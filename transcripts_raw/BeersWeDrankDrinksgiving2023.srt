00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
he uh, he's currently

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,980
Addied out and it's really funny science talk to him because I

45
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:32,040
So I went oh, I'm staying with him. So I went over to his place. He's really been really helpful really nice

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,880
He set me up on an air mattress

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,860
And he's just like I'm just like trying to take a nap because I'm so tired

48
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,720
And he just walks up to me and just has me some chips and doesn't just and goes away and just come tracking

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
and he handed me some candy.

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
I'm like, "Alright man, thank you."

51
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
You handed candy? He's momming you?

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
Is he locked in?

53
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Is he locked in right now?

54
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
He's locked in.

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,720
He's so dialed in, but also he's also still so distracted.

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
So he keeps like going back to work

57
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
and he's like so dialed in and he walks outside

58
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
and he's just talking to me like,

59
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
"Yeah, this actually, I hooked my entire room to like Alexa.

60
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,720
Check this out. Alexa, play some Family Guy."

61
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
And he's like, "Oh yeah."

62
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
And he's like, "Alright man, thanks."

63
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
You saw that when we went to his house

64
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,720
where the pride and joy of his life is that

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:32,740
can

66
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,020
about it for 30 minutes and I was like, Oh, what are you working on right now?

67
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,940
And he was like, well, I'm in a TFT game, but playing TFT for like four hours,

68
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,780

69
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,100

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,540
He said he was going to like do it.

71
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,420
He was going to try to be here, uh, but he couldn't make it and that's his loss.

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,060
So we're doing a little special episode with all the people that we know in New York.

73
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,820

You're sticking to stuff. What do you have on your head?

83
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
A long...

84
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Is this a bandana?

85
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
That is not a bandana, mate.

86
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,300

You may.

112
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,380
Maybe mentally you are much bigger than me,

113
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,220
but in terms of stature, bro,

114
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,580
I basically got a centimeter on you.

115
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,260
Which I don't think is that much, right?

116
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,860
Nope.

117
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,960
No, not a centimeter's not much.

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,300
So how's America, man?

First time in America.

123
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,180
First time in America is you've been on a tour.

124
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,300
You're born overseas already.

125
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,100
You served your entire life and now you're finally here for the first time.

126
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Yeah.

127
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,100
It's crazy.

128
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
And it was worth fighting for, right?

129
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,100
Yeah.

130
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,100
I lost a lot of guys.

131
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
This is what...

132
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Lost a lot of guys.

133
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100

136
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,100
He really loves my guys.

137
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,100
Who's the number one guy that you lost, Matt?

138
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Jamie.

139
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Oh not Jamie, no.

140
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
He was my guy.

141
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
No, not Jamie Foxx.

142
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
The one from Monster Garage.

143
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,100
This is not a funny matter, not Jamie Foxx.

144
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
No, don't laugh about Jamie Foxx.

145
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
He got some bad news today.

146
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Jamie Monday. Who's the one that was married to Sandra Bullock?

147
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Jamie Foxx.

148
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Wait, was it the motorcycle guy?

149
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Yeah, yeah, Jamie Motorcycle.

150
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100

Yeah, he was West Coast Customs or something.

152
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,500
West Coast Customs or something?

153
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,140
Yeah, it was chop or Orange County chopper.

154
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,840
No, he did Monster Garage.

155
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,540
Oh, whatever. He had one of those shops.

156
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,940
Monster Garage.

157
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,380
And he looked, he had like a fucked up-

158
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,540
Someone look it up and tell me the-

Yeah, someone said it in cat.

160
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,640
He looked like he was 60 and he was like 35.

161
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,980
That guy was cool as fuck, man.

162
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,740
Jamie Savage, they're saying.

163
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,520

No, that's a different-

165
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,020
That's the Mythbusters guy.

166
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,280
That's not his name.

167
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,780
That's basically the Mythbusters guy.

168
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,660
Jamie Savage.

169
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,060
What is that?

170
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,320
No, that's a combination.

171
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
Oh, Jamie.

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,300
Jesse James.

173
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,060
Jesse James.

174
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,300
It was not Jamie, okay.

175
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Wait, that's really it?

176
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Yeah, Jesse James is actually Jesse James.

177
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Yeah, his parents named him after the cowboy.

178
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,300
That's badass, dude.

179
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,300
You named him after a cowboy?

180
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Yeah, I'm gonna name my kid Charlie Chaplin or some shit like that.

181
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Yeah, you might heal their mustache.

182
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Just ruin your life just off the bat, dude.

183
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
I mean, that might be the best possible...

184
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,300
That guy's had a hard life. I think he's addicted to drugs.

185
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
But that might be the best...

186
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
Charlie Chaplin?

187
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
No, Jesse James.

188
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,300
That might be the best possible outcome for somebody named Jesse James.

189
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
What's hard about being addicted to drugs? They're fun as hell, man.

190
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,800
Well, because eventually, dude, you gotta get off 'em, man.

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
No, you don't.

192
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Straight up, dude.

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
No, he's rich.

194
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
That's some real shit.

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
He's rich, so he clearly is functioning pretty well.

196
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
You think he's still rich? I'd be pretty surprised, honestly.

197
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I would bet Jesse James is somebody who lost it all.

198
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
I bet he lost it all.

199
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
I kinda wanna try methadone.

200
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,800
[laughter]

201
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
Just jump straight to methadone?

202
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Sorry, I found out that you drink it.

203
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,700
Yeah, it's like a little comes in a little cup.

204
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,300
It comes a little.

205
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,700
Let me try that one time.

206
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Cameron mean camera Olive Garden and he they handed us a pink

207
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,600
lemonade sample and when we walked in really.

208
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Oh, thanks and I chugged mine and he like kept his and brought

209
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
it to the table and then we sat down and he had the pink lemonade

210
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,300
the tiny cup and the waitress came up.

211
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,700
She was like, hi, can I say what the fuck is that?

212
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,400
You can't have that this fucking restaurant and he was like,

213
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,300
you know, lemonade.

214
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,700
She's at all.

215
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:59,700
I

216
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:25,660
the

217
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,900
Not everyone's drinking this we gotta we gotta do the ratings man. You know how the rules

218
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,220
I'm gonna give this a

219
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm gonna give this a five. No, I'm gonna give this a six two and this is a

220
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,980
This is a also a six to basketball player on the basketball player scale

221
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,680
I'll say six seven you get this at six seven six seven just cuz it's a pilsner you gotta give it contact

222
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,020
OK, give me the basketball player, though.

223
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,520
Basketball player?

224
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
It's like Chris Paul.

225
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Shut up.

226
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,320
Oh, Chris Paul, though.

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
Oh, Chris Paul right now.

228
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,480
Chris Paul right now.

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:00,980
OK.

230
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
Six man Chris Paul.

231
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
It's like a guy you want to plug and play any time.

233
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,280
You can put him on any team.

234
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
He's going to make a difference.

235
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,480
A Smirnoff Ice.

236
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,920
He got Ice.

237
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,880
This is not my choice.

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,800
Gale just walked up to me, and he did the stupidest thing

239
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,320
of all time.

240
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,400
He handed me a hat.

241
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,520
I was like, check this out.

242
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,160
Put this on.

243
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,200
And he just pulls this out.

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,060
I'm like, okay, I'm fucking nice to tell you.

245
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,480
So I'm, I'm iced and I'm icing and it's, it's all right.

246
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
That's actually not bad.

247
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,720
You don't hate it. I don't hate it. It kind of tastes like, just like candy, man.

248
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay. Mr. Veteran, what do you give this?

249
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,640
I think I give this like a nine.

250
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,560
Yeah. Never had beer before.

251
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Middle East. I've been kicking bad in the Middle East, man.

252
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Damn.

253
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
And having this, is this American?

254
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I don't know.

255
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
It better be.

256
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
It better be American. I fought for this.

257
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Damn, thank you, dude.

258
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
A lot of boys died for this.

259
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Alright, I might have to bump my score up.

260
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I'll give it a 7 then.

261
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
If I know people died for this shit.

262
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
You've been a little disrespectful.

263
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
It was like a blood diamond.

264
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Dude, I would never disrespect troops in front of you.

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
You already know that shit.

266
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Thank you.

267
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Mike, what are you giving? Oh wait, you have something else.

268
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
I have a White Claw Surge Blackberry.

269
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,640
Barry and I would give this a five out of ten. I think this is this is a six foot

270
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,580
guy who is you see him on the court this is a guy you went to school with you

271
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,760
come back during the summer you're playing pickup ball with him and he's

272
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:40,040
fine. I didn't fight for that. This is disrespect. This is maybe the first ever

273
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:47,640
rating that wasn't even in the league dude. Wow that's really bad.

274
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,140
All right, what do you have?

275
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,640
All right, we got a Sapporo Reserve.

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
It's delicious.

277
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
One of the best beers ever, I'd say.

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
10 out of 10?

279
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
No, not a 10 out of 10.

280
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
No.

281
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
That's reserved for the best.

282
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
This is probably a 7.5 out of 10.

283
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
We do the Portnoy scale here.

284
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
There is no 10.

285
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
This is a Jimmer Ferdet.

286
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
This is better.

287
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
It's from a foreign land or at least performs better in a foreign land.

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I actually agree that Sapporo is a Jimmer Ferdet and here's why.

289
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Before you buy it, it sounds like the best beer ever.

290
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
And then you buy that shit, and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to have to go back and buy

291
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
another one."

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,480
in a foreign land.

293
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
- It actually, I actually agree

294
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,980
that Sapporo is in jibber for that and here's why.

295
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,120
Before you buy it, it sounds like the best beer ever.

296
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,620
And then you buy that shit and it's just okay.

297
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,740
Especially for the price.

298
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,580
- But you get this somewhere overseas,

299
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,820
it's fucking amazing.

300
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,660
- Yeah, yeah, it would blow your mind.

301
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,980
- It's like, wow, this is the best.

302
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,820
- Because it's the only way you can read the label.

303
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,780
- Also, I haven't had Sapporo been sitting in this office

304
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,620
for like two days.

305
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,900
- No, actually I brought that.

306
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
- Yeah, but thank you.

307
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,940
- Oh, yeah.

308
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
You brought it last night and you left it there.

309
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
No, I brought it last night.

310
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,780
I put it in my backpack.

311
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,820
Then I brought it back home, put it back in the fridge.

312
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,020
Then I put it back here.

313
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,540
So it's seen the world is what you're saying.

314
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,140
It's yes.

315
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,620
It's traveled just like Jim or for death.

316
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,140
You did a flat Stanley with the, with the beer, man.

317
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,620
That's a good idea.

318
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,520
We should do a beer that we, everybody lives in different places.

319
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,860
We should hand a, we should do a Bud Light that everybody takes a

320
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,500
photo with in a different car.

321
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,740
And you can do one driving directly into the white house.

322
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,220
That's a great idea.

323
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:27,220
I'm

324
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,720
had something funny to report.

325
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,140
My younger, one of my cousins was bragging to everyone else

326
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,060
that his younger brother was being tested for autism.

327
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,900
- Bragging?

328
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,460
- Yeah, he was like, I'm smart and my younger brother--

329
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,500
- Just go and get them out the hood.

330
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,060
- The autistic ones are really smart.

331
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,420
- This, I don't think he was saying

332
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,780
he was like a smart autistic.

333
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,340
I think he was saying he's like a--

334
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,380
- He was not-- - He's weird and that's why--

335
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,220
- So it was not gonna,

336
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,260
this wasn't a get them out the hood situation

337
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,220
where like he's gonna invent the next Facebook.

338
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
I don't think so.

339
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
No, I don't think so.

340
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,300
I also, I don't think, I think he's a normal kid.

341
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,020
I hate to say it, I think it was kind of a swap.

342
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,980
The younger brother, normal, like a normal kid runs around and screams.

343
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,460
You think they switched the results?

344
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,460
Yeah, yeah.

345
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,580
Younger brother runs around, screams, like pulls dog's tails.

346
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580
Yeah.

347
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Normal, seven year old boy.

348
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
That's what boys should do.

349
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Yeah.

350
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:22,660
The older brother, in his teens, like high achieving student, gets really mad when the

351
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,380
younger brother is getting attention paid to him, like gets into fights with everyone at

352
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,060
the table over how they're resolving disputes.

353
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,260
I think the results were switched.

354
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,660
That'd be kind of a classic little Maury situation.

355
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,260
That'd be a funny way to destroy a family if you're a doctor I guess.

356
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,220
To be clear, I don't think anyone, nobody was diagnosed with autism.

357
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,100
One of the older kids was lying and he was like, "My younger brother might have autism."

358
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Well what happened to me today?

359
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Well I put super glue in my mouth.

360
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Tried to open a bottle of super glue.

361
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
You don't lick your mouth?

362
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
I don't know how to open- people open stuff with their hands.

363
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I don't know how to do that man, it hurts my hand.

364
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Use it over your elbow.

365
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
That's real.

366
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,100
I don't open shit with my- I'm sure this is how they do it over in the other countries.

367
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
I use my teeth dude. God gave me teeth.

368
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm just throwing them on coke bottles one fucking-

369
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
They're not just for eating.

370
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
They're not for eating at all. I barely use them to eat.

371
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,020
I used them to open super glue.

372
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,900
The entire thing exploded in my mouth.

373
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,740
And I was like,

374
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,020
"Well, this is like getting any other thing in your mouth.

375
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,260
Let me go and put cold water on it instantly."

376
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,900
And all of it just hardened.

377
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,460
And I've just had something,

378
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,380
I've had glue stuck between my teeth for four hours.

379
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,220
- It's an L day for Caleb today.

380
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,260
Yes, you're doing L.

381
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,220
- I've taken all Ls.

382
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,340
Guys, here's what happened to me today, man.

383
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:46,340
I woke up and I woke up at 6.30.

384
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,740
I had to go pick him up.

385
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,560
- Do it, Jubio.

386
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I woke up at 630, I had to drive to Newark to pick him up, direct flight from Abu Dhabi.

387
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Abu Dhabi, the war torch machine of Abu Dhabi.

388
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Dude, it's crazy.

389
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,560
It's insane in Abu Dhabi. I think he's in spec ops.

390
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,560
We had to make a lot of signs saying welcome back our hero troops.

391
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Yeah, man, he had to go to that.

392
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
They have a golf tour over there now, right?

393
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,160
right? Yeah. What's it called?

394
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
The L-I-V-E.

395
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Yeah, LIV.

396
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
And they took the PGA.

397
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
They're racking.

398
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,840
They did, but they also still paid everyone like $8 billion.

399
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,240
They paid people. Wait, it got dissolved?

400
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah, they were shamed from buying it.

401
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Oh, they had to. They had to.

402
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,240
So now they're going to start sending the regular PGA guys out into the fucking...

403
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
To Dubai?

404
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
That is so awesome.

405
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Fucking Bubba Watson.

406
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:48,240
And it literally cost... I mean, it's expensive to have a golf course here. It's probably $40

407
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,600
40 times more expensive to have a golf course than to have grass.

408
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,400
Yeah. That's insane. But they, they got their own thing going on.

409
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,000
What was I saying? God. Oh, huh. Oh, my L report.

410
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I woke up. This is, yeah. Had to go to Newark. This is already a huge L.

411
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,040
I drank a cold brew coffee, right? Second L. I pick him up.

412
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,160
We go to where you work. You give me too many drinks, guys.

413
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
way too many drinks. And then he starts driving.

414
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,820
And then I'm really too tired. And then I start driving.

415
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,520
And then I hop behind the wheel. We drive over to Micro Center.

416
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
It's Black Friday. Where's the deals?

417
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,920
Let me get a deal on a brand new gaming mouse, guys.

418
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,120
100% MSRP, G Pro Super Light.

419
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,620
I get forced to purchase by three guys who are with me.

420
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,420
I get completely forced. My hand is forced.

421
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,120
I had no option. It's all right.

422
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,620
Well, is it a good mouse?

423
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
I don't even...

424
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,220
Guys, here's the worst part.

425
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,700
I haven't even opened it. It's been sitting in my car. I might use it after this, but who fucking knows?

426
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,900
Third L. I have to... what was my third L?

427
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,300
I think that's the glue.

428
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,900
Third L? Glue my mouth. Glued my mouth. I got it all over my tongue, both my lips and my teeth.

429
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,860
Fourth L.

430
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,940
Everybody takes a nap except for me, apparently.

431
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,440
Game fuel.

432
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,060
Oh, and I take... I had a game fuel that I got at Micro Center, and I thought, "Guys, that's probably a hundred and sixty milligrams of caffeine.

433
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,580
That's a normal drink."

434
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:20,600
300 milligrams of caffeine. I've had six between the and you gave me cold brew drinks at your

435
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,080
cold brew rum drink. Give me a cold brew rum drink. So now I've had I'm at like 700 milligrams

436
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,080
of caffeine today. And then I went to the gym and I started working out and thought fully

437
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,040
thought I had a stroke while I was doing reverse curls. I was like, this has got to be the

438
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,560
worst way to die ever. I'm not even like doing a deadlift. I'm not even doing something hard.

439
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm doing reverse curls and I got your neck up again. No, man, I mean, I lived. Well, because

440
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I didn't do upright roads.

441
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
That's how I chose life.

442
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
I chose life.

443
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I chose life today.

444
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
I chose life today as I do every day.

445
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,240
Well, we'll see about tomorrow.

446
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,140
But then I didn't get to have dinner before this.

447
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,320
So now I'm a little bit splitting hairs.

448
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Yeah, I'll be honest.

449
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
It doesn't seem that hard.

450
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Julio L report.

451
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
You can't give us 100 L's because then you're just complaining.

452
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,720
So Julio L report.

453
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,400
I literally thought this was like some of my closest friends in the world in one room.

454
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Complaining, complaining, whining, whining.

455
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Okay, I'm taking my shot without anybody.

456
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
All right.

457
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Whoa.

458
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Alright, whoa!

459
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Oh no!

460
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Go, cheers!

461
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Then cheers, man.

462
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Cheers.

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Cheers.

464
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
To Drinksgiving.

465
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Wow.

466
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Drinksgiving.

467
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Drinksgiving.

468
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
This is awful.

469
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,280
That is worse than I remember it being.

470
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
It was actually incredibly smooth and delicious.

471
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,760
Wow, George Dickel White Dog, incredible.

472
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,720
This is, for people who saw it, this is the whiskey that we poured in beef stew a week

473
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,640
ago and ate the beef stew.

474
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
It's worse straight than it is in the beef stew.

475
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I miss the beef stew.

476
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,800
I know it described it as a corn

477
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,640
forward before, and I wish it

478
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,800
tasted more like corn.

479
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,600
I honestly really would have preferred

480
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
that. You like that?

481
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,480
They should sell this bottle for

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
two hundred and fifty dollars.

483
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
Battle hardens.

484
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,400
It reminds me of the Middle East.

485
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
That is true.

486
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,680
That that that that that that

487
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,800
throw burn. Uh-huh.

488
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Mustard gas.

489
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,120
Search a chemical.

490
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,760
Oh, that tastes good, man.

491
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
Mustard gas has been there since

492
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,420
What, 1989? You've been stationed over there?

493
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:15,920
Yep.

494
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,420
It's been a long time.

495
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,220
First time home in, what, 31 years?

496
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Well, I've never been home. I was born there.

497
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
I was born on the base.

498
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,420
He was born by way of expats, and they immediately enlisted him.

499
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,920
Actually, he enlisted himself.

500
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
Himself, at the age of 13, 14?

501
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,920
They put, like, two different things down, like when they teach a dog how to speak English with buttons.

502
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
And he chose to enlist.

503
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
It's just a bunch of guns.

504
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
He just picked one.

505
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
And he just grabbed one, man.

506
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I was grabbing one, and I started shooting.

507
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,920
sure

508
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,440
I think Brigadier General is actually like the second highest thing you can be next to the President, I want to say.

509
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
Yeah, that's not real.

510
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
Well, besides the five-star.

511
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
But second...

512
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Five-star general, but there hasn't been a five-star general since I've been around.

513
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,800
The second thing next to the President is the First Lady, mister. I went to school.

514
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,920
Oh, sorry. Well, there's President, First Lady, Brigadier General.

515
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,680
These days.

516
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,000
And then the guy who services the Brigadier General.

517
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll say it. The First Lady.

518
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,600
Damn, man. We have the gun.

519
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Yeah, he should have the gun.

520
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
He brought his service.

521
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,480
How many people how many people would have to die in the line of

522
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,880
succession for Mike to be elected president?

523
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,960
One.

524
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
I mean, you live in Washington.

525
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,400
I think that you might it might only be like 50,000 people.

526
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,920
It might be that many. Yeah, it might be actually fewer than that.

527
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Fewer than 50. Yeah.

528
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,480
You think before they just start going down a staff list and all the papers

529
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,640
and they go be. Yeah. They'd be looking at responsible young men who own

530
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
property in Washington, D.C.

531
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
Oh, property.

532
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,880
My girlfriend owns the property.

533
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,160
That's actually even cooler.

534
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,480
I'm actually her complete tenant.

535
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
That's amazing.

536
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
You pay rent to your girlfriend?

537
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,920
I pay rent on Venmo every month to my girlfriend.

538
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Yeah.

539
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,040
I am such an alpha.

540
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,280
That's amazing.

541
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
I fought for that.

542
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,560
Who's that report?

543
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,200
Mike's. That's an alpha.

544
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,520
That's a fucking dub, bro.

545
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
None of the liability of owning property.

546
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,520
I didn't take any else today.

547
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,080
I just had a long walk.

548
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,080
You just took an, that was an L.

549
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,680
You took a 30 minute walk.

550
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
40, 40.

551
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,520
People are saying my 40 minute walk from the other end of town to the office was an L.

552
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,120
The other end of town?

553
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,360
I don't think it was an L because I ate a lot yesterday.

554
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
It was Thanksgiving.

555
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
My first Thanksgiving.

556
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
You worked it off, man.

557
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:39,600
I had nothing but heavy plates and then this morning I got poisoned by a secret worker

558
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
at a restaurant.

559
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
You did, dude.

560
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,000
I took a nap and I just walked for minutes over here. It was really cold. So took the cousin walk

561
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I took the cousin

562
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,880
Yeah

563
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,480
It was alright. It was a little cold in my face. So I'm gonna go get a yeet shy see after this

564
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,720
I think we think he would look exact he has the same facial hair

565
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,760
Construction as well. Yes. This is a big problem yesterday. We played secret Hitler

566
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,640
And he literally look at him and tell me that with a face

567
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,520
Well, first of all the face the the hair the mustache the beliefs. This is a ringer for Adolf

568
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,800
It's some Hitler lineage that he literally has to be he went to Mexico. I fled Germany. He did

569
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
That's what they always say

570
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,840
The first game the first game of the night I was actually Hitler

571
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,840
He actually was and Brian just ruined it for the rest of your life. So the rest of the night

572
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
I was just feeling like for you. I did my job something got taken away from me

573
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:57,160
my

574
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:03,640
thought he was Hitler every time. I mean, and he would just be every single game he'd be

575
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,080
like, Oh, I hope the liberals win this time. Like, so kind of weird and coy. It was odd.

576
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,040
And of course he didn't win that much. Yeah. I lost all games. Yeah. Anyways, no else to

577
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,800
report. You know, report. I think I only had one L today, which was, I was pooping in the

578
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,440
airport and then they're, they're almost here to pick me up and they told me it cut it short

579
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
I haven't finished it yet.

580
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
It's so...

581
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay.

582
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Let's don't...

583
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
You left the crust.

584
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
We did say specifically, "Leave the crust."

585
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I...

586
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Yeah.

587
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
You left the...

588
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Still got the crust.

589
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
I did leave the crust.

590
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
That's battle-hardened, dude.

591
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
That's crazy.

592
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
That has nothing to me.

593
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
That's the norm.

594
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Dude, I love that.

595
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,760
I'm pooping, gunshots, I stop it.

596
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Yes, I fight.

597
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
You guys sometimes...

598
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah.

599
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I mean, I guess that might be...

600
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,760
That's the only thing that could interrupt a man taking a shit in the middle of the desert

601
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
is a gunshot whizzing by your head.

602
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
You know that?

603
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
I got a fight right now.

604
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
That's how W's.

605
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
All it takes is a friend.

606
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
All you need is a friend to pick you up.

607
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,760
And then you go, "I'm leaving this crust right now."

608
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
And I bet that was a deep dish.

609
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,760
I bet for real, that was Chicago style.

610
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Popping out of the airport, got the donut.

611
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,760
It took a lot out of me to cut that, to cut it short.

612
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Damn, dude.

613
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
I had to hold the rails and cut that thing short.

614
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,760
You were sitting in the disabled spot?

615
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm a veteran.

616
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Why would I not?

617
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
You're right.

618
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,760
That's a good point.

619
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Yeah, that's a good point.

620
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
Like, there's a couple guys in there.

621
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I can go in there.

622
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
A couple guys in the disabled stall?

623
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
No, no, no.

624
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
There's a couple guys in the other stalls.

625
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
I knew somebody in college, I won't say who it is, but he refused to shit in anything

626
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
but disabled stalls the entire time we were in college.

627
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
And I explained to him at some point that there has to have been at some point somebody in

628
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
a wheelchair sitting outside my house.

629
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
And I was like, "I'm not going to do that."

630
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
And he was like, "I'm not going to do that."

631
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
And I was like, "I'm not going to do that."

632
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
And he was like, "I'm not going to do that."

633
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,760
I won't say who it is, but he refused to shit in anything but disabled stalls the entire time we were in college.

634
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:53,760
And I explained to him at some point that there has to have been at some point somebody in a wheelchair sitting outside of the stall.

635
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,760
And then the guy walks out, well it's Joe Gleason, Joe walks out.

636
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Joe walks out, and they're like, "What's this guy?"

637
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
There's a guy in a wheelchair?

638
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Yeah, this guy has to be...

639
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
Joe is tall though.

640
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Well, that is some kind of disability, I think. At least on an airplane.

641
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:26,760
and

642
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:49,720
of

643
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,560
I was once on a flight to Russia.

644
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,320
I was upgraded to something called Imperial Class.

645
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,820
Whoa!

646
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,320
Which was those things-

647
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
That sounds better than First Class.

648
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,820
Where they have-

649
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,560
It was way better.

650
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,460
It was where they have those pods for you.

651
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
The stuff you only see in promotional videos

652
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,700
for like Air Emirates.

653
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,200
Oh my God.

654
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,300
Where it's you each-

655
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,900
Like five people in the front get their own pods.

656
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,640
And they have like a meal.

657
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,840
And it was just completely empty and they gave it to us.

658
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,080
Did you get a steak or some home treats?

659
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,980
I remember getting-

660
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,540
They served food on like really fancy china.

661
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,440
None of the fake like recycled cardboard shit.

662
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,480
like they gave us plates, real plates.

663
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,080
It was fire.

664
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,880
And I ate the plate.

665
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
I want to, did you ransack the mini bar?

666
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,520
Oh, you know, I did.

667
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, I was, I was what, 13 and you know, I was fucking on the stewardess.

668
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,400
Way.

669
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,520
Mike, can you stand up real quick?

670
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,400
Can you raise your hand real quick?

671
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,240
Just so people can tell, can tell how tall you are.

672
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,560
Stand up.

673
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,080
Oh yeah.

674
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,680
And then Alex.

675
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,640
I know it looks.

676
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,920
Alex, no one and Mike stand up.

677
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,280
No, sit back down.

678
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,600
So you're.

679
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,240
Should I stand up?

680
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,520
Yeah.

681
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,040
Stand up.

682
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,880
Whoa.

683
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,880
*laughing*

684
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,880
*more laughing*

685
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
That's crazy man.

686
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
He's like a little boy.

687
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
You guys should do Robin Big, remember that show?

688
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
I am not a little boy.

689
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,880
We were talking about the movie Brothers before,

690
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
but the one about

691
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito,

692
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
we gotta do that. I'll be Arnold Schwarzenegger.

693
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Wait, don't! Stop sticking with DeVito, man!

694
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
That's crazy man.

695
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,880
That's racist!

696
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,880
You wouldn't last a second in the war.

697
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:28,320
the

698
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:40,780
the

699
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,780
drunk guy that fell asleep at my bar today.

700
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,060
(laughs)

701
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,900
And then--

702
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,740
- I was close.

703
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,560
- Yeah, you were close.

704
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,400
- I was close.

705
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,540
- And then he wouldn't leave with his girlfriend

706
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,700
and she was like begging him, like,

707
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,340
"Please, let's go home, let's go home."

708
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,660
And he was like, "No, fuck you."

709
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,140
And then he went to sleep.

710
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,500
Not that type of bar, by the way.

711
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,340
It's kind of fancy.

712
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,780
- You have an insane rate of crazy people

713
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,620
coming to that restaurant for a place

714
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,980
that really shouldn't have that.

715
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,780
- I took Big W, Big W, fake keys with the low cut.

716
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,780
That's your momma.

717
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
Alright, on to the next one.

718
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,780
I will say, double your report, every time I burp into the mic, it kills Brian.

719
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
The stink of it?

720
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
He loves it. Just the sound.

721
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,780
He really goes crazy.

722
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,780
He can't, look at him.

723
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
That's funny dude.

724
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
That's a dub.

725
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
Huge L, technically today.

726
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Usually I know when I'm at home with my dad, to like not engage in argument.

727
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,980
says something to just be like, yeah, I do believe like Israel's controlled by lizard,

728
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,980
etc, etc.

729
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,420
For some reason, I got into an argument with him last night.

730
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,900
And that was a profound I couldn't tell you what the argument was about.

731
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,980
He kept changing stuff.

732
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,980
I think he's been watching like Ben Shapiro videos because he keeps trying to own me in

733
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
conversations.

734
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm so amazed when old people know about like Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder.

735
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:18,120
He sent me a text the other day and he was like, "Look at this Candace Owens video.

736
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,920
I think she makes some seriously good points.

737
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Have you heard of her?"

738
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,920
I was like, "Not responding."

739
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
I really did.

740
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,900
I accidentally killed my dad.

741
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:33,240
But there was one thing that really stuck with me, which cannot possibly be true, but

742
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,320
But it's like rattling around in my head.

743
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,500
He was like, I actually told Vladimir Putin how to keep the Belarusian president in charge

744
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
of the country.

745
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,200
And they followed my plan point by point.

746
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,200
He's still there.

747
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,200
I was like, no, not at all.

748
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
I think that maybe he's in a meeting.

749
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,560
And he brought it up and he was bragging about it to me.

750
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,520
And I was like, I could not, there was no, there's no way to engage with him.

751
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Yeah.

752
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
There's like no response.

753
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,680
We have a panel of really knowledgeable guys right here.

754
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,240
Why don't you go step by step what the plan is.

755
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,740
He didn't tell me the plan. He was just like, yeah, I emailed them and yeah, they followed my plan point by point.

756
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Wow.

757
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,240
I was like, dad, there's no way.

758
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,240
I didn't impress him on it though. I mean, it's probably true.

759
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:20,740
Last time I saw my grandpa, I went to Jersey because he wouldn't come to New York because he said it's a sanctuary city.

760
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:27,240
And literally before I even hugged him, hello, I went to go get lunch with him in Jersey at a diner.

761
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,820
I like walked in and from across the diner he was like, "Do you have any Muslims in your

762
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,820
neighborhood?"

763
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
I was like, "Yeah."

764
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,060
And he's like, "Oh, we made a good choice coming to Jersey."

765
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,220
I was like, "Jesus Christ, man."

766
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
He's just so loud.

767
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,400
Then he tip $5, $100 bill.

768
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,880
The thing that started the argument was my dad was like, "I bet the newspaper doesn't

769
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,020
put in why Hamas attacked Israel."

770
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,700
I was like, "Yeah, we do.

771
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,860
Yeah, we did."

772
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,420
And he just did not believe me.

773
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
Yeah.

774
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Did not believe me.

775
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:14,860
that

776
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,300
raw eggs. Like every morning he eats raw eggs. No, not every morning, just most mornings.

777
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,620
Most mornings he eats raw eggs, man. Rocky vibes, man. It is fully rocky vibes. It is

778
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,100
rocky vibes. I'm basically training to beat up any guy that looks like Apollo Green that

779
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:37,180
I see. I'm just gonna, you know, go full force and they'll understand. You should enlist.

780
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:43,940
You need to enlist. You do feel like a guy who lost out on enlisting a little bit. I've

781
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
definitely thought about it.

782
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Mostly like the Coast Guard.

783
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,240
Wait, you look like the kid who says he's a future Marine.

784
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:51,940
No, I don't.

785
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,540
You do.

786
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:52,940
No.

787
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,740
You do.

788
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,440
Wait, that is a child.

789
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,640
I am a grown man.

790
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,940
You have a grown up version of him.

791
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,040
No.

792
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
Wait, look at the camera.

793
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,540
That's a black guy.

794
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,040
Vans?

795
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
That guy has a--

796
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,840
No, it's a little white boy.

797
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,040
It's a little white boy, yeah.

798
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,740
Chat is saying he does.

799
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,840
People are saying he does.

800
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,040
No, no, actually not.

801
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,340
They're not saying that.

802
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,440
No one's ever said that.

803
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:13,940
God.

804
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,040
Yeah. And then I, um, I got up at 5 30, uh, took my two raw eggs,

805
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,960
uh, which are delicious.

806
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,600
I took them.

807
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Uh, and then, uh, I had to get, um, driven to the airport to go pick up our,

808
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,000
our glorious veteran, which I mean, also is miserable.

809
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,840
Uh, Julio made me sit in the backseat, even though I called shotgun,

810
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,640
clearly not, you know, the same with the American rules are about you should

811
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:56,640
the

812
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,740
We'll just drop it on my stuff wait and oh you're keeping yourself in my place

813
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:05,280
Last point

814
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,640
We we took we took turns going shotgun. We did not take turns. I had to run and

815
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,120
Yeah, no then he called me a bitch

816
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,360
And then yeah, I had to hang out with these fucking guys all day which you know

817
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,200
Yeah, obvious W, but only half the the W

818
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,440
We know it was awesome

819
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,400
Thank you. I need to see the picture of him

820
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,320
In front of the skyline

821
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,440
Yeah, we just took a bunch of him first time in the city maybe back or not back

822
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,220
It was yeah, it was awesome Caleb took me to a children's park that was cool I took it

823
00:33:52,220 --> 00:34:21,220
I

824
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
last time right?

825
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
He did.

826
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Yeah, yeah.

827
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,700
He did that by blurting.

828
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:32,020
Unlike the Brian incident where he just showed his address a couple times on stream.

829
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,020
And he doesn't like to be heard.

830
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,020
And besides that, didn't you show them your card info too?

831
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,020
No, I didn't show them my card info.

832
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,060
Just the last four digits in the security code.

833
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,660
Not the security code.

834
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
Not that important.

835
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,900
Don't, if you look this up, I swear to God, I'm going to get my special forces SEAL team

836
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,100
nine guy.

837
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
He's going to come and kill you.

838
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:58,380
kill anybody for no reason. He's out of his mind. So now that you're here man, are you

839
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,620
going to get like a security job, a bouncer? You'd make a great bouncer I think. If I pulled

840
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,980
up at the club and I saw you dressed like this, I might just leave man. I'm gonna be

841
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,780
straight up. I might not even hand you an ID. I don't know what I want to be. I might be

842
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:32,660
the

843
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:40,140
out and go crazy taxi. Yeah. I think, um, I think we might send you back pretty soon.

844
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:49,140
We got a new mission for you, boss. They might recall me back. Yeah. Did you get discharged

845
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,060
or did you just, you served your, your years? I served my years. I said I needed some, a

846
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,660
little bit of time. Were you guys ever close to joining the military? I was pretty close.

847
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,620
You were definitely close, man.

848
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,820
He did, wait, he did, you know what he did, man?

849
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,180
He did a child Air Force training.

850
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,220
I did more than that, though, dude.

851
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,380
Tony Cowden, are you kidding me?

852
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,420
Oh, yeah, he also did CrossFit.

853
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,060
No, no, I mean, I did CrossFit for like six months

854
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,100
and then I moved on 'cause I,

855
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,940
'cause she's gay?

856
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,340
There's this guy in our hometown,

857
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,420
this guy Tony Cowden.

858
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,180
Well, there's a couple guys in our hometown

859
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,580
because we're-- Tony Cowden is the beast.

860
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,620
We're like an hour from Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune,

861
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:42,620
so

862
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:51,020
Every story I've heard about this guy is definitely a lie.

863
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
That I've told you?

864
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
No, it's all true.

865
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:03,020
You said that he was a guy, he dealt drugs in high school and then tell the story.

866
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
Confirmed by his sister.

867
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Yeah, confirmed by his sister man.

868
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:14,060
Yeah, he was selling coke in high school and then got caught and because his dad was like friends with the sheriff's department

869
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,740
He got off and then he went to like the State University and then was selling more coke

870
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,980
DEA agent came up to him in the grocery store and told him like yeah, we're gonna pop you were on a

871
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:31,740
Task force do that. I don't know. I don't know but it dude Tony is not a liar. He is a

872
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,900

No, this is real this is real this is real real real I've seen pictures of the Mercedes I've met

883
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,340
I've met multiple guys who have said

884
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,100
It was armored Mercedes and he's the only one that survived

885

886
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,060
Tony lies about like almost everything that's real. That's real. It was a pimped-out

887
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:52,520
Mercedes and it had a PlayStation and I mean so you look no this shit is real. No, that shit is that's

888
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,700
Well, how wild city could you start from the CIA?

889
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Because he's crazy

890
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,740
Or because he heard his foot. He was the most decorated

891
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,180
Like a ranger at the time before he joined the CIA

892
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,140
Where's Chad at? Where's Chad at? I need Chad to back me up.

893
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,500
It's confirmed.

894
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,940
I need Chad to back me up here.

895
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,500
Dude, he literally was... Iron Man was on the TV behind you as he told you this story.

896
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,620
I was like, "Yeah, dude, I came up with something called an arc reactor."

897
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,940
And then Jeff Bridges came up with one too, and we had a complete battle on top of a building.

898
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:50,380
Nah, nah. I will always... The thing is, Tony is such a scary guy that when he tells you a story,

899
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,820
you have to believe it because he can smell when you think you're lying.

900
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,320
and he...

901
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,820
Tony Stark?

902
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,220
Yeah, Tony Stark.

903
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,720
Yeah.

904
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,220
[laughter]

905
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,020
And my name was Tony, it's not his name.

906
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,520
[laughter]

907
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,020
His name's Daryl.

908
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,020
Yeah.

909
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,520
But yeah, he ran for, uh...

910
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Yeah, he ran for...

911
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,020
Yeah, he ran for...

912
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
No, he ran for, like, actual...

913
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,520
Oh, for Congress.

914
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,020
Congress.

915
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,520
For a House of Representatives.

916
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,520
He ran for the House of Representatives.

917
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Uh, he has, uh, an insane TBI from the, um, the blast that blew up that Mercedes.

918
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,020
Insane TBI, he's nuts.

919
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,520
Yeah, I completely believe it.

920
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,020
He's completely insane.

921
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,520
And, uh, he didn't come...

922
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
He didn't come from a softball tournament.

923
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,520
He didn't come anywhere close to winning at all.

924
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,520
No, but he had a fire website where you could win an AR-15.

925
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,520
Actually?

926
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
Yeah.

927
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Why didn't we enter?

928
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Chad did enter.

929
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
He donated $5.

930
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
And he entered.

931
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
So we could give away?

932
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Yeah, it was like if you donate $5 to the campaign, you could win an AR-15.

933
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,520
Being around Tony and his like, I don't know, there's like probably 20 or 30 Special Forces guys

934
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
that are like, you should join up.

935
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,160
So you never even, how close did you get?

936
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,920
Um, I was like, oh I'm strong enough and if they train me I could probably make it.

937
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
But then I realized like you gotta, yeah dude I was built.

938
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
He says you're not strong enough.

939
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,520
Yeah dude I was strong enough and they were like, yeah you could do it.

940
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,720
And as soon as I thought about like, oh I'll have to like kill people if I do this.

941
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
That's the best part of the job.

942
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
I didn't want to do it anymore.

943
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,720
Yeah, ask him man.

944
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
Yeah, it's not me.

945
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
It's like 80% of the boys.

946
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Not for me dude, I'm a baby.

947
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
Yeah, yeah, shoot some guns.

948
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
No, no.

949
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,720
You don't want to kill?

950
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,720
You don't wanna kill?

951
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Kill some bad guys?

952
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Osama?

953
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
I'll put that bullet in.

954
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
I wanna nurture life.

955
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,720
That was you, man?

956
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,720
He was the one who went through his hard drive and found all that answer.

957
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I love beauty, man.

958
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Do you love beauty?

959
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Excuse me.

960
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
He's beautiful?

961
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
He is beautiful, man.

962
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
I would lay with him.

963
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,720
You would lay with him?

964
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Yeah.

965
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
He's still alive today.

966
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
That's pause.

967
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Is there a bra button?

968
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Yeah, wait, hold on.

969
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
Is there a bra button?

970
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
It's probably one of the top ones.

971
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Yeah.

972
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
I would be his concubine.

973
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,920
I'll put this wig on and I would dance

974
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,400
Say you'd lay with him again. I would lay with Osama bin Laden

975
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,560
Would you have sex with the crickets man?

976
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm just trying to clarify for the yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm I might kill you too

977
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,920
Have you seen everyone saying he's fire recently everyone's like

978
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,080
Yeah, people were saying that people were saying Osama bin Laden is they're like fire people take the word like wait

979
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
He actually kind of had a point. That's what I'm saying

980
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:30,880
Everyone I think they're always suck. They're stupid as fuck. They don't they don't realize he ran two planes into the Twin Towers

981
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,360
He did first. I'm here. Boom this

982
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,680
Wait, what he did this when did he do it?

983
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,240
Years back. I really want to make one of those videos. It's like, you know, they always do like like

984
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,040
This true crime videos, it's like when to high school kids shot up the high school

985
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:54,720
They're high school in Columbine. I do I want to make one that's like like that that crazy time when two planes

986
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,800
I

987
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,300
Think that'd be good. I've been watching a lot of those videos watch a video yesterday. I was making an unsolved mystery. Yeah

988
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,320
Nobody knows who did it. This is the craziest thing ever. I made a video or no. I watched a video

989
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,160
Yesterday that was a kid who killed his own mom guys

990
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,200
Killed a this video. I made this video

991
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:17,600
No

992
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:24,080
It's one of these like ripoffs of the JCS criminal psychology videos the ones that you fall asleep to and he made

993
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,880
That's normal. I think that's normal that didn't weird

994
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,320
I am I feel like I'm free to fold to blow your spot up. Yeah. No, you're not free to do anything

995
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,580
Nice last night we're hanging out a branch apartment

996
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:50,900
It was me cam and Pat and Brian because he lives there and we were honest

It was logged into his account

999
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,000

00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:27,940
It might be a glitch then we keep scrolling down then at the the grid of like four five videos

1009
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,040
Watching that all day it makes it explains a lot about you

1010
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,480
You fall asleep to scary stories every single night. Yeah, I like you wake up terrified. I wear my eggs

1011
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,680
It's a normal thing.

1012
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,800
It's actually cool.

1013
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,600
And you should kill yourself.

1014
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,240
I watched a FNAF video about the entire Laura FNAF.

1015
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,840
Any of you follow up to that one?

1016
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
What?

1017
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
The entire Laura FNAF.

1018
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Have you ever watched that one?

1019
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Five Nights at Freddy's.

1020
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Oh, FNAF.

1021
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Yeah.

00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
Me and Noah know.

1024
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,840
No, that's not.

1025
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
I'd be harmonized on that shit.

1026
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I'd be very happy.

1027
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840

1028
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,840
No, actually I wouldn't because that's not scary and that is my dream.

1029
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,840
You're not scared of Five Nights at Freddy's?

1030
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
Actually...

1031
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
What the hell's wrong with you?

I'm not gonna lie.

1035
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,840
I went to the theater to watch the movie and it was an L.

00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,840
It's an L.

1040
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I was trying to get me, Pat, and Cam to go to the premiere and take a bunch of...

1041
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Just like jump over the rope and take a bunch of pictures of us on the red carpet at their Five Nights at Freddy's premiere.

1042
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:05,360
the

1043
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:12,880
all over their bodies? Hair? Hair. Yeah, so it wouldn't be maybe the least person to be a doll.

1044
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,400
And by the way, it's not a doll, it's an animatronic. So you're wrong on two counts.

1045
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,760
Hannah's dad was in town and I dropped her off to see a movie with him. And there was like a

1046
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,600
billion people at the theater. Don't watch my dad. And she was like, there's nothing in the theater,

1047
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,640
but Five Nights at Freddy's and this Meg Ryan comedy. And when we, and she was like, there's

1048
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:49,640
is

1049
00:46:49,640 --> 00:47:13,120
it was

1050
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:25,120
I

1051
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,440
in his movies when people die so like if they could just do a super cut of

1052
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,600
yeah I would watch that yeah I would watch that but that's it

1053
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,960
Mike shooting you in the head man. This is the craziest game of Russian roulette I've ever seen.

1054
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,720
Did you like the flower moon movie? Yeah I thought it was really great like I was very

1055
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,680
touched by the ending. That's amazing. Have you seen it? I've not seen it. The end for whoever

1056
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,320
seen it the ending is very touching it's very moving. Genuinely the last like minute of the

1057
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,440
movie is very moving. I'm not gonna lie I think you're the only person that's

1058
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,880
watched this movie here. I will say that's the way I feel about Heat and Heat is the

1059
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,040
longest movie of all time and the last minute makes me cry every time. I did I

1060
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,120
saw, he's a liar, I did see Heat with Noah maybe two weeks ago. He did not cry.

1061
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,880
Well I didn't cry because people were being rude in the theater. The next day I

1062
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,400
I cried in the walk-in at work thinking about

1063
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:30,840
I'm so serious. No my my co-worker put the ending Moby song on and I had to go into the walk-in

1064
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,120
No, I didn't I did not ask him

1065
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,880
Damn good guess

1066
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,440
Nice

1067
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,880
That was well done Mike. How did you know where that was?

1068
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,640
Way he's going again. Wait, hold on

1069
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,560
Hitler was back

1070
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:58,900
Thank God he really that was a serious roulette you just played man in a major way

1071
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,280
Yeah, I'm trying to think of lies a good movie. I seen that I haven't seen any good movies in a couple you're honored

1072
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,520
Good they don't exist anymore man damn. That's a really

1073
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:15,840
In the theater or just in general in general brother and watch a good movie. You have mascara on your nose. It was killing me

1074
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:23,080
Mascara yeah, let's see what is it gone. Yep. No, it's gone. Okay, my hate your vape. Yeah, it might be volcanic

1075
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
So here you go. Just trust it on that

1076
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:30,520
Part salt. Yeah, no, it told us that he has a salt that smells and tastes exactly like a fart

1077
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,160
No, it doesn't taste like a fart, but it's when you open the bag up. It makes the whole room smell like fart

1078
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,520
I don't understand how you can smell like a fart black salt black salt. No, can you explain the racist?

1079
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,120
Can you explain the porno drink that you made us? Oh, yeah

1080
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,260
At a at 9 a.m. I made Alex and Julio drink a porn star martini

1081
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:56,400
But you don't know what that is. It's the most like consumed cocktail in the entire world

1082
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,520
It's a British then it's a very British

1083
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,200
We walk into this restaurant, you know, they they order a bloody mary. They're twinning

1084
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,420
So me and I were like, oh we should twin some mimosas and I gave them a tiki cold brew rum drink and I go

1085
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,160
Oh, yeah, can we get some of Moses? You're like, I'm gonna make you a porn drink. I was like, all right

1086
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,120
No, you guys asked for passion fruit. We said can we get action on the menu man? Oh

1087
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,680
You guys just said passion fruit

1088
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:31,000
Passion fruit. Oh, we're the were the martinis good. Yeah, they were fine. Yeah

1089
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,540
I will I will say the passion fruit mimosa is made the porn star martini is much better

1090
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:43,140
Yeah, so and I don't know who kind of looks like a porn star over there

1091
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,480
I can see you having a big one and being

1092
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:52,140
Jeremy but can I raise you?

1093
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,760

1094
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,760
Way Juvia, what's your opener?

00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,880
And then you say let me see your thing in your normal voice. Yeah, and then what do you say?

1098
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,880
You have to go one lower because you started high

1099
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,640
please

1100
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,720
that's

1101
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,960
What are you gonna do the rest of the time you guys are here man, dude everything

1102
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:38,200
Everything fellas come meet us at we're doing a beers. We drink meetup at Brooklyn, New York

1103
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,080
Yeah, and Bushwick in 30 minutes. All right, y'all

1104
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,320
Troutman on Chapman's on Troutman Street. Yeah

1105
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,480
Yeah, buys a drink you can hear there. We don't we won't care. We will kill you with the gun though

1106
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,220
I'm thinking bring that we had we had a we had like a

1107
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:01,820
Airsoft Glock that I can't believe they sold in a store. That was like it looked exactly like a glass

1108
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,680
Oh, yeah, they sold it. They had to go to Connecticut to buy it. Oh

1109
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:13,380
I thought you meant like this it's gone. No, no, no, we threw it away because it got my best friend

1110
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,840
Growing up got a charge for for having a fake in his is like full metal airsoft

1111
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,460
Putting it in boiling water and taking the orange tip off. That's I think exactly what they did on someone in traffic

1112
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,460
That's crazy

1113
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,900
Probably deserved it. He wouldn't have gotten the ticket though. If you got all I got was a ticket

1114
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,760
He got arrested he wouldn't have gotten arrested though if he hadn't immediately

1115
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:48,740
After pulling the gun on somebody pulled into the parking lot of a discount tire because he couldn't find the extendo clip

1116
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
*laughter*

1117
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,740
He was like, "what?"

1118
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,740
He's like searching around the back of his car, pulling through a discount tire,

1119
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,740
and then immediately like, cops all over him like,

1120
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,740
"Put your fucking gun on the ground! Put the fucking gun on the ground!"

1121
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,740
Jesus Christ dude, I couldn't believe that they sold this shit.

1122
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,740
They did nine months in uh...

1123
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,740
What, eight months for an airsoft gun?

1124
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,740
Yeah, well the judge was even like,

1125
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,740
"This is fucking weird."

1126
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,740
Well, I don't know.

1127
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,740
Uh...

1128
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,740
Yeah, that's what the judge...

1129
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:40,740
*arguing*

1130
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:46,740
Damn, that might be the craziest possible state to be waving a fake Glock at somebody in traffic.

1131
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,740
Which you could easily die for that.

1132
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,740
Well also he could have just bought a real gun.

1133
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,740
Yeah, exactly.

1134
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,740
They're probably the same price almost.

1135
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,740
Or you're doing a fake one, yeah.

1136
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,740
Yeah.

1137
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,740
Yeah, it was a nice hair show.

1138
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
Yeah, get a...

1139
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,740
Yeah, he did like nine months in like a county jail for that.

1140
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
Jesus Christ.

1141
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,740
Get a high tech, bro.

1142
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,740
150 bucks.

1143
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,740
Yeah.

1144
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,740
And well, it'll break the first time that you pull it out at anything.

1145
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,740
Yeah, but if you're just showing it off...

1146
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,740
Wait, wait, wait.

1147
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,800
That's shade man high techs high tech

1148
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,720
$150 gun are you kidding me? No, it doesn't shoot bullets man

1149
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,900
Fine with me man

1150
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,980
Enough to kill myself

1151
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:29,620
They make a gun called a yeet can and on the side. It says a yeet cannon. That's we're gonna get it

1152
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,620
I need to have some kind of gun. I wanted to get it since we have an office

1153
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:38,320
I wanted to get a gun and you can leave you have a guy who can conceal

1154
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,960
But you have to transport $5,000 in cash every single month.

1155
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,720
So I would have to take out $5,000 from our business account,

1156
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,320
bring it here and then bring it back to the bank once a month.

1157
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,120
That's worth it.

1158
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,920
Is it worth it?

1159
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,240
Yeah.

1160
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,840
I mean, you only have to do it like once.

1161
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,560
What the hell am I doing?

1162
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,280
Of course I'm going to do it.

1163
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,920
And then you get the license.

1164
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,000
We're getting so much mileage out of this prop.

1165
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,360
Imagine if you had like an AR-15 or a real gun.

1166
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,240
Wait, how does that work?

1167
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,680
Yeah, and we all just do it.

1168
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,200
I mean, sorry, the real gun.

1169
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,480
You have to have a reason, I guess, to transport money.

1170
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,080
I guess they're not going to send somebody to escort you.

1171
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,580
You have to be a handgun licensee, you have to be like ex-law enforcement.

1172
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,880
Or exactly, you have to transport large amounts of cash.

1173
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,380
Yeah.

1174
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,880
Which is bullshit.

1175
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,580
Spin the bottle.

1176
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,420
I don't know what podcast about this.

1177
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,960
Don't worry, it's in the Supreme Court right now.

1178
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,380
It's going to get struck down and we're all going to be carrying this time next year.

1179
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,100
I guess I'm going to stick with my Supreme Court.

1180
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,600
New York City's like unconstitutional...

1181
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,220
Facts.

1182
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,980
...can still carry laws.

1183
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,480
Really?

1184
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,940
Yeah, it's in the Supreme Court right now.

1185
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,640
They're reviewing it the New York Supreme Court is a big one the big one way and the Californian ones

1186
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,220
The LA County ones and

1187
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,460
The New York City ones

1188
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,900
That's right

1189
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,300
We're gonna be open carrying 1911s. I am wait man in the bodega, bro

1190
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,460
Yes, sir miss

1191
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,940
people walking around with guns all the time a really I saw some I saw a security guard at Walgreens who had a gun and

1192
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:25,420
a

1193
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,220
who would come in and he would steal COVID tests every single day.

1194
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,780
And then they started having security guard with a gun.

1195
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,100
Those are, they give those out for free.

1196
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,500
That's what I was like, what the hell is he?

1197
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,340
But he would like come in and he was just like a homeless guy.

1198
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,940
And he sits inside of the bank all the time.

1199
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,340
Was he selling them?

1200
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,220
I have no idea.

1201
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,060
I mean, maybe I would, I would think so.

1202
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,940
It'd be crazy to take that many.

1203
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,660
And then yeah, not sell them.

1204
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,100
Yeah.

1205
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:47,940
He's doing one a day.

1206
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,620
He would just.

1207
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,940
He's never seen a gun before.

1208
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,220
He's.

1209
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:53,900
No, he's never seen a fake gun before.

1210
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:07,420
is

1211
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:19,900
is

1212
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:39,700
of

1213
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,700
technically ambiguous for show.

1214
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:50,460
You're from Kashmir. I mean, we literally say you're mixed and I believe you Hitler and anything is what you are. I mean, the swastika was an Indian symbol.

1215
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,140
Exactly.

1216
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,420
Let me have a gun.

1217
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,220
And the DMV. Come on, just let me

1218
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,780
it's crazy that Julio actually works for the cartel. That's not true.

1219
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:04,420
He works for the cartel and any CBP officers are watching he works for

1220
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,300
all of their videos.

1221
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,900
I forgot, CBP don't fuck with me no more.

1222
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,400
They stopped fucking with you.

1223
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,200
Dude, two years ago, I got into the airport so early in the morning that they were like,

1224
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,700
"You know what? You seem chill. Just go through. We won't even look at your passport. You're that chill."

1225
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,700
I'm like, "Oh, thank you, man."

1226
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,700
And I dapped him up and I just went on my way. I don't remember where I was going.

1227
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,200
I test him around. I land at 5am, a little early.

1228
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,700
So I'm a little worried.

1229
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,700
But I think like, "Oh, you know what? It's so early. It's so early. They're gonna be like,

1230
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,700
'Oh my god, it's you from the other day. I'm gonna... I fucked with you.'"

1231
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:45,060
I fuck with you, just get in, I won't even look at you.

1232
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:49,780
But I just get the most inquisitive, sleepy officer of all time.

1233
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,780
She looks at my passport once and she's like, wait a minute, you're not from this country.

1234
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,780
I'm like, yep.

1235
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,500
You're the guy at Beer's Wee Dre.

1236
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,700
She, yeah, they're not fans anymore, I don't think.

1237
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,140
I think they unsubscribed from the Patreon.

1238
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,140
They used to rock with us.

1239
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,140
Yeah, they used to rock with us.

1240
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,140
They no longer.

1241
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,140
What happened?

1242
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,140
What changed?

1243
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,580
I think too much wokeism by the other hosts.

1244
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:26,380
So they, she's looking at my passport, she sees that I have 1,000 trillion million dollars, and also I have two, what are they called, the seals, whatever, the stamps, right?

1245
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:36,980
I forgot the word. And she's like, "What do you do for a job?" And I go like, "Twitch streaming?" And she's like, "Nah, L, that's an L response, dog."

1246
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:42,860
And then she goes like oh, then she's like asking me about like all these questions. I like my life and everything

1247
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:51,040
She gets really interesting about this one really weird trip that I took in 2018 where I spent just to one day in the country

1248
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,480
It's like what do you spend just a one day in the country? I was like what yeah this in 2018

1249
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,200
It says you were in the country for four hours. I was like oh for a layover. I need a one day in the country

1250
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,820
For a layover is like oh, that's weird

1251
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,520
Where were you going? I was like somewhere else. All right

1252
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,780
so

1253
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,320
Sir, uh, they they're like, you know what we set up not far. We go into the little room

1254
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,420
They sent me to a little room where I just sit there for like half an hour cavity search

1255
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:23,180
They asked me this the same thing. I thought I was gonna get there. He didn't get there

1256
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:28,980
Oh a cop just like just asking like what do you do for work? Where do you live? What do you live with?

1257
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,220
What do they do for work? Do they have like any fly benefits? I'm like, no

1258
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,620
I pay for this with my drug money.

1259
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:42,520
I mean, so I just they just made me wait and in the time I waited

1260
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,420
there for like half an hour.

1261
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,420
I think it was the first person that got sent there for the next

1262
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,120
30 minutes.

1263
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,920
They only send Chinese people.

1264
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,620
So I think they thought I was from Hong Kong.

1265
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,620
Straight up.

1266
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:57,020
Chubio is a member of the Sinaloa cartel.

1267
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:01,120
He is trafficking precursor chemicals into the United States

1268
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:25,840
for

1269
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:33,040
He was talking about the Sinaloa Cartel, Jubio is smuggling precursor chemicals, Twitch, Plagas

1270
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Terrorism.

1271
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,760
It's all, that is so funny to pull a "Does your mom know you're gay?"

1272
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,760
Yeah.

1273
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
As a TSA agent.

1274
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,760
And I was like, "Who's they?"

1275
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,760
And she's just like, acting like she didn't ask me that.

1276
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
She's like, "What are you doing in the city?

1277
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
Oh, are you friends with someone?

1278
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,760
Oh, that's cool.

1279
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,760
Are you doing anything for Thanksgiving?"

1280
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,760
I was like, "Yeah, I guess."

1281
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,760
She looks at my back, she says that I'm just a nerd.

1282
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,760
And she's like, "You know what?

1283
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,760
Just get out of here."

1284
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,840
Some use you didn't you fuck up your address?

1285
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,680

I mean I gave him I had given them breakfast address beforehand like on the contact contact form

1287
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,560
