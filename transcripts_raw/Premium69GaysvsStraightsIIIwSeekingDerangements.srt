[INTERPOSING VOICES]

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,120
Now is how we're starting.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
Now is how we're starting.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,640
OK, Jai.

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,040
I know now you're recording now.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
--you were talking about.

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,200
Hi, welcome to podcast about lust and seeking something.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,240
I don't know.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,040
OK, I'm going to tell you right now, Jaak,

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,520
we have guests, please remember the mic goes next to your mouth.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,940
Since you destroyed the mic stand you built last episode.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,320
We should give Jacques like a dog cone around their lips that they like

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,820
have to keep the microphone.

19
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,180
Yeah, I put like a laugh mic on there.

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,020
Yeah, that'd be pretty smart.

21
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,520
Yeah, we're doing doing Gaze versus Straights Volume three.

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,240
I'm pretty focused today.

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm going to keep this on top.

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,240
I'm going to keep this sucker right next to my mouth.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,540
I think he's turning the mic right now.

26
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,540
Yeah, this is gays versus straights.

27
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,860
I have to bring my guitar back out.

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,580
No, no, no. You don't use that yet.

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
That's our secret weapon.

30
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,940
That is our fucking WMD, dude.

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,940
Don't fucking take that out. Don't you dare.

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,540
They're going to leave immediately.

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,180
I don't want to win.

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,740
I want to have a fair fight until the shock and jock can bring out his DJ.

35
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,060
We would destroy your ass and I will.

36
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,380
I will leave right now.

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,940
We would be you guys.

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,500
If you start DJing, probably all gay guys are over six feet tall and we're all...

39
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
[laughter]

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
Wait, Caleb, I always assumed you were at least 6'7" or something like that.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
That... if I was 6'7" I would be in jail.

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,240
You can't be this bald and ugly at 6'7", dude.

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,940
How is that something you assume, Jacques?

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,540
Why would you assume that? What about Caleb conveys that to you?

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,940
Um, there's just a certain je ne sais quoi about the way that he...

46
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
they're speaking cajun

47
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
speaking cajun off of that cajun bullshit

48
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
no, Caleb acts like a short guy

49
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm not short, I'm definitely normal

50
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,940
no, you're short

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
hey guys, I'm not short, I'm normal

52
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
um, no, I'm

53
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,940
hey guys, I'm normal, I'm actually short

54
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,940
no, I am normal

55
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm the tallest guy I know

56
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm not a little squeaky mouse

57
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,940
and 5'9"

58
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
who's the shortest here?

59
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,940
it's either me or Pat, we've never figured out, we don't wanna find out

60
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,500
did figure this out. We did not. Jana measured us in your apartment. We're the

61
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,420
same height. We're the same exact height. That makes sense to me. I would say maybe

62
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,100
maybe Patrick's got an inch or two. No come on. He's fucking serious right now.

63
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,060
I'm the tallest one in my team. Imagine Jana measuring you guys back to back and there's like a clear

64
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,140
like one inch difference. She's like, "Yeah you guys are the same height!"

65
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,140
She's a ride or die dude.

66
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,140
She's like cradling Cabe like a baby.

67
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Yeah.

68
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,140
Uh yeah, no we're the same.

69
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,140
Yo, you're the same height as Patrick, Caleb.

70
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
Don't let them tell you otherwise.

71
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,140
I always assumed Max is pretty tall.

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,140
Max is the shortest of the group.

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,140
Max is the shortest of the group.

74
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,140
Max is the shortest of the group.

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
I'm 5'10.

76
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Shortest in Jacques?

77
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Jacques is a normal height.

78
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,140
Jacques is 5'11 right Jacques?

79
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,140
not that terrifies me

80
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
jock is not 5'11"

81
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,140
I always assumed jock was like

82
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,140
5'2"

83
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,140
jock being 6'3" he would have been assassinated

84
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
I always assumed jock was

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
like just a little too powerful

86
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,140
now that is really

87
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
scaring me now, imagine jock being

88
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,140
taller than me

89
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,140
have you seen fright night 2?

90
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,140
where like the vampire

91
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,140
like rollerblades through the high school or whatever

92
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,140
yes

93
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,640
I would have bet Jacques was any taller.

94
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
It's just like a vampire from...

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Wait, okay, wait. Jacques...

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,440
Jacques had his roller... I didn't know this, and I haven't talked to Jacques about this,

97
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,440
but Jacques, you had your roller skates stolen from you.

98
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
Oh my god.

99
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
What? And this turns into, like,

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,440
you have a GPS tracker in your roller skates?

101
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Did you get, like...

102
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
I just want to get answers.

103
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
I forgot about...

104
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,440
Wait, tell this story because I literally...

105
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,320
It's court ordered, uh, Jock got pinched, uh, for roller skating while drunk.

106
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,640
And the court put in like one of those, uh, a blow thing.

107
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,440
A tube on like the heel.

108
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,240
His dab, his dab, uh, volume per blood amount or whatever before he can get to his roller

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
skates.

110
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,040
How much being he's had in one day.

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,760
It's a pretty wholesome amount.

112
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
It's a pretty wholesome story.

113
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Okay.

114
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
This is what happened.

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Is it a wholesome story?

116
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Stole it

117
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:48,960
Jax rollers. Oh, I don't I don't know. I thought maybe you got pulled over and they like suspended your library card

118
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,400
I'm gonna tell you all right now if the cops ever get my roller skates. There's gonna be dead cops

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
*laughter*

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
I will kill the poor white dweller on their ass.

121
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I will kill them.

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
So, um...

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Hold on, hold on. If the cops didn't get your roller skates, you can just buy another pair of roller skates.

124
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I don't think it's that hard.

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah, steal them from some other child.

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Well, no, I mean, I'm getting my pair back.

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
They're sentimental.

128
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
My pair is... they're not even sentimental.

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I just want to kill a cop.

130
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,400
But I want to kill a cop.

131
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I do not want to go to jail again.

132
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I spent enough time there when I was 17.

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I think you probably do need to spend more time in jail.

134
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't know if you were exactly rehabilitated.

135
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I am definitely a rehabilitated criminal.

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:11,840
and

137
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,000
your own keys? Because I lose shit so often, my wallet and stuff. I just started, I got

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,200
this like literally- So you're just GPS tracking like every single one of them? Yeah, just like

139
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,000
leftovers, just throwing a square on it. I'm already losing things all the time and now

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that I've been introduced to a certain Mexican anxiety relief medication, I have just- You

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've just I've said that like we're supposed to know what you mean.

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, I've become a is that what you call Max?

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,700
Yeah.

144
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Well, no, no, no.

145
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,800
But anyway, I've been a little bit more forgetful than normal.

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,300
And so I look at the tracker.

147
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm like, okay, I took okay.

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Wait, tell who how did your roller skates get stolen?

149
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, where were you?

150
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,500
I was at the roller.

151
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,100
I was at the roller rink, cancel me, and I'm skating.

152
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,620
Wait, why would you be? Oh, because you're you're not quarantining.

153
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,140
Yeah. No one's going to cancel you for that.

154
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,660
Don't worry about it.

155
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,260
I mean, there's no way you were not the only person.

156
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,940
I bring a baseball bat with me, so if they try to get close to me,

157
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,860
I just push the baseball bat toward you.

158
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,220
You just dressed like Marshall Barley.

159
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,980
I'm a roller skating rink.

160
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,580
So, um, six year old girl who is like three feet away from

161
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,980
John.

162
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,980
It's her the phase of the I took my skates off out to go

163
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,380
outside to smoke a blunt and I put my shoes on.

164
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,680
I left my skates on and when I came back my skates were

165
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,380
gone and I was like, what'd you do?

166
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,480
How did you react?

167
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,580
I was like, okay.

168
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,280
Well, someone's got my fucking skates.

169
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,280
The staff is like all 16 year olds with learning disabilities.

170
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,480
So they're incapable of helping me in any way possible.

171
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Like the stat the owner.

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,780
What is this roller rate?

173
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,480
Is that like the theme skate City in Arvada?

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
No, they're just box.

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,280
No, those were eight City in Arvada and the owner at the owner

176
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:35,280
The manager is like a 5'4" gay Office Depot looking twink.

177
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,280
What? I didn't know there were Office Depot gays.

178
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Is this really that confusing?

179
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Yes it is.

180
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,280
He's a twink, but he looks like he works at Office Depot.

181
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
But he works at a roller rink.

182
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
He had a red shirt on.

183
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,540
(laughing)

184
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,200
- The office depot.

185
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,000
- So anyway, I'm like complaining,

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm like look someone took my skates,

187
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,240
they're like look we can review the footage tomorrow.

188
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm like fuck reviewing the footage tomorrow.

189
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm like let's--

190
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,760
- I'm gonna kill some cops.

191
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,400
- I'm gonna kill some cocks, I'm gonna kill some cops,

192
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm gonna do something fucked up

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
if I don't get my goddamn skates.

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
And I'm like, and I'm like if you don't tell that

195
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,560
ugly 40 year old mother fucker who keeps spinning in circles in the middle of the roller rink

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,840
to put his mask on. I will personally. That's going to be you. Trip him again. He's just

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:42,800
looking in a mirror. If you don't tell me I'm going to make a whole snack club look

198
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,240
like a motherfucking kindergarten. Also the story is really starting to come together in

199
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,400
my head as why my skates were stolen.

200
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,880
Before the skates were stolen, this guy kept skating too close to me and so I just kicked

201
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,440
him as hard as I could.

202
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,080
He fell and he rolled.

203
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,000
It was adult night, so I thought it was okay.

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,320
You're just putting this together now?

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,320
the

206
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,520
I knocked him over and he deserved it but

207
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:33,860
No, I mean I just did it really quickly it was a hit and run kind of situation

208
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:41,240
Late later in the night later in the night I go to

209
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,740
Later the employees don't help you you don't see the security footage

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,640
Decide to leave no, no, I don't leave I look at the app and I'm like, okay

211
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
What app

212
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:09,260
I see that that wherever my roller skates are they're still in the parking lot. I'm like

213
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,660
GPS tracker

214
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, I knew some shit was gonna go down once I started it's like

215
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,280
Inspector gadget or what?

216
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,280
You kicked that guy and then put the GPS tracker onto the skates right now.

217
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Anyway, I see the guy loading in the back of his car, he's putting some other stuff, and my skates are right next to his wheel.

218
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,280
And I say, "STOP! WHAT?!"

219
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,280
And he just starts running.

220
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,280
What did the guy look like? Can we get a physical description?

221
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay, literally red hoodie

222
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,120
Pete Davidson

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,720
Fuck dude, I know these were your skates. I'm so sorry

224
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,280
Some gay monster

225
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,240
Fuck

226
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,680
Enough anxiety medication to let this situation

227
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,520
Mike Mike. Oh, yeah. I love Mike which Mike which Mike is your favorite?

228
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,960
I found hold it off. Oh, I will hold a microphone to your mouth

229
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,200
please

230
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,040
What kind of

231
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,160
Abuse we have to hold up to it like so every single time we record

232
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,400
So you chase?

233
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
person

234
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
finish the story

235
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
Jacques has cancelled for this

236
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,080
well I grabbed my skates and I just went back to my roommates car

237
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,760
wait so the guy ran and just left his car just open?

238
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
yes

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,200
maybe he was trying to steal the car too

240
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
maybe it wasn't

241
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,560
Jacques was literally on so much Xanax

242
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,400
this is a story of him stealing someone else's skate

243
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,400
yeah running out of the car

244
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
he invented a napkin in his head

245
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,440
was like this absolutely barred out on mexicans and i think it's like you might

246
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
see what what back

247
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
the while the other

248
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,160
uh... yeah i think that it was uh... instead of looking like he gave us a

249
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,880
mispronouncement like i don't know i would like to know

250
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,200

he was just as cocky as pete davidson

255
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,520
uh... to and that's why i can tell

256
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
davidson isn't cocky

257
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,920
he can't even be cocky

258
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,920
he can barely roll out of bed every morning like the only thing he does for fun

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,000
is like get shitty tattoos of like

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
hillary clinton and her pussy

261
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,140

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:35,080
the

266
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:42,080
the

267
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:55,960
the

268
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:10,960
a

269
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:28,080
and

270
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:50,600
is

271
00:15:50,600 --> 00:16:12,620
like kill a bug is exhausted dude okay I went to five below today which I don't

272
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:21,800
know if you know what that's where you live it's a scary place it's not

273
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,220
somewhere you want to end up it's a haunted house I thought we're the first

274
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:33,660
angel mommy video was shot I mean I had to chew to Ambien just to walk into the

275
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,620
store I mean come on why would you it is a crazy store I mean it feels very my

276
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,860
My friend Kirstie wanted to meet me. She's a craft.

277
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,900
You know, she likes like fake mustache humor and things like that,

278
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,980
or not even.

279
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,820
Is she random too?

280
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,420
She's so random. Anyway, this, I go to this store,

281
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,780
I just filled up a basket. Um, I scanned one single item,

282
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,900
which was an eraser.

283
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,900
And then I got like five bags of those pretzel Buffalo's chips and

284
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,740
six canvases and then just walked out with everything.

285
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,100
Yeah, that's like a pretty easy store to steal from.

286
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I think I feel like every store is asking for it.

287
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
If you have a self check out self check out is like it's so

288
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,500
easy. I got free groceries for years through self check out

289
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,100
because I'm just bringing everything in as a potato. Yeah,

290
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,200
when I was in Boston, I never bought cheese just for the road

291
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,400
in the bag did it's so easy to steal that I can bring you

292
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,900
you bring your own tote bag to the store and then you can

293
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,260
just throw every other item in the bag.

294
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:42,380
- I took 15 cases of La Croix at once last week.

295
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,220
- A what?

296
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,060
- A 15 cases?

297
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,900
- 15 cases?

298
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,340
- You took a pallet of fucking-

299
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
- 15?

300
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,020
(laughing)

301
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,840
- La Croix?

302
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,580
- I put 15 at the bottom of the grocery cart.

303
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,700
- Were you operating a forklift?

304
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,580
(laughing)

305
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,980
- No, no, no, no.

306
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,540
- Just, it's a potato.

307
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,380
Just scan it.

308
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,420
(laughing)

309
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,020
This is a potato.

310
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,860
- Yeah, we see the-

311
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,140
- Oh, okay, okay.

312
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,260
i think it's a bit bigger ones like yeah that's not okay

313
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,180
hi either way if you know if you know what to do it's still a lot that's like

314
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,100

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
yes i can

316
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,560
not many times

317
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,800
i think them all

318
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,500
now have

319
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,560
maybe a few left i have a copy of the israeli

320
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,300
out of the fifty-nine so and i think it gave me a kidney stone

321
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,320
it's water

322
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,060
this year's war is carbonated though it's got it's got stones in it

323
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,220
Something is a kidney stone and I don't know what it is, but

324
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,940
Is it the bean?

325
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,820
I love that a kidney, like people are like, oh, I feel a cold coming on or,

326
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,060
you know, I feel like I might get a fever, but for you, you've had so many kidney stones

327
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,540
that you're like, yeah, I'm probably going to get a kidney stone. I can feel one coming on.

328
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,820
No, if you really want to hear something funny is that I had my

329
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,820
procedure to have my kidney stone pulverized pushed back from today.

330
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,260
Is that what you just hit on your heart?

331
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,940
So tomorrow, because I

332
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,180
trying to crush something.

333
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,340
Yeah, I just don't.

334
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,740
It is a short dish.

335
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,020
No, it's mad.

336
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,580
But no, seriously.

337
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,180
Yeah, I thought that we were going to do this little recording ditto

338
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,660
on Tuesday.

339
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,540
So I'm like, yeah, we could get my kidney stone pulverized today.

340
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,140
No problem.

341
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,780
What is that?

342
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,700
What they call it?

343
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Is it you making a point for pulverization?

344
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
I'm going to pulverize that kidney stone boy.

345
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,380
I call the doctor, you know, Dr. Piper.

346
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,280
What a cartoon character.

347
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,180
Yeah, he works at Piper's Pulverization.

348
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,180
At some point the bar for me to like stop Jack while telling a

349
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,880
story is so high.

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,580
You know, it's like Dr. Piper.

351
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,480
You talk to the doctor and you're like, I need this kidney stone

352
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,080
removed and they're like, oh, we can't do that, but we can pulverize

353
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,980
it if you want.

354
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,780
I told him I lost my full bottle of steroids,

355
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,220
so I'm going to get more steroids to take so I could just, you know, whatever.

356
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,540
I'm going to get this kidney stone

357
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,180
UTI thing zapped, get it removed.

358
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,420
I'm going to get them to put a saline solution bag in me.

359
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,180
In you? IV.

360
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,380
Oh, in me.

361
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,040
Since I have health care, you guys could just put that in my ass for free, right?

362
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,040
If I bring you something you guys have to put it in my ass.

363
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:42,040
And I'm gonna bring my anxiety medication that they gave me and I'm gonna chew it in front of them and I'm gonna say look I'm not anxious, I'm anxious still it doesn't work.

364
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
And they're gonna give me a better prescription.

365
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,040
That's definitely how that works.

366
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,040
They're not taking it in front of you, institutionalize you or call the police.

367
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh my god, no, these people were friends. They know these games I play.

368
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
Why do you think, what has led to your kidney stone?

369
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
You're talking about your doctor.

370
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh fuck, Shaq's coming back to play some games with us.

371
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,640
He's gonna chew a bunch of pills in front of us and demand we give him a stronger dose.

372
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Hey, can you put this sandwich in my stomach?

373
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,640
This reminds me of my friend, this is a horrible story.

374
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
like 14 or 15 we would go and hang out with my friends

375
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,840
pilled out like white wine Xanax mom just to get

376
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,340
fucked up with her even though our friend wasn't there like we would go and hang out with her

377
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,340
mom to 14 15 year olds.

378
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,040
That's yeah. Yeah, and I and we would and I would start getting undressed starting to be like I'm getting

379
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,040
naked. If you don't give me if you don't give me pills right now, I'm going to get naked.

380
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,040
You would do that. You would do that to your friends mom. Yeah, and she'd be like, okay,

381
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,640
Okay, okay, fine.

382
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,280
Well, and then she would get fucked up with us and she would put on music videos on Cox

383
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,960
direct or Cox cable and then she'd be like, I've been practicing a dance for them.

384
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,840
And this woman is not attractive.

385
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,720
She's not a good dancer.

386
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,960
She is not someone you want.

387
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,080
And she would get in front of the TV and kind of like start dancing and she goes, whoops,

388
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
and pulls out her nipple.

389
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
No

390
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:34,520
Hide of music videos

391
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:41,480
Me and then show me your asshole

392
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,480
Doc's friend lived in Carcosa for a long time

393
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,100
Just boyhood friends with the yellow king. Oh don't get naked. I have to turn on the sucker free countdown

394
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:04,800
It just goes to show you that we all grew up a little differently we that is definitely true

395
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:12,120
Say I never had any friend's mother do a nip tease.

396
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,920
No, that was a dream, but it never happened for me.

397
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,460
I would have scared me when any of my friends would knock on

398
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,800
my family's house's door.

399
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
My dad would answer and they'd be like, Yeah, I'm Jacques friend.

400
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,360
And he'd say,

401
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,200
you shock doesn't have any friends and then close the door.

402
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,360
It's so mean.

403
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,420
Oh, man.

404
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,860
What a mean dad.

405
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,620
That's Jacques.

406
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,060
That is one of the top OBGYN in Louisiana.

407
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh, yeah, that's right.

408
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,260
No, no, in the United States.

409
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,160
Oh, in the United States.

410
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,300
Yes. Another curveball.

411
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,200
I know. That's crazy.

412
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
You come from a medical background.

413
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,660
Literally.

414
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,700
That's that's nuts.

415
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,800
Why are the guys from Dead Ringers?

416
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,760
What did they do so?

417
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,360
What did they do so wrong that I did?

418
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,460
That's exactly my question.

419
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,160
Why didn't you go into the medical field, Jock?

420
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
You clearly are, you love going to the doctor.

421
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
Going to the medical field.

422
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
Yeah, you love pills.

423
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah, Jacques is smuggling Xanax from Mexico.

424
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
That is technically the medical field.

425
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
That is a parody. That is not true.

426
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
That is a parody comedy.

427
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
You said that like eight times.

428
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I didn't say that at all.

429
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Jacques, you can't just smuggle drugs and be like,

430
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
"Oh, that was, I was joking."

431
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
"I was doing a weird outfit."

432
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
"That was just a prank. That was a prank."

433
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Yeah, it was.

434
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,760

442
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:26,320
We're like we're not gonna be back for like two days at least we just got a free deal on a hotel and we're here

Means that would absolutely be my first concern.

456
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,520
Now that you have AIDS, tell me about your primary care physician.

You know, make sure you're able to go to Planned Parenthood at least and like get that, you know, get the AIDS pill and then just go, you know, like the AIDS pill.

458
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,000
No, you can't get a pill.

459
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,200
If you're exposed to HIV, you just get a pill.

460
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,040
It like makes you really sick and then you don't get AIDS.

461
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,280

So the prep you'll need it's called the Bible

468
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
*laughter*

469
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:50,640

Yeah, yeah, totally.

475
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
No, Pep, Pep, the post-exposure stuff.

476
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Oh, okay.

477
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,640
Then, right after I was prescribed PrEP for a month, and I lost weight, and I just, that

478
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,000
shit made my body feel terrible.

479
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,680
PrEP, yeah.

480
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
It's obviously not good for you.

481
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,040
There's no way that, like, there's gotta be a way where you can be gay and not have...

482
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,840
They are trying to poison all the gay people with PrEP.

483
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Don't take the pill!

484
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Don't take the pill!

485
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,400
He's an AWOL!

486
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,440
literally how I think about it. Yeah.

487
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,320
But it's going to make you skinny anyways.

488
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,920
So I don't think there's a way to avoid that.

489
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Yeah. We eat a bunch of cheesecake.

490
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,720
Makes you skinny, Jacques.

491
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,920
I don't I don't want to be.

492
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,600
Yeah, I'm just going to start taking it just because

493
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,000
like how women take birth control because it helps their acne.

494
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,320
Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,520
Going on perhaps you can lose weight.

496
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,480
They should make up Flintstones prep.

497
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,720
(laughter)

498
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,960
- Gummies.

499
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,560
- No, they'd have to get a different

500
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,920
Hannibal-Berra property.

501
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
- I ate the whole container of the shirt.

502
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,720
- She just is eating them out of like a popcorn bag.

503
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,560
- I ate the whole container and now I actually have eight.

504
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,320
- It would be like Tom Tom and Jerry Prep.

505
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
- Yeah, I was thinking Jerry was eating

506
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
the pussycats or something like that.

507
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,560
- I love, I love Jerry.

508
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,760
- Pussy in the pussycats shaped prep.

509
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
- No, it'd have to be for gay guys,

510
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,640
it'd have to be like Betty Boop.

511
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,200
- Oh yeah, there we go.

512
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Gangsta Betty Boop.

513
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Chola Betty Boop.

514
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,000
Betty Boop.

515
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
A little gummy in the silhouette of Betty Boop.

516
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But you can tell she has massive camo pants on.

517
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And boobs.

518
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I thought you said "cummy" at first.

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's like holding an AK-47.

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I thought you said "cum."

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You're damn disgusting, Jacques.

522
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I love Chola Betty Boop. That's probably my favorite iteration of like...

523
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
...like, Cholification of cartoon characters.

524
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,600
It's either that or Gangster Felix the Cat.

525
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Yeah, Gangster Felix the Cat is good.

526
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Gangster SpongeBob is great because it just came out of left field.

527
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,100
Gangster SpongeBob is good.

528
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,400
Gangster Bugs Bunny.

529
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,900
Oh, Black Bart.

530
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,000
I mean, that's like a...

531
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Black Homer.

532
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
Black Homer is the gut out of all the Simpsons.

533
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
The Simpsons are white.

534
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
Black Opoo is a great one.

535
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,400
They're not. They're white.

536
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
Marge... I mean...

537
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:49,400
the

538
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,660
(laughter)

539
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,680
- She is not queer, shut the fuck up.

540
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
- Homer is queer 'cause he's bald.

541
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
- Homer is the--

542
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,880
- That's actually not, it's actually not queer to be bald,

543
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
it's actually like the straightest thing you do.

544
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,640
- I don't know, you and Jacques are side by side

545
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,280
on my screen right now, so.

546
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,920
- But I'm fully bald, Jacques has some hair, that's gay.

547
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,120
That's some gay shit.

548
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,960
- Yeah.

549
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,480
- I feel like the gay people on Grindr,

550
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,680
the only people available to me,

551
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,560
or who are interested in me on Grindr,

552
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,880
all look like Homer.

553
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
(laughing)

554
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,760
- Are you, do you have interest in Homer?

555
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
Are you eating rotisserie chicken?

556
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,240
- Yeah, of course.

557
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,480
- I feel like Jock is one of those people

558
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,000
who eats like every part of the rotisserie chicken.

559
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
- Yeah. - What's wrong with that?

560
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
- The bones. - The spine.

561
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,920
- Thank you, Patrick.

562
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Thank you, Patrick.

563
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Thank you for defending my American rights.

564
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,240
- I think Jock eats it like the Tasmanian devil.

565
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,040
There's just like a tornado around it for a second

566
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,440
and it's just bones.

567
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,320
it's the entire chicken meats mouth and pulls out its clean skeleton

568
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
leftist liberal

569
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
Jacques eats, Jacques eats

570
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
wait wait wait, Jacques is about to go off on leftist

571
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,320
why did your Jacques go off on leftist Jacques?

572
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
go ahead

573
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
you leftist liberal, leftist liberal

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,320
trying to tell me how much meat I can eat

575
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
I will eat every little skin and bone off of this

576
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
I spent 60 bucks

577
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
leftist owed

578
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
I eat an entire chicken skeleton

579
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,320
I will eat every little skin and bone off of this

580
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
I spent 60 bucks

581
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:46,280
the

582
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,480
There's no key. Why my no, I haven't been eating kale

583
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:57,520
Please tell me even an Amy's breakfast burrito the very least take that impossible burger and throw it away

584
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,920
I don't know. I don't want your

585
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,560
Come on bro

586
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,880
Stop eating that like a fistful of chicken

587
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,320
and

588
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,320
it

589
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,960
you're drinking ketchup but the fuck

590
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,160
the

591
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,880
always has got their beats when i lived with been all night you know i'm

592
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,280
drinking them

593
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,280
you need to purple the i haven't had a beat and so long

594
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,920
and i think that i'm not even a maturing team and that's up in fact

595
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,520
That is, she did sound like that.

596
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,520
Jesse, you know, I'm not eating them, I'm drinking them.

597
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,820
I like that your impression of Ben is Vincent Price.

598
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,220
[Laughter]

599
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,420
Uh, um, wait, Jacques, what were you gonna say when I lived with you?

600
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,720
I was not at a beat phase in my life then.

601
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,820
No, but when I lived with him, Ben would always be slapping raw chicken breast.

602
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,420
Okay, this literally, no, no.

603
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,220
Shut up! Shut your, shut your dumb little mouth.

604
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
He's always slapping raw chicken in the kitchen.

605
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,220
In the kitchen, just throwing raw chicken around.

606
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Slapping together chickens.

607
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,220
This motherfucker opens the container, takes it out of the plastic wrap,

608
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,220
and is just slamming that motherfucking raw chicken on the counter,

609
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,220
not wiping the counter before or after.

610
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,220
That's nasty.

611
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,220
It's part of the seasoning, it's part of the seasoning, Jacques.

612
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,220
You watched me cook an entire meal?

613
00:34:47,220 --> 00:35:02,220
the

614
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
Why are you slapping the chicken on the counter?

615
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Yeah, why, why, first off, why are you slapping chicken on the counter?

616
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,720
Apparently all the time.

617
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Why?

618
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,220
Over all of my meals.

619
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,220
No, this is impossible.

620
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,220
The kitchen was its own room at this house and Jacques was never awake at the same time

621
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
because Jacques wouldn't wake up until like 4 o'clock.

622
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Eyes again.

623
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,220
Because you were too busy.

624
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:29,220
You, Jacques, were too busy sneaking in what you call sex worker clients into the home

625
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,220
to smell you for money.

626
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,480
(laughing)

627
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,320
- Okay.

628
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,400
- If you really,

629
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,320
if you really want to slander me

630
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,720
by saying I would flap a raw chicken around,

631
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,760
which would have been healthier than the--

632
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
- No, Caleb, I think they were paying Jacques.

633
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
- They were paying Jacques to smells, okay, okay.

634
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,240
- Yes, yes.

635
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,480
- Don't put your microphone in your armpit,

636
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
it might stuff your--

637
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,800
- Jacques, and I just found this out recently.

638
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,280
One time I, apparently,

639
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,880
one time I was leaving the house Jacques and I lived in

640
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
with like six other people.

641
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,240
And Jacques was like, "Oh, hey Ben, how's it going?"

642
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,600
I was like, "Fine, going to work."

643
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,840
And Jacques was like, "Okay, bye."

644
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,080
And he, in that process,

645
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,720
was sneaking a john of his into the home.

646
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,800
And he made this guy like crouch--

647
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
- Out of?

648
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,680
- Out of the home.

649
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
He made this man like crouch behind a car

650
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,840
so I didn't see him.

651
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,480
- Wait, why can't you just say like,

652
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,520
(laughing)

653
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,360
this is a,

654
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,480
(laughing)

655
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,040
why do you need to make him fucking go--

656
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,960
- I know, I just would have been like,

657
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
It's part of the experience

658
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:39,700
You don't you don't pay to go on the Jimmy Fallon ride

659
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,360
Ride so you can see the a cappella band at the beginning

660
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:55,960
Tronics those people should kill them

661
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,960
I went to a pentatonic gig when I was in high school.

662
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
They keep distracting my for one time.

663
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Transformers beatboxing.

664
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
Yeah, they did that shit.

665
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,960
They did like a, like for the longest time,

666
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,960
like beatbox and I was like,

667
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,960
I almost walked out of the fucking concert then.

668
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,960
What kept you in?

669
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I had to go to a concert when I was like in,

670
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
I think 11th grade in high school.

671
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Like write a concert review for my music.

672
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:37,640
you

673
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,080
now because he's European.

674
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,640
Right.

675
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,000
True.

676
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,840
Now in Europe, in Europe, that's that's like the first rule.

677
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,920
Yeah, I've been having sex with little children because that's

678
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,240
what they do.

679
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,720
It's classy.

680
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,920
Literally when in Rome.

681
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,360
Classy.

682
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:51,840
Yeah.

683
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,120
Now I can finally live my fag destiny.

684
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,240
You got him.

685
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,000
You got him.

686
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,240
That's definitely what Spanish people sound like.

687
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:14,200
everyone in Europe is the queen of England.

688
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,160
This is Max.

689
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
This is Max on a regular day in Spain.

690
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,520
He's like, Oh, can I please have another glass of white wine with my paella bowl?

691
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:37,880
the

692
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,840
the middle of town and I did have a big bowl of paella, a cigarette and a big glass of

693
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
white wine.

694
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Wow.

695
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,920
So you kinda- Joke's on you bitch.

696
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,640
I think the joke is still on you Max.

697
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Yeah, no you got clout.

698
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
You got exactly- You were owned.

699
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,160
Yeah, joke's on you, I'm exactly who you just made me.

700
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,240
Yeah, and I fucking enjoyed myself, I had a nice time.

701
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Patrick, what's the sexiest meal in your eyes?

702
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:13,440
*laughter*

703
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
I don't know.

704
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Double cheeseburger.

705
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
I'm not trying to fry.

706
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Food is not sexy to me.

707
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I don't think there's any meal.

708
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Okay, okay, okay. Let me put it.

709
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
What is the best food you could eat?

710
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,440
*laughter*

711
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Food you have sex with.

712
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Yeah.

713
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Food I would have sex with.

714
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah, that could be the list for the episode.

715
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,240
Never mind.

716
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Pussy bread.

717
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Pretzels.

718
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I was trying to hit her.

719
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Chicken livers.

720
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Man, fuck this.

721
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,760
I was trying to get to know you to get a good question in, but you throw in this chicken

722
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,760
liver bullshit.

723
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Well, Shock, answer your own question.

724
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
What's the horniest food?

725
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Was that the sexiest dish?

726
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Yes, sexiest meal.

727
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Shepherd's pie.

728
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
How about that?

729
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Shepherd's pie.

730
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
Shepherd's pie.

731
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
- Pepper's pie? - Pepper's pie?

732
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
- What the f*ck? - Pepper's pie with the protein and vegetables

733
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
one scoop and you got all you want.

734
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
- That is very sexy. - Ew!

735
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,760
- It's very sexy to have like a brown gravy. - Protein and vegetables in one scoop.

736
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
- A brown gravy hidden under mashed potatoes. - Yeah.

737
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,760
- Nothing gets you off like that. - Slop is the sexiest kind of food.

738
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,760
- He must have different... - That is the one meal I am good at cooking though.

739
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
- We should have pepper pie. - Really?

740
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
- Pepper's pie is good. - I don't believe you.

741
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
I wouldn't call it sexy.

742
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
You're good at cooking multiple meals, I can tell.

743
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Me?

744
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
How can you tell?

745
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Tell me what about Patrick

746
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
makes you think he's still cooking a bunch of different meals?

747
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
That sounds fatphobic to me.

748
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
Exactly.

749
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm going to stick up for Patrick right now.

750
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Since I quit drinking, I lost so much weight.

751
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,760
It's insane.

752
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
Why did you quit drinking?

753
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
girlfriend or something?

754
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,560
There's an insane amount of calories and carbohydrates in alcohol.

755
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,360
Yeah, I mean, I fucking, I lost like 10 pounds in January.

756
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Like I was like, I was drinking.

757
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Damn, Pat.

758
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,440
You quit because you were getting too lost on the sauce.

759
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,400
You were like street corner wino, like hobo.

760
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Street corner wino.

761
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,240
I was on the street corner singing doo-wop for fucking.

762
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Imagine Patrick is a wine guy, it's so funny.

763
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Drinking, you know like Thunderbird.

764
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Chugging wine.

765
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
He really is Thunderbird.

766
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
He really rips.

767
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Y'all know what I'm talking about?

768
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Drinking coolant.

769
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,240
That's the thing about Pat is like he drinks and eats everything like he's eating it over

770
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
the summer.

771
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,740
Obviously we've all never been homeless before because when I say wine and I say wino, typically

772
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,240
you're drinking Thunderbird wine which tests out.

773
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,200
It's like it tests out like 30 or 40%.

774
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,680
It's a small bottle and this is the most disgusting thing

775
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
you could drink.

776
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
Do not mix it with mushrooms.

777
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,800
In fact, don't mix anything with mushrooms.

778
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,400
- No, you can mix stuff with mushrooms.

779
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,800
- I feel like people are like,

780
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,200
I'm finally getting mental clarity.

781
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,000
I'm finally not mentally ill anymore.

782
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,560
- I'm a big-- - No, that's not what I'm doing.

783
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,120
- Of micro dosing mushrooms.

784
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,840
I've been micro dosing over many times in my life

785
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,240
and I was always pissed off that I didn't get like a sober high

786
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,040
because people always talk about like, oh, you know, like

787
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,340
that does not exist.

788
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,240
It doesn't exist.

789
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,940
It does not exist.

790
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,640
It doesn't exist.

791
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,140
The sober high is complete.

792
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,640
Like it's a complete fiction.

793
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,440
I was like, why am I not writhing on the ground in pure ecstasy?

794
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,040
Right.

795
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,940
For three months, but it's like two.

796
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
I'm at two months now.

797
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,440
It's the first of March.

798
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Yeah, so I don't know.

799
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,740
I mean, I think I like drink more in the summer in the winter.

800
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,840
I kind of just like, oh dude, I was like, I don't do anything.

801
00:42:51,840 --> 00:43:05,720
the

802
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:20,720
is

803
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,720
are you an AA? is that why you listen to orange juice and all that like faggy rock music?

804

I gave up on you watched the Mandalorian. I saw seven episodes. Yeah

825
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,960
That's too many to give up.

826
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,680
That's enough to make you a certified cop.

827
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,880
That's enough to make you a certified cop.

828
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,840
Listen, no, listen, I watched an episode.

829
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,880
I forgot my Disney Plus password.

830
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,280
Why are you smoking a fucking like?

831
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,000
It's got a bong.

832
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,720
You were getting.

833
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,280
We're back.

834
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:27,920
Oh, yeah.

835
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,160
What the fuck is it?

836
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,040
It's going to get hard.

837
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,160
If all's rock.

838
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,200
OK, yeah.

839
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,160
Chuck, take the take.

840
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,200
Take the take the rip.

841
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Take the rip.

842
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,680
Come on, eat it back up.

843
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,480
You guys, it's not.

844
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,960
It doesn't work like that.

845
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,100
That is literally an industrial revolution, Debra.

846
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,800
Look at that fucking thing, dude.

847
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,700
Yeah, that's literally a cast iron.

848
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,900
Xenomorph. Yeah, I think that's iron fog.

849
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,200
That's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

850
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,660
You imagine you'd never have to clean it because it's

851
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,000
you just got to season it once in a while with some oil.

852
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,360
I've only had this for a bang, bang, boom.

853
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,000
I've only had this for like six or seven months.

854
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,060
No less than that.

855
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,000
I've only had it for like four or five months.

856
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,560
And there was something stuck in it and I was like, oh, it's probably just some dab.

857
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,800
I pulled out like a ball of wax.

858
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,760
A piece of chicken.

859
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,260
Damn.

860
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,260
[Laughter]

861
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,260
A whole piece of chicken.

862
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,460
Chuck, how often do you like try to clean out like a bowl or something and accidentally end up breaking it?

863
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,400
Every time it happens.

864
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,900
There was...

865
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,900
I don't, so I don't clean.

866
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:38,900
I saw this guy, I saw this guy at the skate park one time in high school and he was trying to like...

867
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,460
You would see a guy at the skate park continue.

868
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
God, God.

869
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,460
That's where they hang out.

870
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
You know what I'm saying?

871
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,180
So he was trying to clean out his bowl, like he was trying to like smack it on his hand

872
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,860
and then I get he might have been too high and thought like, "Oh, I'll do this on the

873
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:59,300
ground so that I can get the atch out."

874
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,700
And the dude just like went to the ground and just fucking like slammed it on the ground

875
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,860
and it broke into like three pieces and he just looked up and went, "Oh, fuck."

876
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,140
*laughter*

877
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Okay, play your guitar riff now, and then I dab it.

878
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,180
Oh, fuck.

879
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,180
Hurry up, hurry up! We have to hurry!

880
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,180
He has his nail in there.

881
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,180
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

882
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,920
Keep going, keep going, Jack, keep going, keep going, keep going!

883
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,420
Keep going!

884
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,380
Patrick, go, go!

885
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,260
Keep going!

886
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
*laughter*

887
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,260
*music*

888
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,460
There we go.

889
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,460
Damn, this is some tenacious D shit.

890
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
*laughter*

891
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,460
*laughter*

892
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Jack is gonna fucking faint. If he dies, it's on you, Pat.

893
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:54,580
you

894
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:15,760
the top of my list are gonna be the Mexican pharmacies, Marlboro, Marlboro, the top three

895
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,320
people on the list of who killed me. Number one, the Mexican pharmacies.

896
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:28,040
For outing them. That's the next list for the podcast.

897
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,600
List of things that killed John. Mattel is going to kill me and Christian Walker

898
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,720
for our- Hasbro is used to potato head, not Mattel.

899
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:45,360
For our anti-gender crusades. I don't think Christian Walker is anti-gender.

900
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,760
I think he's very pro. He's pro-gender.

901
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,360
Yeah, he's pro-gender.

902
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,640
That's what I meant. I'm anti-gender. He's pro-gender.

903
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,360
If you two linked up, that would be...

904
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,200
Jacques has two genders. One for the plug, one for the load.

905
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,600
There we go.

906
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,720
So, like, obviously Christian Walker is garbage, but I mean, he's cute.

907
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,560
No, he's a kid. I love Christian.

908
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,920
I would love the idea of him even being attracted to me,

909
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:21,720
because not only am I disgusting and a mess but the complete opposite.

910
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,720
I tried to like argue again.

911
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,920
That's not yeah.

912
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:32,720
But I don't know.

913
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,920
Someone's getting cold for Christmas.

914
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
I think you and you.

915
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,160
(laughing)

916
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,240
- Okay, so now you,

917
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,960
now you claim to be Santa Claus.

918
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,520
(laughing)

919
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,120
You're at that level now.

920
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,840
All right.

921
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,520
- Oh, I'm so high, I'm zapped.

922
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,360
I'm like zapped.

923
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,520
- Dude, I feel like Santa Claus right now.

924
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,680
- This could turn me into Santa, god damn.

925
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,960
- Jock is smoking on that shit

926
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,760
that made Santa go around the world

927
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,760
with all the children.

928
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,560
(laughing)

929
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
I gotta get back to my workshop

930
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:17,280
That last dab felt like the little

931
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,160
Divine really off

932
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,880
Really off the dabs. Oh

933
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:30,080
Well, that's not you seem like you inhaled like the metal that makes up the rig more than anything. Oh

934
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,240
There's no metal in this. This is quartz

935
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:42,220
There is absolutely nothing wrong with inhaling aluminum.

936
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,920
Oh yeah, no, if there's something wrong with it.

937
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,220
I've smoked out of enough soda cans.

938
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:53,420
I have smoked out of so many cans in my life that I am a hundred percent

939
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,220
positive that there is a deposit of aluminum built up in the center of my brain.

940
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,520
So they cut open people's brains with dementia and Alzheimer's and

941
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:25,640
and

942
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:32,640
that

943
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,240
Where are you going to look?

944
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,560
I was trying to Google, but I thought this is a waste of time.

945
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,980
I'm just going to explain it quickly.

946
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:44,640
Over your lifetime, you're exposed to all this aluminum through the deodorant, through

947
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,440
drinking out of the cans, through whatever, whatever bathing products.

948
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:58,820
For some people, the exposure is so intense that it goes throughout your body and concentrates

949
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:05,940
in a small deposit on your brain or on the back of your skull and it looks like a drop

950
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,900
of melted aluminum.

951
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,900
It's fucked up dude.

952
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,480
It's yeah, yeah, no they, cause they, uh, they're finding like, like microplastics and

953
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,700
like, like placentas and shit now too.

954
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh yeah.

955
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Everyone's turning into robots.

956
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Okay, thank you.

957
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,700
I was hoping I'd...

958
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,700
I can't eat microplastics in my placenta.

959
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,700
I like microplastics.

960
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,540
I believe shock on this one. I think so. I know I know I'm crazy

961
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,340
Microplastics on my micro penis

962
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,860
Yeah, I thought it would give me a boost

963
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:43,980
Yeah, I had to put some microplastics in it isn't that the surgery that they're doing now

964
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,980
They're just putting like a silly. Oh, they put like a

965
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,300
Part of a fake shaft in there. Yeah

966
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,420
No, it looks beautiful what's gonna

967
00:52:54,620 --> 00:53:00,560
It looks really good. I've been looking into it you guys. Oh my god. Let me see penis implant before after

968
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,660
Be careful with your search cuz then you'll find like penis dermal

969
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:08,540
Okay

970
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,500
No one I have the best story one time

971
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,740
I was on grinder and I said send me a dick pic and this guy sent me a picture of what I thought was literally

972
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,740
a dead person's dick I

973
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,360
Wish I could find a picture just listen listen listen come to head like a morgue tag

974
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,740
Listen it's better. It's better come to find out this guy. It's better

975
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:38,880
No, listen this guy's white and he has had a blackout tattoo only on his penis

976
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,420
That's fucking sick was it to cover up an earlier dick tattoo

977
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:50,980
It was it did not look real did they tattoo his penis head his dick was gray because it was so faded

978
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:56,300
And it was a blackout tattoo heavily used it. Oh, no

979
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,540
you have not only a dick a fully tattooed dick, but a

980
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,380
Faded fully. Oh, yeah. Yeah Fox

981
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,300
This what you what you say to him jock. We like are you?

982
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,940
Hello, is this a zombie?

983
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,540
Is this so I said when can I suck?

984
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,060
City of Grey come

985
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:31,260
It was October I think actually

986
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:46,940
It was on Friday the 13th, I finally remember

987
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,940
*laughing*

988
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,940
When John said Friday the 13th he pulled out a hockey mask and put it over his face

989
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,940
*laughing*

990
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,940
Why do you have that?

991
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,940
Because I like to scare the neighbors

992
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,940
Or I like to scare people sometimes

993
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,940
*laughing*

994
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,940
Let me tell you something

995
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,940
Let me tell you a little trick of the trade

996
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,940
If you ever think you're being pranked

997
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,940
And you think it's me

998
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,940
You probably are

999
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,940
And this is how I'm going to be pranking you

1000
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,940
It'll be the middle of the night

1001
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:22,820
Mike

1002
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:30,380
10 30 p.m. Till 4 a.m. And I'll be on my skates in all black outfit

1003
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,580
I would feel like a no

1004
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:43,980
Like you think it's like by Isis do you have anybody who like pay a ransom?

1005
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,980
I wear...

1006
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,980
And I wear...

1007
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,980
Well I just wear my private...

1008
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,980
Clearly your silhouette.

1009
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,980
Like a...

1010
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,980
Like bodycon all black outfit.

1011
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,980
No, no, no, no, no.

1012
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
I'm wearing a very plain looking outfit.

1013
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,980
I'm wearing like a Dickies cover all once.

1014
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,980
I don't know if all black with your face covered is a plain looking outfit.

1015
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,980
Well I guess my roller skates make it not a plain outfit.

1016
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,980
But I'm playing spooky music from the Bluetooth speaker.

1017
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:26,940
the

1018
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,940
What is he talking about and where did he go?

1019
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,940
Oh, not if I'm not trickspiny

1020
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,940
Some kind of speak a

1021
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
Oh, I have the perfect disc for this

1022
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:36,940
I have

1023
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,940
I have this

1024
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,940
What the fuck?

1025
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,940
It's a torture zone

1026
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,940
I found this at Goodwill

1027
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,940
How do I play it?

1028
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,940
How do I, can I send a

1029
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,940
song

1030
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,940
in the group chat and someone play it

1031
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,940
I don't think, I don't think

1032
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,940
to

1033
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,940
Better

1034
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:10,180
Once you've Miller torture zone sounds to tell it's

1035
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:16,620
It's in the middle of the night and you hear this scary song and you're an all-black

1036
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:23,980
roller skater with a mask on I usually wear the ghost face killer mask from scream and

1037
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:28,020
I just approached them once you've done you've done this to someone before

1038
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:32,620
Well, I would get bored in Missoula Montana was so fucking boring

1039
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:42,500
It is literally a skip Marvel of like the fact that you were not killed in Missoula, Montana

1040
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,780
Yeah

1041
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:51,380
Your survivor of your own terror of the people

1042
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:58,260
The only time I ever thought I was gonna die in Montana. What was when I was floating alone in

1043
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:01,260
In on the Queen Air mattress.

1044
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,260
When Jacques says floating, he means floating down the river on a inflatable.

1045
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,260
Yeah, of course. One of my favorite facts about Jacques.

1046
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:16,260
And I was turning this way slowly, eating a bag of flaming hot Cheetos very loudly

1047
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,260
with my Bluetooth speaker and a baby bear starts swimming right next to me.

1048
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:25,260
It's really beautiful, John.

1049
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,260
It is getting, like, you know, getting fish from that, like, the shallow end.

1050
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:34,260
And I'm like, I have all this food. I'm eating Cheetos.

1051
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm like, literally, I'm like, you know, like, praise Hosanna in the highest.

1052
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:46,260
I'm like, I'm praying to my full mattress. I'm like praying to the Beanie Baby God.

1053
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,260
I'm like, oh, please, someone please save me.

1054
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:54,940
me and I start like dropping all of my food behind me and the bear starts getting the

1055
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,940
food.

1056
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,820
So you made a trail for the bear.

1057
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,500
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

1058
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,340
I got all the food off of mine because I didn't have a paddle.

1059
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,780
I just threw all of my food behind me.

1060
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,780
Thank God.

1061
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,140
You think you would have been eaten by the baby bear.

1062
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:16,460
Well because the baby bear that eats the mom.

1063
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,460
Mom.

1064
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,460
Caleb are you stupid?

1065
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,960
No, I'm just trying to get an idea of what you're on an air mattress.

1066
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,360
And I have I have a blowtorch, but I don't know if that's going to kill.

1067
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,160
What do you think?

1068
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,560
They're going to see a baby bear in the wild and go and be like,

1069
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:30,620
I'm going to mess with this thing.

1070
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,620
It can't hurt me.

1071
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,560
Jack, do you think you look specifically delicious to a bear?

1072
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,460
Yes, he does.

1073
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,620
Do I think I look what do you think you look like?

1074
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:40,700
It's like, do you think a bear

1075
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,920
would be like extra interested in you for some reason?

1076
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,160
Like you are more delicious than the average person?

1077
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,560
yes i'm covered in meat grease

1078
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,320

1081
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,800
there's a lot of inviting features you have delicious kidney stones for the

1082
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,200
beard of finish the meal with i have like an

1083
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,200
after dinner meant.

1084
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm D-dressed.

1085
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,200
Excuse me.

1086
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,480
This phone is broken.

1087
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
This is stupid.

1088
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,740
What happened to your phone?

1089
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:28,720
Literally seconds before trying to get the Zoom passcode access, which was like getting

1090
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,000
into Fort Knox so hard.

1091
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,920
It's literally five numbers.

1092
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,880
I'm trying to enter the matrix and it's like, "Whoa."

1093
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,240
I don't know how you techno wizards out there do it.

1094
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,880
He's five numbers and like three zeros.

1095
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,880
Five number three zeros.

1096
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,440
I don't need it today.

1097
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,200
[LAUGHTER]

1098
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,520
I really want to show you all that horror music.

1099
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,680
It's so bad.

1100
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,920
The scary song.

1101
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,400
Oh.

1102
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,680
I don't want to be scared, Jack.

1103
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,760
I'm already so scared.

1104
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,160
I don't really want to be scared.

1105
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,360
I don't want to be terrified.

1106
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,040
It's not-- this is not the day for me.

1107
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,520
You know what I always want to do, but I never do.

1108
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,920
I always think about hooking up my DJ--

1109
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:13,920
no, no, listen, listen.

1110
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,320
I always think about hooking up my DJ board

1111
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,680
without saying anything to y'all before the meeting

1112
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,560
so that it would just play through the Zoom call.

1113
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,400
Oh, you should do that.

1114
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,360
That would be fun.

1115
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,120
And just putting sound effects.

1116
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,960
And so y'all would suddenly start hearing

1117
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,080
gunshot noises so loudly.

1118
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,440
[LAUGHTER]

1119
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,240
That's a new era.

1120
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,080
You are a prankster.

1121
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,600
You shouldn't have given it away.

1122
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,920
Yeah.

1123
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,960
- Well, we have recorded before when,

1124
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:40,920
in the middle of recording,

1125
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,360
Jacques stands up and walks away and runs around the house.

1126
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,120
And then he came back and was like,

1127
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,040
"I heard gunshots.

1128
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,500
Someone's trying to kill me."

1129
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,880
(laughing)

1130
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,680
- The assassins finally got you.

1131
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,440
They finally found you.

1132
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,360
- There was someone who was trying to kill Jacques

1133
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,200
at the time, believe it or not.

1134
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,320
- So stalking me at my mom's house.

1135
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,960
I'm staying at my mom's house alone.

1136
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,320
I'm in from out of town.

1137
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,720
I'm like, "Oh my God,

1138
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,200
like I can't die at my mom's house alone."

1139
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,200
I've drank at least 15 Corona Premieres,

1140
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,720
which my mom's fridge is stocked to the brim with.

1141
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,600
I'm just sitting alone and I see a guy

1142
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,260
who I literally have a restraining order walk across

1143
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,480
the street from where I'm sitting watching TV.

1144
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,360
- Oh my God.

1145
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,400
- Of course I'm gonna be like, oh fuck.

1146
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,720
And then I record the next day and I mentioned to this,

1147
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,640
to Ben and Max and they're like,

1148
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,600
(laughing)

1149
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,600
You get the guy

1150
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,680
There goes

1151
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,840
My gosh

1152
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Like that there's somebody actually actively trying to kill Jacques and when it came to people

1153
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,840
Responsible for their death. They listed Mexican pharmacists

1154
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:15,040
I by all means want to keep living a long life

1155
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,280
and I I'm I have a lot to live for but if I do die suddenly I but

1156
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,020
literally make the best unsolved mystery because

1157
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,400
That would be a great

1158
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,400
too many

1159
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,440
20 different

1160
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:45,760
It'll literally be like

1161
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,760
I'll be the new mystery.

1162
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,760
It'll be great.

1163
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
Oh fuck.

1164
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
That'll be...

1165
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,760
literally, I'm coming for your throne.

1166
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,760
Let me just tell...

1167
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,760
I'm gonna find your treasure, DB.

1168
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
That's what I'm doing.

1169
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
DB Cooper is a raggedy bitch and Jacques is coming for his fucking throne.

1170
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
They better watch the fuck out.

1171
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,760
They better hide that pussy money.

1172
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,760
[Laughter]

1173
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,760
And my mystery

1174
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,760
is gonna be a lot more confusing

1175
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,360
confusing than Twin Peaks.

1176
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,360
I'm excited.

1177
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,960
Very excited for you to die.

1178
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,260
This is going to be good.

1179
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,360
Yeah, well, we already said when Jock dies, Max and I are just

1180
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,560
going to pivot to having a true crime podcast.

1181
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,760
Well, that's the first season right there.

1182
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,460
That's my gift to y'all.

1183
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:38,460
A martyr for the podcast by being mysteriously killed.

1184
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,660
I mean, honestly, if I get physically injured and that

1185
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:49,840
meant more patrons I mean I'm down if that's a tear if that's a good pay to

1186
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:55,460
hurt you if people will pay to yeah or we could I mean we could just lie and be

1187
01:04:55,460 --> 01:05:00,700
like Jacques broke his leg me like no fun me I'm always skating and then

1188
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:10,340
posting snap videos of couldn't take a month on his game as soon as I'm done

1189
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,940
I'm talking to all you fucking jabronis.

1190
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,380
I'm going to the rink and I'm not losing my skates this time.

1191
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,220
I'll tell you.

1192
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,060
- All right.

1193
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:18,880
Good luck Jacques.

1194
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,720
I have to pee.

1195
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,560
So I think you have an out to go skate.

1196
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,380
- Yeah.

1197
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,220
- Yeah.

1198
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:23,540
- I think it's time boys.

1199
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,460
- I think it's time.

1200
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,940
This has been the best part of my week.

1201
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,300
I love you so much Jacques.

1202
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,020
(laughing)

1203
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:31,540
I think the gays took this one.

1204
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:32,380
- Yeah.

1205
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,220
- I think straights, straights two.

1206
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,180
- I don't think Mike gets one.

1207
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,300
- I think, I think that again, Jacques beat all of us.

1208
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,140
- Should I shut up?

1209
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,340
Should I have been quieter?

1210
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,340
No, you're perfect.

1211
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
Oh, no, absolutely not.

1212
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,740
The non-binary one.

1213
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,980
Yet again.

1214
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,340
Non-binary supremacy.

1215
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,740
Almost unfair, I guess.

1216
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,140
Our genderless agenda is going to destroy America.

1217
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:58,620
All right, bye, y'all.

1218
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,780
Bye-bye.

1219
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,020
Bye.

1220
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,620
It was fun.

1221
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,900
Yeah, that was very fun.
