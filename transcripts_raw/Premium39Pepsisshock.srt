00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,700
God, I had another penis predicament.

43
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,660
- I had another penis predicament this morning.

44
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,460
- What do you mean penis predicament?

45
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,340
- I wore the same shorts that I did last night.

46
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,180
- Okay, the Grace Flit Pants challenge.

47
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,100
- To take out the trash.

48
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,940
- Yeah.

49
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,700
- To take out the trash and another lady saw my Lego

50
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
in my pants, dude.

51
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,980
(laughing)

52
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,000
Made full eye contact with it.

53
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,740
- Nice.

54
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,560
- His dad.

55
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,700
- But it was like a morning, I had a morning Lego though.

56
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,900
It was like, because I'm like 50/50.

57
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,100
Either I'm like the hardest I've ever been in the morning or my penis goes into my body

58
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
in the morning.

59
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Like I guess I don't have that problem.

60
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,560
It's like one of those optical illusions where you think the face is pointing towards you

61
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,500
but then you move to the side and it's going in.

62
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
No, I do.

63
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,780
You're like, wow, that's a three foot long penis and then you shift over like one degree

64
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,700
to the left and you can see there's just a giant hole in your pelvis.

65
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,340
It looked like I tried sewing my pants like a patch and I left a needle in my pants.

66
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,340
That's what it looked like.

67
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,340
It looked terrible, dude.

68
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,340
It was one of my all-time worst pieces.

69
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,340
Some ants were camping down there.

70
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,340
They raised a tent.

71
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,340
Yeah.

72
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
No.

73
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Yeah.

74
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,340
You live too close to a church.

75
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,340
Yeah, you got an ant camp down there.

76
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,340
So don't, okay.

77
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,900
I just want to come out and, I want to get ahead of this one.

78
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,220
I don't have ants in my pants.

79
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,500
Yeah, you do.

80
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,980
I do not have any ants.

81
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Explain, explain your dance.

82
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,260
Nowhere near my pants, dude.

83
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
I don't do a dance.

84
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Explain your dance.

85
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,900
I don't have any ants in my pants.

86
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,740
- Yeah.

87
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,900
- Okay, it's that simple.

88
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,540
None of them are from France.

89
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,780
- Okay, okay.

90
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,740
- You have ants in your pants?

91
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,580
- No.

92
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,660
- Yeah, you do?

93
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,100
I know we like to joke around,

94
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,500
but I don't have ants in my pants.

Gloves?

188
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,940
So you're telling me you flashed that old, that old Lego to the construction workers?

189
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,580
I probably, I probably flashed my little, my little church mouse to a...

190
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:47,340
construction worker this week yeah do they try to catcall you they took the

191
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,180
crane and they put it up to my window and they and then they're sitting on top

192
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,060
of each other with each of them having a pair of binoculars yeah yeah when you're

193
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,460
asleep they they bring the crane around through your window and they try to play

194
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,460
the claw game and jack you off in your sleep.

195
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
The crane's too big for my penis.

196
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,940
I've had the craziest dream ten nights in a row where a crane comes in my window and tries

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
to jack off my penis.

198
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
Pat, you're killing yourself there.

199
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,180
And here's the craziest part of the dream.

200
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,380
Caleb, you keep going like, your audio keeps cutting for me.

201
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
I don't know if it's my internet.

202
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
Oh, it's just for you.

203
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,380
Alright, it doesn't happen, it's not happening to me.

204
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,380
I'm perfect, dude.

205
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,380
Fuck.

206
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,380
It's okay.

207
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,740
- No, 'cause I haven't called Comcast yet to switch it over.

208
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,100
So my internet's been working,

209
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,500
but it's just gonna shut off one day.

210
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,220
- So you think that they're like slowly

211
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,620
like turning it off for a second

212
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,940
and then turning it back on?

213
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,780
- They're testing how much they'll notice.

214
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,380
- I don't think that's what they're doing.

215
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,100
- Why don't you just call them?

216
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,940
- Yeah, it's difficult--

217
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
- Are you somebody who doesn't do phone calls with people?

218
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,780
Like you don't wanna call--

219
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,780
- No, because I used my phone number to help my friend,

220
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,580
her phone, like she didn't have data for a little bit

221
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,260
or something like that, or like her phone wasn't working.

222
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,140
- I can tell this is gonna be a really good reason.

223
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,540
- And.

224
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,060
- Continue.

225
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,660
- No, I had to use, so I had to use my phone number

226
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,700
for Comcast, for her Comcast.

227
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,380
So my phone number is linked to her account.

228
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,060
So anytime that she needs to do stuff,

229
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,760
I have to do it for her.

230
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,600
Or I have to at least call for her.

231
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,820
- And so you can't call Comcast.

232
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,420
- Dude, this is, I'm on the edge of my seat here.

233
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,260
- Oh fuck.

234
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,080
- Pat.

235
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,580

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,660

239
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
Hold on, I gotta call Comcast.

240
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
Yeah, we're gonna call them right now.

241
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
I'm gonna call them right now.

242
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:09,980
The worst part of this is he's definitely talking into his mic right now, so we're just gonna have two overlapping audios.

243
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Oh, he's back!

244
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,980
I'm back. Dude, this sucks. I think they finally shut it off.

245
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
How are you talking to us right now?

246
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
I'm gonna give them a call.

247
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Who?

248
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm gonna give Comcast a call for you.

249
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,380
No, don't call them. I have to figure it out.

250
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
Don't worry, I got you.

251
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,380
No, he's calling them.

252
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
It's not linked to your phone number. It won't work.

253
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
No, it'll work.

254
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,380
We have a special relationship with Comcast.

255
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Don't call them.

256
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
Hold on, I need to find their customer service line.

257
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,380

258
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380
Don't even worry about it, okay? I'm gonna take care of it for you.

259
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Oh, no.

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
I'm gonna take care of it.

261
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,040
They're saying oh no about your internet or about me calling

262
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,360
Oh, he's gone again. Fuck dude. Don't worry. I'm handling it. Yeah

- I'll need a phone number or--

350
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,080
- No, it uses your phone number and then--

351
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360

352
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,240

353
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,080

- I think I'm fine.

359
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,600
- What service are you calling about?

360
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
- Internet.

361
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,760
- God, just don't.

362
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,640
- Sorry, I didn't get that.

363
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,200
- Internet. - Why are we doing,

364
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,760
Why are we doing this the whole episode? This is a premium.

365
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,260
*laughs*

366
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,680
I need...

367
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,880
The int- the internet.

368
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,380
*laughs*

369
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,420
I need to talk to somebody about the internet.

370
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:18,920
*laughs*

371
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,660
*laughs*

372
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,160
*laughs*

373
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,660
*laughs*

374
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,160
*laughs*

375
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,660
I need to-

376
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,160
*laughs*

377
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,660
*laughs*

378
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,300
You're attacking my friend!

379
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:25,800
*laughs*

380
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,520
Somebody...

381
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,020
*laughs*

382
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,200
in China is DDoSing my friend...

383
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,700
*laughs*

384
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,200
and I need you to put an end to this.

385
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,300
I need a firewall.

386
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,800
*laughs*

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,620
I need a firewall to protect my friend...

388
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,120
*laughs*

389
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,620
ASAP!

390
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,120
*laughs*

391
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,620
Don't...

392
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Don't you dare do this again!

393
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,620
Don't you fucking dare!

394
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,620
*laughing*

395
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,620
*laughing*

396
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,620
*laughing*

397
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,620
I'm gonna come to your home.

398
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,620
*laughing*

399
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
*laughing*

400
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
*laughing*

401
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
What are you-

402
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,620
I'm at your home!

403
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,620
*laughing*

404
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
*laughing*

405
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,620
You can say, "Add new service."

406
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
Add new service.

407
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Add new service to Patrick.

408
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
Add new service.

409
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
I'm just going to get you new internet, dude.

410
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,620
Don't worry about it.

411
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Don't!

412
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Ask us about Xfinity Mobile.

413
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
I won't.

414
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
Number one in customer satisfaction.

415
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,620
Skip.

416
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Skip this song.

417
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Skip.

418
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
In customer satisfaction index.

419
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
Skip button.

420
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,620
Hello?

421
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Spanish.

422
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
I don't speak Spanish.

423
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Yeah, dude is Spanish.

424
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,880
(laughing)

425
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,020
- For billing inquiries or technical support.

426
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,860
- It's doing it again.

427
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,680
- You broke her.

428
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,620
You broke her, dude.

429
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,460
She's going.

430
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,300
(laughing)

431
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,140
- Did I destroy you?

432
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,980
Did I win?

433
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,620
- If you are moving to a new address

434
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
and would like to move your services,

435
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,060
- Did I beat you?

436
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,580
- You beat the final boss, dude.

437
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,220
- To disconnect your services,

438
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,380
please press four.

439
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,220
- I'm giving up.

440
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,180
- Yeah.

441
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,020
- Yeah.

442
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,840
- I think it's good now.

443
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,500
- This is our first Fatwa in like a year.

444
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Comcast.

445
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah.

446
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Yeah, first one was very successful.

447
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Comcast.

448
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Yeah, the first one.

449
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Comcast, you might want to look back.

450
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,100
Yeah, you might want to look at some things on the computer that happened.

451
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,500
You might want to look up some videos on the internet that have been going around.

452
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Yeah.

453
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Yeah, Comcast, you're going to want to, it's a, you just made a very powerful enemy, I'll

454
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
say that much.

455
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
The fucking taps the FBI already has on Caleb's phone.

456
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Is he screaming at the Comcast robot?

457
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
China is DDoSing my friend!

458
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
*laughter*

459
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Dude, you're fucked.

460
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
*laughter*

461
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm already fucked, dude.

462
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
You were saying you were gonna attack them!

463
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
You said you were gonna go to their home.

464
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
I will. I'm looking up the Comcast

465
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
address right now.

466
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Just for fun.

467
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Don't say it over the

468
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
mic. I don't want to.

469
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, they bugged the mic actually.

470
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
*laughter*

471
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,900
- Do you think they're watching this right now?

472
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,060
- They listen to the podcast, dude, they subscribe.

473
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,100
- They definitely do.

474
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,980
- They have to, they're one of those people

475
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,080
with a racist name that we didn't want to read out.

476
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,140
- Ah, gotcha, they're the racists

477
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,980
who are infesting the fan base.

478
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,820
- Yeah.

479
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,140
- It's their fault.

480
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,500
- Yeah, I hate those racists.

481
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,620
- That didn't sound very convincing,

482
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,100
but why'd you say it like that?

483
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,020
- I hate them.

484
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,860
- Why are you winking?

485
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,980
- Why are you...

486
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,940
- I'm not winking.

487
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,580
- Why'd you wink again when you said that?

488
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
- Why'd you just wink?

489
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,100
Did you just wink?

490
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,500
- Why are you holding up a sign that says,

491
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,440
"I love the racists"?

492
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,620
- That's my internet's been glitching.

493
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,900
- Why are you showing us a DVD copy

494
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,180
of Louis seasons one through three?

495
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,140
- No, my internet's glitching right now

496
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,560
and you're seeing things because of the glitches.

497
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,200
- That's the Woody Allen collection on your bookshelf.

498
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,300
- No, it's not.

499
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,140
- Yeah, it is, dude.

500
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,020
But it's not movies.

501
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,740
It looks like it's a photo album.

502
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,100
Why did you just pull down your pants and show us the tattoo you have where it looks like

503
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,300
Jefferson Davis is riding your penis like a horse?

504
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,940
Cameron, how...

505
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,220
You can't explain your LOL swastika tattoo.

506
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Yes I can.

507
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,940
The tattoo artist said it was Japanese for love.

508
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,780
LOL means peace in India, actually.

509
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,340
It means lots of love.

510
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,380
And I wanted it four times.

511
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,660
I wanted it four times to make a symbol.

512
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:32,540
different orientation. Yeah. I think that's the first time that's ever happened. How did you

513
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,000
solve your internet crisis? No, it just started working again. So after this I

514
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,200
have to like finally do that. Yeah, I basically solved it by calling them it

515
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:52,520
seems like. Yeah. We are so sorry sir. Oh my god. We're installing a firewall. You're gonna have free internet for a whole year.

516
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,520
That's right. I wish I'd been alive during Hurricane Katrina. I could have stopped that with a phone call too.

517
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Yeah. I'm calling Harp in FEMA and I'm telling them.

518
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm 15. I'm 15, but if I was 16 and I'd been one years old, I would have called George Bush.

519
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,520
"Hey, Bush! Yeah, you already know who it is. Listen, all that water, you gotta knock it off."

520
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
You weren't 15 when Hurricane Katrina happened?

521
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
No. I'm 15 now.

522
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Oh, okay.

523
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Yeah.

524
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
We're all 15.

525
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,480
- I think it would have stopped every world tragedy

526
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,600
with a phone call.

527
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,120
- I would have stopped the World Trade Center

528
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,720
from falling with my hands.

529
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,560
- Listen, Osama, between you and me,

530
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't like the Towers much either.

531
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,620
They're a real eyesore.

532
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,000
I hate that they have become,

533
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,160
every mug and every fucking t-shirt with the skyline,

534
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,520
it's like, oh, look at the Towers.

535
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,760
- I hate seeing them in the Sopranos intro.

536
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,840
I hate seeing that.

537
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,740
- What about, you know, like a preschool or something?

538
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,440
- I feel like that would have been worse.

539
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,360
Preschool in like a lower-income neighborhood, you know those kids. There's nothing they're not gonna be anything who cares man

540
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,320
If you really just want numbers just just absolutely just blast them dude. I don't give a fuck

541
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,180
Just leave our towers be if I was at 9/11

542
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,700
I would have built the towers back from the rubble and I would have glued them back together. I would have said oh damn

543
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,040
Oh my god

544
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,460
Side of my Impala that ice cube was driving

545
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,160
Yeah

546
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,040
That's what I would have built it back like mine. I would have said listen. Yeah, I

547
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,720
Have minecraft I have minecraft on my computer. Yeah, just just step back Rudy Giuliani

548
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,960
Yeah, we're rolling back the server is it am I misremembering this or after shortly after 9/11 did Rudy Giuliani and George W

549
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
Bush play a game of King of the Hill on the rubble?

550
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,720
- What?

551
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,560
- What?

552
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,880
- Did they fight each other to stand on top

553
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,880
of the mountain of rubble?

554
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,420
- I don't know, I don't think they did that.

555
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,980
- You're thinking of Godzilla versus King Kong.

556
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,640
- Yeah, you're thinking of Godzilla and King Kong.

557
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,780
- You're thinking of aliens versus the predators.

558
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,800
- 'Cause Rudy Giuliani is an ape

559
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,520
and George Bush is a lizard person.

560
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,560
- Yeah, they're both a couple of monsters in my book.

561
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,840
- They're both aliens and predators if you ask me.

562
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,000
Did I ever, did I tell you when I saw Steely Dan in October, Donald Fagan, after he made

563
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that Me Too joke?

564
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What Me Too joke?

565
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know if I, I, uh...

566
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,720
You just assumed that we would remember a Me Too joke that Donald Fagan made at a show

567
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
that we weren't at?

568
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
No, I thought I told you about it.

569
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,240
It's funny that he won't explain that, but if his brother stubs his toe, he'll do 15

570
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,760
minutes of like, "Yeah, my brother stubbed my toe," and he actually has really weak toes,

571
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,520
which he runs in my family.

572
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,560
We all have weak toes.

573
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:48,440
But uh, fuckin, yeah, Donald Fagan said that the Dayanettes, the female backup singers

574
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,560
were gonna sing "Dirty Work" and then he was like "The beautiful Dayanettes, I feel weird

575
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,200
saying that, I feel like I'm gonna get me too'd.

576
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,440
Anyway, here's 'Dirty Work'" and then he left the stage and came back with a jacket cause

577
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,080
he was cold, and then as soon as he came back, cause he's fuckin old as shit now, and he

578
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,000
came back and he sits down at the piano and he's like "Halloween's comin up, huh?

579
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
I think I'm gonna go as Rudy Giuliani. Pretty scary, huh?

580
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,560
Dude, owned. That rocks, dude.

581
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,120
Dude, fucking awesome. What about the Nanette singing?

582
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,360
Uh-huh. You know?

583
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,080
I don't wanna do your dirty work, mate. No.

584
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,160
No, I'm not gonna do your dirty work anymore. I don't think I've ever heard dirty work.

585
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,960
I can't contribute. I was more setting a...

586
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,680
Times are hard, you're afraid. You're afraid.

587
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,960
Yep, keep going. To pay the fee.

588
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Do you find yourself somebody?

589
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm a dillywad to do your dirty work?

590
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
No. Oh no.

591
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Can't do the I say.

592
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
You're a cunt to do my dirty work.

593
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Do you think she

594
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Listen, look at me Patrick.

595
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Do you think that Hannah Gadsby

596
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
is Crocodile Dundee?

597
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Is that what you honestly

598
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
believe in your heart?

599
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Do you think that's the same guy?

600
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Cause I think it's a different guy.

601
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
They all sound like Australia.

602
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,360
They all sound like Crocodile Dundee down there.

603
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
No.

604
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I don't think so.

605
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,520
Yeah, some of them are like, "Noooo!"

606
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,360
And some of them are like, "Noooo!"

607
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,800
And then some of them are like, "Fly to the Concord" style.

608
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,680
Yeah, "Fly to the Concord" style motherfuckers.

609
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,560
I think that's what "Dannette" was, or "Nannette."

610
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah.

611
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
It was song parodies.

612
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,280
It was loose song parodies.

613
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,440
I still haven't seen it.

614
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,480
I think I watched like the first couple minutes of it and I was just like, "Nannette."

615
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Well, let's get into it.

616
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,960
It's a year and a half old. Let's break it down. It's a year and a half old. God. That's fucking 20 years ago. Yeah

617
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,900
Yeah, it feels like it came out in 1999 and she had a she came out in 1989

618
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:49,620
She had a high top fade like kid and play. Yeah, she looked like she looked like Gerald from Hey Arnold. Yeah

619
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,160
2020 is so crazy. Can you guys believe that 9/11 happened this year?

620
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,800
Wow, it feels so it feels like it was almost 19 years ago. Yeah, but in fact it happened this year. Yeah. Yeah

621
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,880
How do we celebrate murder hornets and and and kovat everything's nobody

622
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:14,580
One of the murder hornets I think they found like a hive of them. No. Yeah in your ass. Yeah, that's right

623
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,920
So I mean they found them

624
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:23,400
Yeah, they were actually they weren't able to get him out. No, they're still there. They weren't able to know they weren't able to get

625
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,800
About they're doing they're chewing out the insides of my router right now. Actually, they're stinging in my router is inside your ass

626
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,640
- Yeah.

627
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,480
- Is that why your internet's so bad?

628
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,800
- That's how he remains connected everywhere he goes.

629
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,360
He had a wifi router implanted into his asshole.

630
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,280
- Yep, it also gets cable, so.

631
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,120
- Whoa.

632
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,960
- Uh-huh.

633
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,120
- I just learned about penis implants.

634
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,560
- Yeah, like the silicone ones?

635
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,400
- They have ones now.

636
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,840
- Wait, are you thinking, are you, like,

637
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,600
extenders or the guys who inject it with legs?

638
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,240
- Extendo clip on the penis.

639
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,800
- Extendo clip on your penis?

640
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:06,480
clip on your penis? I'm talking about the banana clip lego dude. They have ones now that you they

641
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,720
take off your penis and then they add a sleeve of plastic and then they put your penis back on.

642
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,720
What does that do? It makes your penis plastic. It's so you can become a toy. Oh my god. Is it

643
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,320
Medical-grade plastic or just like

644
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,080
Yeah

645
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
Water bottles full of BPA

646
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,160
Harvesting a harvest. There's a little bit of particle board whenever a sea turtle chokes on a six-pack on six-pack rings

647
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
They melt them down and make them into a new penis

648
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:50,280
That's how he got that's how the creator of the implant got that idea he saw a sea turtle choking on plastic

649
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
He's like, "I'll give you some plastic to choke on."

650
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
[Laughter]

651
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I'm putting that on my dick, dude.

652
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Yeah, and then he created a penis extender.

653
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
He wanted to fuck a turtle.

654
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
And here's the best part, it only comes in--

655
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Would you fuck a turtle?

656
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
What?

657
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Yeah, no.

658
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm not gonna say my answer 'til I hear yours.

659
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Did you know sea turtles--

660
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
I would.

661
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
I would fuck a turtle shell full of peanut butter.

662
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
[Laughter]

663
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I wouldn't fuck a turtle.

664
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I was just saying, I was just asking.

665
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
asking.

666
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,040
Well a sea turtle or a land turtle?

667
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,120
You kind of hopped on that a little too quick.

668
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,760
I mean I'm just an inventor.

669
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,680
Is that so wrong?

670
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,680
This world is so anti-science, pro-religion and god nowadays that you can't even put a

671
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
hot dog in a cell.

672
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Fuck a turtle full of peanut butter.

673
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,680
No, not a turtle full of peanut butter.

674
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I don't want to... that's messy.

675
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,440
I'm saying a dead turtle's bone.

676
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,120
The turtle is part of the shell.

677
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I didn't realize that.

678
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
- Turtle's not part of the shell.

679
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,800
- If you take the shell off it--

680
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,520
- I saw a cross section of a tortoise.

681
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,920
- You take the shell out the turtle,

682
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,880
you can't take the turtle out of the shell.

683
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,760
- In Cannibal Holocaust, they take the turtle off the,

684
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,040
the shell off the turtle and all the guts come out.

685
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,920
- It's like the third time we've talked about that.

686
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,760
- About the part--

687
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,920
- About Cannibal Holocaust turtle.

688
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,960
- All right, are we gonna start keeping track

689
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,400
of how many times people mention stuff

690
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,080
on the podcast, Patrick?

691
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,920
- I don't know.

692
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,280
- We're gonna start counting that?

693
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,120
- Yeah.

694
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,400
- We need to start being mean to Pat,

695
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,000
like the people on the subreddit.

696
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,820
- No.

697
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
- Yeah, being mean to people doesn't mean that people

698
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,220
are gonna watch. - My whole family thinks

699
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,060
Caleb's already too mean to me.

700
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,900
- Well, yeah, they're your family.

701
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,700
- It's so funny that your whole family listens

702
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,660
to the podcast.

703
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,640
- I know.

704
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,300
- That's so sick, dude.

705
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,740
Will they hear this right now?

706
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,700
- Probably.

707
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,660
- What's up, mama?

708
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,500
How you doing?

709
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,260
(laughing)

710
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,580
You're welcome, by the way, for saving your brother's life.

711
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,780
- It's more likely-- - Or your son's life.

712
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,060
- Your brother.

713
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,900
- Yeah, what?

714
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,140
(laughing)

715
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,260
- If it wasn't for me, Pat, he'd be in a gutter right now.

716
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
If it wasn't for me, Patrick would be your brother.

717
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
He'd be stuck in a storm drain.

718
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Oh, okay. It happened to the... the internet thing happened to my neighbor, too.

719
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,260
So, we're good. It was just a hole.

720
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,260
So I don't have to get that shit fixed for another week.

721
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Does your neighbor text you?

722
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
Do you guys hang out?

723
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Well, my... one of... like, Dom's best friend lives in the building.

724
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Oh, okay.

725
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Yeah.

726
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
Nice. So it was a whole outage.

727
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Yeah, I guess it was an outage.

728
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
Yeah, I guess it was an outage.

729
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
But yeah, my whole... it's more likely my brother's gonna hear this, not my mom.

730
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:25,380
not my mom. What's up Rodney? What up Rod? Big Rod. It's good to see you buddy. My brother

731
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:40,420
Big Rodney. Big Rodney. He's 6'8". And he's 10 years old. My cousin Timmy is 6'8". He's

732
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,420
He's one of those really tall guys that is injured all the time because he's too tall.

733
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,620
Do you guys ever know a guy who has a cousin or a nephew or something and he can't stop

734
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,620
talking about how big he is?

735
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
No.

736
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
You don't know what I mean?

737
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,820
Where it's like, "Oh, I have this, my nephew, I mean this kid's a hoss.

738
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,140
He's 6'5, he's 10 years old, he's headed straight to the league."

739
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,140
You don't know anybody like that?

740
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
Yeah, that's always so funny to me.

742
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,540
Yeah, that's how my uncles would talk about my 6'8 cousin.

743
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,100
- My six foot eight cousin.

744
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,180
- Of your cousin's growth.

745
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,020
Well, if you have a big cousin, that's the,

746
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,660
see if everybody in your family was six foot eight,

747
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,900
nobody would give a fuck.

748
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,720
- Right.

749
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
- But you have a six foot eight cousin,

750
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,340
it becomes kind of the only thing

751
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,900
that your, that uncles care about.

752
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,100
- When you get together, yeah.

753
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,020
- Uncles love big nephews.

754
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,500
- Uncles love, yeah, a big kid.

755
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,860
- Uncles heart big nephews.

756
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,120
(laughing)

757
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,940
That's just the truth of the matter, dude.

758
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,780
That's in an uncle's blood.

759
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,620
- Yep.

760
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,300
- That's in their DNA genes.

761
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,840
Yeah, uncles love to talk about like how

762
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,420
like the football season's going.

763
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,620
And uncles literally will forget a niece's name.

764
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,780
Yeah, uncles will be like, "Oh, Pete!"

765
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,100
Hand it over to what the fucker over there.

766
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,620
"And a girl, girl Pete."

767
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,460
You knows.

768
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,020
Your name, you know your name.

769
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,500
You look so much like your mother.

770
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,340
You-ness.

771
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,340
You-ness.

772
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,180
You-ness.

773
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Eustace!

774
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,180
Girl...

775
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,180
Girl...

776
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,180
Girl...

777
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
Girl...

778
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Girl...

779
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,180
Manette.

780
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,180
Manette.

781
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,180
Yeah.

782
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,180
My cousin was really big.

783
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I know, I think you would like this.

784
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,940
I just saw this comedy special.

785
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,940
It's called Manette.

786
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
It's about a woman.

787
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
You might want to check this out.

788
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,940
You'll like it.

789
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,940
You'll like it.

790
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,940
It's about girls.

791
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,940
I don't know what it's about.

792
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,540
There's an awesome plot twist about 30 minutes in, too.

793
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,460
I think you're really going to like it.

794
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
Oh, right.

795
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,060
So you've been going to the mall lately?

796
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
That's great.

797
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,060
Alright, Pete, get over here.

798
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,060
I'm gonna fuck you up.

799
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,060
Take your clothes off.

800
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,060
Take your pants off.

801
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,060
You know there's a no pants house.

802
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,060
Let's get you oiled up.

803
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
Inspired by the Japanese.

804
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
I drew a big ring on the living room floor.

805
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
And we can cover it with a rug.

806
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Hey, what are you doing?

807
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
What are you doing in my house with your clothes on?

808
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Get in the bathroom and put your fucking singlet on.

809
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
Put your singlet on.

810
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Put your big sumo diaper on.

811
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
We're wrestling today.

812
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
It's 2 p.m.

813
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,060

00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,060

815
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,060
It's 2 p.m.

816
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,060

817
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060

00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,060

821
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
Come on with family!

822
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,060
Put your singlet on!

823
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,060
Put your big sumo diaper on!

824
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
It's 2pm, what are you doing?

825
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
It's Thanksgiving!

826
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,060
It's Thanksgiving!

827
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,060
Get your fucking sumo clothes on!

828
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
What are you fucking doing?

829
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,060
When you're at Uncle Ralph's house, you know it's sumo.

830
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,060
Oh, I hate it. I hate going to Uncle Ralph's house.

831
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
I hate having to throw the sand for respect.

832
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Uh-huh.

833
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,060
I hate having to like...

834
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
I hate when he gets those highlights in him.

835
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,480
I've seen him. I hate when we have to do a fire dance. Yeah. Hey, Uncle. Where's the rest of the family?

836
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,180
Oh, I sabotaged their cars. They're not showing up for a few hours

837
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:44,080
We're gonna get some really good wrestling in Pete. You're going pro. You're gonna hit the pro American sumo wrestling market. I

838
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,040
found this

839
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,400
Working at the supermarket and he's gonna come over in about 10 minutes and you're gonna beat the shit out of them, dude

840
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,500
They should have an American sumo wrestling league like the they probably like it should be like X. Yeah, they do

841
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,860
- I do, you know what it's called?

842
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,500
The freakin' line to order at McDonald's.

843
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,800
- Oh, there we go.

844
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,640
- Wow.

845
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,480
- Yeah.

846
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,880
- Hey. - Wow.

847
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
- Hey, Big Pete, I don't know,

848
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,520
I saw someone at the grocery store today,

849
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,760
he might've been like six foot 10.

850
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,600
You think you could take him?

851
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
- I think you're not that big anymore, Pete.

852
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,880
- You think you, yeah, I don't know.

853
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,360
I think I'm gonna go be his uncle now.

854
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,760
- I think I'm gonna pick you up

855
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,640
'cause I know you don't even have your learner's permit yet.

856
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,320
Actually, fuck it, you can drive.

857
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,840
We're headed to the grocery store.

858
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,080
You're gonna kill this guy.

859
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,520
There can only be one big guy in town.

860
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,720
- Look, I know the guy, I know the butcher.

861
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,280
He's gonna let us go into the freezer.

862
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,360
We're gonna have an ice cold sumo match.

863
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,600
(laughing)

864
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,440
- Ice sumo.

865
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,400
- Look, I've combined-- - That's the American

866
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,560
sumo league.

867
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,600
It's 32 degrees. - Cold sumo.

868
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
- It's cross nations. - Frozen sumo.

869
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,920
Combined I've combined curling and sumo and we're gonna watch you fucking 400 pounds six foot eight body

870
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,840
Slide across the floor of the butcher's meat closet

871
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,780
We've cleared out we've cleared out a big section

872
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:15,840
We're gonna give you some we're gonna feed you some raw steaks. You know in Japan they call this football

873
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,880
Just plowing is his pickup truck through the front of the supermarket just where's the big guy?

874
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:34,480
Where's that big guy I saw a few weeks ago

875
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,600
Sir, I don't

876
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,120
Give me the biggest guy in the store

877
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Big guy trench coat really really a really high voice trying to buy alcohol

878
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Kind of boyish features

879
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,680
It kind of looked like a little guy in the face, but then a big guy in the body

880
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,000
Where is that big guy? I think he might have had that Beetlejuice disease

881
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The one with the you when you get the shrunken head

882
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,400
But your body's the same size and your head's got like a big ponytail. I think he might have had that

883
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm talking Beetlejuice from the movie not from the whack pack. I know what I'm dying. I oh, I know the whack pack

884
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,200
I've recruited a few fucking people for I would stir its whack back. Did you see that beetle juice is suicidal?

885
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:30,160
What what dude he came out and did an interview and he was like well not gonna do an impression

886
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,480
Yeah, you know what he sounds like and he was like

887
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,660
Yeah, pretty sad pretty sad thought about thought about ending it all oh

888
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,440
Do you know just come on?

889
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,460
Well, I mean when you're fucking it when it wouldn't a fucking

890
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,860
Guy who makes people ride the sibyan turns you into a circus freak of course you can be fucking suicidal

891
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
I think he was born a circus freak dude I

892
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:00,280
Don't think I don't think I'm a normal life look like he could have led a normal life

893
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,640
You think so yeah, I think he could have been like people making a box and shit

894
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,720
No, he could have just like worked it like the store or something, but like maybe you're right

895
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
He could have worked at the grocery store

896
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,600
Nah, dude, he likes it. He gets to like fucking...

897
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,820
I think he...

898
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,020
That's true. He was in True Crime. He was in True Crime Streets of LA.

899
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,020
I think he fucked Pamela Anderson.

900
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,420
Yeah.

901
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,920
I believe that.

902
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,420
I think that happened.

903
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,700
Yeah, I was there. I set him up.

904
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,200
Yeah.

905
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,700
Yeah.

906
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,200
Yeah, I said, "Pamela, I know this guy."

907
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,800
He's like a basketball player type. I think you guys would get along really great. He's an athlete.

908
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Yeah.

909
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,040
He was a pro boxer for a little bit. He's done some radio.

910
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,700
He's in a pack, you know like the rat pack. He's in like then, you know, they'd like the rat pack and the brat pack

911
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:54,600
He's in like one of those things. He's kind of looking up. All right. Look I you're gonna have to go into this trick room though

912
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,360
It's the only room I have

920
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,720

926
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:01,800
Conversation I don't want to listen to you scream at a robot why why that's kind of because is already buddy because I don't do

927

928
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,060
That's true. This is the only time I get to talk to my friends, right?

929
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:15,500
That is true. Listen and this and playing DS games online. You just right you just catch up then. Yeah. All right

930
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
What are you guys doing?

931
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,040
I showed my penis to four people this morning three people last night and then on Wednesday to two more people

932
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,240
I found a girl in town. You're found a urine

933
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,800
You I found a European mouse. Yeah

934
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,920
I'm not Australian. I'm not Australian. I would not pee in my mouth.

935
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
I found a new place to pee, guys.

936
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,920
I found a new hole in my body where pee goes.

937
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Do you think Australian people pee in their own mouths because their toilet's flushed the wrong way?

938
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Yeah.

939
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Yeah, and the pee comes out the wrong way. It comes out of the mouth.

940
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,920
Yeah, the pee comes out counterclockwise.

941
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
It comes out the balls first.

942
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,240
first. Do you think Australian people watch... Other than normal American people where their

943
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,640
pee goes out the balls last. You think it touches the balls last? Yeah. No, the pee comes out

944
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,320
the balls... The spout on your balls? The pee just taps the balls as it goes by like you're

945
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,080
walking the hot dog way and tagging the top of the doorway. You don't have the spout? It's

946
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:24,040
just like I was here, you know? Showing off. You guys are... You don't have the spout on

947
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,480
I'm gonna drain your balls just as soon as you fucking sign that dotted line for our marriage

948
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
certificate buddy, because I'm saving myself.

949
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,640
No, because no, you didn't want a prenup.

950
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,000
You will not take these from me.

951
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,600
I want some pre-nut in my mouth.

952
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,080
I'm gonna touch your little prenup.

953
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,560
You have to sign a prenup because I don't want these gone.

954
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,040
I want you to sign my peanut.

955
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
How about that?

956
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
How about that?

957
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,040
I want you to come over, I'm gonna get you a sharpie, you're gonna sign my peanut.

958
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,040
You're gonna do an Andre the Giant, you're gonna stand there and go, "Would anybody like a peanut?"

959
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
Yeah, I'm gonna give you my peanut.

960
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Hey listen, on the TV I was watching the Princess Bride and I saw a guy on there who's a little bit bigger than you.

961
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
A little bit bigger than you, I'm gonna say.

962
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
We need to figure out how to get you into the TV.

963
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Look, I got this PlayStation VR thing.

964
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,040
No, Oscar, look, look on the TV, he's only like, you know, 6 or 8 inches tall.

965
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,540
Yeah, but look at him compared to the other guys.

966
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,540
Well, but they're, see, they're like 4, 4, 3 inches tall.

967
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,040
No, they're just far away.

968
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,540
I mean, you got him, you got him standing up.

969
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
That's cause the TV's outside and we're sitting in the living room

970
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,540
cause I moved everything out of the living room for him to make room for the sumo ring.

971
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,540
So, congrats.

972
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,040
Hey, look, Wallace Shawn's pretty fucking tall.

973
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,040
I mean, look at this guy.

974
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
I don't know, that guy, that guy's a, that guy's a little bit bigger than him.

975
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,040
There's this little guy, I think his name is Gromit, but then this guy Wallace is pretty big, you know, comparatively.

976
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
I don't know, like it doesn't, I mean...

977
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Uncle, he's standing on all fours.

978
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
But like, he sits around and eats cheese all the time.

979
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Hey look, he's standing on all fours, he's standing on all fours though.

980
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Look, if he stood up on two legs, he'd probably be a little bit taller.

981
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Look at how small those crackers look next to him, I mean, Jesus Christ.

982
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Look, he's on the moon, he's like...

983
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
You can see the curvature of the moon, that's how big he is.

984
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:23,040
is

985
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,960
seen this movie honey I shrunk the kids look how fucking big this Rick Moranis

986
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,980
guy is okay look he's compared to his kids we're gonna get you to fight this

987
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:44,100
guy all right I found his address between his big his big nephew and just

988
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:51,640
any tall guy you could find yeah I'm flying you out to China you're gonna

989
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,640
to fight Yao Ming. One round, feet only. It's his rule.

990
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,520
Look, Rick Moranis was tall in Honey I Shrunk the Kids, but look at him next to the rest

991
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,520
of these Ghostbusters. I think something's wrong with my TV.

992
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,000
Bill Murray might be pretty big. Oh fuck.

993
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Yeah, I tried to schedule a fight with you and Bill Murray, but no one would believe

994
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:24,500
me. Harold Ramis, technically the biggest, but he passed away. May he rest in peace.

995
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:30,280
We're going to dick up his bones and you're going to punch him. Just the proof that you

996
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,000
can do it. Digging up Andre the Giant's bones and you're going to dominate him. Okay, you

997
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,520
understand me? You're going to get on top of him and you're going to jump around. I tried

998
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,040
to get Dan Aykroyd, but he was too busy getting sucked off by a ghost. You're going to fight

999
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,160
Harold Ramis's bones. You're fighting Leslie Jones and it's not gonna be

1000
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,280
televised. We need to make sure it's not televised. If it's televised you will go

1001
00:42:52,280 --> 00:43:00,840
to jail. We'll just say you're doing some Andy Kaufman thing. That would be funny if Andy Kaufman came back.

1002
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,080
You know if he picked a Leslie Jones type out of the audience to fight and she just

1003
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,800
just threw him out a window. She just ate him one bite. There was one fight where

1004
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,800
he lost I think. Was it to a big girl? I think so. Wouldn't have been me dude I would have.

1005
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,160
Yeah, because you're a little girl. You're a big girl. You're a little girl. Put on your

1006
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,280
big girl pants. Nah, I don't have any girl pants. Girls wear dresses. But I'm also not

1007
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,500
a girl so I don't have a dress. You don't have anything? Yeah, I don't have a dress.

1008
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,880
If I did it'd be made out of dollars because I'm so rich too. Oh, I just realized there

1009
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,760
- There was a, I think that guy's dead now,

1010
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,320
but there used to be this guy in Nashua,

1011
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,880
it was this store called Dollar Bills,

1012
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,600
and it was this guy who just bought everything wholesale

1013
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,440
from other--

1014
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,900
- It's like a store almost.

1015
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,740
- Yeah, it's like a store, but he would buy--

1016
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,880
- You buy things wholesale, you sell them for a markup.

1017
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,840
- No, no, he would buy things using money and dollar bills.

1018
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,680
That's why they called the store that.

1019
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,940
- It made no sense at all.

1020
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,760
Yeah, he would buy things, he would buy drinks

1021
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,440
on a big pallet, right?

1022
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,320
He would buy a ton of 'em, and then he would sell them

1023
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,520
to you for like two or three dollars each.

1024
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,360
- Damn it.

1025
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:10,300
- No, he would buy things that didn't sell at other stores,

1026
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,740
and then it would just be a warehouse store like that.

1027
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,580
- Oh yeah.

1028
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
- His whole thing was he wore an umbrella hat

1029
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,100
that had little dollar bills that would hang off of it.

1030
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,940
- Whoa.

1031
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,560
- And I thought he was the biggest celebrity on earth

1032
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,360
when I was six, and then my mom met him.

1033
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,220
My mom met him at a flea market,

1034
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,880
and I was like, "Holy shit, it's a dollar bill!"

1035
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,200
And he gave me a hat.

1036
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,880
He gave me one of his umbrella hats.

1037
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,720
- Whoa. - No way.

1038
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,300
- Do you still have it?

1039
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,140
- No. - Why not?

1040
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,540
I broke that shit. I broke that shit like immediately.

1041
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,340
I have a fucking huge head. Even as a kid I had a big head.

1042
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,340
So you broke the hat by just putting it on your head?

1043
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,840
And I probably, I was not good at keeping my toys. All my toys would break.

1044
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,340
That's a powerful head, dude.

1045
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Yeah.

1046
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:53,640
If it can't even, if, if, can't even handle an adult hat as a child, you're the chosen one.

1047
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,440
Mm-hmm.

1048
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,940
Yeah. There's a crown somewhere in like some fucked up-

1049
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,840
Hey nephew, I've been listening to this podcast and there's this guy who could break a hat with just his head.

1050
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,240
We're gonna get you wrestling this fucking idiot.

1051
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
They call him the Hammerhead!

1052
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,240
[Laughter]

1053
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
He must be pretty tall.

1054
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
He's gotta be pretty tall.

1055
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
He's breaking heads with his head.

1056
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,240
Oh my god.

1057
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,240
I feel like my head is proportionate to somebody who is like...

1058
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,240
6 inches bigger than me.

1059
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Your head's gotten bigger, dude.

1060
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
It's gotten bigger since I've known you.

1061
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
It's from all this HGH I've been taking.

1062
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
It's from all the knowledge you've been building up in there.

1063
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,240
All this knowledge and this HGH.

1064
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
I've been taking HGH

1065
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:50,240
a

1066
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,840
head right now like he's having like a epiphany I he's never read a book yeah

1067
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,140
- no I read a book - wires are touching in his head right now that have never read

1068
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:10,280
I read oh you know what my dad was a big dog a little dog you say you're dead it's

1069
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:17,360
a it's John Glazer's John Glazer's my dead dad was in ZZ top that's not the

1070
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
That's the last book you read?

1071
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,360
That's the last book I read, yeah.

1072
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Wow.

1073
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Whoa, dude.

1074
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,920
How long ago is that?

1075
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,920
That book is mostly pictures.

1076
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,320
What was the last book you read, Caleb?

1077
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,320
Moby Dick.

1078
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
I don't like to read.

1079
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,320
I'd rather have an audiobook.

1080
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,440
You didn't finish it.

1081
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,440
What happens on the last page?

1082
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,440
Everybody dies.

1083
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1084
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,320
No, I read, fuck, what is this book called?

1085
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,720
I had to read it from my Latinx literature class.

1086
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,720
Latinx.

1087
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,220
Latinx literature.

1088
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,220
It's called like...

1089
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,960
He's freaking out right now.

1090
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,980
No, it's got a fucking name.

1091
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,980
It's about like these migrant workers who work on like a...

1092
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,300
This is the most active I've seen Patrick on a video call ever.

1093
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
He's trying to think of a book.

1094
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:08,400
He's literally using every part of his body to remember the name of a book.

1095
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,920
It's like these like migrant workers and they work on a boat and there's bad conditions and

1096
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
it's a new...

1097
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
Moby Dick.

1098
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,920
bad conditions.

1099
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Uh...

1100
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
It's about these migrant workers.

1101
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
And there's actually bad conditions on the boat they work on.

1102
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
In the book there's bad book...

1103
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
There's conditions that are books.

1104
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
Bad some things happen to...

1105
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
in the boat?

1106
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
And they're Latinx, I think.

1107
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
Oh my god, what's it called?

1108
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
And it's right next to him and it's called

1109
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,920
Latinx Workers on a Boat with a Bad Condition.

1110
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
It's called I'm on a Boat,

1111
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
the book.

1112
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,920
It was on my mom's Kindle. I can look this up.

1113
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
Oh my god. You don't have to look it up,

1114
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,920
Pat. You really don't. I don't think it's going to do anything for anybody.

1115
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,920
No, I have to prove that I read a book. This is the last book I read.

1116
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,920
The Vegetarian by Han Kang or Han Kong.

1117
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Han Kong.

1118
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,920
It's 10 best books. Fuck, I don't know my mom's Amazon, Pat.

1119
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,920
I can't believe that you're just trying to...

1120
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Just don't worry about it, Pat. We can move on. We can do something else.

1121
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,920
We'll do another episode about it. We'll do a whole hour.

1122
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
You can describe the plot and stuff. Get off your phone.

1123
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
It's important to have this fisheye lens up on Patrick when we're recording because we can see...

1124
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,920
That's right.

1125
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Immediately he moved a hand to his penis.

1126
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,160
(laughing)

1127
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,600
- I thought about opening this up,

1128
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,720
just showing you guys my little spike

1129
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,120
and just so you guys could see how little my wiener looks.

1130
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,740
- I've seen your penis.

1131
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,580
I've seen your penis before.

1132
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,000
- No, but in these shorts specifically,

1133
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,200
it's looking, I mean it's dire, dude.

1134
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,680
- Things are pretty, yeah.

1135
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,440
- Like it's not looking good.

1136
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,280
Nobody's checking me out, you know?

1137
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,120
- Well you never know, dude.

1138
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,840
Some people could like that kind of thing.

1139
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,760
- Normally I like jack off a little bit

1140
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,120
before I walk out of the apartment,

1141
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,960
just so when people see my--

1142
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:11,780
- I got rid of the Kindle app.

1143
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,620
- Well, people normally--

1144
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,000
(laughing)

1145
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,800
Normally people see your big bald head--

1146
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,160
- I'm never gonna know what that fucking book is called.

1147
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,860
- Normally, Caleb, people see your big bald head

1148
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,480
with the cut on the back of it from falling out of bed

1149
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,240
and they go, "Oh, he has the biggest penis ever

1150
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,560
"on the top of his body."

1151
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,160
(laughing)

1152
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,000
- Thank you for saying that.

1153
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,920
- Oh, no, 'cause that was the second to last book I read.

1154
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,860
'Cause then the last one was some Juno Diaz book.

1155
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,200
That was the last one we read in class.

1156
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
That's the kid from Spy Kids.

1157
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Oscar Wow?

1158
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,200
Oscar Whoa?

1159
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,200
Oscar Wee-oo?

1160
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Nowadays they call that Oscar Hit the Whoa.

1161
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,200
No, and then after that there was some fucking

1162
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,200
magical realism book.

1163
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,200
You've never read any of these books?

1164
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,200
I read it! I read it!

1165
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
I read the whole thing.

1166
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Books for class definitely don't count.

1167
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Books for class don't count and the last book I read was My Dead Dad was in ZZ Top.

1168
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Yeah.

1169
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
I'm writing a book right now.

1170
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,200
I'm writing a manifesto.

1171
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
God, I should...

1172
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Don't say that.

1173
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
Should I read more? I don't know.

1174
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
It's my 10,000 follower manifesto.

1175
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
When I hit 10,000 I'm releasing my manifesto.

1176
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,200
Why should you read more?

1177
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Because you look at your phone 23 hours a day.

1178
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,200
No, I don't.

1179
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,200
Yeah, dude. You're like...

1180
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,200
I read articles.

1181
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,200
What's the last article you read?

1182
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
You read clickable articles.

1183
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,200
A Vulture article doesn't fucking count either.

1184
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,620
- Like a magazine.

1185
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,720
(laughing)

1186
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,180
- Yeah, okay, that counts.

1187
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,500
- Okay, then I'll give you that.

1188
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,420
- A Thrasher article doesn't count,

1189
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,740
a Mad Magazine article, a cracked article.

1190
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,340
Yeah, I'm actually quite a reader.

1191
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,700
I'm quite the reader.

1192
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,140
- Reading the words that says on a shirt,

1193
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,540
it's an article of clothing,

1194
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:52,940
but it doesn't count as an article, okay?

1195
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,000
So you can't say The Exorcist,

1196
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,100
the shirt you're wearing right now,

1197
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,280
doesn't count. - I don't need to read.

1198
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,520
- I think you do.

1199
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,360
- You should read.

1200
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,140
- I think you would be a better person.

1201
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,540
Patrick's faking his own death now to avoid reading.

1202
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,540
I don't either.

1203
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,540
[Laughter]

1204
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,540
Oh, he's turning into a pig again.

1205
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,540
It'd be funny if Pat read, like, one book and it killed him.

1206
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,540
I read the Transformation!

1207
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,540
I read fucking Kafka. I read that fucking...

1208
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,540
Metamorphosis?

1209
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,540
I read the bug one. The Metamorphosis.

1210
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,540
I read the back of the Transformers DVD, you're right.

1211
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,540
It's the Metamorphosis, that's what it's called.

1212
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,540
Yeah, the Transformation.

1213
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,540
The Transformation? I don't think you read it.

1214
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,540
I read it. I read it.

1215
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,540
Yeah, I read Moldy Dick.

1216
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,540
[laughter]

1217
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,540
I did.

1218
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,540
It's just the facts.

1219
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,540
I read The Catcher in the Guy.

1220
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,540
[laughter]

1221
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,540
I read The Street.

1222
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
I read that book, The Street.

1223
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,540
I read My Son Also Rises.

1224
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,540
[laughter]

1225
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,540
I was thinking it'd be funny to tell somebody like,

1226
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,540
like tell your son,

1227
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,540
like, uh, listen,

1228
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:04,100
If I kill myself, I want you to know, it was not me,

1229
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,340
it was like the government.

1230
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,660
- It was Ernest Hemingway.

1231
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,940
- It was Ernest Hemingway.

1232
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,500
No, it was the government.

1233
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,700
If I died in a parent suicide, it was not me.

1234
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,620
I have no suicidal tendencies or ideations.

1235
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,960
It's just, it was the government.

1236
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,280
And then like the next day, died,

1237
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,500
like jacking off, doing asphyxiation.

1238
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,220
And he walks in and he's like,

1239
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,740
why would the CIA do this?

1240
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:33,620
They hated my dad so much they made it look like he was jacking off.

1241
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh the CIA putting gay porn on my dad's computer.

1242
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,580
Yeah.

1243
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:46,580
I read Huckleberry Qui-Gon Jinn.

1244
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:52,860
Dude, we need to start a book.

1246
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,860

00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,820
I was gonna read some of his books.

1252
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,780
I don't know who that is.

1253
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,260
I did, I did genuinely, I was gonna get into,

1254
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,660

1255
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,560
and it was very funny.

1256
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,100
And I was gonna start reading his books.

1257
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,740
I was gonna go to the public library,

1258
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,020
the Boston Public Library and get a card.

1259
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,900
No, that was not a transaction.

1260
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,740
Did you guys realize?

1261
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,380
No, I was gonna do it and then like.

1262
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,900
You read the script for The Mask

00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,540
and you were like, this is a book

1264
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,060
and I can't wait to see what's next

1265
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,800
from this young up and coming author.

1266
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,640
- Jim Carrey.

1267
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,140
- Yeah, Jim Carrey.

1268
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,220
- You guys realize that, I just realized that

1269
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:07,360
Stephen King and Stephen Hawking have almost the same name.

1270
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,060
You could just add Haw.

1271
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,460
- And Stephen Hofstetter.

1272
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,500
- Also the same.

1273
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,460
- He's also has three geniuses.

1274
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,960
- And King Stephen, the king of the castle

1275
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,700
from medieval times.

1276
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,820
- Oh my God.

1277
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:24,300
- Stephen Hofstetter brutally destroys Stephen Hawking

1278
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,980
on Epstein's Island.

1279
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,460
Dude, I just remembered this.

1280
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,500
Stephen Hawking heckling Steve Hofstetter.

1281
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:37,340
How about you tell some jokes?

1282
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,340
Next.

1283
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,340
Next.

1284
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,700
How about you tell some jokes?

1285
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,460
Stop dogging, I'll blow a drum.

1286
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,460
Boo.

1287
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,460
Boo.

1288
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,460
Boo.

1289
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
Boo.

1290
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,460
Boo.

1291
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,460
Boo.

1292
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,740
And Hofstetter could be he could be like is it is it okay to make Stephen Hawking

1293
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,380
jokes now that he's a like on Epstein's Island yeah they've that's what they

1294
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,100
buried no no cuz that's a fucked up part is like he didn't somebody could have

1295
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:11,100
just wheeled in there he can't do anything about it

1296
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,660
yeah that's true they can make a big frame that dude for fucking anything

1297
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:21,460
that's true right they could have put him fucking anywhere like his maid down

1298
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:28,540
the stairs or something? He had sex with the maid. No he didn't! He has the greatest alibi of all time. You just mixed up, by the way,

1299
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:34,140
Stephen Hawking with that movie, or that documentary, The Staircase. Oh, okay. Yeah,

1300
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:40,440
didn't Stephen Hawking kill Nicole Brown Simpson? Yeah, no, Stephen Hawking, yeah,

1301
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,180
cuz he had those little paperclip legs and he ran in the Olympics.

1302
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,720
Stephen Hawking did not have sex with anybody.

1303
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,720
His maid put like porn on his brain or whatever.

1304
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
I don't know how his computer works.

1305
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,720
And was like, "Do you like this?"

1306
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
And he was like, "Bless."

1307
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,720
And she just put more porn on.

1308
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,720
And then his wife was like, "Finally a fucking reason I can divorce this guy. Oh my God."

1309
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
And she got out of there with like half his money.

1310
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Damn. Goddamn.

1311
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,300
- Damn, and half the universe.

1312
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,760
(laughing)

1313
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,340
- Oh my God.

1314
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,820
- Yeah, she also got, she got freaking time.

1315
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,400
- Half his knowledge.

1316
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,240
- Yeah.

1317
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,080
(laughing)

1318
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,840
- She just uploaded it to the thumbnail.

1319
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,880
- She got time travel in the divorce.

1320
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,000
- She got the secrets.

1321
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,840
- Yeah.

1322
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,880
- I was, I, we mentioned Jim Carrey and I just remembered,

1323
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,960
I just had a flashback to this creative writing class

1324
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,160
I was in at my old college, where,

1325
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,000
I can't believe I've never,

1326
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,080
I know I've never told this story on the podcast.

1327
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
Yeah, you don't talk about your old college at all.

1328
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Yeah, UNCW, I was in this like, beginner creative writing class my freshman year.

1329
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:59,080
And we did the icebreaker thing and everyone went around and it was basic, your name, your age, and a fun fact about yourself.

1330
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:08,080
And there was one guy who was like a veteran and he had a dog and he was like, "Yeah, my name's Dan, I'm 43 years old."

1331
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,080
"I'm Lieutenant Dan."

1332
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,720
(laughing)

1333
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,360
My fun fact is, I have this dog because,

1334
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,440
yep, I have PTSD.

1335
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,760
(laughing)

1336
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,040
And then immediately after him was this like,

1337
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,160
this like pale, like see-through white nerd.

1338
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,500
And he was like--

1339
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,340
- Cameron.

1340
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,480
- His name was Cameron actually.

1341
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,440
- That's not true. - I don't remember his name.

1342
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,520
But he was like, yeah, I'm Arthur or whatever.

1343
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,560
I'm 19 years old and fun fact about me,

1344
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,080
"Well, I guess it's that I do a pretty killer Jim Carrey impression."

1345
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:45,440
And then he got up from his desk and did...

1346
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,600
He did... He was like...

1347
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,480
"DO NOT GO IN THERE!"

1348
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,480
[Laughter]

1349
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,480
And then he gave the veteran guy PTSD.

1350
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,480
[Laughter]

1351
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,480
[Laughter]

1352
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,480
[Laughter]

1353
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,480
That's what my platoon leader said about the bunkers.

1354
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,480
[Laughter]

1355
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,480
[Laughter]

1356
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:13,760
But then he was like, "And if anyone ever wants to see, I do a pretty mean Ace Ventura also."

1357
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,040
And he did it a couple more times throughout the semester.

1358
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,400
It's a good one to pull out, dude.

1359
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,240
That'll make people like you.

1360
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,960
Every once in a while, you just gotta throw out a little carry.

1361
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,960
Yeah.

1362
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,920
I'm sure everybody here is a comedy fan, you know?

1363
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,920
Exactly.

1364
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,680
"Okay then!"

1365
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,680
You know, like he says.

1366
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,680
"Oh, well."

1367
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,680
"Oh!"

1368
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,680
You know, like Ace Ventura says.

1369
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,680
"Oh, the..."

1370
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,680
"I agree!"

1371
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,680
"I agree!"

1372
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:44,920
agree. Like Case Ventura said, "Somebody get this friggin' animal out of my office, I'm

1373
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:54,200
trying to do work!" You know, what Jason Ventura said, "I love animals!" You know, "I'm going

1374
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:02,560
to the zoo!" What Jim said, "Give me my mask back. Where's my mask?" "If you don't give

1375
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Give me back my mask.

1376
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,040
I'm gonna feed you full of- I'm gonna stuff you full of pills.

1377
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,000
I neen to be green.

1378
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,600
Give me my mask, Bask.

1379
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,480
Give me my back smacks.

1380
