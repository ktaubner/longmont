00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm not excited for this at all.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Um...

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I have to do Patrick's thoughts too now because Caleb...

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Oh shit I have all the Twitch stuff on.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Hold up.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
That's gonna...

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
That'll fuck it up.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,800
Where did I put the...

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
There we go.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll just shut all that off.

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Oh boy.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,960
This is gonna be a weird one.

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,840
So you wanna see something fucked up?

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,440
I'll be open and honest with you guys.

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,440
I don't care.

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,720
I don't give a shit.

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,720
Bless me.

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Jesus Christ.

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,900
I'm having a day beer because I have to do this.

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Check this out.

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
Bam.

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,560
That's all of my laundry and it's as tall as my shelf.

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,920
Look at that.

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,760
Look at that shit.

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,400
Aren't I fucking disgusting?

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
What the fuck is wrong with me?

37
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Jesus Christ.

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:31,140
Literally like I had the plan to go home and then do all my laundry in New Hampshire and

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,140
then bring it back.

40
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:43,140
But this Omicron shit is, it's, it might, my roommate got it.

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,580
So I'm freaking the fuck out obviously.

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:02:00,820
I had like a big, not a meltdown, but I did panic and spend $84 on snacks just in case

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,060
I'm locked in for two weeks.

44
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,460
Yeah.

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,420
Yeah, that's shit.

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,620
I haven't even bought Christmas presents yet.

47
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,860
Do you, anyone else, like I wait till like the last minute.

48
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,780
Like I got Caleb and Kams because we had planned to do like an episode and then this freaking

49
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:33,220
Omicron hit and we had planned a Christmas special and now it's like I don't even know

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,940
if that's going to happen.

51
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,700
I would love for it to happen but fuck man shit.

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Fuck man shit.

53
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,580
I don't know.

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,440
This sucks.

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,740
This is like the worst time to be alive.

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,460
I've been like so, so, so stressed out lately.

57
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,460
Oh dear.

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,340
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

59
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,820
It's basically, it basically sucks.

60
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:32,740
the

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:45,300
watch

62
00:03:45,300 --> 00:04:02,700
new

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,700
I went in there, I was riding this, where did I put it?

64
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,640
It's under my bed somewhere.

65
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,540
My room is such a mess right now.

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:24,740
But you can see the laundry on my bed too.

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,240
That's a thing Cameron and I have been doing

68
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:46,200
to

69
00:04:46,200 --> 00:05:03,080
the

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:19,120
trailer for paymaster. Where's the... yeah here it is. What? Oh. It probably got got

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,680
for copyright. Damn. Well anyway. Ok so. Oh I just moved that shit. So I've been riding

72
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,440
this 917 board because one of my boards got waterlogged and riding this 917 board for

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:41,400
those in the know, you know that Max Palmer who rides for limousine now, started limousine

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,360
whatever.

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,840
So he's at, I go into labor, I'm pregnant, I'm pregnant as hell.

76
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm like looking at the shit to make sure that it's like recording and everything and I'm

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,160
like looking at myself and realizing like facial tics that I do when I'm nervous and like the

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:20,020
oh god dude this every uh whatever anyway anyway uh um so I go into labor skate shop to buy

79
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:28,580
new wheels. I'm riding that board 917. There's like beef between Max and Alex Olson who runs

80
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:35,700
917 or whatever. So I'm riding like an old 917 board while Max Palmer's trying to take

81
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,900
pictures of all the new limousine product at labor. So there's a possible chance that

82
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,900
there's a photo of me holding a 917 board looking at limousine product.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,820
Which none, no one who is subscribed, like probably like 10,

84
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,020
15 people who listen to the premium,

85
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,100

86
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,980
understand that that's like like kind of kooky of me and like,

87
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,700
like, Oh shit. Like that's kind of funny. Max took like a,

88
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,340
I'm like in the foreground of a picture,

89
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,840
like looking at his new shit riding like one of like like it's an old Cyrus Bennett board

90
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,400
who also owns limousine and like oh god I've never felt like more like a fucking fool in

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:33,600
my entire life like that that sucked that sucked okay I guess we'll just watch the new limousine

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:43,400
Paymaster is what it's called.

93
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, fuck.

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,240
Oh, here it is.

95
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,960
Here it is.

96
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
this is a...

97
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Ooh, gotta make me small.

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I know for a fact

99
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Cam and Calew find out I'm doing this

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
they're gonna get so mad.

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Hold on, let me...

102
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Jesus.

103
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,040
Might be too quiet now.

104
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,640
It's not like I can get DMCA'd.

105
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,280
I heard that people were complaining that Cyrus Bennett did too many back tails in this.

106
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,080
And it's like, if I could back, what the fuck?

107
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,480
Imagine complaining about a back tail, that is insane.

108
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,520
Oh, they got some Nolan Benfield footage in this, that's so tight.

109
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,720
Haven't seen much of him since like Cosmic Vomit.

110
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:13,680
Like, like I get being a hater or whatever, I, you know, but like complaining about like

111
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:22,240
a back tail, especially if you can do him as good as Cyrus, like what the fuck?

112
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:37,480
to

113
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:59,480
that

114
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:22,360
it's

115
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,360
so ADHD and so fucking stupid.

116
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Uhhhh.

117
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,860
Ooh, abandoned skateboard restoration.

118
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,360
That actually looks kinda tight.

119
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, look at that grip job.

120
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
It's kinda...

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,080
Hold on, Caleb had to reinstall all of his drivers and shit.

122
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,160
It was supposed to be an episode of me and Caleb.

123
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,840
And um, cause Cameron's away.

124
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,760
And uh, I just went ahead and started.

125
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,680
Cause I knew something was gonna be fucked up with Caleb's stuff.

126
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,680
He's either, either something's fucked up or he's lying cause he doesn't wanna do it.

127
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,400
Which I get it.

128
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,040
I get it man, I get it Caleb, it's fine.

129
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,940
You can just tell me you don't want to do it, but I have to tell them I'm recording this

130
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
right now.

131
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
What kind of trucks are these?

132
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
Those look like, there's a C on it.

133
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Those are, the hangers kind of look like thunders.

134
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
I don't know, I don't know.

135
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I don't know what they're for.

136
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
I don't know.

137
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
I don't know.

138
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
I don't know.

139
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
I don't know.

140
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
I don't know.

141
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
I don't know.

142
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
I don't know.

143
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
I don't know.

144
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
I don't know.

145
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,940
I don't know.

146
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
I don't know.

147
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
I don't know.

148
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
I don't know.

149
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
I don't know.

150
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
I don't know.

151
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I don't know.

152
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Is anyone, no one would get any enjoyment out of this.

153
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:05,700
Like this is also like, cause I'm not thinking about like the people who aren't going to

154
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,100
watch it, you know?

155
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,380
Like no one, I don't know.

156
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,260
We don't do video episodes for that reason.

157
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,900
And now I'm doing a fucking video, oh god dude.

158
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,660
What if I've just ruined the whole show?

159
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,880
What if I've ruined everything and everyone's mad at me?

160
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,100
I hope no one's mad at me for this.

161
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Fuck.

162
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,100
Ugh.

163
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:43,060
Anyway, what kind of board is this?

164
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,900
Probably some shop deck or something.

165
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,940
It looks like spray painted.

166
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,580
Those look like thunders.

167
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,340
I think those are Thunder Trucks.

168
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,340
This is kind of like...

169
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
I guess some...

170
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,820
Oh, dude, just put it on the fucking...

171
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,500
You don't have to take the bearings out like that.

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Just put it...

173
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
You could have just put it on the hanger.

174
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,380
And look, they literally, on that fucking reflex tool, you can just...

175
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,900
There's a bearing push right there.

176
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,980
You could have just used that thing.

177
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,620
I don't know why he's doing that.

178
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,180
It's like way simpler.

179
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:27,220
Oh anyway, at labor I bought 58mm wheels.

180
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,340
Which is like crazy big.

181
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,740
I don't think I've ever...

182
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,380
Oh what are those?

183
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,780
Those look like a truck company that just doesn't exist anymore.

184
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,460
The hangers kind of look like thunders though.

185
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,100
I just need to see the base plate again and I'll probably be able to...

186
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh fuck.

187
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Are those...

188
00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:00,100
This is ASMR done by somebody with a learning disability.

189
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Uh...

190
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
These must be some like

191
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,060
Amazon brand fucking trucks. I can't get a good look

192
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,780
Also like nobody gives a shit no one

193
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,540
No one cares what trucks they are

194
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,660
Nobody cares, but me. I'm I'm the only one I guess I'll have to see once you

195
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,860
But they have that fucking little

196
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,060
Graffiti on them. These are probably some you know what they're probably some European brand. I've never heard of yeah, Crail

197
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,740
It's his Crail on them

198
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,820
The fuck is Crail

199
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,340
I'm sure I'm gonna get some fucking like

200
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,900
Some German guy some German fan of the show is that actually Crail was one of the biggest

201
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900
one of the biggest skateboard track companies

202
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,060
in in Deutschland

203
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Oh this one time I was with somebody waiting outside of a bar.

204
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,460
I don't know I think I was just like chillin, like having a cigarette and this guy, this

205
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,820
like German guy asks me for a cigarette, it was my last one.

206
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,540
Actually was, I wasn't just being like "yeah I know it was my last one" because I give

207
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,060
out cigarettes like a motherfucker.

208
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,180
I give out cigarettes like way too much.

209
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:53,860
in

210
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:05,980
it was a German. But yeah he's like standing there. I tried to guess what part of Germany

211
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:13,020
he was from though. And I guess northern he was southern and then he's like you don't

212
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:21,380
hear the Austrian in my voice? And I was like dog I guess German. I didn't say Austrian.

213
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:32,820
Hitler yeah he's like like talking all that shit and then like my friends like

214
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,060
she was like oh so like what are you like doing after this and he's like oh

215
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,700
you know I could not meet any girls here so I'm probably going to go home and

216
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:51,260
masturbate I'm gonna go back inside I'm not hanging out with this fucker anymore

217
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:58,260
more

218
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,700
I bet Crails not even a German truck company too.

219
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,320
I wonder, hold on, let me do a quick look-see at this.

220
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,160
Rod Filmes.

221
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh, this is like,

222
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,700
this is like Portuguese or something.

223
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
Yo, Brazilian, yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,680
Oh, so Crail must be a Brazilian truck company or something.

225
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,280
Gotta say, Brazil?

226
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,220
Crazy ass skaters.

227
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Brazil and Japan fucking smoked us in the Olympics.

228
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
It was nuts.

229
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:41,220
I don't know too much about Brazil.

230
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
I've never...

231
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,220
I mean, clearly I've never been to Brazil.

232
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,220
I don't think I've ever left the country.

233
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
No, I've never left the country.

234
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,220
I don't mean...

235
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,220
Why did I say I don't think? I don't fucking know.

236
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
Whatever.

237
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Whatever.

238
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:05,900
I got a package in transit.

239
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,940
It's cool.

240
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,540
I think it's a shirt I bought.

241
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:19,700
But yeah, Brazil, I mean, they got Tiago Lemos and like, oh, who's that guy?

242
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Big Dreadlocks.

243
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Aldemo Jr.

244
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,940
That was his name.

245
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,620
he was sick. He rode for I-Path, hit those giant dreadlocks, he had to cut them off because

246
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,980
he went to jail because his dad like fucked him over for like taxes or something. Shit,

247
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,380
crazy ass story, definitely check that out. I think it was on like, it's like his Nine

248
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:49,940
Club interview or some shit. No one, no one cares about this. No one... I'm gonna get like

249
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,620
a bunch of people saying like oh like oh it's fine over there blah blah blah also I don't

250
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:04,700
fucking no one gives a shit dude why am I doing this?

251
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:14,580
You're not supposed to use WD-40 on bearings.

252
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,980
It's not good for them.

253
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,980
only supposed to use bone speed cream.

254
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,100
Again none of you fucking know what I'm talking about.

255
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,780
This is like, you know what it is, I just came back from skating so now it's like the only

256
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,140
thing I'm thinking about.

257
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,060
And like, it's not like, see it's like now I'm thinking like oh I have to like top the

258
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:55,020
the

259
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:09,880
a

260
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:16,880
twitch stream. You know what, I'll surprise you with an animal that I saw. Nevermind,

261
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,960
I forgot. Woah. This is like the first result. Hold up. What is this video? Woah! What is

262
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,080
Whoa, this is like the first result.

263
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,920
Hold up.

264
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,280
What is this video?

265
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,260
Whoa!

266
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,720
No!

267
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,000
Buddy!

268
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,460
Oh, geez!

269
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Look at how he jumps!

270
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Look at that fucker!

271
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Oh my god.

272
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,260
That is insane.

273
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:17,260
I can't do like...

274
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,220
The two like most redneck dudes too.

275
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
So perfect.

276
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:37,820
So perfect that it's like, "Oh, you fucking, fucking look at that raccoon, he's on a boat."

277
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,780
Oh man.

278
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,580
Raccoon versus cat.

279
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,460
All right, this looks, this looks very promising.

280
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:59,060
30 minute video uploaded in 2015.

281
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,180
No audio for some reason.

282
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,380
I'm not doing this one.

283
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,020
Cat attacks raccoon, two minutes, okay.

284
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,340
Just like some backyard footage.

285
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:26,700
If I had a backyard like this, and a raccoon came in to my backyard, I'd do everything

286
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,180
in my power to domesticate it.

287
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:38,100
I would let a mama raccoon set up shop in my backyard.

288
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,980
And then, oh there it is, there's the fucker.

289
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,980
Camera glitched out. Only caught the raccoon for a second.

290
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,980
But I'd do everything in my power to let that thing...

291
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,980
Dude, haven't like... Oh my god, like a baby raccoon farm basically and I'm selling them to people?

292
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,980
I sell little baby raccoons to all my neighbors?

293
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,980
That'd be sick.

294
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,980
That'd be like...

295
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Oh, oh, oh!

296
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,980
See, this would be the one problem.

297
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
My cat would probably...

298
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,980
If I am in this future where I have

299
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
a backyard

300
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,980
and I'm trying to house a baby raccoon farm.

301
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Damn, he's fucking them up.

302
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Orange cats, dude, they're...

303
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
vicious as hell.

304
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,260
Oh, dude, look at their... look at the arches on both of their backs.

305
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,700
Nuts.

306
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:49,720
Whoa.

307
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,100
Whoa!

308
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,700
Is he gonna climb with...

309
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,980
Holy shit.

310
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,580
That is so fucking sick.

311
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,740
Dude, he climbed that thing like fucking Spider-Man!

312
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,260
Holy fuck.

313
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Look at that shit.

314
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:16,260
Damn.

315
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,940
That is nuts. That is fucking crazy.

316
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,520
Oh, if you're listening to this on your commute,

317
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,600
you're missing out. You gotta look up "Cat Attacks Raccoon"

318
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,620
by Christian Brayden.

319
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,940
Like it's his movie.

320
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,060
Yeah he directed this in June 17th 2021.

321
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:47,220
Damn. Oh my create my Adobe Creative Cloud has plugin updates.

322
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,500
Cat on ice.

323
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Whoa. Oh come on little dude. Oh he's so little.

324
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,940
Oh he's so scared.

325
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Oh come on little dude.

326
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,100
Oh.

327
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
You'll be ok.

328
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Oh.

329
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Oh man.

330
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,380
Oh he's so confused.

331
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,380
He's never been on ice before.

332
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Look at him.

333
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
This is awesome.

334
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Whoa.

335
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:26,380
This is awesome.

336
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Woah!

337
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,380
*snort*

338
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,380
He straight up does not understand.

339
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,380
People are going to be so mad at me for this episode.

340
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,740
This is 10 times worse than the first one.

341
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,300
Because at least the first one I had like 2 days prep.

342
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:02,100
This is like 12 hours that I have before I have to...

343
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,060
Fuck dude.

344
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:10,700
Funny cats compilation, most popular part 1.

345
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,000
Absolutely.

346
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This one's a classic.

347
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh that cat just took off that woman's bikini, oh hell no.

348
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh dear.

349
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Dude, cats fucking, cats love to push things off of...

350
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh he's gonna push it anyway.

351
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, he's gonna do it.

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
*snort*

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
*snort*

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Dude, they- the cats fucking love

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
pushing things off the tables.

356
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I-

357
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I- what?

358
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
about that?

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Like, why?

360
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hold on, I'm gonna look that up.

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm gonna look up- why does cat-

362
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
why do cats like to push things off of the table?

363
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Why do cats

364
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
knock things over?

365
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Can you even read that?

366
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
No, there's no way.

367
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
This is PetMD.com

368
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Some of our cat's strange habits can easily be explained.

369
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But this is one habit that leaves us scratching our heads.

370
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
It looks like...

371
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
It looks like the only explanation is like...

372
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, okay, it's like manipulative...

373
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Cats are little manipulative fuckers.

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Damn. I gotta get a cat.

375
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I gotta get another cat real quick.

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm using... I'm using, uh...

377
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not my actual YouTube account, because I know...

378
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I know you fuckers would see something in my like recommended videos and make fun of me for it forever.

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It's like how to heel flip or something. Like I'm trying to like learn, like skate tricks I'm trying to learn as like a grown man.

380
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Ugh, boy.

381
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Which, I mean, it's fine. It's fine to like try and learn how to skate when you're old, but like...

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,320
I don't know.

383
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,680
I don't want anyone to know that I'm fucking...

384
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,920
I don't want anyone to know I can't heel flip.

385
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
You know?

386
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Oh hell yeah.

387
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Look at that.

388
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh fuck.

389
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
I got something in my eye.

390
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I can't even see the video.

391
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
There's a really dark shadow.

392
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
I'm not even looking.

393
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm not even looking.

394
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I'm not even looking.

395
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm not even looking.

396
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm not even looking.

397
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I'm not even looking.

398
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
I'm not even looking.

399
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm not even looking.

400
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm not even looking.

401
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm not even looking.

402
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm not even looking.

403
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,120
delicate operation.

404
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,240
You just got one eye open. So that indicates she's five weeks

405
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,920
old. As you can see, she's got a really fat little tummy there.

406
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,800
Oh, she's got a sleeping bag in here. And she's gonna be nice

407
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,680
and cozy in there.

408
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,240
All right, I think my eyes good now.

409
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,400
We're not really well. Just going really fast now.

410
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,560
All right, it's time for a bigger enclosure for

411
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Damn dude, it's so like...

412
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,720
Stode is just British for weasel, right?

413
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,520
Like no one's...

414
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,000
No one can answer me. I'm talking to my fucking self. I'm having... I should have called Leo.

415
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,920
Know what I might do? I might pause this recording and call somebody.

416
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,720
I think that's what I'm gonna do. Everyone was busy.

417
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,960
I couldn't I couldn't call anybody because they were busy

418
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Damn.

419
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:39,240
Whisper the Stoat?

420
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Stuart Stoat?

421
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Oh God.

422
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,840
I need a Stoat dude.

423
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,160
I need like a little animal.

424
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I need to be a father.

425
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm ready to become a father.

426
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
If anyone wants to...

427
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,160
If anyone wants to give me a baby...

428
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Please.

429
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Not a human baby.

430
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Like an animal.

431
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Some kind of like snake or...

432
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Like a Charmander.

433
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Like...

434
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:25,520
like a Charmander like I'm going I'm going completely insane now I don't

435
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:36,040
think oh geez I spent $84 on snacks because I'm I'm so scared of a second

436
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,560
lockdown not scared of a second lockdown I just don't want to deal with one

437
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:52,080
one because it will be annoying.

438
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,640
I need to check if this is recorded.

439
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,320
I think it is.

440
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,640
The first half of that I had to stop recording.

441
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
I don't know.

442
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Wait!

443
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Ugh.

444
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:17,200
Anyway, I need like a, I need like a tiny cat.

445
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,400
I need like one of those like cats that they like do like genetic engineering to that makes

446
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:29,880
it stay kitten-sized forever and it has a million gajillion health problems and it's like, "Oh,

447
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120
it looks so cute!"

448
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,680
And it's like, "Oh yeah."

449
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,040
It can't shit without bleeding.

450
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,000
It can't shit without bleeding and every morning it wakes up with organ failure and you have

451
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,200
to give it mouth-to-mouth as soon as it wakes up.

452
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,680
That's how you get it awake.

453
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,160
It's like essentially like a toy poodle.

454
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,320
Like all those toy animals riddled with fucking...

455
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,920
Like pugs aren't supposed to look like that.

456
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,800
I feel like pugs are a genetic mutation.

457
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,520
Most dogs are now.

458
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:16,840
Most like, it's like, oh this dog was bred to hunt foxes and then people just wanted them

459
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,000
as pets and then they just breed out like some kind of like, oh it used to have like a longer

460
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,260
nose like a beagle in like 1901 compared to like a beagle now has like a smaller face

461
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,840
or some bullshit you know?

462
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,760
And it's, ugh, dear.

463
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:46,160
What we do to animals so that they can like remain cute or like be better house pets is

464
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,520
so fucked up.

465
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,200
It's so fucked up that we play God with dogs.

466
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,840
What the fuck?

467
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,520
What am I doing right now?

468
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:10,360
I think it's good to have a thing like this every year.

469
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:17,840
A day where I just audit my own thoughts and think about why I think the way I think.

470
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,840
I don't know why.

471
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm glad I have Caleb and Cameron to keep me in check.

472
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:34,120
If this shit went unchecked, I'd be the worst.

473
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I'd be like the worst guy of all time.

474
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,460
It's not like I'm already...

475
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,360
It's not like I'm the greatest.

476
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,200
*laughs*

477
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,800
What the fuck?

478
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
What am I even saying?

479
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,080
I'm just like, just saying like shit

480
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
so that you aren't bored.

481
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,520
Oh dear.

482
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Oh dear.

483
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,760
Ugh.

484
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Commercials that every 2000s kid knows.

485
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
*Zoop house theme*

486
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
*Zoop house theme*

487
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
*Zoop house theme*

488
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360

*Zoop house theme*

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,360
You know this 2000's kid

*Zoop house theme*

494
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
*Zoop house theme*

495
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
*Zoop house theme*

496
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,360
I miss Caleb and Cameron already

497
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I'm gonna miss them so much if we go into second lockdown

498
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
I'll be able to see them in the park or whatever

499
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:45,040

500
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:51,560
really good night and uh, just like god damn it I, I love all my friends so much.

501
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:58,240
I've had so many of those in the past couple weeks and uh, now it's all gone to shit cause

502
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:07,740
now everyone's getting fucking Omicron and uh, yeah dude it blows.

503
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,480
It blows ass.

504
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,560
Dream skateboard build, all white skateboard setup.

505
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,800
You ever realize what your obsessions are?

506
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:27,440
And just be like, "Damn, I fucking love watching, I love putting together skateboards.

507
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,000
My dream job would just be to do this."

508
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,240
I don't even, like, if this shit wasn't working out, like if most of this shit in my life

509
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
wasn't working.

510
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,760
Have you ever been so down bad that you almost apply to a Zoomies?

511
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Because I have.

512
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,720
I've gone through the application process of Zoomies and then closed the tab.

513
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:03,520
I got halfway through a Zoomies application in like 2018 and was like, "No."

514
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,920
I thought about it for longer than like the 15 seconds where I'm like, "I just need money

515
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:18,640
so bad and I just like I was like yeah no I'll just spend my whole day like setting up skateboards

516
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:27,140
for like shitty kids what the fuck kind of grip tape is that it has no oh okay nevermind

517
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:34,140
you can tell yeah it's like I don't know it's some kind of blank he's probably spending

518
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,880
like little to no money on this on like Amazon.

519
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:47,380
Also I love the fucking, what is that like Minecraft like background music?

520
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,180
The soft piano?

521
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,980
He should have worn a white shirt though.

522
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,020
Yeah I almost applied to Zoomies.

523
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,060
I almost worked at a fucking Zoomies.

524
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:04,180
I didn't almost work there, I almost went through with an application.

525
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,460
I would have been the only fucking core dude working at that Zoomies, you feel me?

526
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:14,660
I would have been the only one, I would have been the only Zoomies employee that skated

527
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
core shit.

528
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,860
I would like go into Zoomies in high school and just to like see if like, oh they're selling

529
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,260
like Spitfires, like if they're selling like Formula Fours or something for like at a discount,

530
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,440
you know like oh well I'll fucking like you know like yeah support your local but like

531
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:41,240
you know if I can if no one sees me buy like wheels or like bearings at zoomies at a discount

532
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,440

533
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,680
products they had and it always sucked like it was always like like zoomies has like cool

534
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,120
shit like wow don't oh fuck taking that out of context I'm gonna look like such a fucking

535
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,800

like Baker, they got like all like the big companies, they'll have like cool shit like

537
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,960
that. And then they have just like, the shittiest fucking like, like Goodwood and Superior,

538
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:20,120
like those fucking graphics. I think my first board was the Goodwood, it was like this Goodwood

539
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,560
major, it said major blazers on it, and it was like a Rasta unicorn with like galaxy,

540
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,120
Like the first board I got when I was getting back into skating when I was like 13 and then

541
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,120
like the first, hold on, the timeline of boards that I've had is like Major Blazers board

542
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:44,320
when I was 13, 7.5 board, tiny fucking, tiny ass board.

543
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,080
Then when I was like 14 I worked for a landscaping company and I like shoveled like an old folks

544
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:59,620
home and then I bought this crooked Mark Gonzales team deck, like pink 8.5 board with these

545
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:05,000
white and blue Thunder 147's.

546
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,960
Why did he spray the...

547
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
Why did he spray it?

548
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:19,680
Anyway, the fucking, yeah, like pink board with white and blue trucks.

549
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:37,680
it's

550
00:40:37,680 --> 00:41:06,200
I

551
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
No one gives a shit about that.

552
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,820
There's ten people who care about-

553
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,860
No, this sucks.

554
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,400
This sucks so much.

555
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,440
God damn it, dude.

556
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,680
Caleb and Cameron are gonna be so mad at me.

557
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,800
But I love them so much.

558
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,840
I love my friends.

559
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,400
I love all my damn friends.

560
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,160
I'm gonna list off all my friends' names.

561
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,840
*laughs*

562
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,080
*claps*

563
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,760
*laughs*

564
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:50,680
The rest of the episode is me just being like, Caleb, Cameron, Patches, Joe, Alex, Neil.

565
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm so sorry to people who are like listening to this in the car.

566
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,840
Oh dear.

567
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,760
I should have just watched it, I should have had a plan going into this.

568
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,320
Cause I don't know, is this like narcissistic of me to like, you know, record myself, like

569
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,680
I'm having a fucking crisis right now.

570
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,400
Like I'm like, like I know we have to put something out and I know that Caleb and Cam

571
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,320
told me to do this.

572
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:28,320
But it's like, is like, should I do this if I'm not going to be proud of it?

573
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
[laughs]

574
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Ugh.

575
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Dios mio.

576
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Dios mio, indeed.

577
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,320
And talk about my skateboard setup.

578
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:50,960
That's, no, that's very narcissistic.

579
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,600
also no one gives a shit about that.

580
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,280
Truly nobody cares about that.

581
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,920
Except for the one guy who asked.

582
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,120
Forget who, but one of the patrons messaged me.

583
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,800
Asked me about my setup.

584
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,840
I guess I can talk, I don't know.

585
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,200
It's not like I'm not going to get immediate feedback or anything like this.

586
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,760
Like I'm saying it like I'm still on Twitch.

587
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,760
What the fuck are those?

588
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:26,860
Those... clear bearings?

589
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,880
Those look... those would break in a sec- those are like plastic!

590
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
What the fuck?

591
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,520
Oh see, now he uses it!

592
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:51,000
Oh yeah, the bearing fart.

593
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,120
Never use that thing, always use the truck.

594
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,520
I mean I said earlier, use that, but why put the fucking, I don't know.

595
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,280
I'm not consistent with what I say.

596
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,480
This is psychotic.

597
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:21,480
this

598
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:28,480
You can message Jubio and uh, you can tell, you message Jubio and say in the Twitter DM

599
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,080
you say "Dear Jubio, the podcast sucks. I want to kill you because of it. And then we can

600
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:46,160
report you and then get you banned." Fucker. Fuck you. Ha ha. Fuck you. Uh, I don't know.

601
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,200
I think I'm going to stop it here.

602
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,640
Actually I do want to see how this ends.

603
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh here's a quirk I have I can tell you about on my skateboard.

604
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,520
I heard that Ashad Ware does this, so now I do it.

605
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
Which is stupid.

606
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,280
Which is stupid for me to be like, "Oh, well no."

607
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
Because it's like, "Oh, well that's a good idea."

608
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,080
You get like a fraction of an inch more on your fucking...

609
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,200
I put both the washers on the inside.

610
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:36,640
like

611
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,640
make me good like a shod if I do that. It doesn't. I bought some big ass wheels though. I bought

612
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,680
some fucking 58mm wheels. I probably already talked about this. I bought some tires dude.

613
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,680
I bought some fucking tires. It's been fun. I get a lot more speed. But you don't care

614
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:07,080
about that. You wanna hear me do jokes? You wanna hear me be funny? Hey, little funny

615
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,880
man dance for us. If I don't get to go home for Christmas because of Omicron, I'm gonna

616
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:19,880
kill myself.

617
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:28,480
Should I even put this out?

618
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
We'll find out if I do.

619
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,720
You'll find out if I do.

620
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,200
He fucking it.

621
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
He ain't fucking that thing.

622
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,200
Ugh.

623
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:57,200
There's so much going on in this damn world.

624
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Ugh!

625
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,760
that my roommates hear me and just think I'm I'm I've completely fucking lost it now

626
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:20,840
everything's scary everything is fucked everybody sucks you don't really know why

627
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:31,160
but you want to justify sucking someone's dick off funny funny funny gay parody um

628
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,800
I'm gonna finish this video out and then stop.

629
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:44,680
Oh but yeah my my for the one guy that's interested

630
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:51,560
yeah I switched to 58 56 millimeter wheels to 48 or 58 millimeter wheels and um

631
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:58,680
I've got an eight and a quarter uh GX1000 board that's coming in the mail. I bought it straight

632
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,080
from them because I wanted a specific graphic they were making and I couldn't find it at my

633
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:20,640
I

634
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
and a Dr. Pepper.

635
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,360
Speaking of, Dr. Pepper good as fuck.

636
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,540
Dr. Pepper is so good.

637
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,080
I've literally like

638
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:41,860
not, I stopped drinking Dr. Pepper for a while and then started drinking Dr. Pepper again

639
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:47,100
because I just like one day remembered like, "Oh yeah, Dr. Pepper, like the can of Dr. Pepper."

640
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,360
Fucking so sick. Dr. Pepper in the can

641
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:56,040
That's one of the best flavors 23 of them

One fraction of the center of the board you throw that thing away I

646
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,360
Don't know too much about the forbidden 14. I know it's a Boston guy. I know it's Dana Erickson

647
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:32,400
Is that like I have to read the quarter snacks interview about it again

648
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,800
Cuz I tried to do that. I tried to do it. So I only skated like the nose and the

okay, so

658
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:37,420
What happened was I'll explain what it is. I can't just like go in and

659
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Play it out of nowhere

660
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,280
so Joey Brzezinski

661
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,200
Who I mean?

662
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,360
People can have their opinions on him. I don't care. I'm talking about like months old beef now. This is so funny

663
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:56,360
He runs like footprint

664
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,000
shoes and

665
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,880
Like all they're like marketing is like oh you can drop an egg on these insoles

666
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,080
Then they won't break and it's like all right. Yeah. No. I'm a fucking I'm a rube. I'll buy those I don't oh

667
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:12,800
Oh, the guys in Cirque du Soleil, they use the Footprint insoles!

668
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Yeah, I'll fuckin' - look, you're selling to guys like me, I'll fuckin' - I'll buy whatever

669
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,280
stupid fuckin' product you're shelling out.

670
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:31,840
But for some reason he had too many white claws at a Wu-Tang concert, and Footprint

671
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:38,200
had just did like an ODB collab and those shoes look fucking terrible.

672
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:47,640
So he's like on, he's off the claws at a Wu-Tang show and took it upon himself to call out

673
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,400
fucking awesome's own Jason Dill, the owner of fucking awesome.

674
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:00,360
Which you get, you know, fucking awesome puts out some stuff and it's like, yeah, people

675
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,320
People only like it because it's F.A. like I get it, but the stuff they do put out that's

676
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,080
sick is sick.

677
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,760
Like I won't deny that, like F.A. is like a sick fucking, sick art direction and everything,

678
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,760
whatever.

679
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,720
Whatever, I'm fucking, ugh, I'm so stupid.

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,800
Uh, anyway, Jesus Christ my voice is, ah shit, did I, I fucking caught it didn't I?

681
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,840
I caught that shit.

682
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Um, yeah I got too drunk at a Wu-Tang show and started doing this.

683
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:39,840
*Fuck you Dale, what do you have with your fake ass company? F.A.

00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840

702
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:52,840
I

703
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,600
a shoe that was similar to Footprint's shoes.

704
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,880
And he's standing there at a Wu-Tang show,

705
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,760
you should be fucking enjoying yourself,

706
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,080

707
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,360
And he's like, "Man, fuck these guys,

708
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,960
"like our shoes have twice the rebounding technology."

709
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,040
(laughs)

710
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,520
He's talking about his fucking egg drop test

711
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,840
at the fucking Wu-Tang show.

712
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,640
It's so fucking sick, dude.

713
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,400
Oh speaking of, same guy put out a video 10 years ago on his own personal channel, Joey

714
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Brzezinski.

715
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,040
This is a video titled "Joey Brzezinski Gets a BJ".

716
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,920
I've never seen this before.

717
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,180
I know this is going to be fucking comedy gold.

718
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,000
I know this is going to be better than SNL's, this is going to be better than, uh, this

719
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
is going to be better, the best comedic mind of all time.

720
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:07,880
of

721
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:17,660
this is it. No. Fuck. That used to be, that song used to be the first result when you

722
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:29,620
looked up like, oh here it is. Yeah. That's so funny. He literally looked up funny 70s

723
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:57,500
This

724
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,620
- the headphones so the girlfriend will love them

725
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:12,060
I don't like him. I

726
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,540
Don't like Joey Brzezinski, I

727
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:23,920
Don't like him. I don't like him at all. I think visual his company sucks. I think team burrito sucks

728
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:32,700
Footprint sucks. I've skated footprint insoles. My feet hurt so bad after I skated them. I

729
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,500
Don't like him. I

730
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:42,020
Loo I don't like his vibe. I don't like his tick-tock channel. I don't like I

731
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,580
Don't care I'm gonna say it

732
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,740
I'm starting my first beef

733
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,660
This is it

734
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:55,080
Patrick's thoughts - ends with me starting my first beef and it's with a guy

735
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:03,260
Who could fucking destroy me in skate? It's like with a guy who's a ten times better skater than me. He had a pretty good

736
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:06,800
It's a it's okay. It's like

737
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,500
It's a C- part in

738
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,160
Cliche Bon Voyage, I think that's what it's called. Let me see

739
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,200
Yeah, yeah cliche Bon Voyage he has a he has a C- part in that

740
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,540
But I'm starting my first beef with you motherfucker.

741
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,820
Fuck you.

742
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,500
Fuck you, you little bitch.

743
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,780
I really hope that this doesn't get to him because I'm not actually trying to start a

744
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,780
beef.

745
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,100
I really, I don't want to pull up to a skate park one day and have that dude off the claws

746
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,820
run up to me just like, "Man, fuck you!

747
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,820
Fuck you!

748
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,860
You're talking shit about my rebounding technology, you fucking little bitch!

749
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,300
Little ass bitch!

750
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,940
I'm in the streets, dude!

751
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,940
You're out here claiming straights, fuck you!

752
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,940
Yeah. No, I'm not a fan of that guy.

753
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,940
Anyway, alright. I have to edit this now. This sucks. Okay, bye bye.
