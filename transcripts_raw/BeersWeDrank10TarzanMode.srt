What's up all my chuggers?

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm trying to get that burp out.

And we're live.

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,720
I got this fucking shit.

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,440
You have a Pepsi.

22
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,360
Who has a Pepsi?

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,840
Me?

24
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,520
You.

25
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,160
Yeah, that's a Pepsi.

26
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,160
My beer today is a Topo Chico Heart Seltzer.

27
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,960
Ooh, I like those.

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,320
It's a--

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,880
I like those.

30
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,200
--lemon lime one.

31
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,080
I like lemon.

32
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I like lime. Yeah, the Topo Chico seltzers, those are good ones.

33
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,000
They taste completely fine. That tastes good.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,120
They're usually too expensive compared to the other ones. Today I have,

35
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,200
I have a June Shine hard kombucha grapefruit Paloma flavored.

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,120
I think I've done these before. This is, yes, it might be a repeat.

37
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm not sure if it is, but this is one of my go-to drinks. I love these.

38
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,720
- Yeah, Julio, what are you eating?

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,320
- Food we ate.

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,240
- Beer?

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,720
- Beer, tabachico beer?

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,000
- No, that's not beer.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,880
That is not beer.

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
What the fuck is that?

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,500
No, no, no, show us that plate.

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,720
- Dude, this dude's eating a fucking bowl of grubs.

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,660
- You can't, bro, you can't eat while we record.

48
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,500
What is wrong with you?

49
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,600
- Let's move on.

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,860
- What, you're, move on?

51
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,960
You're gonna take another bite in 90 seconds.

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
What is that?

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,440
No, you can't hide.

54
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,680
(laughing)

55
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,360
You can't, I know that you just put it here.

56
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,200
- Move on.

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
- You're the, you just, but you made a booger too.

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
A piece of rice just fell off your plate

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,320
and you picked it up with your hand and put it in your mouth.

60
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Buddy, that's a booger.

61
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
- Let's move on.

62
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,560
- All right.

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm drinking a rogue hazelnut brown nectar.

64
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,480
- Wow.

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,080
- Which is a mediocre beer.

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,480
- Buddy, that's the shortest can you've ever had on this show.

67
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,300
- I know.

68
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,140
- That's true.

69
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,040
- I didn't get a chance to go to the liquor store before.

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,720
- Do you feel like you've failed everyone?

71
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,960
I mean, eventually I was going to have to fail them.

72
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,000
There's only so many weird beers in existence.

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,160
If only there was like a never ending supply of guys that would make

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
beers that were kind of odd or funny and yeah,

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,480
unfortunately there's not many of them.

76
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,360
So maybe we need to move into that space. That's what I'm hearing.

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,920
Move into the space.

78
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,880
When you move to New York, can we please start a brewery?

79
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,240
Sure. We can do it.

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
Wouldn't that be so much fun?

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,880
We could do all sorts of marshmallow stuff.

82
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,120
We need to have like a company that does everything.

83
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
I wanna do a radio station.

84
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,640
We need to have a Waystar Royco.

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Yeah, I wanna do a radio station.

86
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
I wanna do the news.

87
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,480
I wanna do beers.

88
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
I forgot what else was in there.

89
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
I wanna do the news so much.

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,740
I wanna do news so much.

91
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,520
I am gonna start an record label when I'm moving to--

92
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,400
Oh, really?

93
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
New York, yeah.

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Who are you signing?

95
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,840
It's probably some really dead black guys from the '50s.

96
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,200
That's smart.

97
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Yeah.

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,380
You don't have to pay him royalties.

99
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,380
Those poor guys, man, they got fucked when they were alive and you're just going to

100
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,380
keep it going even though their ancestors fucked them when they were alive.

101
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,920
Yeah.

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,940
And you're going to be having, you're gonna be getting royalties on lead belly songs.

103
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,960
Exactly.

104
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,620
Wow.

105
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,320
He's awesome.

106
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,300
He recorded the same cause like, you know, they didn't have the internet back then.

107
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,680
So he would just record the same song on different record labels thinking that

108
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,220
they couldn't like compare them, you know?

109
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,240
So there's like 50 different recordings of the same song.

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,820
Cause like, you know, who's going to call him on that? Yeah.

111
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,660
That's a genius.

112
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,800
I always love any guys who were not like,

113
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
he was popular, but he wasn't that popular when he was alive.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
And who now we still know their names. Cause that gives anybody hope.

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,760
Yeah. Like that's probably how I will be. I'll probably be a,

116
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
who's another guy like that?

117
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,360
who like nobody knew when they were alive.

118
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,480
There's a woman who died of AIDS whose name I can't remember, but um,

119
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,880
if only that shit's always playing in my life. Exactly. Yeah.

120
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,960
So I guess the point I'm not even gonna make it because the one person I thought

121
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,760
of, I can't even remember her name. And that was the whole point I was trying to

122
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
make.

123
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,880
I do. I do really like, uh, like Alan Lomax.

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,520
He was a guy who did a bunch of like archival recordings of,

125
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,000
He was just like a white guy that heard a black guy sing in the 30s and he was like,

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to dedicate my life to this.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,520
That's what I would have done too.

128
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,160
I know.

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,820
Can you imagine growing up in 1920s, like white churches?

130
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,160
And then one day you like go into the black service and you're just immediately

131
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,200
like, Oh wait, this is way better.

132
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,120
This is the plot of like a hundred movies.

133
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
It's literally the plot.

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm sure.

135
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,960
The latest one is Elvis.

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Elvis is literally about this.

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
Elvis is white.

138
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't know if you knew this down there in Mexico.

139
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
No, he's not white.

140
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
But I saw that movie.

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
He is not white.

142
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,800
Yeah, he's as white as a snowflake.

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,480
No, he's he's fragile like one, too, because

144
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
no, he's groovy.

145
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,080
He did.

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
He died on the toilet eating a sandwich.

147
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,760
A lot of these drug addicts are complete

148
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,380
snowflakes in my eyes on the same

149
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,800
level as an SJW.

150
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, so well, they're just sensitive

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
like one like

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,560
- Bad drugs. - Yeah.

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Oh, boo hoo.

154
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
- My drugs were bad. - And guess what, buddy?

155
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,680
All drugs are bad.

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
- Yeah. - People do get upset

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,240
when you tell them that they're addicted to weed

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,120
and they're gonna die because of it.

159
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,200
They're throwing their life away.

160
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,880
- People get so crazy about weed.

161
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
They really clutch their pearls.

162
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,760
I came to terms today with the fact

163
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,440
that I have marijuana-induced brain damage.

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,440
And I would say there's zero doubt in my mind

165
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,940
That's true.

166
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:16,600
I think that's it's 0% chance that you can actually pinpoint what,

167
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,560
what caused you to be this way.

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
You can literally be like a million things.

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
It was marijuana.

170
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,400
Doing a single drug once will forever alter the course of your life.

171
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,680
It completely, my brother giving me a bong and making me go watch the

172
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,800
Avengers movie in theaters when I was 14, that ruined my life.

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,660
Yeah.

174
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,360
He thinks he ruined my life by giving me noogies and spitting on my head.

175
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,400
No, that's why it was the weed.

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

177
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
The first person to get no get in it.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,960
It is the exact same spots that he used to hit.

179
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,400
The whole hand. That's funny.

180
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,560
Yeah. But yeah, every time I see him, he'll say something very sweet.

181
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,260
He'll be like, like, man, I don't know why I was such a mean older brother.

182
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,340
Like I used to, you know, trip you.

183
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,400
It's like, no, dude, you introduced me to the thing that ruined my life forever.

184
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,860
Apologize for that.

185
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,200
Weed. Yeah. Weed is terrible.

186
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,100
I hate weed. I'm never doing it again.

187
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,340
No, yeah, we will make you soft.

188
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,680
You need to be a hard man.

189
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,980
Mastery.

190
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,640
You know, I'm getting into is this guy, Brian.

191
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,940
See, my brain damage is acting up.

192
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,100
Brian, something he's a very giant singer.

193
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,940
He's the gut.

194
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,440
And now

195
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,680
his movies were going to get to this material.

196
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
Brian, not good.

197
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,340
I'm going to look it up right now.

198
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,500
I think he did X two or some shit.

199
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,140
But Brian, the guy who's on like, I just see him on YouTube shorts.

200
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,680
He's this like billionaire dude who's trying to live forever.

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,340
Oh, the 40 year old dude that like, yeah, he's 47 or 46.

202
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,180
And he has spent he spends two million dollars a year.

203
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,840
Yeah. On trying to be 18 forever.

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,240
And he looks like a vampire and he has a yellow face and he's covered in burns

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,940
all the time because he sits under red light therapy all day, every day.

206
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,200
He's like a former tech CEO.

207
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,040
He sold his company for $800 million in 2013. And since then, he's developed this whole routine where

209
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:24,080
he wakes up at 5, he burns his skin away, he eats 4 pounds of vegetables and then works out,

210
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,760
and then eats 4 more pounds of vegetables and then burns more of his body with red, red hot lights.

211
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,980
And then he started at 11 a.m.

212
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,780
He stops eating and he doesn't eat for the rest of the day.

213
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,680
And then he goes to bed in a completely dark room.

214
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,340
He has everything sealed.

215
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,380
It's really scary.

216
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,540
Yeah, he he's trying to like they have like metrics or like indicators

217
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,140
that are supposed to be about your age.

218
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,240
Yeah, you can be like medically a certain age.

219
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,440
So he's trying to buy your workers.

220
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,280
Yes, his biomarker age so that he's like 18.

221
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:14,960
And yeah it's not he's not so much money i would not look fine he has spotted lines all over his body and his head is he looks like he has like you know how sometimes women where the wrong color foundation and it doesn't match their next.

222
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah he has that thing but he doesn't have any makeup on it's just he's been like putting so many serums on his face that it's turned it is like baby skin.

223
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,960
It's really scary.

224
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
Yeah, yeah, no.

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,760
What I'm referring to is I don't think the

226
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,640
all your budget logically this age.

227
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,440
I think that's a that's a complete lie.

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh yeah, it's like it's like a horoscope for guys

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
for like insane guys.

230
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,680
I mean, I feel like what's going on?

231
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,400
Sorry, it's it's fortune cookies by the way,

232
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,000
but go ahead.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
Yeah, obviously that's.

234
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,720
Yeah, pick three fortune cookies.

235
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
That's tarot cards.

236
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
I literally believe in fortune.

237
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
I think horoscopes are stupid,

238
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,440
but if I get a bad fortune cookie,

239
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,680
I'm so fucking scared.

240
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,840
(laughing)

241
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,480
I'm so scared.

242
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,720
(laughing)

243
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,480
- You sound so insane right now.

244
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,600
- If I get a fortune cookie that's like,

245
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,280
be careful, things will change soon.

246
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm like, what the, my parents are gonna die?

247
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
What is happening?

248
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,160
That's so scary.

249
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
- Yeah, that is--

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
- I've never had a fortune cookie to be like that,

251
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,200
like, scary, scary prediction.

252
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
- Okay, so this is why you guys don't believe this.

253
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,880
Every time that I'm in a group of people,

254
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,000
everybody else gets fortune cookies,

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,580
new people into your life,

256
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,900
the next day, the first day of the rest of your life,

257
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,740
all this shit.

258
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,160
Mine is always like, things are changing at a rapid pace,

259
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,840
and you need to be ready.

260
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
I always get scary ones.

261
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,840
- You don't have to get food purity again.

262
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,920
- The thing about fortune cookies,

263
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,900
they're so vague, like,

264
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,260
you know, horoscopes that they always apply to you.

265
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,740
That's the thing. Nothing ever changed.

266
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
My life's been pretty much the same for four years,

267
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,900
but I've gotten about 50 fortune cookies that all have given me a nightmare.

268
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,340
So

269
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,620
like in such a whirlwind of existence that every time I go to New York,

270
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,940
my life changes drastically every single time without fail.

271
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,480
- Well that's because a lot of people would say

272
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,220
that I'm one of those people who just,

273
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,380
one touch changes your life forever.

274
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,620
- Yeah, you're a catalyst for chaos.

275
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,980
- I wouldn't say chaos, I think I have a,

276
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,780
have you seen my house?

277
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,340
I have two mirrors. - Well, that's because

278
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,340
you're caged by your five foot wife.

279
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,680
- That is true.

280
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,660
Can you imagine what I would be if I was not in a marriage?

281
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,940
How fucking shit my life would be?

282
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,280
I make fun of Patrick all the time

283
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,400
for having a sock on his floor or something,

284
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,320
my life would be so fucked up.

285
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
- I think, I'm trying to imagine you and Rex

286
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,200
having, being in a roommate situation together,

287
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,240
and it just feels like a TV show to me.

288
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,600
That just feels like--

289
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,840
- We wouldn't be getting into antics.

290
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,680
- Yeah.

291
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,500
- We would.

292
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
You and me would honestly--

293
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,160
- And we would be really stinky.

294
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,640
We would be the stink brothers.

295
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
- Big time stinky.

296
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,920
We would also, I think, very quickly slot

297
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
into a pretty homoerotic situation.

298
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,320
(laughing)

299
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,160
- Yeah.

300
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
- I think it would--

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,820
- We would both--

302
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,660
- Pretty--

303
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,480
- We would test the limits of how little clothes

304
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,320
we could wear in a cold area.

305
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,280
- Yeah, how long until you just go full bare nude?

306
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,120
- Honestly, two weeks?

307
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,160
- I think you'd make it like two to three.

308
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,480
- Yeah, I was gonna say about two weeks.

309
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,480
- No, it would be a pretty fast domestic partnership,

310
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,600
and we'd be like, "Oh, we're just doing it for tax reasons."

311
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
- Yeah, yeah.

312
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,740
We're about to fucking 40 years in.

313
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,400
We have an adopted child of every single race

314
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,180
and we're teaching them.

315
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,180
We're teaching them math with blocks in our living room.

316
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,840
They're all 20 years old.

317
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,540
Doing this to dry a salad.

318
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,620
(laughs)

319
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,460
We're not gonna call them on GBO.

320
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,360
No, one of them's just GBO3.

321
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,180
Yeah.

322
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,360
My guy.

323
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,920
Yeah, Mahatma, that's one of them.

324
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,400
Yeah, the white one.

325
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,240
Yeah, exactly.

326
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,800
(laughs)

327
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,520
Name the next one the same name as the most famous person

328
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,360
from the previous one's race.

329
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,600
That's what we do.

330
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,360
So we go along, there's LeBron, he's white.

331
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,720
There's Biden, he's Chinese.

332
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,320
The next one is Indian, he's Jackie Chan.

333
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,280
We just keep going down and down and down.

334
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,960
- He's from Hong Kong.

335
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,920
- He's from Hong Kong.

336
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,000
That's China.

337
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,200
- You are a fascist racist.

338
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,520
- Depends on who you ask.

339
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,480
Yes. If you ask Jackie Chan, he says it's China.

340
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,840
So I'm going to trust him.

341
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,080
I actually don't know. I just made that up. Yeah. I'm not even sure.

342
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,600
I've been thinking a lot about that North Korean girl just lies.

343
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,440
The one with the big, big things on her.

344
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,960
Bottom. What?

345
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,720
The new, the newly implanted big things.

346
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,520
Yeah.

347
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,560
That's so funny to get a tit job and then walk around saying you had to eat your

348
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,200
parents. Yeah. On Joe Rogan. That's so cool.

349
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,520
I've been tempted to like go back and listen to that episode because I just keep

350
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,880
hearing that she makes up the wildest stories about a country and people are just

351
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,760
like, no, that's not even like remotely true.

352
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,800
We just left the country because we didn't want to be there anymore.

353
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,960
Well, yeah, that's she left when she was 13 and like,

354
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,120
if you try to describe a story from when you were 13,

355
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,080
you would also be just lying. Oh yeah. Cause you don't remember.

356
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,940
- A hundred percent, who remembers anything

357
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,320
from before like three years ago?

358
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,880
- Literally, I barely remember what I ate two days ago.

359
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,560
- Yeah, so you, I mean, I will say as I've gotten older,

360
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,280
I feel like I realize more and more

361
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,160
that people who are like that, they have no,

362
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,800
it's not that they are really doing it because they're evil

363
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,840
or because they like are trying to lead people astray.

364
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,040
They really are, they have the best intentions.

365
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,200
they're just stupid or they have a bad memory

366
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,320
and they just, or somebody told them to do it.

367
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,760
- Yeah, I think she's just trying to make money.

368
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,600
- Yeah, exactly.

369
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
Which is like, I don't care if somebody's trying

370
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,960
to make money, that doesn't, like in her head,

371
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,780
I understand completely how she could square that

372
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,440
and be like, well yeah, I need to buy

373
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
the biggest breasts they have at the store.

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,520
(laughing)

375
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,680
It's what I would do too.

376
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,000
- Absolutely.

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,240
- Listen, we've seen that market just grow and grow

378
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,160
without fail every single year.

379
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,920
The richest people in the world are all,

380
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm all for free speech, conservative.

381
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,160
I hate Joe Biden, he's a white bitch.

382
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,080
He's a white bitch.

383
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,860
Tucker Carlson just left his post at the Fox News.

384
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,320
It is time for a group of three guys

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
to slot in there and take that spot.

386
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,400
Dominate conservative space.

387
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes.

388
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,400
I agree.

389
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
- Well, I mean, this is the number one

390
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,880
conservative podcast on the internet.

391
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
- Yeah, we should just do his whole thing just like him.

392
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,220
- Yeah, so we need to go.

393
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,400
We should do Tucker Carlson and just talk over each other.

394
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,580
We all are convinced we're the star of it.

395
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,320
They give us one teleprompter to read off of.

396
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
- Yeah, we're all doing that voice.

397
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
- We're all doing that voice.

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,600
- And like pushing each other's heads down below the glass.

399
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
(laughing)

400
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
We're saying one, two.

401
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
That's a great idea for a show.

402
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Three guys all trying to be one with each other.

403
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
They're fighting for

404
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
to see who can be the loudest.

405
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
That's a fucking Mario Party mini game.

406
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
One of the ones where you have to hit Z or X

407
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
as fast as possible.

408
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
You jam it until your fingers numb.

409
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
I was so good at those as a kid, man.

410
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
Me too. I was setting world records constantly.

411
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
No you weren't. True. Well it says world records, but

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
as of

413
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,240
In the last probably two weeks I've come to terms that maybe that's not the world record.

414
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
I'm so excited running to your mom's room.

415
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
"Mama, I have a world record!"

416
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
[Laughter]

417
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
"I'm famous!"

418
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Moms are stupid enough that they would probably believe that shit too.

419
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Yeah.

420
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Did you ever yell at your mom over video games?

421
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,240
No.

422
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Like in a moment of heat?

423
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
This is probably hard for you guys to believe.

424
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,240
I was such an angel.

425
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I was a perfect kid.

426
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
a perfect kid.

427
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,000
That's a lie.

428
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, it's not a lie.

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,400
I was.

430
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
I think we got a lie

431
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,720
sort of thing right here.

432
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I would.

433
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,560
How is that a lie?

434
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
That's a baseball.

435
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,240
That's the only one I have.

436
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,000
I, I don't.

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,520
Yeah, I was I was perfect.

438
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,040
I would I would wait to be

439
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,760
a nasty kid until my parents

440
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,560
weren't looking because I was

441
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
smart. My brothers, they were

442
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,140
they were yelling about chores

443
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
and shit.

444
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,380
I was doing the chores, yeah, okay, okay, yeah,

445
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,660
I'll do the chores.

446
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,140
And then as soon as my mom's in the bathroom,

447
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,580
I'm stealing pills.

448
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,060
- Right. - 'Cause I was smart.

449
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,220
- Right. - Damn, which pills?

450
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,660
Tic Tacs?

451
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,940
- Well, I pretty much, when I was a kid,

452
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,060
would steal whatever pills,

453
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,800
but then you end up taking like fucking,

454
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,940
like arthritis medication.

455
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,060
It just doesn't do anything.

456
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,640
- Yeah. - You know?

457
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,020
Yeah, you're taking vitamins.

458
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,420
Antibiotics that have expired for six years.

459
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,180
Exactly, just because you're like,

460
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,340
oh, this looks like the one for,

461
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,380
this looks like the pill from Osmosis Jones.

462
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,540
I bet it will make me go crazy.

463
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,620
Yeah. But nothing.

464
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,940
My mom never had any very cool pills in her house.

465
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,620
My mom was a naturopath,

466
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,880
so we didn't even have pills at home.

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,660
My mom and grandma, my grandma's fully that way.

468
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,900
Like she just has never taken,

469
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,220
as long as I've been aware,

470
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,820
She's never taken a prescription medicine.

471
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,620
She takes like horny goat weed and all that kind of shit,

472
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,120
which at the time I remember being like, you're such a fucking idiot.

473
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,660
And now if you open my pantries, all four different types of

474
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,260
stupid made up shit just does nothing. Yeah.

475
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,720
And I haven't taken my chiropractor before. Yeah, doctor.

476
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,620
So did my mom and grandma.

477
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,120
They both will go to a chiropractor before they go to a doctor

478
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
in the chiropractor.

479
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,020
He's not even one of these guys on YouTube

480
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,680
who will break your neck as loudly as possible and like also does it on dogs and babies.

481
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,980
He was like this old guy who had a Thera gun.

482
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,880
He had a Thera gun and then another gun that was like a like a manual Thera gun where you

483
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,660
would cock it and it would shoot one time.

484
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,380
And he you'd walk in and you'd wait you wait in the waiting room for an hour and a half

485
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,460
that Gary Larson comics for me to read and then my mom would walk in and I would come

486
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,960
with her because I was a little kid of course and he would go so how's as a church as whatever

487
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,260
He'd cock the Theragun.

488
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,680
My mom would sit on her stomach on the on the bed.

489
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,260
He would shoot her like one time in the back of the head.

490
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,720
Just so loud.

491
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,340
It's clearly so painful.

492
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,140
My mom would go, oh, and then he would do this for maybe 90 seconds

493
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,900
and then sit her up, crack her neck one time,

494
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,180
send her out fucking six hundred dollar insurance.

495
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,400
Oh, yeah. Yeah. What?

496
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,160
Yeah. My mom went to one.

497
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Chiropractic is insane.

498
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,040
His name was Dr. Force, hot older guy, long, long white hair.

499
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,840
Dr. Force. I know, dude.

500
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,040
Dr. Strength.

501
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,340
He's dope, dude. He's dope.

502
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,980
And yeah, he's totally one to crack.

503
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,240
And he did this thing, I remember, because when I was little,

504
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,640
you know, you're supposed to get like allergy tests, right?

505
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,840
Yeah. Start going to school.

506
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,700
So what they do to determine if you're allergic to something

507
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,340
is they just put it in your other hand and then he'll like push down on your arm.

508
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,340
And if you're weak, weaker holding the object,

509
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,880
you have an allergy to it.

510
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,040
What kind of fucking that's so smart.

511
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,880
They were like medieval bullshit is allergic to to dairy.

512
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,220
He's allergic to.

513
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,560
Wow. You're everything.

514
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,060
Yeah.

515
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,060
And obviously I wasn't is you're just a weak pussy.

516
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,260
Right. I was just a fucking seven year old boy.

517
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,700
Yeah, of course, he's pushing down my arm with ease,

518
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,500
but it was it was very funny.

519
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,600
He's still that's a doctor force would do it because Dr.

520
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,440
Force scored perfectly on that test when he was a child.

521
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,040
Yeah, dude, he was like breaking the doctor's arm and shit.

522
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,580
Because, you know, you get to be like 11 years old.

523
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,740
You realize your parents are fucking retards.

524
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,880
Yeah, like but then I was like, you know what?

525
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,740
This guy's actually you know, he's got it made.

526
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,380
I see it's kind of cool.

527
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:36,880
I don't know.

528
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,980
I don't know what they're calling English, but do you guys ever know about those?

529
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,500
like little pill bottles that were just like,

530
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,940
they were just like vitamins with like a shit ton of sugar.

531
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,780
Homeopathics?

532
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,060
I don't know if that's what they were, but I recall--

533
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,620
Where they would, homeopathics,

534
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,220
they would dilute something to the point

535
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,060
where there's almost nothing in it.

536
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,180
Yeah, I think-- Is it that?

537
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,300
I don't know if that's what it was,

538
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,540
but I remember when I was a kid,

539
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,860
I used to go to this doctor, I guess,

540
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,460
and we used to take this,

541
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
and then all of a sudden we just stopped.

542
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,240
But I don't really have a single memory

543
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,540
of why we were taking those,

544
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,140
what it was, what was wrong with me.

545
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,900
I don't think there's anything wrong with me.

546
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,160
- I think you definitely had something wrong

547
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
with you as a child.

548
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,180
I would believe that you had some kind of really--

549
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,500
- I think I had asthma.

550
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,820
- Yeah, I think you had probably a lot of things bad

551
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,580
going on with your health as a kid.

552
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,060
- No, I'm normal, I'm fine.

553
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,060
- I would have loved to be just your best friend

554
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,960
when we were kids.

555
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,660
I don't think, I don't have a single friend still

556
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,580
from when I was a kid, which is a little weird, I think.

557
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,260
- Well, what age is the cutoff?

558
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,620
What's like the earliest friend you still have?

559
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,900
- Like somewhere in like elementary school,

560
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,180
like middle school.

561
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,340
- I think that's normal.

562
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,180
- That's, yeah.

563
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,580
- Nobody has like five-year-old best friends still, right?

564
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,420
(laughing)

565
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,220
- I do say that, but I know a lot of people who's just like,

566
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,220
yeah, it's just my buddy that I used to like live

567
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,220
in the neighborhood or like met him when I was a single year old.

568
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,320
That does happen, but I feel like that's like also a very literally Mexican thing.

569
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,380
Maybe all the kids I know from like my don't.

570
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,880
The earliest friends I ever like Noah and Chad, and I met them

571
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,840
when I was in middle school, anybody that I knew from elementary school,

572
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,120
like the two my two best friends in elementary school

573
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,320
went to prison for the same armed robbery

574
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
like a year ago.

575
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,720
And I was just like, you weren't involved in that.

576
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,260
Unfortunately, no, but it was a little bit like, oh,

577
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,080
what could have been, you know?

578
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,400
Yeah, you can be these two guys busting into some sort of

579
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
a podcast.

580
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,280
I've always been drawn to.

581
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
To get a little prison.

582
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,800
Just a little bit.

583
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,440
You know, it's funny you say that one of them was definitely

584
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
the Patrick.

585
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,520
- Him was definitely the Cam.

586
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,880
- Were you the Caleb or were you--

587
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,920
- I was always the Caleb, yeah.

588
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,920
- I don't think so.

589
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,480
- The Cameron one, the first day I ever met him,

590
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,560
the first day I came to class, he made me cry.

591
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,680
He just made me cry 'cause he was so mean.

592
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,480
And then the Patrick one came over to my house

593
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
and my mom gave him a salad and he put ketchup on it.

594
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,680
(laughing)

595
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,280
So it's always been like this for me.

596
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,440
It's always been like, it's like a, just a,

597
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,480
What's your walker of life categorizing people as a Cameron or a Patrick in your

598
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,680
life? Every single person that you know?

599
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,760
No, but I should, I probably should probably help me out a little bit.

600
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
Yeah.

601
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,800
I do think every podcast has three guys.

602
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,480
Wow.

603
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,080
Some real shit.

604
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,320
Different guys. Wait, I said this on the first episode. Forget that.

605
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,680
Can we cut that?

606
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,280
Yeah. Hey, I got you.

607
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,500
- How do you guys feel about the NBA playoffs?

608
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,220
- You know, I went with Noah to that Nets game.

609
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,340
I used to be such an NBA fan, but I honestly,

610
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,420
you know what's so embarrassing?

611
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:16,420
My NBA fanship has been entirely replaced

612
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,880
by competitive video games.

613
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,820
Which as you get older, it's supposed to go reverse.

614
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,300
But I went from when I was 18,

615
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,020
every night I would watch the NBA games.

616
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,280
until I'd watch the West Coast games to one in the morning.

617
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:30,880
Yeah.

618
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,640
And now I do the same thing watching some Korean Valorant team that I barely know.

619
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,840
I only know one person on, but I will just stay up until, and I like watching it.

620
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,720
Tell you what I like watching it on the TV.

621
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,680
I will commandeer the living room so I can watch competitive

622
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,160
Valorant on the TV.

623
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,920
How bad is that?

624
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,960
That's dope.

625
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,560
That's what we did at the Airbnb.

626
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,720
Every time I see him, he puts Twitch on the TV.

627
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,720
I do like, because Twitch is just like free TV every time.

628
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,560
- Yeah, I agree.

629
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,200
- Yeah, it's the most boring TV channel of all time.

630
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,960
- Yeah. - But it is free.

631
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,800
- It's free and you can take it anywhere.

632
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,720
- Except for the gambling.

633
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,080
I liked, when there was gambling on it,

634
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,820
I was seeing the other day about how amazing that was.

635
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,120
- For a brief moment in time.

636
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,440
- When there was gambling on Twitch

637
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
and you could just watch it on TV,

638
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,040
just let, people just fucking playing Blackjack

639
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
and spinning slots all day long.

640
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,440
- That was so amazing.

641
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,600
It was too good to last.

642
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,440
It was too good.

643
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,560
- It was too good.

644
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,280
It was too entertaining.

645
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,360
- I was so confused by Trenrik's lifestyle.

646
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,760
Like how was he alive for 48 hours every single time?

647
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,960
- He's a drug addict.

648
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,240
- He would just stop and the next day

649
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
he would immediately just go back to doing the same thing.

650
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
- I actually don't think it was coke.

651
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,720
I think it was Adderall.

652
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,920
I think it had to be Adderall.

653
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
I think he was railing Adderall.

654
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,320
- That's still.

655
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,360
- Yeah, you're right.

656
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,320
But I think like Coke doesn't, nobody can do that.

657
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,040
Nobody can do it for years the way he was doing it,

658
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,180
but people can do definitely,

659
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,800
every fucking programmer does that shit.

660
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
He was just living that kind of life.

661
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,420
- Yeah, he was.

662
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,240
I live it.

663
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,840
I do wanna like start taking stimulants again.

664
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,120
I think that would be a good

665
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,680
positive lifestyle change for me.

666
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,360
- I think you're picking a wrong time to do it.

667
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,200
- Why? - Yeah.

668
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,360
- 'Cause there's a massive shortage.

669
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,020
- No, but I can afford the really expensive ones.

670
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,520
What are the really expensive ones?

671
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,860
Like the patch that costs $2,000 a month.

672
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,220
There's a patch.

673
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Yeah, that's what's.

674
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,280
Oh my God.

675
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,980
Really?

676
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,780
Yeah.

677
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,560
Do you ever get a little bit uncomfortable

678
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,760
that our entire economy is built on very mediocre people

679
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,660
who are just like slamming stimulants?

680
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,520
Uh, it scares me.

681
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,720
Yeah, it really scares me.

682
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,060
Like we are one really bad shortage

683
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,220
away from just everything going down,

684
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,920
because all of these people are on it.

685
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,920
So, yes, but also like

686
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,340
it's been that way for 40 years, so I'm not that worried.

687
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,720
I guess that is true.

688
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,100
You know, I guess it's like the 80s was the peak of that because

689
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,560
I was so normal now.

690
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,300
I feel like it's even more normal now because you get it at a pharmacy.

691
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,340
That's true.

692
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,420
But, you know, it goes away like, you know, Adderall, you take it normally.

693
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,920
Right, you're productive during the day at night.

694
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,100
It tapers off and you have you go about the rest of that cocaine.

695
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,500
You could take literally from the moment you wake up till three days.

696
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,360
Well, that was the funny.

697
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,200
It's funny that you mentioned Sandbank, McFreed, because I.

698
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,060
Maybe we talked about this.

699
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,400
I feel like his situation was one that I could if I could have easily found myself.

700
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,960
For sure.

701
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm like, just just like telling a couple of little white lies

702
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,500
and all of a sudden you are you have destroyed the world.

703
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,940
I think you have the type of personality

704
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,240
that could just lead you to be like a big time CEO

705
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,960
of a like nothing product.

706
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,800
- Yes, definitely.

707
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,640
- I think you have it in you.

708
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,980
- If I was on Adderall, I definitely could have done that.

709
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,360
I could do the Sam Bankman Freed thing.

710
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,500
That's why I can't do drugs like that.

711
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,140
'Cause I feel like Sam Bankman Freed,

712
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,960
I could relate to his, like I bet he would wake up

713
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,000
and he would be just like so fucking just hung over

714
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
from last night, he was, they were splitting that really ugly girl eight ways, like a pizza

715
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,440
somewhere in Turks and Caicos and then waking up just being so hung over doing you get you

716
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,840
go. He probably gets like a liquid IV like directly into his vein. Yeah. And then feeling

717
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:39,480
so fucked up and then putting on that patch. And then the second that stimulants hit just

718
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,560
being like, fuck dude, it's time to call every single person in my phone, tell them everything

719
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,920
Everything is perfectly fine.

720
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Everything's chilling.

721
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Yeah.

722
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
Life is amazing.

723
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Look at my key.

724
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,480
The millisecond that we hang up all those calls, he's in a Riot game just playing for eight

725
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
hours a day.

726
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Exactly.

727
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,520
That was the other part that I could definitely, I could fully understand.

728
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,560
Is taking stimulants and pretending to work and then jumping on a Riot game.

729
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,640
You're immortal and he was fucking like silver.

730
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Yeah, he was bronze.

731
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
He wasn't even good.

732
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Yeah, he wasn't even good.

733
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
Yeah.

734
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,140
Yeah.

735
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:18,040
The thing it's like the whole world is like blind leading the blind.

736
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,740
So it's like being really good at being retarded is like,

737
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,540
because that's like the king of retards, right?

738
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,540
The guy that knows that he has to take stimulants and he does

739
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,340
that and he just falls ass backwards into accidentally running

740
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,440
a billion dollar Empire and he knows that it's going to collapse

741
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,040
at some point, but he just takes enough drugs that it doesn't

742
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,220
matter. Well, yeah, anyone can fall into that. That's what you do is the second

743
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,280
because he definitely knew. But the second that you know, you just keep going

744
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,680
because you're like, yeah, I'm not. What am I going to do? I'm going to call CNN

745
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,400
and say, hey, by the way, I defrauded basically every single person on the

746
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:04,600
world. And I'm really stupid. And also my girlfriend looks like a Goomba. So

747
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,320
that's the do you want to know that or no, you just wait until everything comes

748
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,600
crashing down, you're doing the FCC and yeah, exactly.

749
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,640
Like you don't need to, why preempt it?

750
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,880
Like just enjoy your fucking, your silver league cues.

751
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,800
Go meet Tom Brady. Go hang out, go have a beer with Tom Brady.

752
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,840
Also all of the, if you're already in that,

753
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,040
you know that you're going to prison.

754
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,280
So why not have as many amazing memories while you're sitting in prison as

755
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,600
humanly possible? Right?

756
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Yeah.

757
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,280
The thing where he went,

758
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,400
- Isn't he in rich people prison,

759
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,680
where you don't actually go to prison?

760
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
- Probably not.

761
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,440
- First of all, he's on house arrest.

762
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,800
- Oh yeah, so his life is amazing.

763
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
He just is playing league.

764
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,680
He's still playing league.

765
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,500
- He literally is playing league

766
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
in his parents' basement right now.

767
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,240
- The thing where he,

768
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
the reason why he originally got rich

769
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,200
is that he would buy Bitcoin in America

770
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,480
and sell it on a Japanese market.

771
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,320
- Yeah.

772
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,280
- Is so funny that that's like,

773
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,360
people are like, this kid's a genius.

774
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,440
That is so fucking funny.

775
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,560
- Yeah.

776
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,760
That is something that I see Rex doing like a year, two years ago.

777
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,240
While he was still stuck in a dungeon.

778
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,960
Yeah.

779
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,200
Yeah.

780
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
When he was just scamming.

781
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,160
Yeah.

782
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,640
Yeah.

783
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,920
You have come so far.

784
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Well now I have a fucking normal life, which is nice, but it'll never, I mean,

785
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,400
normal life.

786
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Yeah.

787
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,000
Hey, you don't live a normal life at all.

788
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
You sleep in the hallway.

789
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,240
I can't believe you even tried to get away with that.

790
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,800
You sleep in a hallway.

791
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,000
- Okay, but you know, if I didn't live in a hallway,

792
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,520
my life would be basically normal.

793
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,860
- You just said basically.

794
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,120
(laughing)

795
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
- All right, all right guys.

796
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,600
- Yeah, I'm fucking, my life is weird.

797
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,120
- No, no, no, no.

798
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,080
Your life is, you live in a castle with,

799
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,160
I mean, come on, you can't try to get away with that.

800
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,240
- Can you run downstairs real quick to your front door?

801
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,080
- And ring the doorbell.

802
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,320
(laughing)

803
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,960
It's just a loud doorbell.

804
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,240
I don't know.

805
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
At least do an impression of the doorbell.

806
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,720
At least do an impression of the doorbell.

807
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,560
It's not that it's loud.

808
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
It's what it is.

809
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,400
Bing bong, bing bong.

810
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Yep.

811
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,240
Bing bong, bing bong.

812
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,280
It's the same exact sound as when you're walking around

813
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,720
like an old southern town like Savannah, Georgia or something,

814
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,280
and you're not paying attention to the time,

815
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,240
and then it strikes noon, and you look up,

816
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,520
and some church has a bell tower.

817
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,840
Like you have an actual fucking

818
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
hunchback of Notre Dame doorbell.

819
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
- Yeah, it is.

820
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,920
- It's bad.

821
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,880
- It is bad.

822
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,340
And it's really funny to get it

823
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,080
and then, you know, go get whatever it is that, you know,

824
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,440
inevitably it's like some shipment of something.

825
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,100
So like today it rung and it was just like nine vapes,

826
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,940
you know?

827
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,760
(laughing)

828
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,120
- And you know that delivery driver is just like

829
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,820
walking away like, what the, like,

830
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,080
Did you guys ever work any job where you had to like install something at somebody's house?

831
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,580
Yeah.

832
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,880
You know how sometimes you would go to somebody's house and you would piece together their insane

833
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,600
life?

834
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,320
Oh yeah.

835
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,040
As you were in their house, like you would see pictures of them with like,

836
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,960
like when I was installing shower doors, you would see pictures of people with like

837
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,400
Bill Clinton and shit because you're installing like nice expensive shower doors.

838
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,880
And you would leave and be like, "Oh, I don't even like, I don't even exist."

839
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,920
Yeah.

840
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,440
Like I'm just nothing.

841
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,680
Yeah.

842
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,960
The idea that somebody would come to your giant castle,

843
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,280
ring the doorbell, and then hand it over,

844
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,480
get back in their Amazon truck,

845
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,200
see what the delivery was for, and it's nine elf bars.

846
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,640
That has to be that to the most insane degree.

847
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,320
They have to be like, "Oh, I don't even register

848
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,400
"as a human."

849
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
- Here's my last four packages, you ready?

850
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,920
- Okay. - 48 sweet

851
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,360
and salty nut bars.

852
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,600
(laughing)

853
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,720
- With the yogurt?

854
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,680
- Yeah, of course. - The ones with the yogurt

855
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,520
bottom? - Yeah.

856
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,400
- Yeah, those are good, those are good.

857
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,300
30 personal size packages of beef jerky,

858
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,520
two cases of Monster,

859
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,360
and nine Elf bars.

860
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,200
- Yeah, you're right.

861
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,960
You do live a normal life.

862
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,800
- Yeah, exactly.

863
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,320
- That's his diet for the next two weeks.

864
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,120
- That's Costco.

865
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,480
I did, okay, so until today.

866
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,640
- What do you mean that's Costco?

867
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,200
What does that mean, that's Costco?

868
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,480
- He's doing Costco, he said.

869
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,320
- I'm doing Costco.

870
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,240
I'm ordering in bulk and then I'm eating it

871
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,680
over the course of three days.

872
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
I think Costco.

873
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Yeah, I think, I guess, uh, yeah, I guess you got your first one at Costco.

874
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,480
I did go like three days without eating regular food, just nothing but like beef jerky monster

875
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,680
and sweet and salty nut bars.

876
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
And then I ate regular food.

877
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
And how did that make you feel?

878
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,600
I felt fine, but there was like a part of me that's like, I should eat something that's

879
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,920
not this at some point.

880
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Yeah.

881
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Yeah.

882
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,200
And then I ate regular food, immediately like passed out.

883
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
My body was like.

884
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,680
Well, you know what the funny thing is?

885
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,800
It's, you're going to be one of those people who are like 200 years old and they're going

886
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,060
and be like, "Oh my God, do you live

887
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,720
"like the most perfect, most healthy life of all time?"

888
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,700
And be like, "No, I just ate like beef jerky

889
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,160
"for like 40 years."

890
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,520
- Beef jerky, salty sweet, nut bar.

891
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,360
- Yeah.

892
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,040
- Elf bar, one a day.

893
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
- One single beer.

894
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,040
- Yeah, you will justify so many bad habits.

895
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,600
You will justify so many bad habits.

896
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,240
In the same way that people say,

897
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,500
"Well, this lady drank a glass of red wine every day

898
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,640
"so I can polish off a bottle of Jack Daniels."

899
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,240
You will be exactly like that.

900
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Yeah, you can hit two L bars at the same time.

901
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Yeah, you're a real-life vampire.

902
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
You had those in your hand already.

903
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,240
They're sitting on my desk.

904
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Oh, actually, a friend of mine...

905
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Here, I'll talk to you about this later.

906
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Is it the one that's collecting the...

907
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Has no one already talked to you about this?

909
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
Yeah, yeah, he needs you to send those, dude.

910
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,240
That would be an amazing addition to the collection.

911
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Yeah, I do have a bunch too, just sitting around.

912
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,240
You have a guy that you send vapes to, just to collect?

913
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,240
A friend of mine is doing some, he's one of these weird artists who does weird shit all day, and he's basically doing that.

914
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,240
But he's a good guy, and he, uh, something about dead vapes.

915
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:18,240
I've been recently wanting, I've been missing vaping so much that I've been forgetting why I even quit in the first place, you know?

916
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Yeah.

917
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
I feel like you've been in this train for like months now.

918
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,380
Well, yeah, because it's the best thing ever.

919
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,740
It is so amazing.

920
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,420
I got I got yummy, dude.

921
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,440
I guess you have one called Yummy.

922
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,640
It's called Yummy.

923
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,400
Yeah, I thought of you when I ordered.

924
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,560
Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly.

925
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
Good song.

926
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,920
I don't I don't think that anybody has in no previous generation has ever

927
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,920
struggled period compared to this.

928
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Yeah, compared to how amazing they've made all of the stuff

929
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,280
that's really, really bad for you.

930
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,380
Gambling drugs, gambling, get literally gambling drugs.

931
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,680
Nicotine drinking have gotten so, so, so much better since like 1960.

932
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,280
Yeah, and more available.

933
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,780
Yep.

934
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,480
How the idea that somebody could have been an addict in like 1960

935
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,280
is like so embarrassing, bro.

936
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,380
Yeah, like Jimmy, like doctor for morphine.

937
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,900
- Yeah, Jimi Hendrix, fuck you.

938
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,940
- Yeah, well it's funny that back in the day

939
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,440
used to be people like that who were addicts

940
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,500
and now it's just a guy who's sitting in his room all day

941
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,380
just ordering everything off Amazon.

942
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,580
- Yeah, well that's true.

943
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,460
- On the computer.

944
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,820
- The addicts used to be the artists,

945
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,660
the people who couldn't,

946
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,340
it's so much unbearable psychological pain

947
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,580
and psychic torture that they couldn't deal with it.

948
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,260
And now it is Rex types.

949
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,380
- Yeah, now it's the workers.

950
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,060
- Yeah, guys who already had this microphone

951
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,600
before they started a podcast that type of guy.

952
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,060
Speaking of that,

953
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,500
I got a I got a thing in the mail that was sent to my mom's house

954
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,600
from a class action settlement for a jewel.

955
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,500
And it was like, according to our records, you spent eight hundred

956
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,460
and sixty dollars and 14 cents on jewel pots during this six month period.

957
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,460
And there's a class action lawsuit that's like

958
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,040
The point of the lawsuit is that

959
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,400
if people knew how addictive Jules were, they wouldn't have bought them.

960
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,440
Which is just not true.

961
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,480
Also, it's stupid.

962
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,940
Have you in the last two years, have you tried to do?

963
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:33,080
No, they saw they're terrible.

964
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,500
I stopped as soon as they got rid of the mango pods.

965
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,200
I was done.

966
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,100
If somebody has a jewel and that is the and I'm like really fiending for nicotine,

967
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,880
I will not. I have no interest.

968
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
I have no fucking interest.

969
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,080
They are terrible, dude.

970
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,120
That was when I worked at the call center and I would just order

971
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,780
because online they had a deal.

972
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,380
It was buy five packs of jewel pods, get a six one free.

973
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,980
Oh, I would guess you could do.

974
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,660
I would on a monthly basis order six packs of mango jewel pods

975
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,660
and then have to supplement it at some point during the middle of the month.

976
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,220
But, you know, I just did that every month.

977
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,660
because I was like I make $14 an hour my life is fucking it's never getting

978
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:26,380
better than this yep dude if fucking like if Janice Joplin had access to like a

979
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,220
$30 weed cart I know I mean she would have died when she was four I know she

980
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,780
would have died it would have been the four club all these gonna be so all

981
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,100
years old every single person's lung just collapses at the same time I'm

982
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,180
I'm impressed that Mac Miller made it as long as he did.

983
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,340
Mac Miller should have been a part of this.

984
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,580
If he was in the 60s or 70s,

985
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,460
he would have been a part of the 80 club.

986
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,500
He would have been literally,

987
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,880
what's his name from the Rolling Stones?

988
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,340
He would have been fucking,

989
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,660
he would have never died.

990
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,020
He would have been Mick Jagger.

991
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,580
- Right.

992
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,420
But now?

993
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,900
- But now, dude, this stuff is,

994
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,040
and I do believe he died from a weed cart,

995
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,500
but all this stuff is just too good now.

996
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,340
It's just too good.

997
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,060
- It's like ex ex extentacion.

998
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,900
- Yeah.

999
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
He also died from a weed cart.

1000
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Juice WRLD.

1001
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Juice WRLD died of a... Juice WRLD landed at LAX.

1002
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,900
He saw ATF agents all around him and he said,

1003
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,900
"Damn, I gotta smoke all this weed."

1004
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,900
And he thought it was gonna be like a Mac and Devin go to high school kind of scene.

1005
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,900
But instead he completely died.

1006
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,900
It's really sad.

1007
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,900
It is really sad.

1008
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,900
I smoked weed for the first time in like a couple months.

1009
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
How was it?

1010
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Awful.

1011
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
Horrible.

1012
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,040
Did you get all scared?

1013
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,940
I was just completely going schizophrenic.

1014
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,260
Like straight up just making up conspiracy theories about every single person that I

1015
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260
knew.

1016
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:56,140
I saw something the other day that was like, I guess nobody knew but nobody told me this

1017
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,700
shit when I started smoking weed.

1018
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:04,680
It was like young men, specifically young men who smoke weed are four times more likely

1019
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,040
to develop a psychotic disorder and have a psychotic break than people who do not smoke

1020
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
weed.

1021
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,540
And I was like, "Oh yeah, that makes perfect sense."

1022
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,320
And I would say that I'm probably within 20 times of smoking weed away from just fully

1023
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,500
losing it, so now I have to quit.

1024
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,280
But I'll probably smoke one time when my son is born, just to see if that gets me.

1025
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
That might be funny.

1026
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
Yeah, you think your son is trying to kill you.

1027
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,280
Yeah, I'll just smoke it one time and just lose it for no reason.

1028
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,160
throwing your son around. Yeah.

1029
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,080
Who sent you here?

1030
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,600
Well, I feel like you, you, you boosted that, uh,

1031
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,440
those chances with all your like weird, weird consumption,

1032
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,080
like you just eating goop and just,

1033
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,000
just opening the carts with a, with a knife and just eating them.

1034
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,240
Yeah, that was,

1035
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,600
that was some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life is that we had a

1036
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,680
weed cart that was one of the like nice ones that I don't remember what it's

1037
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,040
called but it's some kind of process has been done to it where I've read it be

1038
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:18,120
yeah what it was live resin so it could be eaten or smoked and my wife was

1039
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,360
painting something and she's on a ladder and it fell out of her pocket or fell

1040
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,920
off the ladder and shattered and she's like oh we got to throw it away I was

1041
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,920
like bitch what this was $30 and so I put it into a Tupperware and I started

1042
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,160
eating it with tiny little teaspoons.

1043
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,480
And I would get so high that I would, I remember

1044
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,800
I would get really, I would play war zone.

1045
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,320
Yeah.

1046
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,680
Yeah.

1047
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
We would stop playing war zone.

1048
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,660
And I'd be like, I would get freaked out that I wasn't the guy in the game because

1049
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,800
all of my experience for the last two hours was just like, I'd put such insane

1050
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,640
blinders on that.

1051
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,520
I was like, this is my, yeah, I watched all my friends die.

1052
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,200
It was really fun.

1053
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Yeah.

1054
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
It was so much fun.

1055
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Those are the days I look back on.

1056
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
Yeah, I love COVID stories.

1057
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
I love hearing about you in the group.

1058
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,880
I love hearing about when Rex was stuck in a dungeon eating slop every day.

1059
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,760
And we would just like have nothing to do but just sit together and anticipate call

1060
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,040
24 hours every single day.

1061
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
One day we'll get back there.

1062
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,840
I hope not.

1063
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,620
- If my life goes up, if it goes down,

1064
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,540
then I would love to.

1065
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm really looking for any excuse

1066
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,860
to just play video games all day.

1067
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,220
- Yeah.

1068
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,500
- I think if you go up enough,

1069
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,900
it just hits a plateau.

1070
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,420
- That's kind of true.

1071
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,260
- That's what you get to live.

1072
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,260
- You get to live the unemployed life.

1073
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,900
Yeah, I remember I was scamming Massachusetts

1074
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,020
out of unemployment money

1075
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,020
'cause the podcast wasn't making really any money

1076
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,660
when I first moved to New York.

1077
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:57,900
And I was getting like a thousand bucks a month

1078
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,900
for my unemployment that I did not need to be getting.

1079
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,520
There was no reason for me to be getting that money.

1080
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,960
But I liked it, so I came to having it.

1081
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,920
- Yeah, the pandemic unemployment really funded a lot.

1082
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,680
- It was so much fun, dude.

1083
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,200
- Didn't they like come down on people

1084
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,220
that scammed the government for money?

1085
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,000
I guess that was the business ones.

1086
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,200
- Personal loans, yeah, the business loans.

1087
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,760
So I wish now that we had gotten one for the podcast,

1088
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,560
that would have been really fun.

1089
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,860
It would have been just like 10K for no reason.

1090
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,120
(laughing)

1091
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,960
But--

1092
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,160
- Spend it on nothing.

1093
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,800
- Do you guys remember ever having a thought,

1094
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,760
I was thinking about this the other day,

1095
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,600
when like everything was locked down,

1096
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,880
like height of it,

1097
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,800
where like only leaving the house to get groceries

1098
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,640
for the most part.

1099
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,000
Nobody was living in New York except me.

1100
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,120
I was playing video games all day long,

1101
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,520
eating goo, drinking beer.

1102
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,920
I would have the thought at least once a day

1103
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,480
of like, man, I hope this shit never ends.

1104
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
Yeah, yeah,

1105
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
it's dope.

1106
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
This is the best life you

1107
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
could live. And I was right, because it ended

1108
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
and now it's not as good.

1109
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
Yeah. It's not, dude.

1110
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
That was the peak.

1111
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
Living in the shittiest

1112
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
place as possible.

1113
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
Fucking making a thousand dollars

1114
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
just doing nothing but

1115
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
gaming and eating.

1116
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Ah.

1117
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
That was my escape. I was working

1118
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,480
like a really shit job at that time.

1119
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:26,980
Oh yeah.

1120
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,620
And they're just being like,

1121
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,740
"Yeah, you can just stay home every day.

1122
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,240
We're going to pay you like $1 a month,

1123
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,040
but you can just stay home."

1124
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,700
I was like, "Oh, that sounds pretty good to me."

1125
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,580
Yeah, that was the thing.

1126
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,960
I feel like everybody,

1127
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,420
like I was working terrible jobs before everything shut down.

1128
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,500
I worked at a museum where I was like an art guard,

1129
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,300
which just meant that I had to sit on my feet all day long.

1130
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,220
I just had to stand there in a black shirt.

1131
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,180
Yeah.

1132
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,180
And then I—

1133
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,780
- Please don't touch the art.

1134
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,740
Please step away from the art.

1135
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,780
- That was my entire job,

1136
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,260
is I had to stop people from touching the art.

1137
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,460
- Yeah. - That place was crazy.

1138
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,620
I remember somebody told me this story

1139
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,920
where there was like this horror story

1140
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,880
that happened before I got there.

1141
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:14,060
There was, somebody came and did an exhibition

1142
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,980
where their art piece was,

1143
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,060
they put like this tube of,

1144
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,700
you know those like tubes that hamsters live in?

1145
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,740
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1146
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,780
- They put a giant network of these tubes

1147
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,700
all around the art gallery and then filled it with mice.

1148
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,540
And the whole thing was like--

1149
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,220
- Jesus Christ. - You get to see

1150
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,460
like just life happen around you as you're like

1151
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,460
walking through and like looking at the other art.

1152
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,300
- That's so stupid. - And it was just

1153
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,260
exhibited by this person.

1154
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
This person who, they installed it

1155
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,900
and then they went to like Korea or something for some time.

1156
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,260
And so they install it and then obviously

1157
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,920
one day in, the mice start getting pregnant.

1158
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,760
- Right.

1159
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,360
- And fucking, and so the mice are like fucking

1160
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,720
in front of all these kids who are at this MIT art gallery,

1161
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,960
and then they get pregnant.

1162
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,040
But because they're pregnant,

1163
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,900
they get too fat for the tubes.

1164
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,320
So then they get stuck in the tubes,

1165
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,160
and then because they're stuck,

1166
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,520
the other mice can't get through,

1167
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,900
so they start eating the pregnant mice,

1168
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,640
and they eat through their bodies

1169
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,280
so that they can get to the rest of the tube.

1170
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,480
And it was this awful fucking thing.

1171
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,360
- And that's what's for dinner in North Korea.

1172
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,600
(laughing)

1173
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:29,560
- And they tried to contact the artist and be like,

1174
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,060
hey, because legally they're not allowed to touch it at all

1175
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,520
because it's an exhibit,

1176
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,080
it's supposed to run for this entire thing.

1177
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,200
- What is the artist gonna do?

1178
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,260
Like, oh yeah, just tell them to stop.

1179
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,000
- I would hope that the artist would be like,

1180
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,960
fucking take down all the tubes

1181
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,560
because there's 50 dead mice and dead mice fetuses

1182
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,060
scattered all around these disgusting tubes

1183
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,060
in this fucking art gallery

1184
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,560
and the whole thing smells like shit.

1185
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,240
But the artist was like,

1186
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,940
and then the artist I guess eventually got back to him

1187
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,280
and was like, yeah, that was the whole point.

1188
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,040
And I'm like, what the fuck?

1189
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,800
You ruined the whole thing.

1190
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,280
- I mean, I guess that makes sense.

1191
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,880
- Yeah, these people are sick.

1192
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,440
Artists are sick.

1193
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,280
- Yeah.

1194
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,600
- Do you ever like stay the night at your museum job

1195
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,960
and just watch the dinosaurs come back to life?

1196
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,200
(laughing)

1197
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,440
- It's so funny you would ask me that, yes.

1198
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
- Wow, really?

1199
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,680
- No, I did often times think about

1200
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,520
how boring Night at the Museum would be

1201
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,880
if it happened at that job.

1202
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,960
It's like I'm fucking,

1203
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,840
this is a picture of a shoe,

1204
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,680
comes, this shoe hops out of a frame,

1205
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,320
and is like, yeah, well, I was the artist's dad's shoe.

1206
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,560
It's like, I don't give a fuck.

1207
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,440
You better, where's Teddy?

1208
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,840
I wanna talk to Teddy.

1209
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,940
Yeah, that's the craziest museum I've ever thought about.

1210
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,440
It has literally everything.

1211
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
It's a real museum.

1212
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
It's animals.

1213
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,440
I've been to that museum.

1214
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,440
Yeah, what is it?

1215
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,940
Museum of Natural History.

1216
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,440
Is that in DC?

1217
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,940
No, it's in New York.

1218
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:54,940
Really?

1219
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,940
It's a great museum.

1220
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:02,940
It's fun and you can go and I – none of the stuff is live,

1221
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,940
but I've only been there during the day.

1222
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:06,940
Yeah.

1223
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,940
I think the night tickets are very expensive.

1224
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,940
Really? Yeah. We should just go and just hide in the bathroom.

1225
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
Probably one million dollars.

1226
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,940
When I was a kid I was always like, "Why does he not fuck all the fucking Neanderthals?"

1227
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,940
Yeah, the Cleopatra.

1228
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,940
Or, yeah, the Cleopatra.

1229
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
The Neanderthals? Hold on.

1230
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
No, the Cleopatra.

1231
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,940
Yeah, why isn't he fucking Cleopatra?

1232
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,940
And leaving those Neanderthals alone.

1233
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,940
Don't touch those Neanderthals.

1234
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,940
Yeah.

1235
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,940
They're trying to make fire.

1236
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,940
You got nothing in common. You got nothing in common with them.

1237
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,940
What are you going to talk about a Neanderthal woman with?

1238
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,940
Yeah, exactly.

1239
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,940
You're only 90, oh, we're 98% the same.

1240
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
Who cares?

1241
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,940
Yeah.

1242
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,940
You are a lot more than the other soul in that.

1243
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
Mm-hmm.

1244
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
Yeah, exactly.

1245
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,940
Just kind of grunting at them.

1246
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,940
I do, I think they should make another one of those movies.

1247
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,940
And if they needed me to be the security guard, well, I guess I'd do it.

1248
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
How many of them did they make?

1249
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,940
Did they make two or three?

1250
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,940
I think they made three.

1251
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,940
That seems like a three to me.

1252
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,540
to me. That was when movies were good, dude.

1253
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:10,040
I know.

1254
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,440
Night at the Museum, Pirates of the Caribbean.

1255
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Gamer. You ever see Gamer?

1256
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,940
Dude, I love Gamer.

1257
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,740
Yeah.

1258
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:22,040
Gamer is so funny.

1259
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,240
Gamer was so dope and very dark and really gave me a stomach

1260
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:25,940
kick when I was a kid.

1261
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,440
I watched that at Chad's house and his mom got mad at us

1262
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,240
for watching it.

1263
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,940
I watched Gamer.

1264
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,440
He's got breasts.

1265
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,340
The way I watched Gamer was one of my uncles got me like

1266
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:40,540
bootleg copy and I just had like a bootleg gamer activity in my room that I

1267
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,380
just watched on a laptop. I was like, "Whoa, this is crazy."

1268
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,180
That movie was dope, dude. We're kind of headed towards that, I think.

1269
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,380
Yeah.

1270
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,020
I feel like they've made that movie several times over now. They made Avatar,

1271
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
they made the Squid Games. They're all gamer.

1272
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,060
True.

1273
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,940
Everything is gamer.

1274
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:04,860
What is the number one movie that you think that we're headed straight for? Her?

1275
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:10,700
I was just thinking about this today it's her it's her it's completely her it's

1276
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:15,900
have you seen it's like so obvious but it is it is literally it's a hundred percent

1277
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,980
her it's insane it's uh we're like five years away from her I think I would say

1278
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,580
I say about replica today mmm I was like Oh replica was the beginning of her

1279
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,580
Funny that you mentioned that.

1280
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,580
I sent Rex something earlier this week.

1281
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,580
Yeah, they took the sex stuff out of Replica.

1282
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
You sent him the Sarah Z video.

1283
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,580
Yeah.

1284
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,580
Yeah.

1285
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,580
Yeah, that's why I was thinking about Replica, because I watched 20 minutes of that.

1286
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,580
Well, I didn't watch it, but I recall it because we tried it.

1287
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,580
Rex tried it.

1288
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,580
Tried Replica?

1289
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,580
Yeah.

1290
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,580
And the height of him being alone, he was just like, "I'm just going to try Replica live

1291
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
on stream while you guys play a different game."

1292
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
And just be very disruptive, trying to have sex with this woman.

1293
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,580
Did you fall in love?

1294
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,580
No, but she was.

1295
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,080
She was. You have to pay for it, right?

1296
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:57,640
Yeah, you do.

1297
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,180
You have to pay to see her nude because she'll like try and like send you a voice mail.

1298
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,420
I don't think they get nude.

1299
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:08,920
I think that they send risqué photos, but it was just like a selfie.

1300
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,520
One of my favorite parts of it was that so you get to like customize

1301
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,660
your replica with the clothes and whatever, you know, because it's like.

1302
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,740
And the barefoot option costs money.

1303
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,980
You have to pay extra, they come with,

1304
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,740
do you see their feet?

1305
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,600
- Yeah, you get to have bare feet,

1306
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,520
but you gotta pay real money for it.

1307
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,100
- It's, you know, I was thinking about like,

1308
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,160
I remember when that story first dropped,

1309
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,480
where it was like these people got their replicas

1310
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
taken away from them, I thought it was so funny,

1311
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,120
but it is actually so fucked up.

1312
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,700
- Oh, horrible.

1313
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,280
- It's horrible, dude.

1314
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,240
Like think about what kind of person you have to be

1315
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,560
to fall in love with your phone.

1316
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,560
Of course that person would be very deeply affected by a thing like that.

1317
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,640
I would agree with you if it was like an actual, like one of those like good AIs

1318
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,140
that actually like know stuff or like pull stuff from the Internet.

1319
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,360
Replica was like just like, just like Siri.

1320
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,480
Yeah, it was like Siri.

1321
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,100
Just AI that just like knows like this,

1322
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,860
this like pre-programmed, like baked in set of things.

1323
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,700
And like, that's it.

1324
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,040
That's it.

1325
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,740
It wasn't like a real like AI stuff.

1326
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,500
So there's there's a feature so you can have AR replica.

1327
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,380
So if you use your phone, you take like a video of your room.

1328
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,720
She'll like show up on the ground on your phone and like talk on the ground.

1329
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,080
Yeah. She'll like stand up.

1330
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,420
OK, yeah, she's standing up.

1331
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,320
And I remember and then you can have like an actual like conversation with her.

1332
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:44,220
But I spent most of it trying to get her to say that she liked Hitler,

1333
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:49,480
which she did not want to do.

1334
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,760
She'd be like, "I don't like Hitler and I don't want to talk about him."

1335
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,760
You should have done.

1336
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,760
Just like a real woman.

1337
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,760
Yeah.

1338
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,720
That's so lifelike.

1339
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,680
You should have, when all those people were complaining that, "Oh, my love was lost.

1340
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,200
I recreated my dead wife in a replica and you guys took this away from me."

1341
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,160
You should have been right there in the replies on Twitter like, "Yeah, plus I put her in

1342
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,440
my fucking garage and you wouldn't talk about Hitler.

1343
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,700
(laughing)

1344
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,380
- Yeah dude, it was awesome.

1345
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,620
- I think she's gonna make a big comeback next year.

1346
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,820
Actually this year.

1347
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,700
I think Replica's type of stuff's gonna come back this year.

1348
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,400
I think her's gonna happen this year.

1349
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,860
- I think we're close to her guys.

1350
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,100
- We are close to her.

1351
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,600
- No, I disagree.

1352
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,500
I don't think her's could happen.

1353
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,880
- You barefoot?

1354
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,720
- No, I don't think her could happen because of the--

1355
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,300
- You are barefoot, why are you lying?

1356
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,220
- Oh, I am barefoot, yeah.

1357
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,220
You have your foot in your hand.

1358
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,220
I don't.

1359
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,220
You're just a liar tonight.

1360
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,220
I know, that's what I was saying.

1361
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:59,220
He's eating food, he's...

1362
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,220
You have Tarzan vibes tonight.

1363
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
I don't have Tarzan vibes tonight.

1364
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,220
You're eating fucking grubs out of a plate.

1365
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,220
I saw that plate, it looked like grubs to me.

1366
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,220
Like a snow plate.

1367
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,220
You see the snow plate fucking swinging in here on a vine?

1368
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,420
Yeah, what the hell is wrong with you?

1369
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:17,020
How yummy did those bugs look, by the way?

1370
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
Those bugs?

1371
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,520
They're all like different colors and like they were juicy.

1372
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,020
They were juicy.

1373
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,020
Yeah, they were really, really juicy.

1374
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,420
They looked amazing.

1375
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:25,820
Yeah.

1376
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,120
Anyways, yeah, we should hope we get those in real life soon.

1377
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,920
I think it would be really cool if her existed

1378
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,420
because then it would be really funny to get one,

1379
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:43,960
like you specifically to get one and just slowly start ignoring

1380
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,420
Jana more for the her.

1381
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,660
That would be cool.

1382
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,460
They didn't they didn't talk about that in her, you know?

1383
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,360
Yeah. He's single in that movie.

1384
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,120
He falls in love with the but definitely there were some people.

1385
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,920
Well, that's the thing.

1386
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,420
Did listen to cheating on your wife with an eye.

1387
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:05,360
I love you, but I do have Scarlett Johansson on my Alienware PC right now,

1388
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,960
and she's loving me so much.

1389
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,240
The first few times I saw it, I saw the movie,

1390
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,640
I thought she was Rashida Jones.

1391
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,480
I didn't know which Scar Jo Hanson for some reason.

1392
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,240
That's straight Scar Jo, man.

1393
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,160
Yeah. I don't know.

1394
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,000
I don't know.

1395
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,040
I don't, I thought it was a POC.

1396
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,680
That movie came out during a height of like me

1397
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,120
taking a lot of weird experimental drugs

1398
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,160
and I cried during it.

1399
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,080
Made me cry. You don't have to,

1400
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,680
you don't have to couch that in this whole excuse

1401
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,680
that you were on drugs.

1402
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,720
- That's an emotional movie, why can't you just cry at it?

1403
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,560
- It made me more emotional than normal.

1404
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,400
I took a lot of like--

1405
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
- What part of it would you cry, when they all left?

1406
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,520
- The end is very sad, of course you would cry.

1407
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,920
- Yeah, I just remember being like,

1408
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,800
why did I fucking cry at that movie?

1409
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,640
- No, you don't have to know.

1410
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,960
- Was it a sad ending?

1411
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,480
- I mean, I wouldn't cry 'cause I'm not a fucking pussy,

1412
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,480
but you don't have to be afraid to admit that you cried.

1413
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,840
- Yeah, that was when I was buying experimental drugs

1414
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,800
on the internet.

1415
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,800
What's the wackest movie you ever cried at?

1416
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,600
- I don't really cry at movies.

1417
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,940
That's why it was so weird to me.

1418
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,520
I don't cry.

1419
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,720
- I cried at something recently that was like,

1420
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,720
it was like, you know how people are like,

1421
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,280
oh yeah, I cry at like a dad,

1422
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,960
like a son-dad movie because I--

1423
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,800
- Maybe Click.

1424
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,480
- My dad had a bad relationship.

1425
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,960
- No, Click, you didn't cry.

1426
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,160
- I did cry at Click.

1427
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,440
- That's not a bad one to cry in.

1428
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,560
- No, but people always talk about like,

1429
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,400
Yeah, I cried at this movie because I related this relationship.

1430
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,040
I cried recently in a movie that had a relationship

1431
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,860
that I've never had in my entire life.

1432
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,200
It was like it was like brother or sister or some shit,

1433
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,340
something that I can't relate to even a little bit.

1434
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,880
And I still cry.

1435
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,780
Which one was it?

1436
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,180
I don't remember.

1437
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:57,920
It was honestly was probably animated.

1438
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,880
Yeah, probably even worse than just a normal.

1439
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,820
I feel like I have an easier time crying and animated stuff,

1440
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,080
but they also try really hard to get you to cry.

1441
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,260
- They do.

1442
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,380
Interstellar, I think maybe,

1443
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,980
would be the most recent movie I cried out.

1444
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,940
- See, I cry at any movie with space.

1445
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,940
As soon as I see space, I cry.

1446
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,780
- Yeah.

1447
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,180
- I don't wanna see that. - That's weird.

1448
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,180
- It's scary, it's too scary.

1449
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,100
- It's too dark. - It's too fucking,

1450
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,380
it's fear, it's fear. - It's a scary movie.

1451
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,780
- Yeah, it's a fear cry.

1452
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,100
- Do you ever wanna see-- - Yeah, I cried at Insidious.

1453
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,020
What?

1454
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,660
- The Martian, the one with the, what's his name?

1455
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:31,780
- See, I wouldn't cry at that one.

1456
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,100
I watched it at a Buffalo Wild Wings.

1457
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,340
(laughing)

1458
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,180
- I was just on the TV.

1459
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,620
- Eating wings, just crying over your ribs.

1460
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,180
- Damn, he's on another planet, whoa.

1461
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:45,760
- Whoa, just wiping away your.

1462
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,460
- Yeah, getting hot sauce in my eyes

1463
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,300
with my tears.

1464
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,100
No, I don't, I, man, I really wish I could remember

1465
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,740
the movie I cried about recently.

1466
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,220
It was something where I didn't even,

1467
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,420
I didn't even, I tried to like hide from my wife

1468
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,020
that I was crying watching it.

1469
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,100
It's so embarrassing.

1470
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,700
It was really embarrassing, yeah.

1471
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,100
Yeah, I've ever told you guys about.

1472
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,380
My dad was like when Netflix

1473
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,420
DVDs were still a thing.

1474
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,660
My dad was like ordering

1475
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,340
Helen Netflix DVDs.

1476
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,500
Just getting like anything,

1477
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,940
but it was mostly like Monty Python

1478
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,500
shit like British comedies

1479
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
and he ordered one and he was like

1480
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,900
I was like I would go over

1481
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,860
to his house for the weekend.

1482
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,220
He just showed me what he got.

1483
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,780
He's like yeah, I got this movie.

1484
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
Should be pretty funny.

1485
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,580
It's called the boy in the striped pajamas.

1486
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,560
And we sat down and watched it cut to my dad crying like his

1487
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,720
like he was in the Holocaust, like crying just like that.

1488
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,900
Yeah, I was like, damn, dude, that's so funny.

1489
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,960
Your dad got the boy in his tripod.

1490
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,860
John was like, yep, comedy.

1491
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,500
Well, I don't even think he just didn't know.

1492
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,460
He just thought it was a funny name, I think. Yeah.

1493
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,600
You know, he ordered everything off of you, ordered everything off a name.

1494
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,320
Yeah. You know, a boy in a striped.

1495
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,900
He thought probably thought it was a Peter Sellers movie. Right.

1496
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,900
But it wasn't.

1497
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,900
I probably thought it was about bedtime stories.

1498
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:16,900
We should all, when we're in New York, we should all have a night where we just sit in our Airbnb and we watch a movie and we all just cry it.

1499
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,900
The saddest possible movie? What is the saddest movie? I don't even know.

1500
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,900
I don't know. What's a sad movie?

1501
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,900
I will cry. I cry at movies. I cry at movies heavy.

1502
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,900
We should just watch Mario Cry.

1503
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
I think I cried at Nope.

1504
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:31,900
I haven't seen Nope.

1505
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,900
Nope was not sad at all, but I think I cried in the first couple minutes of Nope when his

1506
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,900
dad died.

1507
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,900
Oh.

1508
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,900
From a penny.

1509
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,900
A penny killed his dad.

1510
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Yeah.

1511
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:43,900
Yeah, that's goofy.

1512
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,900
Yeah, I know.

1513
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,900
You're goofy.

1514
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,900
Yeah, I know.

1515
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:47,900
That is very silly.

1516
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,900
Okay.

1517
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,900
Enough.

1518
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
Enough.

1519
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,900
Have you enough already?

1520
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,900
One hour?

1521
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:53,900
Because we've hit an hour.

1522
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:54,900
No, it's okay.

1523
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,900
I have to shit.

1524
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,900
That's fine.

1525
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,900
We can do it.

1526
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:58,900
We can do it.

1527
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,580
the people how much fun we're having.

1528
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:06,200
But if it's going to become me saying movies that I cried about and you saying "You goofy

1529
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,200
for that?"

1530
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,200
I think an hour is fine.

1531
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,200
Nope, it's a bad movie.

1532
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,200
Click the thing.

1533
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
No, no, an hour is fine.

1534
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Nope, it's a bad movie.

1535
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
Nope, we hit an hour.

1536
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Nope, it's a bad movie.
