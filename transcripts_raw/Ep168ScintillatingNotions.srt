1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,040
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,860
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,700
(explosion)

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,080
- Oh man, I wish I could get an elephant man disease

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,920
on my nuts.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,960
- That exists.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,800
- I know, dude.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,640
I've seen the video, the guy just--

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,480
- The video where he's bouncing around on 'em?

13
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,120
- He has to wear the sweatshirt over his pants.

14
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,240
- Yeah, he wears like a onesie.

15
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,080
- He wears a hoodie.

16
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,560
- And he just bounces around on his balls all day.

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,640
- Dude, I wish I could.

18
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,480
- That's the life.

19
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,920
(laughing)

20
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Yeah, I honestly if I had something like that maybe I will be completely fine with being just a zoo animal that yeah

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,640
We'll just like pay them. Yeah, cuz like I get I get everything taken care of you know what you could and I just fucking chill

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,820
Yeah, cuz I what's what's harder

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,940
And if you have giant balls that you have to bounce on all day or giant everything else or giant everything else is giant everything

24
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:56,600
Else tiniest balls in the world that's that no that's like the most successful man ever

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,880
But if you have just giant balls, is it harder to be like go like try to interview to be a

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,200
bank teller or is it harder to be a zoo animal?

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,240
It's probably way harder to try to be a normal guy.

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,960
It's probably easy to be a normal guy, it's just people will stare at you.

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,240
What you could do is get like a face tattooed on the giant balls.

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
But then if people are staring at you, you'd get mad but you wouldn't get mad if they paid

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you five dollars to stare at you.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,840
- Yeah.

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,680
- You know?

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,500
- I think we're just reinventing the freak show.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
- A good bank teller gets tips.

36
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,340
(laughing)

37
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,740
- That's true.

38
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,820
- Have you not been tipping your bank teller?

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,660
- 10% of everything you take out and put in.

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,500
- Of every check.

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,320
- Yeah.

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,160
- 18%.

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,880
- There's a gratuity included.

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,720
- Gratuity added.

45
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,220
- In your receipt.

46
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,060
- Yeah.

47
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,360
- Damn, I went to the bank today just to put

48
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
like cash in my account.

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,900
- Yeah.

50
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,720
- And I,

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I have not walked into a bank in a while.

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,400
Probably the last time I walked into a bank was to open up my checking account when I

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
was 17.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,840
I used to pay my rent here with a cashier's check.

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Those suck.

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Yeah, it sucks.

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
And then I didn't know, I banked America and the lady, it was always the same teller every

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
month and I guess it takes forever.

59
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,640
It takes like fucking 15 minutes for them to do it.

60
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,920
And one time, probably the sixth or seventh time I did it, she was just like, "You know

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,640
that you can just pay this online."

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,480
Because I guess they have some bill pay thing where they'll basically just send an automated

63
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
cashier's check.

64
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,520
So she just got mad at me because I would just waste her time every fucking -- on the first

65
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
of every month.

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
The cashier's check, is that the one that costs money too?

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah, it costs like $15.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
It costs like $10.

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Yeah.

70
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Yeah, because that shit's so big.

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,080
And also if you lose it, it's just gone.

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
It's gone, yeah.

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
You just lose the money.

74
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Literally the worst idea of all time.

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,760
I was so terrified walking with my entire rent back to my house.

76
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,120
When we got accepted for our apartment here, I had to get a cashier's check from the bank

77
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,720
and I had to FedEx it to here from Boston.

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,640
And so I had to, basically, I had an envelope in my hand with thousands of dollars in it.

79
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:17,080
I had to walk from like Austin to Brookline to get to the FedEx store.

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,560
I feel like you're the fucking...

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,760
And it was windy as fuck.

82
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,400
I feel like you're the transporter, dude.

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,160
It was terrifying.

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,680
No, I didn't have anything that I could...

85
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,400
Well, also, I feel like it'd be way less secure to put it in like a pocket,

86
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,440
because it would just like...

87
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
Versus like holding it in my hand.

88
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,960
Any time I have a cashier's check in my hand,

89
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,120
I expect to be like trying to cross the street,

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
and then like a black suburban pulls up,

91
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,240
and a bunch of like Japanese hitmen get out and try to fucking kill me.

92
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,040
Well, if I put it in a pocket, it's going to fly out of the pocket.

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,040
But then because the mental thing that happens in your brain, you have to hold onto it.

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Exactly.

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
If I let go, it's gone.

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
I would pay my rent in Boston.

97
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
I would pay my rent in Boston.

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Yeah, I wouldn't.

99
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Literally, I'll only hold it in my hand.

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,360
What if somebody steals the jacket off my back?

101
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,880
Also, if someone steals the jacket, they can't even cash it.

102
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,960
It's just like, if I robbed somebody and I just had to frame it and put it on my wall.

103
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:16,680
$10,000 just that nobody could ever use my first $10,000 yeah $10,000 I stole

104
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,120
this is like a read it's like having the like a cash out voucher from a casino

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
yeah exactly which is what I do I have a cash voucher because I forgot to cash

106
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
out on the riverboat I have one for Caesars for a single cent yeah I have a

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,920
few I kind of want to just collect all my penny ones yeah well that's what you

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,320
you'll save them you bring them back. Oh see I just think it'd be funny to have like

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,600
maybe have like when I'm older like a scrapbook on my coffee table that just

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,160
like the cover is like maybe a photo of me and Jana at our wedding or something

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:57,760
and then you open it and it's all just one cent cash out vouchers from casinos. Yeah I feel like that's a good idea. Show it to my kids.

112
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,440
You could make like a museum like a gambling, a Caleb's

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,240
gambling museum. I cover an entire room. Yeah. Angela Sawyer in Boston, she has a

114
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,280
she had like her living room was just covered in parking tickets. Just do that

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,760
with yeah with Caesars vouchers for one single penny. I think I'd do that with

116
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,000
dollar bills. But then you can't spend that. You wouldn't be able to spend that. I live in a one million dollar home. No. You would live in a one dollar home.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You do it with one dollar bill. Yeah, because it's one dollar on the wall but I had to put it up a million times. No. You would put the same dollar up a

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,440
million times because you couldn't decide where to put it. Yeah, you'd be so

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:40,200
indecisive about it. Do you guys believe in Feng Shui? Yeah. Feng Shui. Feng Shui?

120
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,920
Feng Shui? You believe in Feng Shui? I never think... I don't know. Honestly, I didn't

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,760
believe in Feng Shui until that one time you brought it up that we were at

122
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,360
Wawa. Wawa is the strongest case for the existence of Feng Shui I've ever

123
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,040
seen. Because it just lacks it. It's, yeah, well it's the worst. You don't notice it.

124
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,540
So it's huge clog of energy completely. It's literally just stressful to be in

125
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
there at all.

126
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,340
It's like white noise. It's like you don't realize it till it's gone. Yeah. And

127
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,340
that's exactly how Wawa is.

128
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,580
Yeah. I mean I think I mean I don't I think it is like if you go into a house

129
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,500
that it like has like everything is like placed fucked up and there's like no

130
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,180
space like it feels claustrophobic and shitty. Like it feels bad. Like your

131
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,660
apartment feels bad to be in there. Like that's yeah there's an energy that

132
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
affects you.

133
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,860
Well it was way worse when we first moved in but now the living room is all about that.

134
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
I feel like I get distracted.

135
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
I feel like I'm recording.

136
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
It's bad feng shui.

137
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,340
I feel like I'm in a pinball machine when I'm at your house.

138
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,500
This apartment is pretty good feng shui I feel like.

139
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,340
Yeah that's why I'm never home.

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,300
I just realized that's probably why I'm never home.

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
It's feng shui.

142
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Yeah.

143
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Shit.

144
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Feng shui is real.

145
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,700
Oh that's because the winter is coming up I'm going to be forced into my home.

146
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Feng shui.

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,020
What are you saying?

148
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,300
Feng shui.

149
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,860
What the fuck are you saying you idiot.

150
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,620
- Oh, fung, not fuck.

151
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,020
- Feng Shui.

152
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,580
F-E-N-G.

153
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,060
- Yeah, I know it's spelled.

154
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,140
- Feng.

155
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,020
- Fwong.

156
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,860
- Shui.

157
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,980
- Fwong.

158
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,820
- No.

159
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,660
- Fwong.

160
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,480
- Don't like where this is going.

161
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
- Fwong.

162
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,020
- Okay, it's kind of going Muppets right now.

163
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,460
That's better, that's a better direction.

164
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,300
That's funny.

165
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,380
- There we go.

166
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,420
- I did find, this just reminded me,

167
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,300
I found a website about Feng Shui.

168
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,220
- FengShui.com.

169
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
- Weeks ago, I was reading,

170
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,900
I was reading a bunch of articles about different Feng Shui,

171
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,340
so let me see if I can find it.

172
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,980
there's like a guidelines of like what kind of welcome mat you can have or not

173
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,660
have

174
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,340
so it's like a lake welcome mats with like like jokes on them those are really

175
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,860
like negative and i had fun yeah i will like it's a little like well it's a

176
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,300
little like a little you're having in the like a dot like a welcome mat

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,020
there's a little about like this was about the the colors and stuff to like

178
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,260
there's always yell and say i would agree any any sarcastic uh... the

179
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,500
sarcastic welcome at you and i guess what you're saying is saying a bad

180
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:01,140
Yeah, every single day you come home from work and you're like a reference you're treated with like fucking sarcasm or a fucking TARDIS on your

181
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,500
Welcome hat dude fuck that. It also depends on the direction of the door

182
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,020
That's like how what color the the mat is is like depends on which direction the door

183
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,900
I think I'm gonna forget believing in everything. Forget cutesy sayings and monogrammed mats. No one's home

184
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,660
No rugrats allowed and beware the cat are guaranteed to chase away positive

185
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,060
chief she or at least give a pause placing your name or initials under foot just

186
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,140
means people are stepping on a wiping their duty dirty shoes on the smith

187
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,380
jones residence every time they visit why would you want that

188
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,980
holiday match should be displayed with extreme care

189
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,580
no kids here clutter designs and removed promptly when the holiday period ends

190
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,820
faded bt flip-flops in february or happy holidays with points that is

191
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,700
in july signals that you're lazy or just don't care about the all-important portal

192
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,060
at the gate of your home

193
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,020
That's not a good message for guests or good fortune.

194
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,260
- I will say that on my street,

195
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,340
they put up, they already put up the Christmas decorations.

196
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm getting bad vibes on the street.

197
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,900
- Sucks. - Dude, yeah.

198
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,180
- I'm getting really bad vibes.

199
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,100
That is a chi blocker.

200
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

201
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,700
- Those are chi catchers.

202
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,780
They are catching the chi.

203
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,780
Put up like a turkey.

204
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,060
You don't have to put up like a Christmas tree already.

205
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,660
Bunch of jingle bells and fucking--

206
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,980
- I hate this. - I hate the smells.

207
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,700
- Christmas on November 1st is horrible.

208
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,660
- Yeah, that's the worst.

209
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,500

211
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,500

212
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,620
December. Yeah. It's like I'd rather, you know, I'd rather have some

213
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,500
beautiful, like colorful, beautiful, most beautiful lights, you know, nice lit-up

214
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,900
Star of David. Why not a cornucopia? Mm-hmm. Well, that's the other thing about

215
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,260
Thanksgiving is it's a colonizer holiday. So is Halloween.

216
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,860
ever think about that so it's Christmas you ever think about every holiday is

217
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,220
Easter Easter's the most colonizer holiday eggs fucking colonizing the

218
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,260
bushes in my back you know it is rabbit trying to come through indigenous

219
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:05,080
people's day yeah yeah big time big time dude yeah do you know why it's on that

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,180
day because of Columbus because of Columbus yeah yeah you know what he did

221
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,780
mmm no he discovered America that's right and they called they colonized that

222
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,580
holiday away from him yeah dude they stole it from him that's right that's a

223
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,900
good point he discovered that day he was living on that day for years and they

224
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,460
found it they're like oh this is our day and he had a beautiful culture on that

225
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,660
day of being off work and having 14 beers yeah and then all of a sudden

226
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,660
indigenous peoples are taking over. Now they're making us watch Buzzfeed videos instead.

227
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,820
That was a holiday where you have to watch Vox.com fucking Carlo tell you that

228
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,880
Columbus was actually not a beast. And where's my presents? Yeah also I don't really remember but I

229
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,860
think we used to get presents on Columbus Day. I remember. I think that's true.

230
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,060
I think everybody got a check. Everyone would dress up like a like the boat you

231
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,540
You could pick the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria,

232
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,500
and you would go around and you would find candy in bushes.

233
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,100
And now, you can't even do that because of cancel culture.

234
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,160
- Yeah, it's fucked up.

235
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,560
That used to be a day when the Santa, the Easter Bunny,

236
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,100
and the Tooth Fairy all worked together.

237
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,660
- They maybe took down my Columbus Day tree.

238
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,880
- Yeah? - They did.

239
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
- Wow. - Yeah.

240
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,620
- Were they using the wood to make a tiny boat?

241
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,780
- They made a kayak and they rode it in the street.

242
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,700
- Really?

243
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,040
hip hop real loud to

244
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:37,340
these kayaks that are always blasting hip hop. So when I'm trying to sleep

245
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,700
kayaks, go by these iced out the news,

246
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,440
sub woofers, God it's fucking annoying did horrible when they have the

247
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,220
hydraulics on the back of the canoe.

248
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,700
Yeah yeah, they're floating up and down, they're bobbing up and down like

249
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,660
in the water fucking annoying dude you know what the next future and like

250
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,760
vehicle invention what should be they should give up on like self-driving cars

251
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,360
and shit they should have walking boats yes not wheels on the boat either not

252
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,320
like a duck boat but like robotic legs on a boat you know we got to bring back

253
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,660
what fucking the thing where that you got four guys and they put you on their

254
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,480
shoulder oh yeah like a king that what happened with the holes the chair on the

255
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,680
poles. Why is the Pope the only guy who gets this now? Why can't I have... He has a

256
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,440
big bulletproof car with it looks like a condom. Yeah, why can't... Is that

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,400
what the Pope mobile looks like? Okay, how many people probably... so for every

258
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,440
10,000 like Honda Accords, probably four guys die. Yeah. So why

259
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,240
can't we just have those four guys? If you can afford 10,000 Honda Accords, you

260
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,240
could just... you should just be able to pay to have four guys do that forever from

261
00:12:50,240 --> 00:13:08,360
for

262
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,420
- A huge part of that setup is suffering.

263
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,260
- Yeah, you need to--

264
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,200
- Is enslavement, that's very important.

265
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,880
- You need to be sitting there and feel how unlevel it is

266
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,360
because there's one person who's obviously--

267
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,320
- You need to be able to kick someone

268
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,200
in the back of the head if they're not carrying you.

269
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,160
- Yeah, and then they're carrying you

270
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,600
kind of like using the tension of their arm

271
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,960
to just carry you with their wrist.

272
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
You want it on the shoulder.

273
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,840
I wouldn't bruise there.

274
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,160
- I wouldn't go to McDonald's if the food was automated

275
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
'cause there's no one to yell at.

276
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,600
- Exactly.

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,040
also this food out here too fast put it back if they were salt if mcdonald's

278
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,880
if mcdonald's people i mean i i hesitate to call them people if they if they were

279
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,960
as as uh as uh cheery as chick-fil-a employees i would not go there yeah

280
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,280
absolutely because that is the way yeah the employees are happy but the food's

281
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,840
good mcdonald's the food is terrible but you're fucking mcdonald's mcdonald's is

282
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,320
like on the worst day of their life that's like the modern equipment going

283
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
to like McDonald's is the modern equivalent of like going to like the

284
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
gladiatorial games. Exactly. You just go to see somebody have literally the worst

285
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,440
day of their life and like experience like suffering in excess of what should

286
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,320
be possible. At a city McDonald's but a small town McDonald's I feel like they're even

287
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
worse. What are you talking about? Yeah the people working at a small town

I learned is that you gotta treat the customer, you gotta greet every customer with a smile."

312
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
That's right.

313
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,440
And then he turns to the other employee and he tells one joke about each woman in the restaurant.

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,360
everybody he walks in he asked for a thing that's not on the menu that he

331
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,880

335
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,760
reprimands somebody. Somebody else behind him in line tries to order the same thing and he

336
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,520
bans them from the restaurant for life. Yeah, he's like that's my thing. They don't

411
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,620
like at work some guys started calling him Chief because he like like just as a

412
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,580
thing that he said, but this guy's dad took it as this guy thought that he

413
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,220
was Native American. It pissed him off so much that he like tried to like fight the

414
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,220
guy at work about it, and then and so everyone knew that this guy hated being

415
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,520
being called Chief. And then my older brother, one time when they were like

416
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,460
sixteen, he like brought some other sixteen year old over to this guy's

417
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,620

418
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,760
he doesn't like being called by his name, he only likes being called Chief.' And so

419
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,900
the guy walks out to like meet them in the driveway, and my brother's friend is

420
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,500
like, 'Hey, nice to meet you Chief,' and then this grown man just punched this

421
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,740
sixteen year old in the face.

422
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,660

thought about cutting your eyelashes off? Speaking of thinking,

439
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
this is a thinking man's episode. Yeah. Which I'm sure you could tell

440
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,640
already. I mean we've already tackled a lot of serious. Some

441
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
- Heady concepts.

442
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,240
- Yeah.

443
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,880
- We already basically just (mumbles)

444
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
- Like this thinkers.

445
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
- This is--

446
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,400
- Thinkers of stinkers.

447
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,580
- Top 10 mind blowing philosophical ideas to think about.

448
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,880
And it says,

449
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,960
philosophy has always been a weird subject

450
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,080
to wrap your head around.

451
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,500
And this list contains some of the most mind blowing

452
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,240
philosophical comments, concepts and ideas

453
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,440
for a person to think and wonder about.

454
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,560
- I think this might cause,

455
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,600
This could cause a crisis in my life

456
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,660
if somebody's blow my mind too hard.

457
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,720
- This could cause the listeners to have a brain blast.

458
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,400
- I'm smart enough that I could handle this,

459
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,480
but I think some listeners may wanna turn this off.

460
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
- If you have somebody who's very mentally weak

461
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,600
in the car with you, maybe a child,

462
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
you should probably turn this off.

463
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,360
- Yeah, or put the child out of the car.

464
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,680
- Or put the child out of its misery.

465
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,520
- Just put it out of the--

466
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
- Put the-- - Just snuff it.

467
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,560
- Put the child-- - Just put it out

468
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,400
like a candle. - Put the child in a home.

469
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,780
- Yeah, just snip that, the thread of fate.

470
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,780
sever it. Number one...

471
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Sever the child.

472
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
Sever the child.

473
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
The sorites.

474
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
So I looked this up.

475
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
Paradox.

476
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
So this is pretty genius.

477
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
Wait, no, this person just

478
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
explains it. That's fine.

479
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,780
Would you allow someone to cut off one of your fingers

480
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
if they paid you one cent?

481
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Well, boys, answer that, please.

482
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Yes.

483
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,060
finger. Yes, you also get to choose what kind of penny it is. You could choose like a million

484
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,980
dollar penny. Exactly. I feel like a missing pinky is a cool enough look that I'd do it

485
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:40,500
for a cent. I could make that work. If I would lose my left hand pinky, if it was painless,

486
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,180
I would probably just do it. Yeah, why not? Like I would never use this finger and that

487
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,060
would just be cool. It would be cool. It would be interesting. It's a conversation starter

488
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,460
and they'd be like, "Oh, how'd you lose that?" and be like, "For a penny." Honestly, I could

489
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,260
probably get like a 15 minute comedy central special if I lost probably yet

490
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,820
the comedian with yeah with just with who only everyone yet the only way

491
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,500
wondering how this happened the only basically I made a deal with a guy on a

492
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,620
website and I got one cent for it so nobody remembers your name you're just

493
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:13,100
you're the one pinky yeah you know that one guy with one pinky that one

494
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,980
exactly and yeah probably not okay I restart would you allow someone to cut

495
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,660
your fingers if they paid you for one cent? Probably not. How about four billion

496
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,900
dollars? I know I would and I'm confident that you probably would too. This

497
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,900
establishes two things that there are sums of money that you will accept to

498
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,740
cut off your finger and there are sums of money that you will decline to cut off

499
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,620
your finger because of how money works. The difference between the highest figure

500
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,220
you'll say no to and the lowest figure you'd say yes to is exactly one cent.

501
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,700
These numbers objectively exist but they're impossible to grasp. Pick the

502
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,940
lowest number you can think of accepting and tell me honestly that you'd decline a

503
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,100
a counter offer of exactly one cent less. So that is not an explanation of this at all.

504
00:27:51,100 --> 00:28:02,340
So from what I understand about the SoWrites paradox, the SoWrities paradox, is that this

505
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,660
whole thing is just would you suck a dick for one million dollars.

506
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
Yeah.

507
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
That's the paradox.

508
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,900
They had to reframe it for books.

509
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Uh huh.

510
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,900
Yeah, you can't say that.

511
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,420
That's been around since caveman times.

512
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
I know.

513
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
How many rocks would you suck a dick for?

514
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,700
since before money. Yeah, would you suck a dick for ten rocks?

515
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,500
They were, yeah, well, they were like, would you suck a dick for a million

516
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,860
dollars? And they were like, I don't know what dollars is, but yes.

517
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:30,020
Yeah, we haven't invented dollars. Well, they started with that question and

518
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,460
then they were like, I guess we finally should invent dollars. Yeah, yeah.

519
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,100
It's high time we put something... Yeah, we've had shekels and rupees,

520
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,340
we need to... But let's just finally, let's get dollars out of the way.

521
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,020
And that's why they started America.

522
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,900
- Yeah. - Yeah.

523
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,940
- So that someone could get their dick sucked

524
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,380
for one million dollars. - Yeah, someone's been asking

525
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,020
for quite a long time.

526
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,100
Nobody'd ever gotten their dick sucked before.

527
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,980
- The first millionaire only existed

528
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,580
because he wanted to get sucked so bad.

529
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,860
- Which one is higher, your suck a dick number

530
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,900
or your lose a pinky number?

531
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,020
- They're exactly the same.

532
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,460
- Yeah.

533
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,300
- They're both pure pain.

534
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,500
- I think the pinky one's probably higher

535
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,340
'cause like maybe I would miss it.

536
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,140
- Yeah, pinky, that's a more permanent effect on your life.

537
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,180
Also the suck a dick question is always,

538
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,060
I've always been confused about what kind of time frame

539
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,100
we're working with here.

540
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,420
Do I have to suck a dick forever?

541
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,180
- I've never thought about that.

542
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,620
- If the guy--

543
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,420
- If it's forever, I'm not gonna do it.

544
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,380
- 'Cause what if that would be the genie twist, right?

545
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,860
- Yeah, 'cause it works like the lottery

546
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,060
where it's like, oh, you can get the $1 million

547
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,460
in one lump sum over the course of your life.

548
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,420
- A dollar a day.

549
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,980
Yeah, I wonder like--

550
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,380
You have to suck a dick every day.

551
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,700
- But like if the guy has like,

552
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,980
like what if they're like,

553
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,240
okay suck that guy's dick to completion

554
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,280
and it's like somebody who has no feeling below their waist

555
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,380
and I'm just like sucking a limp dick forever

556
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
for a million dollars, that's not good to me.

557
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,180
- I guess if it's a genie asking the question,

558
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,020
should probably say no.

559
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,860
- Genies are tricky.

560
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,700
I'll say genies are tricky people.

561
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,980
- Here's another question.

562
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,380
So if it is the lottery thing,

563
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,380
would you suck one dick a year for like $33,000 a year?

564
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,700
- Probably.

565
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,520
- Until you get the million?

566
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,060
- If it was like 10 minutes, like yeah, I don't care.

567
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,900
- Yeah.

568
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,720
- You know?

569
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,560
- Yeah.

570
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,520
- Well, 33,000, that's maybe not enough.

571
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,420
- Well, I mean 3,300.

572
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,260
- Oh, no.

573
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
(laughing)

574
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,080
No.

575
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,920
If it was like--

576
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,760
- 3,300,000.

577
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,140
- If it was a--

578
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,860
- $33,000 isn't enough?

579
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,700
I have this Calculia. I can't go past. We just be it would just be because

580
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,260
that's not enough to just like live on comfortably. It would just so you want

581
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,100
to suck a dick and also that you want that to be your job. Yeah, is what

582
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,600
you're saying. I do want to be a

583
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:56,540
yeah, I do that yeah, if I like a supplemental thing like you want that to

584
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,740
be a support. If I had one if I had to yeah, because I like doing nothing. So I

585
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,120
had if I had one like fucking John that I sucked off like once a year yeah and he

586
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,800
can he was like the rich Saudi Prince or something yeah yeah did I do that yeah a

587
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,460
hundred percent like like sixty grand I would do that to you like public school

588
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,580
teacher salary for like fucking sucking a guy off one day I'll even do I'll do

589
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,480
all day like I'll have a three hundred and sixty four day year you know what I

590
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,960
like and then just one day is just a just a wash just cuz I just fucking sucked him

591
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:37,840
yeah but then that's the thing think about like dude would you know what day

592
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,200
is dick suck day that would be the big thing to me that's why yeah I think it

593
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,680
would just like sprung up on you at rain I wouldn't drop everything going on like

594
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,000
if I if I was like like what if I'm like about to walk down the aisle on my

595
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,800
wedding day yeah and then I get like in my all I get the big red phone on my

596
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,400
desk range. Well that's if you don't have a job, if that's your job you got to do it.

597
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,560
I guess on call. It plays that I got five on it remix from us. You're waiting, you're

598
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:12,400
walking down and then your phone just goes dun dun dun. You're just like oh shit I'm

599
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,880
going to suck a dick today. I think the big thing would be if it was 33,000 and I had

600
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,840
to do it once every year I would be worried that I would have some kind of like what if

601
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,760
What if I got really successful and then I'm making like 800 grand a year, but then still

602
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,280
one day of the year I have to go suck a guy's dick for 30k?

603
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
You have to?

604
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,400
I think it's a binding contract.

605
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
I think you can...

606
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,920
Binding contract like $25,000 for over four years.

607
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,360
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,320
I think, yeah, if there was a guy...

609
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,560
I would totally...

610
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
If there was a guy who did that...

611
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,760
Suck off a guy for $25,000.

612
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,640
Let's call them patches. If there's a guy in patches who's hiring me to do that once a year,

613
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,240
he probably would sue me for everything I have if I didn't suck his dick.

614
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Yeah.

615
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
Because we had a binding thing.

616
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Yeah, true.

617
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,480
Okay, that's why the pinky thing is better because it's one and done.

618
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Yeah.

619
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,400
You lose one pinky, they're not going to reattach it and take it back off.

620
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,040
So you'd rather suck a dick four times for $25,000 over four years.

621
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,920
- It's been one time for 100,000?

622
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,200
- What, really?

623
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,800
- I did the math wrong, I thought that added up to 1 million.

624
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,200
(laughing)

625
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,600
It would be $250,000 four times, that's up to a million.

626
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,800
- Dude, you know I can't do peak numbers.

627
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,560
(laughing)

628
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,840
- You'd rather get $100,000 than a million.

629
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,640
(laughing)

630
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
- Yeah, I'd probably--

631
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,440
- Yeah, I'm lowering the price.

632
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,000
- $25 four times, that's a million.

633
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,800
I would do it for $25 over the course of one weekend.

634
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,480
This is the number two mind blowing philosophical thought.

635
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,320
Linguistically, it's possible for two people to have a conversation that each believes to

636
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,240
be meaningful but actually has no meaning because one or both of them don't know what

637
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
they're talking about.

638
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,040
This happens to me all the time.

639
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,680
This yeah, I feel like that's, you probably experience this a lot.

640
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,280
I experience this every day of my life.

641
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,080
Would you consider it to be philosophical when it happens?

642
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,960
Indubitably, I do.

643
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,720
Mind-blowing, in fact.

644
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
I concur that, um, this...

645
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah, continue.

646
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,040
Keep going.

647
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,400
I can't keep talking about that.

648
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,680
I cannot say that.

649
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,560
I cannot keep...

650
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,000
I cannot continue this line of...

651
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,600
I cannot keep speaking that way, in that regard.

652
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,600
He said something... what did you say last night?

653
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,240
Rather.

654
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,720
Oh, yeah.

655
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,840
Oh, yeah. He said rather.

656
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,800
All I said was rather.

657
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,120
I had never heard you say rather before.

658
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,900
You said something and then corrected yourself by being like rather and then the correct thing and I was like it really

659
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,560
It was like a sore thumb dude. It's really stuck out. I do that like all the time

660
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,140
You're changing dude. You're going Hollywood on me. Yeah, you started to say rather

661
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,900
the fuck man what

662
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:09,360
So hard once because I I think I was asking if we would bring the mics to North Carolina

663
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,160
Or something or like what did you say? I forget what I said. He said something crazy

664
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,060
I said, oh, yeah, like like ultimately like it doesn't

665
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,680
Ultimately it does not matter to me

666
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,760
Yeah, and then I I did not know I was getting flamed for that for saying ultimately

667
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,380
Yeah

668
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:35,040
Because I would say there's probably not a higher stake word to set up a sentence with then ultimately

669
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,600
because that that kind of establishes that it's the most important thing.

670
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,880
And then for you to follow it up by like, it doesn't matter.

671
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Even better. I searched it in my message. It wasn't ultimately doesn't matter. It was

672
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,000
a home turf episode would be good, but ultimately pointless.

673
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
Wow.

674
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,800
Ultimately pointless.

675
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,080
That was a Boston thing.

676
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,400
Ultimately, ethereal.

677
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,760
Yeah.

678
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,200
we got him already at that we did i don't talk like that we can remind said i

679
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,880
said so you said but ultimately pointless me yes i said studying for the s_a_t_'s

680
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,360
you said fruitless and futile attempts to record would be

681
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,160
i find it would be rather in a minute should you say our equipment yonder

682
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,600
and patrick said

683
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,720
I'm downstairs

684
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:43,860
no, you know, I was just fuming on the tree. Yeah, it's like no fuck like why

685
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,320
the fuck did I say that I thought that made so much I thought oh fuck. I

686
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,700
thought that makes sense. Number three most philosophical concept ever is no

687
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,400
matter what you do you will be plagued by regret for example if you marry you will

688
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,120
regret it but if you don't you will regret that too

689
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,400
damn this person sounds sad yeah this idea also gives you the advice live for

690
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,680
what you have not for what you could have had yeah live free or die here's

691
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,760
here's a comment from Rocco I could express my thoughts but if I do everyone

692
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,280
will think that I'm one of those people who rambles on if I don't people will

693
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,480
think I'm one of those people who looks through lists and never vote on anything

694
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,400
If I write this people will see it on my profile and think I'm weird if I don't include this in my wording people might

695
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,680
Have no idea what I'm talking about just like the first item on this list which is about people not understanding what you're saying never mind

696
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm definitely one of those people who rambles

697
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,880
Morocco took to me Benadryl yeah

698
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,440
Morocco got a visit from the shadow man. You know I've been reading all about that shit's so funny

699
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,160
yeah, I knew some people in high school who did Benadryl and like fucking like

700
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:59,720
DXM and shit. But I didn't realize how crazy it is. It's so funny, dude. It's like an objectively

701
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,600
terrible drug that people just do because it's like kids just do it because it's in

702
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
their house.

703
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Yeah, because it's easy.

704
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,160
You can't get weed yet. You don't know where to get weed.

705
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,800
I was thinking about like we used to like the big thing in my group growing up was like

706
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,220
2,5-I like inbomb shit, you know, like the research chemicals that are like insanely

707
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,500
strong just make you crazy yeah and I was like I guess that's kind of the same

708
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,100
thing that and like k2 yeah I didn't I never did been a drill and shit that's

709
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,620
you know yeah or like yeah I was always a no it is the funniest one I tried to

710
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,260
smoke nutmeg you see you don't smoke you boil it you boil it you boil and drink

711
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,820
I heard I heard from answers that you smoke it

712
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,260
answers was trying to they threw you off yeah I remember reading trip reports for

713
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,460
nutmeg and it's like they're all like they're all like I had a nightmare in

714
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,860
in real life and then there's there was one that was like I went blind for two

715
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,960
hours and fell down

716
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,380
one of the Bennett. I did a deep dive on it yesterday. One of the Benadryl ones.

717
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,540
I saw a guy took four thousand milligrams of Benadryl and then he like

718
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,580
immediately like lost consciousness and then woke up and looked he like looked

719
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,420
down at the couch and saw his body and then he walked outside and his entire

720
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:20,400
family was a beat was being crucified on his front lawn like on crosses and they

721
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,880
were like why'd you do this to us and then he walked inside and he had to

722
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,400
fight his dog and then

723
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,760
it's so funny that just like that that does that Benadryl yeah and then he

724
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,080
went into he said he went into a white void of like that that episode of

725
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,660
Spongebob where he like time and he says that he was there for seven years and

726
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,120
that he like it like replaced seven years of his real memory and then he just

727
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,740
up in the hospital and he was like don't do this drug like I they said that I

728
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,680
have like I'm like mentally disabled now and also you have to do dialysis every

729
00:39:52,680 --> 00:40:01,140
week people still do it I mean it's just like you're just trying to kill yourself

730
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,940
I guess yeah yeah it's just a horrible way to die that's awesome

731
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,220
you guys don't want to do it when I smoke nutmeg I put it in a post-it note

732
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:20,020
That's just like a, that's like a, that's like making a potion in your backyard.

733
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,260
Did it do anything to you?

734
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,640
That's happened to me multiple times when I was like in the eighth grade.

735
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,100
I think I like dissected a cigarette butt that like it was in an ashtray and put it

736
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,900
in a post-it note and tried to smoke it.

737
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,540
And I did that with tea too, but every time I like, I was like, you know, trying to like

738
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,980
roll it up in the post-it note because the sticky like the adhesive thing and

739
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,540
like I would like try to like smoke it and then like tilt my head back like

740
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,220
just a little bit and just like inhale everything that was in the post-it note.

741
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,340
Did you get high? No, didn't work. You have to do a lot of nutmeg.

742
00:40:55,340 --> 00:41:00,100
One time when I was in the fourth grade, just remember this, got in a

743
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:07,140
lot of trouble for this because I heard the term smoking grass so I went outside

744
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,260
and I cut a bunch of grass from the ground and I put it in a piece of paper

745
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:20,180
and I tried to lay it down. You were doing this as a fucking nine-year-old? That's like honestly

746
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:27,300
really impressive that you're not a drug addict. I was doing it when I was nine. And then I think like...

747
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:49,900
that's some like million little pieces just blades of I think my brother and I

748
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:58,660
shared a closet at the time because we like shared a room and you got it how do

749
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:17,380
you get a trouble I mean like how do you get my mom was pissed cuz like I was

750
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:26,820
burning shit yeah I was burning just like the look on her look the look on her

751
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,660
face of just disappointment I was like trying that's like worse than our than

752
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,860
my kids cuz like if you if your kid is nine years old and you find like a joint

753
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,380
in his hat in his room that's an actual problem well it's a problem but also

754
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,940
you're like he's kind of like competent if you like do even if you can get that

755
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,780
- Yeah, yeah.

756
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,620
- You're holding a buy weed and fucking roll a joint?

757
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:50,620
- Not a piece of notebook paper with the grass on it.

758
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,540
(laughing)

759
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,180
How did I get into college?

760
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,020
- I don't know.

761
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,840
(laughing)

762
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,780
I don't fucking know, dude.

763
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,740
I don't know how you're alive, honestly.

764
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,580
Yeah.

765
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,460
- You know it's the blue lines that get you high.

766
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,300
- Yeah.

767
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,120
- On the notebook paper.

768
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
- That's true, actually, yeah.

769
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,980
- You can feel it, 'cause as you smoke it,

770
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,300
it'll be a period where you're not high,

771
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,660
and then it gets to the blue line and you go,

772
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,860
whoa, that ink.

773
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,700
- What?

774
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:24,020
I was watching the Woodstock movie and that's what inspired me to do it.

775
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:30,660
That is like honestly one of the stupidest things I've ever heard in my life.

776
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,660
That is so funny.

777
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I was a fucked up kid.

778
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,420
Fucked up but not like a cool jaded.

779
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
No you're just like.

780
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I was just impressionable.

781
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:49,420
you were like just impressionable you're like a dog's yeah that's insane.

782
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I can't believe I just remember damn fuck man dude that was I mean my my

783
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,420
older brother almost getting in trouble for it.

784
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,720
Let me be having to be like it was me.

785
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
I'm sorry.

786
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,620
I admit that I have the wave of disappointment that walked over my

787
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,420
mom's face.

788
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,100
so funny number four is the idea of moral luck and how it affects the goodness of

789
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:20,640
people getting getting banned like from listening to the who as a nine-year-old

790
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:29,800
because you fucking put grass you made a taco out of grass and notebook paper it

791
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:36,480
definitely wasn't rolled well it was like it was like twisted at the end like

792
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,560
just imagining what it looked like to my parents like them finding it being like

793
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,000
is that a joke and then like inspecting further and just being like what the

794
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,640
fuck not not a joke it's just nothing yeah like might as well not even I mean

795
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,680
he's just like pocket yeah it's so funny I don't really know what this means I

796
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,800
don't care number five this one's out this one's smart number five the notion

797
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,400
notion of solipsism. The very notion of solipsism. I feel myself becoming a bit

798
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,720
intrigued by this item upon this list. Solipsism is just it's all in your brain.

799
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,440
Solipsism is yeah you're the only person that exists. Yeah I'm pretty sure that's

800
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,120
true. Yeah I'm pretty sure it's true too. Yeah I think it's me though. Yeah I think

801
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:31,040
it's also you. What? Wait Pat. I mean I messed up it's me yeah it's me. I have

802
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,440
internal thoughts. Who's the only real person me or you? Probably me. What? No it's me.

803
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,520
He didn't hesitate either. I don't know. You guys are giving me bad vibes. I feel like

804
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,220
it's now I didn't actually think that now I kind of feel like it's true. Yeah it's true

805
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:54,400
not true. It's true for me. You are covering your tracks. I don't like that at all. This

806
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,920
could row here's a rock. This could be true in your case anyway. I mean I'm not real. I'm

807
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm a bloody cartoon bloody cartoon. You hope he's not bloody. Yeah, that's a

826
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,400
Yeah, South Park OC's and like, what's OC? Original character. Some people make like

827
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,400
their own like Sonic character and stuff. Oh, it's like, oh I know the Sonic thing.

828
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,720
But for South Park. Yeah, they do that for South Park. Like Sonic characters. People do it for

829
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,960
everything. You know why they do it for South Park? It makes more sense if it's a video game, but like for South Park, that is so, like, makes no sense.

830
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,400
South Park because there's like fucking 500 like South Park yourself fucking flash

831
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,600
games it's easy it's really easy. Sonic you gotta hand draw that shit. I texted I

832
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,400
texted my mom asking her if she remembers finding the grass joint in my

833
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,320
closet and she didn't remember that I was that young she says you were that

834
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:14,400
young I hope I beat your ass. Nice. It probably happened. I'm sure she did dude.

835
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,200
He's looking for excuses. What's this a blade of grass?

836
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:24,340
Being the show your gigs they just fucking had

837
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:30,960
You probably thought this was a toilet paper so stupid

838
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,700
Fucking sick number six is possibly the most intriguing yet fascinating entry. Okay

839
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,760
Number six is you can have a doppelganger millions or even billions of light-years away

840
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,640
whoa I don't think so I have a few doppelgangers it's you have many I would

841
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,280
say most people kind of look like yeah yeah I think I think Streeter said it

842
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,360
but every country has a Patrick yeah that's true because there was that um

843
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:03,840
there was that did you guys see that video like the like there's like a

844
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,560
really fat cop on tick-tock now in like the Ukraine they look like you looks

845
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,680
like me. Really? Yeah. You just have a very, you just look very plain and kind of

846
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,520
nothing. Yeah, it's kind of just like a blur. Yeah. Have you seen, you know

847
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:26,320
like, you know Slenderman? Yeah. Yeah. Not Slenderman. Mm-hmm. You just, yeah, you

848
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,960
just have like kind of no facial features that stand out at all. Like a Lego, the back of a

849
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:42,520
Lego guys. Yes, exactly. It looks like you're gonna turn around and there'll be an actual

850
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:48,280
guy on that side. Yeah, you kind of just look like a Halloween mask like anybody could purchase

851
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,400
it and put it on their face. You know, the worst comparison I think is right now you

852
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,480
kind of look like a pumpkin with your hat and your and your that. I've always wanted

853
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,560
look like a pumpkin. Really? Yeah I can tell. Yeah. Well if I looked like a

854
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,240
pumpkin my hat would be green and my face would be orange. That's a good point.

855
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,040
You also, you clearly have a pumpkin. Like friggin Donald Trump. Mm-hmm.

856
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,880
Well he loves his green hats. All his supporters are wearing green hats all

857
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,360
the time with the words on it. Quick pause Cameron. Yeah and fire trucks they're green too.

858
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:23,520
I will say. Cam you're on fire today. Yeah. You're crushing. I will say, remember

859
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,080
the mega jack-o'-lantern hat? Dude, honestly dude, every single piece of, let's admit it

860
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,240
dude, if Virgil Abloh came out with the mega shit, that would have been on, everybody would

861
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,480
have been on it. Oh yeah. That shit, it just like fucking, just serif text on it. It's a

862
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,240
cool hat. It's cool as fuck. Yeah, I think it's been four years now, I think we can say

863
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,760
it. I think we can say it with it. Dude, I'm wearing it right now. I'm wearing it right

864
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,760
Dude, I wanted to grow my hair out. I show you guys this. I saw it the other day. I think I'm just pretty good

865
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,320
I'm going for it. Dude. I'm can I see can you can you like lean the top of your head? Yeah, let me

866
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,500
You have to go for it full halal car. I'll go for it. Oh

867
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,620
Man, yeah, yeah, you're growing it back out. Not really cuz I think I can't stand to do it much longer

868
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,880
But no, please

869
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:15,520
Get to q-tip level q-tip level baldhead

870
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, really?

871
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
You think I should do that?

872
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,720
Like, like, whenever I would shave my head and I would just have, like, completely, like,

873
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
rounded hair.

874
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
I don't remember that.

875
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,720
You don't remember that?

876
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,720
I shaved my head, like, a year ago.

877
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,080
No, I'm gonna get, I kinda wanna grow it out and go like, uh, like, like, Walton Goggins.

878
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,760
Oh, yeah, you should just shave the, the, the part up front.

879
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,760
Uh-huh.

880
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,880
So that I have a nice back, like, really far back hairline.

881
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
That would be sick.

883
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,160
Oh, you get, like, the, the Chairman Mao.

884
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,480
That's the problem is that I still have hair at the front.

885
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,800
So it's, it's bad.

886
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,480
I want to have just a hair, like no hair until halfway down.

887
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,980
That's probably a good idea.

888
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,980
Yeah.

889
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Yeah.

890
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
Maybe go full fryer tuck on them.

891
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:53,980
Oh dude.

892
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,200
I don't know if they could handle it dude.

893
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,200
Yes sir.

894
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,040
I think I might make too many women fucking cream and squirt walking down the street.

895
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
Could be.

896
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
Fucking cream and squirt.

897
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,640
Well that's the thing, like maybe people, like, I don't know, maybe people are just

898
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,000
so used to the bald now.

899
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You know?

900
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Maybe they are.

901
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I'm used to the bald.

902
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah.

903
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I look in the, I don't even.

904
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,760
I think you grow your hair out, I shave my head.

905
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
No.

906
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,800
that's it I'm trapped with the worst hair then I'll just regrow my hair it won't

907
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,180
be a big deal don't shave your head yeah I'm like I might shave my head too we

908
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,160
could I mean that was actually that's better than just two of us having it

909
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:33,280
all three of us had shaved heads I'm not but only one of us is bald that'd be

910
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:38,560
cool our seven is the problem of induction I don't know what that mean I

911
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,640
mean well that makes sense that you wouldn't understand this one yeah I

912
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,640
I actually understand it perfectly.

913
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,640
That's right, me and Pat understand it perfectly.

914
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,320
No, you know, it's that this guy is such a mental moron that he phrased it so simply,

915
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,880
with such simplicity rather, I should say, instead of that.

916
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,960
The words of a dimwit seem to ring true to many.

917
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,760
I concur.

918
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,200
He concurred.

919
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,940
And you can turd.

920
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,940
You can turd.

921
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,760
Number eight is slugs are just snails without homes.

922
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Damn.

923
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,760
Is that to be?

924
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
Throw this on a snort tea.

925
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
It's a bit of a drop.

926
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,760
Right quick.

927
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,920
about a fucking a bad welcome mat cheese style true yeah yeah I get some more

928
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:22,160
chi also like what she you have to figure out what direction I mean you go

929
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,720
to the guy for half you can meditate I think honestly I didn't believe in chi or

930
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,360
energy and spaces until we started going to casinos yeah and then I feel like

931
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,920
you believe in a strong literally I literally could like if I follow the

932
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,920
system of just believing in myself and my instinct.

933
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
Energy literally is real.

934
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,920
Yeah, people, yeah.

935
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,920
People try and discredit it and make it seem stupid with like stuff like aura photography.

936
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,920
That's stupid.

937
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
That's dumb.

938
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
I like aura photography.

939
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,920
It's dumb.

940
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
That shit's dumb.

941
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,320
But energy, you can't tell me you've never like walked into a place and like felt energy

942
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,320
before.

943
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,240
It doesn't matter if it's like, oh, it's actually just your, it's actually because you don't

944
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
like the store.

945
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,640
I was like, well, duh, I don't like it

946
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,900
'cause it has bad energy.

947
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,120
- One time I was in Provincetown, I walked into a--

948
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,280
- Don't say there was bad energy in Provincetown.

949
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,680
- You are a weird energy from some women.

950
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,520
- No, there is a, I went into a place

951
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,480
that was selling gems and stones,

952
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,320
like a place where people go to buy vibes.

953
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,160
- Yeah.

954
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,400
- And they had a big Allman Brothers tapestry

955
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,200
and I was like, why the fuck do they have--

956
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,040
- Bad.

957
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,480
- Why do they have an Allman Brothers tapestry?

958
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,300
- That's bad chi.

959
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,560
- Yeah, like Grateful Dead, that one,

960
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,720
I mean, it's a staple, it makes sense,

961
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,600
but the Allman Brothers peach thing,

962
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,360
I was like man what the flick it's it says all my brothers - and then like the lady behind the counter went like

963
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,060
I'm sorry. I just have to go outside real quick and

964
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:46,400
To her co-worker and she was like, oh why what's what's going on?

965
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,280
She's like, I don't know just some people in the store have negative energies like stood outside

966
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:58,040
Meditated like in the front of you or cuz of you dude you you like attacked her

967
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,560
I'm a negative force in this world. I

968
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,280
Deplete energy you you're a vampire on women

969
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:13,060
No suck their energy out yeah, you drain them you just prove a vampire everybody dude

970
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,400
I don't say that as women come on. I'm a vampire. Why would you rather say everybody?

971
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,520
It's I just half the people cuz I'm depleting energy what I go in I destroy vibes

972
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:29,560
I'm your vibe destroyer. I'm a vibe destroyer. I'm a you're a vibe cannon mm-hmm

973
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:36,140
An energy print I don't believe in energy except an energetic predator, right? Yeah. Yeah

974
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:40,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah

975
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,140
What call me the word not okay?

976
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,880
negative predator

977
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,380
Negative predator sounds like a

978
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:56,480
Really good or been yeah, that's that's yeah. Yeah, I don't believe in energy. Also. They be called for it because they were a hardcore

979
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,520
Yeah

980
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,420
Number nine, what I may be, this one will blow your mind, what I may be seeing is

981
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,000
green may be seen by someone else as red, it's just that we both have been taught

982
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,520
since childhood to call that particular color green. True. That's true.

983
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,200
One time my brother said that to me when I was a kid and then I was like

984
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,760
what are you talking about and he just said butterfly effect. So then I watched

985
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,160
that movie, I watched that movie and I thought that was gonna be like a part of

986
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,680
- No, no, no. - It's not at all.

987
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,440
- Dude, you-- - Butterfly effect.

988
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,040
- I saw that movie so many times when I was a kid.

989
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
- That's a mind crusher, dude.

990
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,480
- Yeah, dude, when you're like--

991
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,200
- When you're a kid, dude, that's like the first--

992
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,620
- Like, when you stay home from school,

993
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,960
they play that on FX so much.

994
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,360
- 'Cause you're not smart enough to see

995
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,320
what's like philosophical about the Matrix,

996
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,600
but there's something that is just so in your face,

997
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,880
like annoying about it.

998
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,840
When you're a kid, it's all you understand, so.

999
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,600
- Dude, the butterfly effect blew my goddamn mind

1000
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,440
when I was nine.

1001
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,520
- Hey, it blew that pregnant lady's mind

1002
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,280
when she opened up that mailbox, remember that?

1003
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,640
- Yep.

1004
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,640
She exploded.

1005
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,360
And then the dog in the bag, dude.

1006
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,360
Dude, D in the B.

1007
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360
Yeah.

1008
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,360
Dude.

1009
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
I never saw it.

1010
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,440
I've seen the Butterfly Effect probably a hundred times.

1011
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
What?

1012
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
What?

1013
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
I think it's probably-

1014
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
A hundred times?

1015
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Probably 50 times.

1016
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Ballpark, I think that sounds-

1017
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,440
50 times.

1018
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,240
50 times at two hours each.

1019
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,880
You spent a hundred hours of your life watching-

1020
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,240
Well, that made for a TV movie.

1021
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,240
Oh, okay.

1022
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,240
So 90 minutes.

1023
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,560
It made the edited for TV version of the Butterfly Effect.

1024
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,280
You saw Kutcher tear it up-

1025
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,280
Yes.

1026
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,120
90 minutes for a hundred, 50 times.

1027
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,280
- That, in 2007, 2008, that was on FX all the fucking time.

1028
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,140
- They cut out all the cool shit though.

1029
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:36,980
- Yeah.

1030
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,800
- Yeah, pretty sad.

1031
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,360
- Mm-hmm, like the swears.

1032
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,280
- Yeah, I love the swears.

1033
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,120
- Yeah.

1034
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,960
- That shit's so cool.

1035
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,520
- That scene where he wakes up and he's going like,

1036
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,260
"Oh, oh, oh," remember that?

1037
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,100
- Yeah.

1038
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,400
- Uh-huh, the dog is in the bag and the dad's a pedophile

1039
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,240
and then, don't spoil everything about it.

1040
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,540
- Yeah, I get that, I mean, but what happened in the movie?

1041
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:57,300
I get that you're, that was your life.

1042
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:02,420
number one the theory of six degrees of separation that is fascinating I hope

1043
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,020
Kevin Bacon doesn't I get fascinated when I think of something like that yeah

1044
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:13,700
yeah who could we let's who do we have let's nail this Elvis so my no Elvis my

1045
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:22,100
uncle was Elvis somebody else somebody else yeah okay well well I'm at like

1046
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,460
that Kevin that's one degree so I know Patrick yeah Patrick two degrees for us

1047
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:33,020
one no I met him yeah I know Patrick one degree met him well I mean the obvious

1048
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,300
one is Kevin Bacon I know he's right he's over there yeah one degree it's one

1049
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,740
it's like 30 feet I can map this one I can actually map this one my mom watches

1050
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:51,900
city on the hill one degree mm-hmm yeah mm-hmm let's just try Hitler one degree

1051
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:57,100
you know what no whoa maybe for you it's seven for me it's outside I barely lost

1052
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:03,460
but I did lose yeah I'm pretty proud of that 25 degrees from Hitler 25 degrees

1053
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:08,580
from Hitler I hope he's burning at 9 I have 360 degrees from Hitler yeah I got

1054
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,380
to turn around and walk away from him mm-hmm you're facing him directly now 60

1055
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,480
360 degrees same direction you started from now. Yeah, I don't think so yeah,

1056
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,220
no because you spun around so you could see your whole body. I'm a hundred

1057
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,680
eighty degrees from Hitler turn around walk the other way. I don't want to be

1058
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,420
anywhere near that guy. You walk all the way around the earth, three hundred

1059
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,320
sixty degrees, you come up behind him and you hug him and you turn to put my

1060
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,520
hands on his eyes like this. Yeah, guess who yeah, you turn who in you turn

1061
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,980
three hundred and sixty degrees and then you put your arm at forty five degrees.

1062
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,440
you see him yeah down to pointed his badass shoes.

1063
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,920
Say what are those? Yeah and I say what are those? I say damn. These are my boots. I say

1064
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,880
damn Hitler. That's boot. Hitler back at it again. Here's a really fascinating one from

1065
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:02,360
the contenders. Okay. Number fifteen, we're both heaven and hell. That's not true. It's

1066
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:08,360
fascinating. I'm just Caleb. And here's the- And I'm so sweet. Here's the last one. This

1067
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,080
This one is probably the most mind blowing of all.

1068
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:17,200
Number sixteen, rule based systems are inherently chaotic due to the principle of exquisite sensitivity

1069
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,080
to initial conditions.

1070
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,560
I completely concur.

1071
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,760
Yeah, I concur totally and utterly.

1072
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,280
I would like to respectfully disagree but keep it open for debate.

1073
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,920
Okay.
