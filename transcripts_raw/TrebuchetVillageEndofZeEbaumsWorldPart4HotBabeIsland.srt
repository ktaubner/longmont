It's like Johnny Depp.

Okay, wait, no, yeah, do that.

Just keep going.

Tales from the Sea-

You are so innocent, sir.

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Eve homes where the three set on a long adventure to sail to the end of-

20
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't keep doing this.

21
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Yeah, I guess, okay.

22
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Just cause of, you know, I just feel a lot of feelings right now.

23
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:56,820
Sick.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,620
long battle, you finally defeated the glass ship and its glass crew members, all of whom,

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,500
when struck, would shatter and turn to sand.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,140
Yeah, they would, they will.

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,660
Yeah, let's let, they didn't shatter when they were struck though, that was kind of the issue.

29
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,460
Yeah, let's just, I don't really want to re-litigate that whole thing.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,700
Well yeah, we'll have to open it back up.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
But I would like to just say.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,940
I want a change of wording there.

33
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,940
I would like to-

34
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,300
When struck and struck and struck and struck and struck, they would shatter.

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,420
No, I think they jumped on and ball bearings and oil dumped on it.

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,300
I think that was like a poor choice by me as like a as a

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,500
storyteller. Absolutely and I will fall on the I'll fall on

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,380
the sword for that the sword shatters. I'm fat the captain

39
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,220
fled as his ship went down saying that the sandwich would

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,220
get her revenge. The sandwich being the the witch who was

41
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,500
protecting the rubbers, the were dolphin clan that's aboard

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,260
your ship. Yeah. until you stole them away to become

43
00:01:52,260 --> 00:02:16,140
slaves.

44
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,900
the fight you saw in the distance the fabled hot babe island about a day's

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,340
journey out and evening approaching you all settled down to have a celebratory

46
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,980

I'll explain. Aeoli is for dinner.

50

Before we do that, I do want to show you guys the map.

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
Okay. Pat, can you come over here? I'm sorry.

52
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Did you already show us this?

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
I showed this to you.

54
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Can we do it on the Chromecast?

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,820
What? The one that's all the way down the hall?

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Yeah, you can stream it there and then we'll go look at it.

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,820
Pat, come here.

58
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
That makes sense.

59
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Pat, come here. Just for a second.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,820
So I will put this in, if you join the discord,

61
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,500
I will put this in the discord.

62
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,620
So, where you guys are is in VirtueGood.

63
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,020
You guys are kind of over,

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,940
kind of here.

65
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,700
- VirtueGood seems like almost a cluster of small islands.

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,980
- Yes, that's right, and Archipelago.

67
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,700
So that's where you guys were,

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,300
and then you moved over here.

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,340
- In between the three little islands there.

70
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,140
- Yeah, so you're in between them,

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,380
and then this is just the known world

72
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,340
as far as the Terrafire Kingdom goes.

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,900
So this is where you guys were.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,780
- And you can move the clouds?

75
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,500
- Like, I can move the clouds on my map program I have.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,820
This is where Trebuchet Village was.

77
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,660
So the whole adventure took place here.

78
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,340
- This map looks so cool.

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,180
- Thank you. - Quick question,

80
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,420
and you'll see it in the Discord.

81
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,780
- You will. - Quick question.

82
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,680
- Yeah. - If you zoomed out even more,

83
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,020
would you be into space?

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,860
- Take a look for yourself.

85
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,700
- Can I see?

86
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Okay, if you zoomed out even more, would there be a like God in heaven?

87
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,060
Potentially, not really.

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,660
Not really.

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:14,940
Wouldn't be.

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,820
That's going to be a lie.

91
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,900
You say God is not really.

92
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,780
Which God?

93
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
The Abrahamic God?

94
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,500
Because yes.

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,260
Christian.

96
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
I don't know who Abraham is.

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,140
It's the same.

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,660
Lincoln.

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,900
Lincoln.

100
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,980
Because he's a Christian.

101
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,340
Yeah.

102
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,020
All right, just checking.

103
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,380
Yeah.

104
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,620
So yeah, so you guys, just to give you a sense of like,

105
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,240
what you're trying to do probably is go south,

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,860
sort of similar to what Magellan did

107
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,900
when he went around the tip of South America

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,260
towards Bury-Bury.

109
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,620
You're trying to go around there probably.

110
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,980
Obviously you can still land in Israel

111
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,900
or the Dirtlands if you'd like to

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,000
and just go across these places.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
You'll learn more about these places

114
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,020
throughout the adventure.

115
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,620
'Cause this is the Terrifier Kingdom in full.

116
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,980
We're finally going to give you a sense of all that.

117
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,540
We're headed to Hot Babe Island, right?

118
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
Yes, that's where you're headed right now.

119
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,220
I can't remember, did we decide that we're going to make a new theme park or no?

120
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,140
You guys were discussing making an aquarium.

121
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,500
An aquarium at Hot Babe Island?

122
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,540
I can't remember the decision and I don't want to spend another 45 minutes on it.

123
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Who gives a fuck?

124
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
We're going to Hot Babe Island.

125
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
I think we should forget that that ever happened.

126
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,700
But first, you can ask Aoli what he's cooking.

127
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
What's for dinner?

128
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,380
Oh, oh, I'm cooking for you a, we're taking some hardtack and we're putting it in a little

129
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,700
pastel I'm adding a bit of salt and a bit of bit of mackerel and it's sort of

130
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,420
be a sort of... macaroni? heart attack no heart attack heart attack so aioli is

131
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,340

132
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,080

133
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,420
voice it's fine it's good you're back I know a heart attack so and then which is

134
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:03,200
It's just a, kind of just a wafer, kind of like a taste, like flavorless wafer, which

135
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,140
we have to have, but then I'm putting in some mackerel and some salt.

136
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,940
Why do we have, we have to have?

137
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,860
Just cause travel's easy.

138
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,860
What is this mac, you're not finishing the word.

139
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
Mackerel.

140
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,300
Can I, I'll just have a lot of mackerel.

141
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,540
You just want all the, you're the captain.

142
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,540
All would be great.

143
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,300
Listen, I don't want to trouble you to make all that, I'll just have two big cotton candies.

144
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Well, I guess we have some sugar cane I could try to...

145
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,300
I don't need to listen. I don't want to know how it's made.

146
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,300
I don't want candy canes. It's not Christmas.

147
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
I just want cotton candies.

148
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Two of them.

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Two cotton candies.

150
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
What do you want?

151
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
There are... what's that?

152
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
That's one of the crewmates.

153
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Oh. Hey, how's it going?

154
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Cook him.

155
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Please don't.

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,860
Hey, you heard the man, he's the boss.

157
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,500
Oh, I didn't know it was gonna go this way.

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,140
Do we even have a pot big enough for him?

159
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
And he knows what he did.

160
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,300
He knows why we're cooking him.

161
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,660
Why are you cooking him?

162
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,620
He's a molester.

163
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
It was only one time.

164
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,580
Okay, so now we have a molester on the ship.

165
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,900
He molested me.

166
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,900
And we're executing him.

167
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,180
While we were in battle, he grabbed my penis.

168
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,740
That could have been an accident.

169
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
It was an accident.

170
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740

- Yeah, and I've been jumping on the bed.

194
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,940
I ate all the food while they were talking.

195
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,860
Well, they were arguing about the Pringles thing.

196
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,380
- Do we have our own rooms or do we--

197
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,580
- Yeah, so you guys have, no, you guys have a--

198
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,100
- A captain's quarters that all three of you share.

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,180
- What's the sleep, is it a triple bunk bed?

200
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,260
Is it three doubles?

201
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,100
- It's a triple bunk, of course.

202
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,940
(whistles)

203
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,340
- So I-- - Who is the topmost bunk?

204
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,580
- I call the bottom.

205
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,420
- You're the bottom.

206
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,900
- There are no more bunks.

207
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,740
- There are no more bunks?

208
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,660
Nope, I was trying to tell you I ate all the food,

209
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,860
got really fat and heavy, jumped on the top bunk,

210
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,620
and I collapsed into one bed.

211
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,460
Aw.

212
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,380
- So that was one, so a twin-sized bed?

213
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,380
- I tried to make a water bed out of water from the ocean.

214
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,220
(laughing)

215
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,140
- I was wondering where you were gonna get the water.

216
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,620
- Ended up like a lake.

217
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,540
- That's the main issue of making a water bed,

218
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,940
is where you're gonna get the water from.

219
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,820
- From the ocean?

220
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,660
- Yeah.

221
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,980
I'm you know I'm not so I'm not a city slicker right like I can rough it on the

222
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,620
boat so I'm gonna pull I'm just gonna pull a couple of cannons together and

223
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,980
kind of put my top part in one you don't want to sleep in the same bed no it's

224
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,940
like when you overfill a trash can like a trash bag and it won't close so you

225
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,980
got to put another trash bag on the top yes it's like an egg like an Easter egg

226
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,860
yes I'm doing that with two cannons yeah yeah the boat swing scurvy neck is

227
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
helping you sort of do that. So scurvy neck is like...

228
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
Well yeah, I need somebody to seal me in.

229
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
He's like, "Okay, is this what you want? Is this..."

231
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
Perfect.

232
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,860
"Okay, just... Alright, sleep tight then."

233
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,860
Here, I need a nice light. Light the candle that's attached to my bed.

234
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
No, no, no. I think... Okay, yep. Um...

235
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,860
I just want to inform you what that is.

236
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I don't need any... No information. No hablas...

237
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
Okay.

238
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Are you familiar with the...

239
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,340
works the melt blank. Okay, okay sure. And he goes over to the and lights one end of the

240
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,580
cannon. Oh hey there's another one on the other side of my bed light that too. Okay he runs over

241
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,620
and lights that. I just want to see what would happen. Okay cool. Cannon. Roll. I'm gonna have

242
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,180

243
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,420

245
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420

246
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,420

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
You have to roll for me.

249
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,080
Yeah, I mean I'm gonna roll for you anyway, so

250
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are they doing this to me?

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Why are they doing this to me? Let's do there we go there we go nothing all right. I'm just rolling damage. I hope you don't die

252
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,040
All right, where you at on health all right you do take 11 damage

253
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,280
From just like being rattled. It knocks me to sleep. Yeah, yeah, that's for sure

254
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,900
What was your HP at I think it wasn't let me check. I think it was like 17 or something. Yeah, I'm alive. It's fine

255
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,380
And if I get on here and it's and I'd actually you're long-resting right now. So

256
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,140
Yeah, of course you will. Yeah, I can look at so I also have access to your character sheet

257
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,200
That's part of why I did it. Yeah, I'll probably just lie to you though. Okay. Yeah, I heard he has one HP left

258
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I heard the opposite you know, you're at negative one. You're a zero. Yeah, so yeah

259
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,820

Yeah.

288
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,120
So Quartermaster, Wayne, like if you give him certain items, like he can help trace treasures.

289
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,820
So you'll be more likely to find magic items like on your journey.

290
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
If you-

291
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I give him an item?

292
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
No.

293
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,660
and you'll you'll find what I find dirt I give him or not dirt not dirt I find

294
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,020
you'll find out you'll find out what kinds of stuff you'll have to give him

295
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,860
yes I find them I find out and then a Oli also like there's certain if you find

296
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,340
certain ingredients like you can give it to him and get certain bonuses for stuff

297
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:59,220
he can cook for you I give him water to see if I get any bonuses I'm doing like

298
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,420
a point-and-click adventure game where I just click everything and every

299
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,420
the combination of everything on screen. I work I'm giving him I'm ripping up

300
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,820
planks of wood from the from the ship and I'm handing the name cook something

301
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,260
with this.

302
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,660
Oh,

303
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,860
no,

304
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:22,620
I could try, I guess, but yeah, no so like like use water on Pringles.

305
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,340
Now, please don't, but yeah, so I'm going to expand the I guess Pringles. I

306
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,060
just do bzorak is what I'm doing

307
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:39,060
a borat Zorak from Space Coast Coast to Coast that's me showing my age. All that

308
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,580
is me knowing what this is a show those on the TV in the nineteen forties or

309
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,500
something. No space goes so you guys go to all that's animation style. That's

310
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,780
right. You guys go to sleep basically looks Hannah Barbera like it looks like

311
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,300
someone drew it with pencils. All right. Crap I hate my colored pencils. I

312
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,260
should say how did I and markers as well. Oh they probably didn't have markers

313
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:06,280
in

314
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
up and like flowers and stuff. We're trying to find Sullivan so that we can make fun of

315
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,120
him. No, the whole point is that you're getting away from Sullivan. Oh yeah, I forgot. We're

316
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,660
trying to get away from him and we accidentally find him. Yeah, your journey's sailed to the

317
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,560
end of the world. We might accidentally find him. Maybe if we don't die. Yeah, facts though.

318
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,400
So yeah, you guys wake up the next day perfectly in time for the approach of... I didn't go

319
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,960
to sleep. I mean, I don't know about these guys, I don't remember saying I went to sleep.

320
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,800
I did fall asleep, unfortunately. Okay, I went to sleep, fine. For hot babe, I wanted

321
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,720
to stay up all night with you guys. So I like I so I kick up I kick myself out of

322
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,760
the cannon. Yeah, explain this to me. The cannon cocoon and I'm completely just

323
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:50,120
covered in soot and I do a big yawn and then I went I'm doing I'm drawing a lot

324
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,360
of portraits of you in that state and I'm filing them away. Jokes on you,

325
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:04,640
that's a shadow. Thank you for drawing my shadow. Also I hit my I like you know

326
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,800
wake up and I yawn and then there's a kind of an outline of me in dust and

327
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,980
also I get everything dust I'm like pig pen from the peanuts. Okay. I'm face down

328
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,600
in my waterbed because I didn't have like a tarp or anything. Face down in your

329
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,440
waterbed? That's dangerous. I'm face down in the water. Really? You fell asleep with your

330
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
face down in the water? Yeah, I fell asleep like that.

331
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
That's what... What are you talking about?

332
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Matt, are you going to intervene? Yeah, I know, I'm trying to figure this out.

333
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,440
So, what do you mean? I was... I had a water bed.

334
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,440
This is also... I'm just realizing how unlike any other D&D game.

Hoppe Bay Island, as you're approaching it, it has like this beautiful, pristine, like, sandy beach.

359
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,820
Like, it looks like a fucking Sandals Resort commercial.

360
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,420
I get so hard I pass out.

361
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,020

I have no idea what that game is called.

370
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,140
It's called Live Xtreme 3 Volleyball.

371
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,140
I have no idea what that game is called.

372
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,220
I never saw a game played.

373
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,500
Cameron told me that's what it's called.

374
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,260
They're drinking coconut drinks and wearing coconut bras.

375
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,860
Maybe they're drinking from their bras.

376
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,980
Do their boobs fit really good in the coconut bras or are their boobs so big that it's actually

377
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
spilling over?

378
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
What do you think?

379
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,740
Probably spilling over.

380
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,300
They probably fit well.

381
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,660

Yeah. Sure. Are these all Hickory's daughters?

388
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,580

389
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,700

Alright, whatever. I'd like to, I'd like to, what's it?

392
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,380
Dock your boat? We're attacking.

393
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,380
We're attacking? No, yeah, we're docking.

394
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,020
Do you want to attack the women? In a way.

395
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,180
I don't want to dock with you.

396
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,340
No we're gonna dock with the women.

397
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,500
See I don't want to do docking with you.

398
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,820
What if that impresses them?

399
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Only a few...

400
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,460
Like when girls make guys make out at a party?

401
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,340
I think it's usually the opposite.

402
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,540
Oh yeah it's like guys gone wild.

403
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,420
I don't think I've seen guys gone wild.

404
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,920
on the what's the like equivalent of a TV?

405
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I've seen a few plays of that.

406
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,420
If you don't want to play late enough at night, they do commercials.

407
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,100
Well you guys had in Cal Godot, you guys had like TV where it was like magically drawing

408
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
every frame.

409
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Yeah.

410
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Oh yeah.

411
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,500
It was recording, so it does exist.

412
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
I do like the-

413
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Like the Take On Me music video.

414
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Yeah.

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Yeah.

416
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
I do like the idea of guys gone wild.

417
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
That's what it is in this universe.

418
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Yeah, they don't have girls gone wild.

419
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
All right.

420
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,300
hot for guys to make out at parties in this world. Yeah. I've never been

421
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:41,660
invited to a party. But yeah, so I mean like only a few people ever get to go to

422
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,820
Hoppe Bay Island, like ever see it or it exists in this like amazing state where

423
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:55,260
it is this perfect place. Made in Israel. Israel that never is disturbed like

424
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,300
there's almost like a truce among the like universe to like just let this place

425
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,660
be perfect little it's perfect it's a perfect pussy perfect little pocket

426
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,180
yeah so as you guys approach you see how tall is every woman before we go what

427
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,540
how tall are all of them are most of them like over or like under five seven

428
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,020
they're like between like so if you need that sort of like five to kind of bitch

429
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:28,400
they got that. Facts. First time I've ever heard Patrick say facts and it was just so

430
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,060
poorly used. It doesn't make no sense. No, it made no sense. And no cap they have that.

431
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,620
And they have no cap there at all. Wait, do they actually have no cap? Yeah, they have

432
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,260
zero cap. For real? Yeah, you gotta go. Holy shit. And then they have like, they have like

433
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,740
like the Amazonian Queens. You know what I mean? They have any women like a

434
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,940
hundred feet tall, no five hundred. What about like a hundred pounds heavy?

435
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,040
Yeah, of course, what about they have a they have a woman there who has no

436
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:05,020
boobs and no ass and is basically a twig like a twig per like a walking stick

437
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,460
insect. They have a girl walking stick. Is there a girl whose spine is like an

438
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:19,320
shape no no hair and she's hooked up to a machine yeah she has something attacking

439
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,960
her from the inside yeah there's like a shy of oh sort of is there like a

440
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,320
shaped girl but it's like horizontal like the very hungry caterpillar there

441
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,840
is a caterpillar I guess that's the question is there is all traditionally

442
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,240
hot babes Playboy Mansion status or is it what the Playboy Mansion would be

443
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,160
these days with every kind of hot babes.

444
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Even maybe they have a girl with no hair.

445
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Yeah, no, it's mostly like I think like normative standard hot babes with the occasional...

446
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,480
Is it like 2008 beach party?

447
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,200
Yeah, it's FHM, Keeley Hazel...

448
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
No ass.

449
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,120
So it's like that, but it's like maybe there's one girl who looks like Jason Voorhees with

450
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
his mask off.

451
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120

Yeah. I've got thoughts on this. But yeah, Trunchbull'd come here with his crew.

499
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,980
Oh my god. They left, they went on more adventures. A lot of adventurers come

500
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,820
through here. Come in, I'll bring you to the whole island. Yeah, real quick, I

501
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,580
gotta use the little boys room. And I just walk over, because we're in

502
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:15,100
nature, I walk over to use, I just go into the ocean. But again,

503
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,820
I'm just coming into the ocean and like a peace dream like Calvin and Hobbes

504
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:26,860
Hot babe island is immediately ruined for me because I realized when I was like 13 I called every one of these women auntie

505
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:35,460
Also, there's fish in the ocean they start eating my cum like when you give it when you spit in the water and a fish eats

506
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,420
It let me just take a note on that. Yeah. Yeah, so they might I mean who knows what that yeah

507
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm like walking around hot babe island like Charlie Brown

508
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:51,500
when it goes because I realize I can't because all these women I mean I like

509
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:58,860
Christmas no like when he's depressed on Christmas you know the one okay okay so

510
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,660
like more like Michael Cera in Arrested Development when he's the real you're

511
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:09,300
sad yeah I'm sad we went to hot babe island they're all my aunts I'm

512
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,340
completely I'm I'm completely red I'm fidgeting I have glasses they're swirly

513
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,900
Yeah, I'm like, I don't know what to say. I'm like walking up to the different one. I'm like, ah,

514
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,820
Do you do you like water? Yeah water is super fun

515
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,180
Oh, let me get you some water I

516
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:36,420
Throw up more and more and every every second that her eyes are on me. I'm throwing up. Okay, she starts to look away

517
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
You stop suddenly

518
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,500
She looks over you start again

519
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,360
So yeah Juniper leads you guys through this through this like woods and by the hand

520
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,840
Yeah, she takes your hand. Oh

521
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,260
I'm riding on her back

522
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,340
Yeah, she laughs as you do. She's just chill. You still have my macaroni painting. I

523
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,000
Don't know. Maybe I'll fast a queen. Okay

524
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,420
Queen dips

525
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:12,640
Small flame fluorescents sort of hover magically along the path and they kind of like guide like they like they will like

526
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,960
are on along the path through the woods,

527
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,120
but also will move out in front of Juniper

528
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,240
and steer her as well and lead her through.

529
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,160
And it leads you guys to Hot Babe Central,

530
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,800
which opens up into this lush green field

531
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,320
filled with thatched roof,

532
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,160
thatched roof sort of like cottages

533
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,000
and expand outward,

534
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,520
punctuated by these white gravel pathways.

535
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
And there's these multi-storied buildings

536
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,960
made of red clay

537
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,560
that have a lot of different folks living inside of them.

538
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,080
And the place is somewhere between like, you know,

539
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,120
it's like kind of like Eden, right?

540
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,440
It's like, looks like a garden,

541
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,440
but it like has this kind of like lived in feel into it

542
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,000
and this kind of wild, wildness to the grass and stuff.

543
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,840
In the main square,

544
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,960
there's like a ton of like plants inside of it.

545
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
As you, you know, like these like plants

546
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,760
that like swirl and twirl and like these flowers

547
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,400
that like bloom and sort of like move and sway.

548
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,200
And the town square has like a fountain in the middle of it

549
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,520
that has the likeness of the Queen Bee herself.

550
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,880
It's like the queen of Hot Babe Island.

551
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,160
- What does she look like?

552
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,920
- It's based on the statue.

553
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,040
- A bee?

554
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,280
- She looks like a beautiful bee woman.

555
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
- Really? - Yes.

556
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,440
- Yeah, it awakened something in me.

557
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,800
I never knew, like a beautiful bug, rule 34 type of--

558
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,880
- Yeah, I never knew that a bug--

559
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,320
- I was wondering, is that an aspect of Hot Babe Island?

560
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,360
Like if they have monkeys and bugs, are they all like hot?

561
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
- Yeah. - Okay.

562
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,120
So any like, if you see like an animal swinging from a vine, yeah.

563
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,480
Any indigenous species is hot.

564
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes.

565
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
Okay.

566
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
What about the plants?

567
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
Uh, the plants?

568
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,480
The plants are- Like a sexy penis flytrap maybe?

569
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,520
I was about to say, but the plants are sometimes like shaped like babes.

570
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,880
Like they look like women.

571
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,880
Okay.

572
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
It's fucking awesome.

573
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah.

574
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,760
Um, and then she's sprouting waters from her eyes in this like statue, which is like tears

575
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,320
of joy it's supposed to be.

576
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,000
Um, the statue occasionally moves and like changes poses.

577
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,840
Does it ever orgasm?

578
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Uh, no.

579
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,680
I'm so much of the water and the water from this fountain like spills out into

580
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,240
these like small canals that like go along these like those like cottages and

581
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,480
those like other buildings where there's open marketplaces and you're drinking

582
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,120
from the live and yeah I'm weird I'm downstream from me these streams have

583
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,600
like it's no I'm right up I have my mouth on the eye hole and then those

584
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,880
filling me up like a water balloon pool in different sections of the the island

585
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,360
that are like and then are like magically sanitized and then those are always like

586
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,160
pool parties that are like introducing new locations so it's like Market Square

587
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,720
or like an arena or like a you know financial district or whatever it's just

588
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,400
like this like self-sustained place of just like bounty and yeah like bouncy

589
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:05,520
heard that. Yep. And as you guys approach the center you meet you see like a guy

590
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:14,600
looking at the the first guy you've seen just like staring at the statue. I immediately try to fuck him because I'm confused.

591
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:25,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's the hottest girl I've seen yet. Hey Hickory. Hey knock it off. Oh, Patrick how you doing? I'm good.

592
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:33,040
Oh, you came back here. Oh my god. Yeah, I forgot. I don't really know where time goes. Yeah, so everyone's my mom here. Oh

593
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,280
Yeah, you want to oh

594
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,720
No, I just wanna say hi

595
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,620
Okay, I forgot my mom lives here. You forgot your father's also your uncle. Oh, right

596
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:51,520
Is that revealed sometime at some point?

597
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,640
No, you just sort of decided that that was a man you insinuated that right now. Mm-hmm wasn't that revealed at the end?

598
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,040
Mm-hmm. I thought what we do the dance not the uncle-nephew dance

599
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,200
Okay, then this whole idea that I had was I'm open to it's all bunk

600
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,960
It's total bunk complete fucking bunk. Let's let's let's just forget. Let's forget that I had the whole

601
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,360
Everyone on the island is my aunt joke. I still think it's fun. Okay, we already did it though. So yeah, it's gone

602
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,440
done. So now you can just, you can either decide you're confused. Those people

603
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,640
already had their fun listening to that. Or you could have had like a revelation. Let's just

604
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,360
start the episode over. A combination of you finally arriving to Hot Babe Island

605
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,200
and you having the bit of the from the other realm inside of your body that

606
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,080
gives you perfect memory where you're able to suddenly like coalesce all the

607
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,640
details in your life that goes, "Oh, he wasn't my uncle. He was my father and he

608
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,200
pretended to be my uncle for reasons I don't understand. I feel like it's better

609
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,040
if it's a big reveal. Yeah but it's sort of like too late right? Okay so we'll reveal that later.

610
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,020
It is true but you already knew it, your character already knew it in the game

611
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,660
somehow but now it's gonna be a big reveal. It's like when people don't like

612
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,680
they kind of know what's going on with them but they don't want to admit it to

613
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,880
themselves. Yeah. Is this woman, it's like a reveal, is she bringing us to

614
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,120
anybody specific she said um she's gonna bring you guys to the Queen all right

627
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
He's revealing himself right now to all these women over there.

628
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I tried to tell them you guys you don't have to leave here this place is like

629
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,120
untouched by time but they all want to go on an adventure who does your uncle oh

00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,360
yeah yeah I was like this is it why wouldn't you just stay here

631
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:57,480
I'll be my see Hickory was part of my uncle's crew and he he was the the

632
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:08,840
minstrel what he was the part yes I sang many a shanty tune back in the day I

633
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:17,320
would sing off my body saying that of saying party rockers in the house I'd

634
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:27,360
sing a singer one two step right lots of songs I would sing I'm sorry you really

635
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:37,960
set him up for failure there you know he has to just go with it yeah unless we

636
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,020
break a rule but you know as you can hear I lost my voice since then I smoked

637
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,240
a lot of cigarettes here you could do like a cool like Tom Waits thing maybe

638
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,760
never thought about Earth Dying Screaming by Tom Waits you can sing that one

639
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
I don't think the babes would like it, but I think the fellas on the island would.

640
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
That's babe scaring music.

641
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,760
You're the only guys here. I haven't seen a man in like a hundred years.

642
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
You should...

643
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,760
You must be so bored, am I right? What's up?

644
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,760
How could he be bored? He gets to sit here and milk all the girls.

645
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
But he doesn't get to play any video games?

646
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
No such thing.

647
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Oh, right.

648
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Yeah, they don't let me milk the girls anymore.

649
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,240
anymore. What? He's done it all. That's like the whole point of him. Look at him, he's got it. Look at him, he's wearing a badge that says I've done it all.

650
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,480
All right, I'm gonna get the milk. You see this one he turns around on his ass as a tattoo that says I and I've seen it all too.

651
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:45,520
Yeah, he says you guys gonna go see the Queen then. Yeah. What flavor milk does she make?

652
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
Bee milk. Honey.

653
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,240
Then yes, I will see the Queen all right well. You know if you ever want a guy's perspective. Let me know

654
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,640
I'm just chillin here. Why would I need a guy's perspective?

655
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,840
Yeah, we are guys with three of three guys. I wonder the same thing sometimes

656
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,880
All right bye Hickory, okay, good. Bye. Yeah, and so yeah juniper leads you guys past the fountain

657
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,400
Towards another little like sort of wooded pathway. I'm milking her you're milking her

658
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
*makes squidward noises*

659
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,120
making those noises

660
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
oh my god it's squidward he's walking up to us

661
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
*makes squidward noises*

662
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,120
stop milking her

663
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
*laughter*

664
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
he just walked away

665
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,120
*laughter*

666
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,120
what the fuck was that

667
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,120
juniper

668
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,120
juniper what the fuck was that

669
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
that wasn't a babe

670
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
it's like he walked right out of the ocean

671
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
and just walked up to us and walked back

672
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
what the fuck was going on he was so blue

673
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:50,760
and grumpy made no sense I'm so glad I'm not neighbors with that guy he's playing

674
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,720
the clarinet guy looked like a blue bitch

675
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,440
what's under this island all right now let's go

676
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,440
hand comes from the left side of the screen and pulls us to the queen

677
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,440
that ukulele music

678
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,800
as you guys walk through the woods I can't address any of that reasonably

679
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,160
there's a big crystal lake sort of in the center of it it's like this like

680
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,640
shiny almost like chrome looking water

681
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,640
and you guys are led through it

682
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,680
and as you do you can breathe under this water unlike your waterbed

683
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,140
And you can see that there's like a hive inside,

684
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,160
like a large hive inside the bottom of this lake.

685
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,000
There's like this--

686
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
- Like on Naboo.

687
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,740
- And very similar to the Gungans.

688
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,820
And inside of that hive, you go in

689
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,240
and there's this beautiful palace

690
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,240
with portraits of babes, of babes from bygone eras.

691
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,520
- Like Mario 64.

692
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,420
- Like Mario 64.

693
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,840
And a throne.

694
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,680
- Like Game of Thrones. - Like Game of Thrones, yeah.

695
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

696
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,340
- You guys are quick.

697
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,780
couldn't even think of a throne show.

698
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,180
And you see a queen.

699
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,020
Like Game of Thrones.

700
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,220
Like, deck of cards.

701
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,820
And it's the Queen Bee.

702
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,660
Like bees.

703
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,480
(mimicking Queen Bee)

704
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,620
Like the alphabet letter.

705
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,460
Beaming out one.

706
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,200
So there's the time.

707
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,700
Yeah, you see the Queen Bee.

708
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,900
And she says to you all,

709
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,700
"Welcome to Babe Island."

710
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Like D&D.

711
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Alright, alright, toots, listen.

712
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Who's your boss?

713
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh.

714
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,700
Show me the real boss here, okay?

715
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
I can get it.

716
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
You're a beautiful secretary, okay?

717
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
But, come on.

718
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
Let's be real.

719
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Uh, roll just a straight charisma check on that.

720
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,700
I think that was pretty fucking charismatic if you ask me.

721
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,700
That's not why you're rolling it.

722
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,700
I think it was pretty charismatic.

723
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
A saving throw or?

724
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,660
Just a regular, it'll just add your charisma stat.

725
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
That's gonna be a 14.

726
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
Okay, yeah.

727
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,460
She, uh, she sort of smiles and like, thinks it's like, kind of, maybe like a, just a little

728
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
joke.

729
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,260
Um, she says, uh.

730
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,220
So now I'm funny to you.

731
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,900
Oh, um, I suppose if you're...

732
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,580
Who are you three?

733
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
I'm a comedian.

734
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Okay, and your name?

735
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Stievel.

736
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,580
And you?

737
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,580
And you

738
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,900
That's how it's pronounced

739
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,780
But I'm a

740
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,940
Patrick

741
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,500
Patrick yeah

742
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,380
Said auntie earlier

743
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
Said hi auntie Wow

744
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,700
Auntie why you've grown?

745
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,580
Yeah

746
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,440
Well, are you looking for your mother? I don't even know don't reveal

747
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:03,740
No, we're trying to know father. That's not it's the father thing that isn't revealed yet and you Goblin. Yep

748
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,440
Your name it's Goblin. Oh

749
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,860
I'm Rod

750
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:17,600
Why did you come to babe island I'm Rod Oaken

751
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,700
basically dig I

752
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,260
Think we came to have if I'm remembering correctly

753
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,780
The time of our lives you certainly will be able to do so he is and

754
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:37,560
Milk as many women. There's only some of them who are okay with that. But yeah, you can certainly and also did

755
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,300
We gonna eat her. I missed so many Mother's Days. I

756
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,700
Have oh, yeah, I guess we should I guess we should stop by his mom, too. I

757
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:55,060
Have all I have is a bag of ball bearings for her though, but okay, so here's the deal we are adventurers

758
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:57,060
As you can probably tell.

759
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,060
Only adventurers with adventure in their heart can find Babe Island.

760
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
That's right.

761
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,060
Yeah, that's how my uncle got here.

762
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,060
Very flowery. Not exactly how I would say it.

763
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,060
Yeah.

764
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,060
You know, you're a girl, I'm a girl.

765
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
When you're cruising for poos.

766
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,060
Yeah. We're trying to get some sloop.

767
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,060
Okay?

768
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,060
[laughter]

769
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
And basically, we thought this would be a nice pit stop.

770
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,060
We're trying to get as far away as possible from one part of the world.

771
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,060
So we're trying to get to the end of the other side of the world.

772
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,760
You're trying to go to the end of the world.

773
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,260
Yeah.

774
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,960
Do you have like a thing we could put on the ship that makes it go faster so we can do it faster?

775
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,460
Nobody's been to the end of the world.

776
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,860
Not who's been to Babe Island.

777
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,960
Okay, she's ignoring me.

778
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,860
I don't have anything for that.

779
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,060
I'm sorry.

780
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,560
All right.

781
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Done it.

782
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,260
Worth a shot.

783
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:47,460
What if we got every girl on Babe Island to sit on the back and milk themselves to make it shoot like a thruster and make the ship go faster?

784
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:47,960
Is that possible?

785
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
What if we put a woman on the front of the ship?

786
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,260
Like, I don't know.

787
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,620
Like the thing in the Titanic?

788
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
I don't even fucking know.

789
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,620
That's how milking... it's not always a thrust.

790
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,620
Okay, or they fart.

791
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Yeah. They could fart.

792
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,620
The girls here at least gotta be farting all the time.

793
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,620
None of the women here fart.

794
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
Okay, they at least gotta be doing queefs.

795
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
They all queef.

796
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620
And little pees with power. You know how powerful a girl's pee is?

797
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620
Pushing pee?

798
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,620
That's funny.

799
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:30,620
[Laughter]

800
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
Is there anything you can do to help us?

801
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,620
Well, I can certainly steer you in the right direction.

802
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,620
We already have a steering wheel on the ship.

803
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Oh wait, we're getting an upgraded steering wheel.

804
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:52,340
I suppose I want to first hold on um and she she she goes back behind her throne

805
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:00,680
I follow her I look to Patrick I'm giving them a thumbs up I know what she's doing

806
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,700
back there I know what they're doing back there

807
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,180
seriously they're hugging really I seriously think they it's my aunt I don't

808
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,180
I don't want to think about that.

809
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,980
Bro, he's seriously hugging her.

810
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,580
I don't want to think about my unhugging.

811
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,580
Can you imagine the whole...

812
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,420
She goes back behind there, I mean she comes out like pretty quickly after, so you're just

813
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,420
like...

814
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
I'm still back there.

815
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
I got lost.

816
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,580
I got my foot caught under the throat.

817
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady, you're wearing the same outfit you were wearing 40 seconds ago.

818
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,660
She has a...

819
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,660
Walk of shame.

820
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:48,460
Walk of shame. Walk of shame. She been hugging. She hugged someone back there. I told you she was hugging.

821
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:55,740
Quietly chanting, "Walk of shame." So yeah, she comes out with like a sort of like a this

822
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:03,700
like diamond and she holds it and as she holds it out your stomach starts to glow

823
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:17,660
Patrick and she says I see what you should just know that the journey you're

824
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:23,020
going on you might not be able to come back from

825
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:29,260
steve-o right uh-huh what if we just go back

826
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,340
what if we just call the journey off you're not supposed to

827
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,060
be here do you know that oh yeah he's not allowed a hundred feet

828
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,260
within within a babe within a babe within any

829
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,820
babe or man no that's not babe that yeah

830
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,540
You've been told this a couple of times.

831
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,340
Yeah, yeah.

832
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,780
Throughout the last arc.

833
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:56,620
And she says, "I'm... but not just like here. Anywhere."

834
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,420
"I'm not supposed to be anywhere."

835
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,700
"I don't want to drop too much armor."

836
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,420
Real as fuck.

837
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,820
She looks further into the diamond.

838
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,260
"This is from another realm."

839
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,460
Are you saying I should just kill myself?

840
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,140
No, no, no. It's far from it.

841
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,140
Okay, then can I milk you?

842
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,120
Um, no.

843
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Okay, finish your diamond talk.

844
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,060
Could I...

845
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
have a hair from your beard?

846
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,260
Is he gonna eat the diamond too?

847
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,260
The way Joey drew you, you had a beard.

848
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah, you can have some hair.

849
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,260
Okay.

850
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,940
She plucks a hair from your beard.

851
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,740
If he didn't have a beard, he'd be just a completely hairless dwarf.

852
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,540
Yeah.

853
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,540
He'd be kinda out there.

854
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,540
Wait, am I bald?

855
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,120
No, not-- I mean, you had a-- so in Joey's drawing,

856
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,240
you have a beard, and you wear a Yankees fitted--

857
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah, but what's under that?

858
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,240
Do I have hair?

859
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,000
Be real with me.

860
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,460
It's up to you.

861
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:53,320
Your character.

862
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,280
OK, I'm bald.

863
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,120
OK.

864
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,360
Damn.

865
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,880
So yeah, she takes that and says,

866
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,400
I'm going to try to analyze this for you.

867
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,120
And she turns to you, Patrick, and says,

868
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,880
it's been some time since you've been here. Do you still want to be a great adventurer?

869
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:24,120
What? Do you still want to be a great adventurer like your uncle? Yeah, well I already am one.

870
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:29,160
This is true. I'm pretty much already, I mean I've done probably a bigger adventure than he did. I

871
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,600
went to uh another dimension or something. I don't think he's ever done that. We met a talking toilet.

872
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,600
We met a talking toilet, uh...

873
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,600
You should be aware that danger is going to seek you out soon.

874
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
Because of the thing in my belly?

875
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,600
Yes.

876
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,600
What if I... what if I poop it out?

877
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,600
I'm afraid you can't poop that out.

878
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
So it's not in my belly?

879
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Some things you can't poop with you.

880
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
That's so beautiful. Wow.

881
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
So danger's gonna... what do you mean...

882
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
What? Sorry, no, you should finish.

883
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Who's danger?

884
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
I can't tell exactly, I just know it's coming.

885
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,600
This crystal here that I have, this diamond crystal, is from a realm of all-knowing.

886
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,600
And I use it to try to understand better what's happening in our realm.

887
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,600
That's how I've been able to keep Hot Babe Island preserved.

888
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
I tried to eat it.

889
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
Please don't eat this one.

890
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
[Laughter]

891
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,600
This is how Hot Babe Island has been untouched by the forces that live in this planet.

892
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,600
So if he ate that, basically all the babes would turn into saggy old grannies?

893
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
No, no, no, I don't--

894
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
And then we just walk around, they're so stupid.

895
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,600
stupid. You see, when the Terrifier won the war, the police had to retreat, but

896
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,320
they've protected us. If you destroy this, I don't know if the police will be able

897
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,640
to protect us anymore. I'm still, I'm still behind. I'm still... Remember there were two

898
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,760
major forces in the war. The Terrifier and the police. The God of Good, the

899
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:59,880
police. Your idea. And the Terrifier, the God of Evil. I'm still, I'm still stuck

900
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,240
behind the throne I don't realize that the Queen went back out and is talking

901
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,920
to them and I think that they still think that we're having sex so I'm just going

902
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:27,600
like oh yeah you've been touched by the dirt God what back there for him you've

903
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,600
been touched by the whole new meaning to backing that thing up. You know what I mean?

904
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,720
Yep. That's right. It's an entirely new meaning. I don't want to kill myself tomorrow.

905
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,440
This gives a whole new meaning.

906
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,400
You've been touched by the dirt god, no? Unfortunately.

907
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,800
Un-fortunately. Have you ever been to the dirt lands?

908
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,080
No. You haven't been to the dirt lands?

909
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,800
I don't know. So the dirt lands are-

910
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,160
No, I was in Trebuchet Village.

911
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,680
The whole time of your whole life, right?

912
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,480
Well, actually, I guess I was a dirt farmer before, so maybe I -

913
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,000
You might have been - I'm asking you.

914
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,120
Can I see the map again?

915
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:09,760
Yeah, absolutely. It is far from Nardzia, which is where -

916
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,360
I don't think I was there. I don't think I went that far.

917
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,280
You've never been to Dirtlands? You've never been that far?

918
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,520
Yeah, so you're sort of like kind of like an odd transplant then that you have this

919
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,360
like dirt worship background, but we're in Nardzia, which is like sort of the capital

920
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,280
of the kingdom. So you've never been to Dirtlands. This is what I wanted to know.

921
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
You could have been there, but like I want to know.

922
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,120
We were in - it's like the Chinatown of Nardzia, but for dirt land.

923
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,080
Oh.

924
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,920
It's dirt. I was from dirt town.

925
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,840
Dirt town inside of Trebuchet Village.

926
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,400
Yeah.

927
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,160
Because Trebuchet Village is the capital.

928
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,640
Okay, yeah.

929
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,200
Is what I -

930
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,160
The dirt neighborhood.

931
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,840
Yeah, the dirt neighborhood of Trebuchet Village.

932
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:50,800
Hell yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So I'll go back out. There we go. Okay, cool. So she says,

933
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:58,640
Perhaps you can find something there if you wish to reconvene with your dirt God. I sense a longing

934
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:06,380
You've come in call a I've that guy with that with that guy more like a shorting I don't want don't want to go

935
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,300
Don't want to but I secretly do I?

936
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,400
Secretly miss dirt really. Yep. I didn't know that

937
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,640
Well, you've come. Oh, we won't reveal that yet. Okay. Well, we're really

938
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,800
Big if you keep listening, we're gonna do all the reveals at once we're gonna do one of these episodes only reveals

939
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Yeah, it's gonna be epic

940
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:36,580
Why did you even close the chips in the first place oh

941
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,400
My god, oh I

942
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,640
Would like to hear the Queen B. She says I

943
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,720
I just wanted to know where each of you stood in your adventures and your journeys, but

944
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,560
It's good to know. I hope you find your answers. You're looking for if not here elsewhere

945
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,640
We'll hear it will be able to resupply you so you guys know you guys only had like a few days left of supplies

946
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,840
So you can get fully restocked here

947
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,440
So I'll wait a gene that you can I have it for a little while until next time you have to stop

948
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,300
Okay, whenever the big the main thing is over. I want to do a huddle with these two and I have a plan

949
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:17,680
Yeah, she says um you're welcome to stay here for as long as you'd like just like Hickory

950
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,380
Later this evening we're actually going to have a pillow fight if you want to join

951
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:28,080
Oh my and how often do those happen only once every year. Oh

952
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,160
It's a big pillow fight on hot babe Island. I won't be watching

953
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,440
It's all my aunts

954
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,560
Do you want to participate then?

955
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,600
Feel like that's weirder

956
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,120
Probably he is weirder. I think do you still have my coloring station?

957
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:51,200
Yes, and I have your macaroni art. Do all the pillows get covered in all the juices?

958
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,720
Well, if any of the women are

959
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,040
juicing

960
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,040
juicing

961
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:03,320
Then yes, I suppose incidentally that happens. All right, then. Yes, I'll show up

962
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,120
Oh, I don't know if any of them bleed. Does anyone menstruate on this entire island?

963
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,900
Unfortunately, we all know we will be leaving. I don't think we were gonna make

964
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:25,040
Yeah, I mean that so that so it's over she dismisses you guys I'm huddle okay guys huddle up

965
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:31,240
Okay, so on our ship. We have a lot of barrels filled with a lot of dolphin men

966
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,680
Now what if we?

967
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,160
one-to-one

968
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Pulled a little switcheroo

969
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,100
Replaced each dolphin man with a babe

970
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,880
Sailed away in the dead of night. Oh my

971
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,760
You want to put all my aunts in barrels? They don't have to stay in the barrels

972
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,320
We won't get all of them to you know, they we only as many only I'm like, we only have any seventh out

973
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,880
Okay, I was 20 of those guys or something. Is there a line I could draw around human trafficking?

974
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,200
We do it. We're not

975
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,680
shipping them

976
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:11,660
We're taking it for one place. We're taking for one place. We're bringing

977
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:18,600
a better home. They hate it here. They hate it here. They've always wanted to

978
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,380
see those. I bet the rubbers will love it on Babe Island. Yeah. We're actually

979
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,140
you know this okay fine. Maybe we're human trafficking, but we're actually

980
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,500
doing a good deed for these rubbers. What if we leave all the rubbers on this

981
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,020
island? Yeah, we are human trafficking, but we're also we're freeing an

982
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
equivalent number of slaves

983
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
exactly

984
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
so it's zero

985
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
in the eyes of god it's nothing

986
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,040
it's a zero

987
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,040
what if we leave all the rubbers on this island

988
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
and then

989
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
i get a bunch of cousins

990
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,040
i mean they are a part of the reason why

991
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
your supplies are draining quickly

992
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
is because you added

993
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,040
you guys added like

994
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,040
basically like 40 more people

995
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,040
to your boat

996
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,720
What if we breed them with the women on the island?

997
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,560
- That's what I just said.

998
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,600
I said I get more cousins.

999
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,640
- Shh.

1000
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,760
What if we breed the dolphins

1001
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,680
and we look at every single second of it?

1002
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,440
- What if we just eat them?

1003
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,280
- The rubbers?

1004
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,100
I wanna eat them.

1005
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,600
- We're running out of supplies.

1006
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
- No, I would rather watch them--

1007
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,640
- We're getting a resupply though.

1008
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,640
- I would rather sneak them--

1009
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,120
Wait.

1010
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,680
I got an idea.

1011
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,520
- Okay, what's your idea?

1012
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,720
- What if we take, right, a bunch of pillowcases

1013
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,440
and we put the rubbers from the barrels

1014
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,760
into the pillowcases

1015
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,380
sneak them into the pillow fight. Okay. And the babes will probably, they, cuz they like

1016
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:42,380
put the pillows on their things and crap. Yeah, maybe they might. They might get pregnant.

1017
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,620
Yeah, they would do a mommy-daddy dance and then all of a sudden, a special seed, and

1018
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:54,300
we could have basically an endless supply of dolphin slaves from Hot Babe Island. It'd

1019
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:00,460
be our slaves island. That's a great idea, but you have to remember that those are all

1020
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,900
going to be my new cousins and we're going to have to treat them with a lot of respect.

1021
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,820
Okay. You have to treat them with respect. Yeah, they ain't shit to me. Alright, fine.

1022
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:17,820
And I get to be, I don't know, the de facto leader/big cousin? Of them? Yeah. Alright.

1023
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:26,260
Or I know we were bringing these rubbers. What do you mean, it's a perfect game? These

1024
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,260
They were telling them they were gonna build a theme park somewhere.

1025
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,260
What if we put them all to work and it's a...

1026
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,260
These babes, right? There's only hickory here.

1027
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,260
They probably never get to have babies.

1028
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,260
They probably are really sad.

1029
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,260
We could make a store where the babes could go to and pay money

1030
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,260
to have a baby with the rubber.

1031
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,260
And then we get the cousin slave and some money.

1032
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,260
And it goes on forever.

1033
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
But what if they only give birth to girls?

1034
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,260
Then we'll kill them.

1035
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:55,760
Okay.

1036
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,040
Just kill all the girl babies.

1037
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,700
I don't care.

1038
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,200
Yeah.

1039
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,840
It's a great idea.

1040
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,940
And then when those babies get older, they'll fuck more babes.

1041
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,440
Yeah.

1042
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,280
Like they'll fuck their moms.

1043
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,780
Yeah.

1044
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,780
And then we have kind of an endless...

1045
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,280
Exactly.

1046
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,280
And it just, yeah, it's perfect.

1047
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,280
So we have endless...

1048
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,280
It is lots of fish people.

1049
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,520
Alright.

1050
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,320
We'd like to...

1051
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,060
You're dropping it all right to me?

1052
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,560
Yep.

1053
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,620
Yeah, we lock it in.

1054
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,120
We'd like to...

1055
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,720
You're locking it in, gang?

1056
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,920
We'd like to go to the...

1057
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,920
We're gonna make a sexual story.

1058
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,920
The board of directors for Hot Babe Island, is there anything like that or is it just the queen?

1059
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Yeah, Mary Kate Ashley runs the...

1060
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Okay, we'd like to apply for a permit, for a business permit.

1061
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
Okay.

1062
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
Yeah.

1063
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Alright, so yeah, you guys can head to the market district and apply for a business permit.

1064
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
We do so.

1065
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Okay, cool.

1066
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,920
So you guys leave the hive, you kind of walk out of the lake and you take the path through the woods.

1067
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Same one.

1068
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Wait, shouldn't we tell the Queen Bee that we're just gonna build a slave store?

1069
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,920
No.

1070
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,420
Why would we tell her?

1071
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,420
We wanna do what seems convenient.

1072
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,420
He's trying to sabotage it.

1073
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,420
I'm not trying to sabotage it.

1074
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,420
He's trying to sabotage it.

1075
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,420
I'm not trying to sabotage it.

1076
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,420
I'm just trying to get the proper permits.

1077
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,420
No, shh.

1078
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,420
He's trying to sabotage.

1079
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,420
Shh, shh, shh.

1080
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,420
Let me handle this, okay?

1081
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,420
Okay.

1082
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:15,920
You get to the fountain and you take one of the little streams on a, you ride on a little

1083
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,920
like tube on one of the streams.

1084
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,920
That is so cute.

1085
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,200
It's adorable, it's like a lazy river.

1086
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,920
To, yeah, the market district.

1087
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,080
And you see a lot of babes selling crystals and incense

1088
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,520
and things that babes like.

1089
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,320
- This is all completely, this stuff works, really.

1090
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,720
(laughing)

1091
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,920
- And yeah, and you see one of the babes,

1092
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,320
you're sort of directing more of it,

1093
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,160
and that's Mary Kate Ashley.

1094
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,560
So yeah, you guys can go talk to her.

1095
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,560
- Hi.

1096
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,880
- Guys, I know how to talk to girls.

1097
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,960
- All right, you handle it, you handle it.

1098
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,680
- Hi, welcome to Hot Babe Island.

1099
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,520
- Oh!

1100
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,680
- Duh, we want to get a business permit, duh.

1101
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,940
(laughing)

1102
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,280
- I mean, yeah, sure.

1103
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Okay, what's your business proposal?

1104
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,960
Let's, actually, hold on, let's come to my office, please.

1105
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,520
And she walks a little bit further in,

1106
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,860
beaded curtain to a sort of modest little office room,

1107
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,640
and she says, "So, what are you gentlemen proposing?"

1108
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,720
"We wanna make a store, and that's pretty much--"

1109
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,220
- Hi, Auntie.

1110
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,920
- Oh, Patrick!

1111
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,880
- We're doing this every fucking time we see a girl.

1112
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,160
- How are you?

1113
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,000
- I'm good.

1114
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,560
Can we open a funny store?

1115
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,600
- Of course you can.

1116
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,040
- Okay, we're good.

1117
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,440
- Well, yeah, I just wanna know

1118
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,720
a little bit more about details.

1119
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,600
- He's with me.

1120
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,200
- It fulfills an important need.

1121
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,320
- It sells medicine.

1122
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,520
- Okay.

1123
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,880
- Yep, we found a miracle cure.

1124
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,920
- And it's part of the service.

1125
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,080
- It's a sexual favor store.

1126
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,720
- Yeah, okay, it's a sex store.

1127
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,480
It's gonna have smokestacks.

1128
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,720
So we basically got 40--

1129
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,120
It's gonna pollute the sky.

1130
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,440
We have 40 of the hottest guys,

1131
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,000
who have dolphin, in the entire world, right?

1132
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,200
And they have agreed--

1133
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,120
Because they're slaves.

1134
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,600
They're shiny and oiled up.

1135
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,440
That they are going to,

1136
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,520
they're very shiny, waxy skin almost,

1137
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,520
and that they are going to donate sperm by fucking--

1138
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,040
And that's a type of dolphin.

1139
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
By fucking it, shhh.

1140
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,040
By fucking every girl on the entire island at our store.

1141
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,040
For a price.

1142
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,040
For a price, of course.

1143
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,040
That's the business part.

1144
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,040
We're not giving away free service.

1145
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,040
Nah, come on.

1146
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
Roll...

1147
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
Roll awesomeness.

1148
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Roll persuasion and...

1149
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
Can we assist?

1150
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Yeah, and then deception.

1151
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,040
Persuasion and deception? I didn't lie about a single thing.

1152
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,040
There's no lies except for both of these stuff.

1153
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,040
I said everything right under my breath.

1154
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,540
- Persuasion, I'm rolling persuasion.

1155
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,040
- So persuasion and deception.

1156
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,380
- So to assist, you're just gonna roll or just hit?

1157
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,620
- I got, okay.

1158
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,720
Advantage, okay.

1159
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,660
- That is a dirty 20.

1160
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,660
- 19.

1161
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,100
- That's his, just his roll with advantage.

1162
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,540
- Okay, so I got a 19.

1163
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:55,380
- That's good.

1164
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,220
- Plus two on precision, so a 21.

1165
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,060
- Nice.

1166
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,420
- And deception.

1167
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,660
- Also advantage?

1168
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,140
- Yeah.

1169
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:02,980
- Okay.

1170
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,620
Let's see.

1171
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:08,820
11.

1172
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:09,640
- Okay.

1173
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,480
22 on deception. You don't have to roll a single. So, um,

1174
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,920
I mean with the 21 that persuasion she's,

1175
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,040
she finds your like proposal compelling.

1176
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,360
The idea of, um,

1177
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,560
she finds it compelling.

1178
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,560
Cause you know, it's like there are,

1179
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,280
isn't a lot of options for those who want to have sex with,

1180
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,600
with sort of a, uh, with dolphins, dolphins, really just hickory, right.

1181
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,640
It was really just for people who want to fuck a penis. And yeah,

1182
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,640
for people who want to do that, like, like, I mean,

1183
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,320
some penis options but it's mostly Hickory who's like down. And then as far

1184
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:49,520
as believing that they're not slaves, she does think they're slaves probably. So

1185
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:56,240
based on what you're about to read body language wise. I use my nephew's glint

1186
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:04,040
ability. Nephew's glint? Yeah. What do you do? I make my eyes go really big and I

1187
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:09,160
and I put my hands under my chin like I'm taking a photo at Sears.

1188
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:15,320
Well that's... Do you have that ability? That ability, yes. I do think it's cute though.

1189
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:20,920
Then I put... is she about to talk and say no to us? She's about to talk. I can't tell if she's gonna say no.

1190
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,280
I'm gonna put a bunch of cotton in her mouth.

1191
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:32,440
I guess roll an attack roll? Never mind. Well just because it is like...

1192
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,440
I don't want to hurt her.

1193
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,960
It wouldn't be hurting her, it's just to see if you're going to succeed.

1194
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Alright, okay.

1195
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,960
She's going to get caught in her mouth.

1196
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
Alright, I put a bunch of...

1197
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,960
Just a...

1198
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,320
But I'm saying roll an attack roll because that is what is happening.

1199
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,320
It's a...

1200
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,320
I think maybe don't roll attack.

1201
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
But you won't do damage.

1202
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
Alright, alright.

1203
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:51,040
Okay, as long as I don't do damage, I wouldn't want to hurt her, okay?

1204
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,520
So I'm going to do...

1205
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,520
Alright.

1206
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,520
So I rolled...

1207
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,520
I rolled a 17.

1208
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,780
Oh yeah, I mean, that beats her AC.

1209
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:00,780
You get caught in her mouth.

1210
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,220
So it's pretty hard to, I mean listen, I know you're gonna say something but it seems like

1211
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,180
your mouth is fucking full of cotton at this point so it's pretty tough to-

1212
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,540
Why did you do that?

1213
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,580
I put it back in her mouth.

1214
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,940
Roll again.

1215
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:16,060
She was gonna say yes, dude.

1216
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,460
Yeah, I think you're ruining it.

1217
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,940
She was gonna say yes.

1218
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,420
What'd you get?

1219
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,060
Seven.

1220
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,260
A seven? Okay, yeah. She like moves aside so I was like, "I'm sorry, Patrick, but I-"

1221
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,580
No, that's how we say hello where we're from. I'm very sorry.

01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,880
so you glue your bottom up with it.

1283
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,560

01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,420
but it's really not that much. - It's a white and green toy.

1289
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,200
- It can be used as medicine. - And we're shouting,

01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,980
I guess deception again, or?

1300
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,420
- Okay, we're gonna start a farmer's market.

1309
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,700

01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,100
i'm talking really quietly she can hear me she's really just waiting for

1311
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,300
dissidents as they were starting a library or something when i was a little

1312
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:59,100
permit just cross out library and writes every role or if you're a little

1313
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:02,360
bit early smart that's what i've been trying to make happen

01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:16,180
I'm recalling it was to say that you were just gonna sell play-doh like a toy like white. Yeah, ooh

1317
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:19,780
She says okay, you can sell like a toy

Store, I guess

1319
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,180
Okay, okay

1320
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:29,380
But just just for today just just for fun. But what if the store is very successful?

1321
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,420
Then we'll have a conversation at that point. Okay, we have work to do. Okay, we have like already

1322
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,020
There's already a stand in the market. There's already there's already like, um, yeah

We've already told them the slaves to start building it.

01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:46,540
Yeah, there's like a Civilization V animation of like a huge factory going up.

1325
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,940
Yeah, and then on the sign it says "Boy Toy Factory."

1326
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:53,140
That's good.

1327
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,260
It's right in the middle of the market square.

1328
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,260
It's amazing.

1329
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,260
It's gigantic.

1330
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,500
If she tries to give us any shit, we're just saying, "Yeah, we're building a toy store,

1331
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
