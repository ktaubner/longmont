[explosion]

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,800
Wow, dude.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:22,300
Dude, I just synced up the record countdown to the "Dropping Better Off Alone" by Alice DJ.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
How'd you do that?

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
'Cause I was the one who did the countdown.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,300
How'd you sync it up?

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,300
I synced it up.

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,800
Since you've got vaccinated, you have been different.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,280
This is not... I don't like this Patrick.

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,800
Yeah, he's changed.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Like house music Patrick, he's fucking...

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
He's weird.

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
What are you doing? Stop dancing dude.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
You're doing karate right now.

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Stop!

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
I need you to... you're supposed to talk.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
No, no.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
That's the song?

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,800
That's the one you listen to? What the fuck?

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
You're listening to like the music that you can add royalty free on YouTube?

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,720
you do dude you were no if you if you let me hear one of those those baby

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,640
keyboards that plays animal sounds to the tune of like twinkle twinkle little star

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,600
he'll go fucking nuts I've been listening to this and I've been listening to

29
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,680
gypsy woman she's homeless by crystal waters a lot that's the name you just

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,440
like the name of the song right no I mean that's why you don't like the name

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,240
of every time that's why do you smile whenever you say it no that sounds like

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,480
- I like that, like a track on like a

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Norm Macdonald stand up album.

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
- Yeah, it's a gypsy woman.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
- Yeah, it's a gypsy woman, she's fucking homeless.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,680
Isn't that what being a gypsy's all about?

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,840
- I mean, get this, she's homeless.

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah, fucking la-da-dee, la-da-da.

39
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,340
- Yeah, that's his catchphrase.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,440
He's a catchphrase comic, and his catchphrase is

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,200
la-da-dee, la-da-da.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
- He loves music and skipping around.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,080
- Yep, that's just one of his main things.

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,120
He's a sarcastic, skipping comedian.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,160
I got stuck with the fungus today, dude.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Yeah.

47
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
They gave me my first dose of the fungus today.

48
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Yeah.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,200
The fungus amogus.

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,240
I had to go all the way to the Bronx and I got there, I checked in and the nurse who

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,040
administered my shit, she was like, "What's your name?"

52
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
And I was like, "Caleb."

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
She was like, "Oh, Caleb.

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,960
I have a son named Caleb.

55
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,080
That's a very nice name."

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
You saw your mom?

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,640
No, it was not my mom.

58
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,240
Her son spells it with a K, I learned from her.

59
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
Your mom's son spells it with a K?

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,800
can I finish my story? It's good, you're gonna like it." And then she

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,600
said, "Last name?" and I said, "Pitts." And she just started laughing. And she started

62
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,240
laughing like so hard and like bent over laughing and I was like, "What?" She's

63
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:49,760
like, "You have made my day." I was like, "That's my name. That's just my name. Why is it so funny?"

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,600
funny and she started laughing, she laughed the entire time, she stuck a needle in me

65
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,560
and then she made me leave and I had to go to the waiting room where there was a-

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm telling you dude, the nurses at the vaccination places are on some other shit.

67
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Oh for sure.

68
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,640
I had to wait 10 minutes and-

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,520
I had to wait 30.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,080
Well they have to make sure that you don't have anything going on.

71
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,080
That's true.

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Make sure you don't develop autism in the time.

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,120
They made me wait 30 minutes because I told them I'm allergic to amoxicillin.

74
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah, they made me wait 30 minutes too because I had anaphylaxis as a kid.

75
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,360
Yeah, I was showing the lady, like there was just a lady in a hallway like pointing people

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,360
to the room and I showed her like the 30 minutes thing.

77
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
I was like, "Oh, where do I wait?"

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
She was like, "Damn, you got 30 minutes?"

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
And I was like, "Is that bad?"

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
She's like, "Most people got 15."

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Dude, I'm a pro.

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
They made me wait 10, dude.

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
They knew I was healthy as a horse.

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,880
They hid the camera that you died.

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,640
There was a guy there, like a Russian dude, who was like, "Oh, I have headache."

86
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
And the lady was like, "Are you allergic to something?"

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
And he's like, "I have many allergies in Russia."

88
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,880
And she was like, "Okay," and gave him a water bottle.

89
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,480
But yeah, it did not develop a cold or autism or anything like that.

90
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,120
I mean, the amount of time they make you wait is just how much they care about if you die.

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
Like if it's 10 minutes, it's not that it's going to take 10 minutes for you to go into

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
anaphylactic shock.

93
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,280
just that yeah they don't really care if you do. They love me down there. Once they let you free

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,160
there's no correlation. Once they let you free they press the button under

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,880
the desk that activates the chip in your brain that drains your energy and sends it straight to Exxon.

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,880
I started, ten minutes was too long for me you know I got shit to do I had to go to

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,680
Peruzzo's get a chopped cheese so I started burrowing through the wall with a

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,600
spoon and I successfully escaped. They can't hold me back they can't put me

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,400
They're trying to institutionalize me. No. You climbed out through the sewage system

100
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
and they were just like, "Yeah, I don't know. We're just going to let them do it."

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,640
Yeah, I killed two security guards and they're just like, "You don't have to stay for the 10

102
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,000
minutes." I saw the most evil nurse when I was getting vaccinated. I just forgot about this

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,080
until just now. You know how some people bleed when they get shots? There was one, a nurse gave

104
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,040
a shot to one like like older lady and she like on her arm like rolled up her long

105
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,040
sleeve gave the shot the lady started bleeding like the lady who was getting

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
the shot didn't notice the nurse definitely did because she was giving

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,120
the shot yeah and then the nurse just rolled her sleeve oh my god she ruined

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,400
her damn shirt what the hell it wasn't like a light-colored shirt I don't

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,840
remember what color it was cuz I'm not a freak think of this shirt man maybe

110
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Maybe she was a blind nurse.

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,800
It's just so funny to just be like, "Yeah, I'm not going to wipe that up.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Fuck you, dude."

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's not my blood.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah.

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Yeah.

116
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,460
Not my blood, not my job.

117
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,800
If I get my blood on you, I might think about cleaning it up.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
But no.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I wouldn't sleep down on that, too.

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm not going to sleep down on that for somebody else.

121
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
That's marking my territory.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
That's true, yeah.

123
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Yeah.

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Piss and blood.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Vampire style.

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,200
If I was a nurse, dude, I'd be fucking, I'd be throwing all sorts of shit on people.

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,800
I'd say, "Don't you ever forget who gave you this shot.

128
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,380
you'll always remember you'll have some little piece of me and you. I gave the shot and then

129
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,280
like I pull out a tattoo gun. I draw a circle around the shot. Yeah you have to be like

130
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,480
like if you want to be known as like the best nurse in the world you have to have a signature

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,640
move. Oh that'd be a great liberal tattoo. Just like a circle around where you got your

132
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,960
shot and then like vaccinated on it. I put an air bubble in every single vaccine. Make

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,680
sure you know that I gave it to you. My signature nurse move is that is that if the patient is

134
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,600
rude to me before they get the vaccine I just squirt it all in their eyes. I think

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,280
it gets I think it can get through that. Yeah it'll probably better hope it works

136
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,840
ten times better because it goes to your brain mm-hmm yeah it goes through your

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,480
through your eyes to your brain. Take the Moderna to the dome. Moderna straight to the face.

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,760
Did you get Moderna or Pfizer? I did Moderna. Oh me too. Dude I got Pfizer.

139
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,400
really you know we're gonna see what happens see who the last man standing

140
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,480
yeah let's check it out first gonna have to give Patrick the AstraZeneca no I

141
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,720

143
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,280
and now they're now they're locked it up is your face are you like getting like

144
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Am I doing this?

145
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Yeah, I've had like-

146
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
You're getting Bell's Palsy?

147
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
What?

148
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,720
I've had pains in my lip, like my face, it'll kind of get like stuck like this.

149
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
No, I'm fucking fine dude.

150
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,160
But I don't know if it's because my wisdom tooth hurts or like I've been freaking out.

151
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,280
Dude, Patrick being the one non-hoax person to get Bell's Palsy from the vaccine.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Right.

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,760
Yeah, no, you're not a, you should never be stuck with anything.

154
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
You have Munchausen's.

155
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I know.

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
It's a bad idea.

157
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,080
Dude, I fucking, I don't have Munchausen's.

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,680
do no it's the I will say the 30-minute wait time for also someone who's like

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,600
gets freaked out about medicine and shit cuz I'm allergic to a bunch of

160
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,440
medicines like that shit is scary cuz you just sit there and it's like okay

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,200
you need to sit here for 30 minutes and do nothing but think about how you might

162
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,000
not be able to breathe yeah also the whole time you're sitting there like I

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,480
can't give me like a Domino's pizza tracker to look at well I just know I

164
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,200
I just, even if you don't give me a pizza, I just want to look forward to something, you

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
know?

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Give me a timeline.

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Yeah.

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Otherwise I'm just...

169
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,280
They don't give you a fucking cookie or anything, like when they take blood.

170
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,400
Nah, dude, I'm just sitting there, just like every fucking weird tingle I have, which I

171
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,000
have all the time, I'm just sitting there like, maybe that's the tingle that kills me.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,920
I don't care about being immune, I just want a treat, right?

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,040
Yeah, and also, give me a, can I get a cherry or something?

174
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Give me a burrito taco.

175
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Can I get a, yeah.

176
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,760
Let me sit in there with the burrito taco and the consomme.

177
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Can I get some chorizo over here?

178
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Come on.

179
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,200
We have to have like a lady frying empanadas in this waiting room.

180
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
That would be sick, dude.

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Oh my god.

182
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
That's what I'm saying.

183
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,920
I had to go, I had to manually leave the place and go get myself a Whopper.

184
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm on a Whopper a day diet the past four days.

185
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,320
It's been treating me really, really bad.

186
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,200
I had burrito tacos for the first time last night.

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,960
Nice, is that what you're talking about them right now?

188
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, yeah, because I wanted to bring them up.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,120
I had an allergy scare like a couple months ago.

190
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,280
About burrito tacos?

191
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
I got a I went to the same place got a brie a quesadilla.

192
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
You called the doctor and said I think I'm allergic to tacos.

193
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,280
No I I ate a quesadilla.

194
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
That's very sad.

195
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,280
I ate half a quesadilla and then I realized the whole thing was full of avocado and I

196
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,280
had to run to the corner store and get Claritin.

197
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,280
I feel like you're not allergic to avocado you're allergic to things that are green or

198
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
something.

199
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
No because avocados are.

200
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
That sounds like.

201
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Would Claritin even help if you like.

202
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah it's an antihistamine.

203
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,560
Is that, I don't know how that stuff works.

204
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Is that, is that?

205
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,000
- Yeah, I have like a-- - It probably wouldn't work

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
if you were like--

207
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
- I have like a pollen allergy that's really bad.

208
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
- Hey, me too, brother.

209
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,600
- You got a pollen allergy?

210
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
- It's been fucking me over.

211
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,680
It gave me a sinus infection

212
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,920
'cause it's super pollen-y here, yeah.

213
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,840
- Yeah, it sucks, oh man, I'm not--

214
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,800
- Dude, it fucking snowed today, too.

215
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,640
- What?

216
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,980
- Yeah, there's snow on the ground right now.

217
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,280
- Damn, you should have told us that first.

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
- We would have come up, we would have made the trip.

219
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,920
- Yeah, but dude, I have a sledding gear.

220
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
I'm not gonna let you guys talk about your stuff.

221
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
No, fuck that.

222
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
No, no, what are you talking-

223
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Snow?

224
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
You seriously didn't clue us in on the snow?

225
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,920
We could have come and made snow angels with you, you fucking idiot.

226
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Yeah, no, Caleb probably doesn't want to make a snowman.

227
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Yeah, no, he only hasn't made one since November.

228
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Yeah, oh, oh, Patrick and Caleb don't want to have a snowball fight with me.

229
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
They want to talk about their stupid vaccine shit.

230
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Come on, get your head right.

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Get your brain right.

232
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
You fucking bitch.

233
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Do you even know us?

234
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
We're like the snow twins.

235
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah, we're like two snow-mizers.

236
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
We're like the snow-mizer and snow-mizer.

237
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
We're basically the ice brothers.

238
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
And you're just fucking not letting us know about the...

239
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
We're the snow climbers.

240
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
If you knew a fish...

241
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
You guys are right, you don't just talk about stuff in a row for five minutes

242
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
with me being silent.

243
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
That totally doesn't happen.

244
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,920
If you knew a fish and you saw the ocean, would you not tell him about it?

245
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I mean, come on, dude.

246
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,520
Joking fish didn't know where the ocean was it probably Cameron get it a glass of water

247
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,200
It wouldn't even tell him about the I'm better. I would not even do look at the fish

248
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,780
Thank you. My dookie. It's gonna get dookie

249
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,200
Hey, you're gonna slip on the snow you've never

250
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,480
Randomly I have this dookie sandwich. Do you are normal sandwich? Do you want a bite of this?

251
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,080
ice cream sandwich don't pay attention to what the two pieces of bread are made

252
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:50,000
out of yeah it's chocolate bread bread chocolate bread yeah I think it's a

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,040
good else would you call that that's a biscuit it's a biscuit if you're if

254
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,960

255
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,840
yeah sorry what what what is a cookie other than fucking chocolate bread it's

256
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,200
- It's got, what do you mean, a cookie doesn't have yeast in it.

257
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,240
It's got shortening in it, it's not bread at all.

258
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,320
- You're making them different than I make them.

259
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,480
- You put yeast in your cookies?

260
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,840
- I make a whole cookie loaf.

261
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,640
- Make a sourdough cookie, what the fuck?

262
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,880
- Sourdough cookie loaf.

263
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,080
- That actually sounds so good.

264
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,280
Oh my God, that sounds incredible.

265
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,520
- If you're a fan of the show, you listen to this,

266
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,840
and you're a baker, make that shit right now.

267
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
- Yeah.

268
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,080
- And mail it to us.

269
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,960
Mail it to me and Caleb, not Cameron,

270
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,000
And mail it ice cold, because that's our thing, we're the ice twins.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Yeah, now we have to stick by it because Cameron Trey is.

272
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,800
It's interesting that you guys call yourselves the ice twins, you didn't even know it was snowing.

273
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,200
I mean, I feel like if you're that into snow, you maybe would like check the weather, or like know where the snow is.

274
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah, maybe we're the ice mom and dad, but we're just the little ice kids, and we just fuckin', you know, we go where the ice, where people tell us.

275
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I'm gonna put you in the closet.

276
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,200
You stand in there, I'm gonna fill it with black smoke.

277
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,760
That's like the opposite of snow.

278
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,560
All right, so basically I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you so you can't.

279
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,480
Here's how it's gonna go down. I'm gonna slash you.

280
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,400
You would want. I'm gonna say one two slash and I'm gonna

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,920
slash you in the face. Where are you gonna get all that black smoke

282
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,520
from, huh? I'm gonna play fruit ninja with you.

283
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,400
I'm gonna burn your toys. I'm slashing a fruit right now.

284
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
What? I'm slashing Cameron.

285
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,680
Shit. I'm going fruit ninja.

286
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,200
No. Oh my god, dude.

287
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,120
That's right. Come on.

288
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,760
That's such a fun like. That's such a fun app.

289
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,600
(laughing)

290
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
- Yeah, such a fun app.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,200
You know, like when your dad calling someone gay

292
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,240
and he says, "Oh yeah, that guy's a fruit."

293
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,640
- Yeah.

294
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,600
- It's fun.

295
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,840
- Yeah, that is fun.

296
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,440
- 'Cause like, you think about it,

297
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,280
you think about like the Fruit of the Loom commercials.

298
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
- Yeah, "Hey Patrick, I might be a fruit,

299
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,360
"but I'm gonna turn you into a vegetable, pal."

300
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,400
You go, "Here, I'm gonna fill your lungs with sweet ham."

301
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
- That's pretty cool, that's like some alchemy shit.

302
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,200
Turning a fruit into a vegetable.

303
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,520
- Cameron's the alchemist.

304
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
- Wow, that's incredible.

305
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,240
- Full metal.

306
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,720
I love you, you're the full mental alchemist.

307
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,160
- I'm gonna give you my meat and turn you into a vegetable.

308
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,740
- Wow.

309
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,920
- I mean, that's a masterclass.

310
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,960
- You're not gonna be able to use your legs.

311
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,040
- Yeah, that's right.

312
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
- Pretty good.

313
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,780
- That's pretty good.

314
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,000
- Yeah, and basically I'm gonna slash you.

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,640
- Okay, all right.

316
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,520
Do you guys even care that the day this comes out

317
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,720
is my birthday?

318
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,600
- Oh shit.

319
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,400
- Oh no!

320
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,360
- And guess who's sitting there, no present.

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,160
I didn't see a single present when I logged onto the call.

322
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,320
- I have a present right here.

323
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,960
- Really, what is it?

324
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,800
You're just gonna grab something from your room.

325
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,160
- No, I have a present for you.

326
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
- You're both just grabbing things.

327
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,360
- No, no, this is literally right next to my computer.

328
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,760
Would I have it here if it wasn't a present for you?

329
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,280
- It's gonna be a mouse.

330
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,080
It's gonna be your computer mouse.

331
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
- Can I show it to you or are you gonna, do you want it?

332
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400

I rest easier knowing Geek Squad has my back.

365
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,220
And this is Caleb PNY.

366
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,620
- I mean, Geek Squad does have my back, dude.

367
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,500
That's just what it is.

368
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,660
Any time I need, you know, three or four guys in the house,

369
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,640
call 'em over. - It's true.

371
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,740
Geek Squad, on the way.

372
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,620
- I rest easier.

373
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,900
Do you really rest easier?

374
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900

375
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,020
I rest on the couch and they sit in my bedroom and fuck my wife.

376
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,980
Whole Geek Squad.

377
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,540
They run a Geek Train on her.

378
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
It's very sweet.

379
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
And you've never used Geek Squad, right?

380
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,060
Yeah, they run a steam-powered train on my wife.

381
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,980
Dude, I have never used Geek Squad.

382
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,900
I think that I left that review on the Best Buy app once because I made a purchase and

383
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,460
they wanted to, they just like asked for a review.

384
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,980
and I was like yeah sure dude Geek Squad, the rest easier with Geek Squad.

385
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,540
Where is that review featured? I'm guessing it's a Best Buy newsletter or

386
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,300
something that they send out maybe a coupon code but basically from now I'm

387
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,900
gonna you know hopefully be able to do some stand-up touring later this year and

389
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,220
the best from the best buy newsletter where he said Geek Squad has his back. I

390
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,980
just googled in quotes I rest easier knowing Geek Squad has my back and it's

391
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:57,860

403
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,540

Yeah oh I knew I called the wrong EECS squad. Hey do you want to hear a quote too?

411
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,100
That's what they say. Here's a quote from Caleb P. In New York City. He says we have his

I've only done it like a few times in my life. It's so strange.

419
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,620
I've never ever done it.

420
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,060
I'm trying to do it.

421
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,660
Stop!

422
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,540
You do that won't-

423
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,740
You're gonna accidentally turn into a werewolf if you keep doing that.

424
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,340
Your face is gonna get stuck like that.

425
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,140
You're gonna scare people on the street.

426
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
Stop trying to gleek, dude.

427
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,820
It's an unlearnable skill.

428
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,940
You're born with it.

429
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,140
It's like an opposable thumb.

430
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,500
Stop.

431
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,780
Stop trying to gleek, dude.

432
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,700

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,320
closest friends we would just really be sitting on the couch watching a movie

443
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,300
was like well that's like I thought it was like work you know I thought it was

444
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:59,280
like a third thing that was like a new liquid that only if you're watching TV

445
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,040
with your friend and he's turning spat on to your body you can't do that I'm gonna

446
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,640
start doing that on the street yeah start to spit people to disrespect them

447
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,240
no it's just a joke oh I'm gonna do it to ultimately disrespect people that's got

448
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,760
to be what's what's more disrespectful once I'm fully vexed mm-hmm yeah I'm

449
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,800
gleeking on anybody just putting a fucking bump stock on your tongue just

450
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
automatic gleek.

451
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
Yeah.

452
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,880
Just constantly, just rapid fire gleeking on people.

453
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Like a fucking...

454
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,040
That'd be so sick if you could do a rapid fire.

455
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,520
Yeah, dude, that'd be sick.

456
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,080
Just fill up a glass of water in five seconds.

457
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,360
Just the human sprinkler.

458
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,640
Oh, man.

459
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Just all over somebody.

460
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
That'd be so cool.

461
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
Yeah, just drenched in gleek goo.

462
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm just gonna google "fastest gleeker."

463
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
There has to be a fucking guy who's hitting targets.

464
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Well, you gotta be careful with that, 'cause then it could be like glee fans.

465
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,280
The top result for that is a YouTube video from Screen Rant called "Crisis on Infinite

466
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,060
Earths - Who is Gleek and How He'll Change the Arrowverse?"

467
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Gleek is meek.

468
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Nah.

469
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,060
I still can't do it.

470
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,620
"Farthest Distance Gleek'd - World Record."

471
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,220
The world record for farthest distance gleek'd is held by a man named Callum Blades.

472
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,660
There's no way.

473
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,820
There's no way his name is Callum Blades.

474
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,100
Callum Blades gleaked 145 centimeters.

475
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,380
That guy is a fucking Wu-Tang-Nan generator.

476
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,100
They have a video for it right here.

477
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,820
Gleaking a hundred meters you said?

478
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Centimeter, 145 centimeters.

479
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,820
Oh, okay.

480
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,820
I was like, "A hundred meters?!"

481
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,420
Gleak an entire football field?

482
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
That'd be crazy.

483
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,540
You'd gleak a hole in someone's fucking head with that, dude.

484
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,820
Yeah, your gleek can shoot that far?

485
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,580
That's a damn, you got some velocity.

486
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,580
He definitely cheated in this video.

487
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Yeah?

488
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,920
leans forward over the table like okay yeah that's that's a nice view in my

489
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:04,920
eyes yeah he's done for the comments on this are so good

490
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,680
Reginald 213 centimeters Reginald I gleeked seven feet Jamal that's nothing

491
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,260
12 feet way easily I could gleek but it also when you say gleeks are they

492
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,300
starting from like you know because the Gleek has to fall and so in that in that

493
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,540
falling action is it just like like it depends on how tall you are I feel like

494
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:33,900
there's a lot of factors here yeah you know I don't know I think we maybe need

495
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,620
to get involved in the Gleeks here. Tiara Baker, I can Gleek between one and two feet

496
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,620
just figures out how to do this today like an hour ago lol I can do over 20 per

497
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,540
minute which the Guinness World Record holder does 28 per minute I'm very good

498
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,700
and I just learned I can do it so I can only get better every day 20 times a

499
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
minute dude that's once every day any seconds

500
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,900
damn shooting two feet and she's in there training like Rocky for that

501
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,540
fucking hit 20 I learned to do it an hour ago it might be a gleeking savant

502
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:10,300
learning to do it to Gleek and just instantly doing 20 a minute yeah I got

503
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,260
well there is it got to be a guy who's never done it could be Patrick who's

504
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,180
just never done it on purpose and might be the best ever at it.

505
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
It could be.

506
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,100
I think maybe this is my true calling is to train as a Gleeker.

507
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,420
You should put that in your bio, dude.

508
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Gleek.

509
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Yeah.

510
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm a total Gleek.

511
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Yeah.

512
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,020
That'll be really good for you, I think.

513
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,740
You think maybe people will misinterpret that?

514
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
No.

515
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
No.

516
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
They might think you're Greek.

517
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
For something else.

518
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,220
How would they think I'm Greek?

519
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,260
- Who would think I was Greek?

520
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,860
- A guy who mixes up his L's and his R's.

521
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,340
- Who would do that?

522
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,060
- Just a guy with a speech impediment or something like that.

523
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,300
He might think that you're Greek.

524
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,120
- Okay.

525
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,220
- Yeah, he might read that and say, yeah, he's Greek.

526
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,660
- I think maybe we leave that there.

527
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,100
- Or he has a reading impediment, maybe.

528
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,780
Yeah, maybe we don't touch that from now on.

529
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,060
You know, that's fine.

530
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,020
Some things you don't have to explore every single,

531
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,640
I know that we're known as people who just,

532
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,480
you know, we keep digging.

533
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,900
- We're explorers of the mind.

534
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,940
investigators of the English language but sometimes you just you know you just

535
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,580
gotta leave it be. See something and say huh you know what?

536
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,180
Let a sleepy dog lie. Exactly you know and also it's about it's about what you don't say you

537
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,660
know that's the most way you don't show too you know I'm kind of like a movie

538
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,300
director the way I do this shit. It's all symbolism and exactly

539
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,660
shutter speed you know just like the movies yeah it's mostly shutter speed

540
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,660
It's about syncing it up.

541
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,660
I'm blinking 24 frames a second.

542
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
I'm sitting here.

543
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
Yeah, you guys don't know what it looks like.

544
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,660
You know what it sounds like, what it hears like to record a podcast.

545
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
You don't know what it looks like, dude.

546
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
It's not pretty.

547
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
I'm doing this to make it look good.

548
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Even if you do know what it looks like, you don't know what it is like.

549
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,660
True.

550
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,660
A lot of people don't understand our struggle.

551
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
You don't know what it feels like.

552
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
You know, I've had my heart broken.

553
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
When I was 14, I had my heart broken by a woman named Madison.

554
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
She was a year and a half older than me.

555
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,580
me. A lot of people don't know that about me. A lot of people don't know I have a sensitive thumb.

556
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,100
Yeah.

557
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,780
So there's a lot of different struggles.

558
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,020
I was too scared to jump off the play structure at the playground when I was in third grade.

559
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,900
Yeah, man. I mean, that's another--

560
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,820
I mean, stuff like that just happens.

561
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah. I mean, you know--

562
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,100
People don't know.

563
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,180
My brother got-- he got arrested once for shoplifting.

564
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,060
Yeah.

565
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,620
Yeah.

566
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
That's like serious--

567
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
He was like maybe this close to going to jail

568
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,900
for the rest of his life,

569
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,180
'cause that's just what it's like down there.

570
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,380
They haven't decriminalized shoplifting yet in North Carolina.

571
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,820
- Yeah, no, but once they do,

572
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,500
once they decriminalize shoplifting down there--

573
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,260
- Oh my God.

574
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,660
- The economy is gonna be amazing.

575
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,460
- Listen, I'll do it if it's legal,

576
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,780
it's as simple as that.

577
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,980
That's why I love Kratom and what's the other one?

578
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,380
- PC, no, K2.

579
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,940
- K2, love K, is K2 legal?

580
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,500
- K2 shouldn't be legal.

581
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,840
- I think in Arizona,

582
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,240
They sell it in these little pouches and say that it's like smelling salts or something.

583
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Yeah.

584
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,840
But yeah, no, that shit will...

585
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
I've talked about my K2 experience.

586
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Yeah, we've talked about K2 many times.

587
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Pat used to be a girl.

588
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Yeah.

589
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,400
I smoked K2 spice.

590
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
And now he's a genie.

591
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Mm-hmm.

592
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Yep.

593
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
That's what it does to you.

594
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Uh-huh.

595
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
You become a...

596
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
You become a blue genie.

597
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Yeah.

598
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
Yep.

599
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,040
Become a big blue genie and you're walking around.

600
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,440
smoking a k2 joint it you think you're inhaling it this motherfucker is

601
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,360
inhaling you you get sucked in put through a genie filtration system which

602
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,000
is part of what k2 is that's yeah that's how genies get in you go you know you

603
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,280
emerge out of the smoke on the other side you fucking blue you don't have

604
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,720
legs no tail where's my penis has gone yeah you got a big tail if you're a genie

605
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,200
that's the only and between mm-hmm including the pony you know do you guys

606
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,100
know why they call it K2? Why? Because you take two of it and you're not gonna be

607
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,220
okay. That's right. That's how the scientists named it. They should call it W3, three wishes.

608
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,720
Yeah they should call it W2. You become a complete genie kind of guy after that you

609
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,400
know? Yeah. It'll turn your ass to a genie in you know five minutes flat. Usually

610
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,320
that takes, I mean back in the day that would take years to become a genie.

611
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,820
- I smoked K2 out of a hookah.

612
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,800
- That's gotta be the most genie shit I've ever heard.

613
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,400
- And I got trapped in the hookah.

614
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,560
And now all my wishes are just getting guys Lamborghinis.

615
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,680
- What would your three wishes be?

616
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,520
- My three wishes?

617
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,920
- Yeah.

618
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,480
- One wish for, I wish that Cameron gets one wish,

619
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
I wish that Caleb gets one wish,

620
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,520
and I wish for world peace.

621
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,300
- Wow, I wish for world war.

622
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,220
- No.

623
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,920
- Yeah, that's the thing, do they cancel each other out?

624
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,180
- I wish, yeah. - It's about the order.

625
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,500
- Oh yeah, but if you, so if you--

626
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,040
- Well I gave you and Cameron one of my wishes

627
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,300
and Cameron wished for world war,

628
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,540
so what are you gonna wish for?

629
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,620
- Well they cancel each other out,

630
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,460
so I'll wish for world war as well.

631
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,580
And then it'll, you know, two negatives make a zero.

632
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,620
- Positive, exactly, if we wish for world war twice,

633
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,980
we're gonna get world peace.

634
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,060
- Exactly, yeah, 'cause if I wish for world peace,

635
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,940
it'll just, it'll bounce back to zero.

636
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,100
- The genie will twist it and do something nasty.

637
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,340
- Yeah, and that's not gonna work.

638
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,220
- Yeah, 'cause if I wish for world peace, maybe, okay.

639
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,820
- Maybe he's like, okay, well then there's nobody left.

640
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,860
- We can only achieve world peace through world war,

641
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,220
and then you guys wish for world war,

642
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,860
and then he's like, well shit, now I have to,

643
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,100
if we have a big war, there's gonna be world,

644
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,340
we're making a paradox for the genie.

645
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,540
- Here's the other thing, though.

646
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,860
- We're only making these wishes

647
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,500
to make the genie kill himself.

648
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
You only need one wish that's like not for you.

649
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,540
The other two can be whatever you want.

650
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,980
You can wish for world peace and then

651
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,300
Mario and Luigi to be real.

652
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,140
- Exactly, nobody's gonna blame you if you do that.

653
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,340
- Immediately, yeah.

654
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,160
I mean, everybody's gonna be like,

655
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,660
"All right, well, he did world peace."

656
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,700
You know what I mean?

657
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,500
I mean, I just thank Christ every day

658
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,340
that a genie's never gotten into the wrong hands.

659
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,980
- Oh my God, could you imagine?

660
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,820
- That we know of, at least.

661
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,700
- Maybe a genie did get into the wrong hands

662
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:27,740
four years ago on November in November I don't remember the day but 2015. Maybe Donald Trump

663
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,780
was a genie himself. True. Have you ever seen his feet? Think about it he's orange.

664
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:38,940
He's orange which is a kind of a yeah what color okay all right when Jafar became a genie.

665
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,780
Was he orange? I think yeah. Yeah I think so. Damn. I don't was he orange? I don't think he was orange.

666
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:51,780
But also the genie can become and show itself in various different forms.

667
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,380
Because it's the blue genie and the red genie.

668
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,780
I'd like to make a point here that Patrick does have an orange topper for his microphone.

669
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,780
Just saying it could be a genie in disguise, you never know.

670
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Alright, well now that you know.

671
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,780
Oh my god.

672
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I have to grant, you rubbed me the wrong way, now I gotta grant you a wish.

673
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:20,760
I get a wish from you? Uh-huh. Okay. World evil. Oh I hate having to grant these

674
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:29,440
wishes. World domination. Biggest skateboard ever. Whoa alright this is one

675
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,180
I can get behind. Princess Peach. Alright you got half naked. That's four wishes so far.

676
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,520
This is too many wishes. Unlimited pot to smoke. I can't even do that.

677
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,480
there's a catch to all your wishes I heard you realize. Burger King in my house and a $50

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,800
King restaurant in this house it's gonna be the king himself and he's gonna be

(laughing)

684
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
- Nymph?

685
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,600
- You devilish dominatrix.

686
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,160
(laughing)

687
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,440
- I have sex now?

688
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,640
- You stinky imp.

689
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,480
- Nymph?

690
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,300
(laughing)

691
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,520
- Yeah, did you mean imp and then you said nymph?

692
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,680
- I said what I said, genie.

693
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Now do your job, you're my slave.

694
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,520
- I'm not a, genies aren't slaves, they're genies.

695
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,920
- Oh, sorry, are you gonna say no to my wish?

696
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,760
- You can, there is a rule--

697
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,580
- Okay, slave.

698
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,880
- Come on now.

699
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
- Okay, slave.

700
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,920
- Oh, come on.

701
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,800
That's gonna be the new cool thing that the kids say.

702
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,040
Okay, slave.

703
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,700
They'll start saying that now, yeah.

704
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm kinda changing the discourse and the vernacular.

705
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,160
- That's the new okay boomer.

706
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,440
- Yeah, it's okay, slave.

707
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,800
And our grandparents will be like, what does this mean?

708
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
We'll say, okay, slave.

709
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

710
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,260
- All right, slave.

711
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,760
- Okay, genie.

712
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Man, I went to the M&M store yesterday.

713
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,120
- Speak about genies, dude.

714
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,040
That's, I mean.

715
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,400
- Oh man. - That's all M&M's.

716
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,880
- Talking about genies.

717
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,720
- Yeah, what the fuck?

718
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,200
- That place is every wish I've ever thought of.

719
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,400
(laughing)

720
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,680
- Yeah, that'd be my one wish.

721
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
M&M world, yeah, I wanna live there.

722
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,200
Make it a real planet.

723
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,880
- Oh man, I didn't get any M&M's, I just went in there.

724
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,920
I didn't even fuckin' buy M&M's.

725
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,340
- Did you do the scan to see which M&M you were?

726
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,520
- No.

727
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,680
- I was a red M&M. - Why did you go?

728
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
- I got off the train and--

729
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,320
- You didn't get any M&M's, you didn't do the scan.

730
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,440
- No, I was going somewhere else.

731
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,920
I was going to buy a DVD.

732
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,720
I'll say it, that's a pedophile move.

733
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Absolutely.

734
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,140
Just walking around M&M world not even scanning yourself, just fucking looking at shit.

735
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,400
I just wanted to see the M&Ms, how is that a pedophile move?

736
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Is that what you call them?

737
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
What?

738
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
The children?

739
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
There weren't any kids there.

740
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Yeah, mothers and mothers' childs.

741
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It was like just me in there.

742
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Really?

743
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Yeah.

744
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Is that why you left without doing anything?

745
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Fuck you.

746
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
No, I wish I did.

747
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
I wish I did.

748
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
I wish I did.

749
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
I wish I did.

750
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
I wish I did.

751
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
I wish I did.

752
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I wish I did.

753
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
I wish I did.

754
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,560
I wish I did do the scan. I wanted to find out, you know, cause I know I'm the...

755
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,800
You could have done it. Why didn't you?

756
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
I was busy.

757
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,080
It's not like there was a line.

758
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,800
I was busy. I got off the train, I saw the M&M store and I was like, "Ah, well, fuck

759
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
it. I guess I'll go."

760
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,400
You just ate in Times Square for some reason?

761
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
It's funny to imagine...

762
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,600
Yeah, I went to Book Off. I went to that big DVD store.

763
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,840
Whatever cashier saw you in there just being like, "Damn, that guy's probably gonna kill

764
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,400
himself. He came in here alone. He didn't even do the scan."

765
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,080
yeah that was just like a young guy thinking he's doing something funny but

766
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,840
he didn't even do the scan part that's like the only reason to come and he did

767
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,680
the M&Ms I already know I'm the orange M&M you're literally the

768
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,360
green M&M we've talked about it no I'm not the green M&M we've actually spoken

769
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,400
on this I'm not you got scanned at the Lego store and it said you were the

770
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,320

771
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,000
the footage you don't which I wasn't Caleb like you have a unicorn or

772
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,880

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:23,440
Show me your hand. Show me your hand right now. Fuck. That might... I never noticed that,

777
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,080
but you do have... they're kind of perfectly positioned for something circular.

778
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,080
Oh, guys.

779
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
What?

780
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,920
I just found a website where you can order custom printed M&Ms.

781
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
You can print M&Ms onto them.

782
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Is it M&Ms.com?

783
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,640
No, it's an insecure website. It's somebody's... it looks like it's somebody's Geocities or

784
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
something.

785
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,520
- They have that at the M&M store as well.

786
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,280
You can go get a special M&M made.

787
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,040
- All right, I'm gonna take a quiz right now

788
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,320
to see which M&M I am.

789
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,160
- Okay.

790
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,720
- All right, just 'cause I didn't do it.

791
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,520
I'm doing it remote, I'm doing it from home.

792
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,360
- It won't count.

793
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,680
I mean, it can't get your energy.

794
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
You didn't get scanned, dog.

795
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,080
- Are you telling me brainfall.com is not

796
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,920
an accredited M&M website? - Dude, the only thing

797
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,360
that can do it is the machine at the M&M store.

798
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,200
- Okay.

799
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,540
- Or you can go to a M&M testing site,

800
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,320
which is usually like a closed high school or something.

801
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,720
You go in, there's a proctor, you take a test.

802
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,560
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

803
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,200
- But an online test is not gonna give you accurate results

804
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,020
as far as M&Ms are going.

805
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,080
- I'm on the M&Ms website right now,

806
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,600
and I'm on the characters page,

807
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,740
and I'm looking at the descriptions of the characters.

808
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,600
They have a turn-ons section for the M&Ms?

809
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,200
- Dude, have you seen some of the M&Ms they're making now?

810
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,560
- The red M&Ms turn-on is when people

811
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,400
blindly follow his advice.

812
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,620
- Dude, the red M&M is a fucking,

813
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,820
So your fire alarm

814
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,820
all right we'll pause for a second

815
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,860
did it cause a lot of anything to do for christmas

816
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,420
the other read in the end of this guy this guy's a focus of later

817
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,500
i don't know i don't wanna go back to this website but i do want to go back to

818
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,860
the subject of fruit

819
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,700
God is trying to shut shut this down right now

820
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:31,440
You are Kenny's just setting his pubes on fire

821
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,740
He's just putting the same slice of bread back in the toaster over and over and over

822
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:48,680
There's a chart on this website for the wrong way versus the right way to choose a message to put on your M&M

823
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,940
And here's the first example, okay

824
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:58,620
The so no product names trademarks copyrights or business names, right? Here's the wrong way to put the wrong way to do it. Oh

825
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,740
American fan company don't put that on your M&M

826
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,260
American fan company that's right you cannot put that on your Eminem the right way for this example

827
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,520
Like it has like it's like a whole list of them

828
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,240
And like it one is wrong when it's right the right way instead of putting American fan company think about putting time to be cool

829
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:26,500
Do you think that lets you put like diarrhea or like like a poison symbol on it or something yeah, that'd be fun

830
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,200
Yeah, it's a biohazard. It's you know like like people like their faces put on like the M&Ms

831
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,360
I would get a stevo M&M. Yeah like the thumb like the tattoo. Yeah I would get the stevo

832
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,880
back tat on an M&M. One side is yours to customize. You get two lines, eight letters per line.

833
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,200
The other side will have the famous M. Could we do podcasts about list M&Ms? I would like

834
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,600
to. Maybe we give those out at the live show dude. That'd be a good idea. Yeah. Some sweet

835
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,280
treaties. Oh speaking of the live show, it's mostly sold out. Thank you. Oh yeah. I think

836
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
There's like two or three.

837
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,360
There's a few bigger tables left for the late show.

838
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,360
But I also wanted to throw it there is if you got a ticket and you're not going with

839
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,280
anybody the minimum it's like the smallest ticket is like a two person table because

840
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,000
of COVID you can't like sit with people you don't know like you can't just buy one ticket

841
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,440
so if you bought a two person ticket you don't have anyone to go with you should go in the

842
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,960
discord and see if anyone wants to pay you to sit with a stranger.

843
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,480
Or you can just grab some freak off the street.

844
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
You could do that too that might be even more fun.

845
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,480
Get some fucked up fucking freak.

846
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
Get the biggest freak you can find.

847
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,080
And we're talking biggest. We want the biggest, sickest guy. This guy in my

848
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,840
neighborhood. We want the room to be like the most full by volume. Yeah, get one of those homeless guys

Did the fans...

865
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,900
I don't know if the fans realize that we're...

866
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,340
This is going to be very sad.

867
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,540
It's going to be a sad show.

868
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,340
It's going to be a sad show.

869
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,860
This is going to be a one three...

870
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,820
One three-man show.

871
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,060
Yeah, we're doing that play Fences.

00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,420
We'll switch it out.

877
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,860
Because I'm like the coolest one.

878
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,980
Can I be the mailman?

879
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm the fence.

880
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,740
You can't be.

881
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,180
There's not an actual fence.

882
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,560
Well, we can take some artistic liberties. Yeah, I mean that's what part of what's

883
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,580
so interesting about doing it and now that's a good point. Update it for modern

884
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:06,580
times. Yeah, you're right. I'll do the ring doorbell. Okay, alright. That'll be

885
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:14,060
actually pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Man, imagine, okay, okay, movie idea. All right.

886
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:21,740
so it's like a ring doorbell okay that's your friend mm-hmm a living sentient

887
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,900
ring doorbell one that it talks to you about your neighbors and stuff okay

888
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:31,900
okay like yeah yeah yeah it's like oh I saw I saw Loretta walking by the door

889
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,340

890
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:42,300
that mailman sheesh yeah does he know how to put a package down and there's no

891
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,100
plot it's just people going up to the door and you get to hear what the doorbell

892
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:54,860
says about them yeah you you ain't coming in here he's kind of mean you know you're

895
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,020

896
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:21,700
doorbell yes dude Wow yes all right fuck yeah I think I think we've got something

897
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,380
to pitch if anybody wants to hop in on this maybe who would voice - who would

898
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,980
voice the ring doorbell I do all the voices no I don't think I get like a big

899
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,740
I think it's a nice wall for the movie we get a big name and then for the TV

900
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,620
show we get some fucker no one care can I be the fucker maybe there's a character

901
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:49,460

902
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,340
you know what and we could do a horror spinoff where the doorbell sees the

903
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:00,700
chupacabra yeah oh my god oh no it's a bacabra he can do that yeah he's got a

904
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,740
bunch of different he's got a bunch of different accents and voices yeah the

905
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,740
He's a fucking computer.

906
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,360
The thing that people need to understand is that's how that word is pronounced.

907
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,360
If you say it differently, you're mispronouncing it.

908
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,320
Yeah, you can't call it, you have to say...

909
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,640
It's not the chupacabra, it's el chupacabra.

910
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,640
El chupacabra.

911
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
El chupacabra.

912
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,520
Every single time.

913
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,880
Very soft on every single consonant.

914
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
Except for the B.

915
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
El chupacabra.

916
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,440
It's just, it's how the word was meant to be pronounced.

917
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah, sorry I speak Spanish.

918
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,840
Yeah, I'm on fucking day six of Duolingo.

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,360
going on with you do you need me to call somebody are you okay

925
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,200

926
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,200
restaurant and you're just like "eh weeeew"

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
"Gina have a m-a-a-a-bah-a-bless"

928
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
"eh weeeew"

929
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,200
"Can I get a e-taco but can I get no sour cream on it please?"

930
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,200
"Grillers cargados"

931
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
"Can I get a mexican pizza?"

932
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:24,200
Or you go "Mexican" and then you go "e-pizza"

933
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,200
You are, you may be the greatest guy we've ever had in this Taco Bell

934
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,560
Thank you so much for your service and you do have to leave still

935
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,920
Listen your penis is out

936
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,720
As spot-on as this gets

937
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,680
Every single time you order you cannot open carry in a Taco Bell. You do have to leave

938
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,380
We do require I mean no shirt. No shoes. We do still require pants. Yep

939
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah, and you have a loaded gun next to your penis

940
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,500
You're pointing a loaded gun at your penis and you're and you're I mean

941
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,880
I'm closing my eyes because I don't want to look at your penis, but those voices that you're doing are amazing

942
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,720
Yeah, anyway, anyway, I get this card. This is my boy walk there

943
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,880
This is my friend Frank Caliendo

944
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,000
He's gonna love

945
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:19,820
Frank Caliendo, you know that guy when he's in a Mexican restaurant. He fucking crushes it dude. Oh, man

946
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,920
Yeah, the key is he just thinks Carlos Mencia and he gets it done because he can't speak

947
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,400
the languages but he can do impressions just about spot on.

948
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,480
He can speak any language in the world by just doing different impressions.

949
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
It's true.

950
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
You know?

951
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,320
Because I mean impressions are the language of the soul.

952
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
That's right.

953
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,080
That's so right.

954
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
Yeah.

955
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,080
Yeah.

956
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
The language of the soul.

957
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,600
And this guy, I mean this guy's got to be a - he's quite the polyglot in that sense.

958
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Yeah.

959
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Yeah.

960
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,560
go to restaurants I make sure to use the correct accent whenever I ask for the

961
00:47:51,560 --> 00:48:05,160
bathroom code I say may I have that bathroom code yeah that's how I order

962
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,120
one of those like one of those cashier looks like Amazon like a robot go into

963
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:24,680
the

964
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,240
again ordering. Three ranch, yeah you have to say. The correct pronunciation, I appreciate

965
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,760
that. Yeah. You have to say the thing three times if you're ordering three of them. Yeah,

966
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,840
it's like Beetlejuice. Exactly, you basically read the receipt out to the different robots.

967
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,000
Are you guys excited for there to be more robots involved in your life each and every

968
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,920
day? It really snuck up on me. I remember like the self-checkout thing at the grocery

969
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,240
store seeing that and being like this is stupid dude mm-hmm oh and then I found

970
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,760
out that you could steal things oh yeah things actually first of all beast but I

971
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,040
don't want any more robots and they just started and then the one that

972
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,920
McDonald's one fucked me up dude yeah so I love I love to look at the burgers and

973
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,400
not order anything they are really fun to play with I think what what what like

974
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,900
Robotics designers don't realize is that by introducing robots instead of cashiers people are just gonna want to play on them for a few hours

975
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,360
So I'm gonna order dude. I'll sit on the coke freestyle machine writing an essay all night exactly dude

976
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:34,600
I'll pretend it's flappy bird, and I'll just move my circles might as well be a public library computer at this point cuz I'm

977
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,800
I'm playing runescape on this one coke freestyle machine right now

978
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,180
When Nolan was in Boston, we went to the

979
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:53,740
The McDonald's by your apartment Caleb in Cambridge and I ordered a thing of chicken nuggets

980
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,880
But I ordered every sauce because I wanted to like get everything

981
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,520
Yeah, and once my order went through the lady like looked and went. All right, who ordered this?

982
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,720
She's like that's way too many sauces. I'm not giving you all that

983
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:17,400
Yeah, give me that damn sauce. I wanted to try I wanted to have a sampler of sauces

984
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,060
It's like fucking tears not doing though. You're not doing that's the good thing about the robot is you can order shit

985
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:28,220
However, you want you can do the thing where you're like, I want I want a McDouble but I want no patties on it at

986
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,620
All I want is the robot is is no emotion pure logic

987
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,080
So cuz you I remember when I was vegan I'd go to like a Taco Bell or something

988
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,920
I order a burrito with no meat and some ago. What the fuck are you trying to order?

989
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,580
I don't get that kind of sassy backtalk anymore.

990
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,420
Right.

991
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,800
My computer does what I say, which is how,

992
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,640
which tell you what,

993
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,840
these minimum wage workers could learn a thing or two

994
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,520
about being silent and obeying orders

995
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,000
from these fucking computers.

996
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,280
Dude, I wish we could put all the minimum wage workers

997
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,080
on a hard drive so I don't have to look at them.

998
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,240
Here's all I'm saying,

999
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
make some sort of cursed mirror

1000
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,640
that you trap the workers in

1001
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,660
where they can't talk or interact with you really

1002
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:06,960
and they just fulfill your order.

1003
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,240
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1004
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,820
So the McDonald's like kiosk, like the thing, right?

1005
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,540
What if we put like a celebrity in there

1006
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,680
and he takes your order?

1007
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,460
Like we have like--

1008
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,580
Oh, like a custom Waze voice kind of thing?

1009
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,700
