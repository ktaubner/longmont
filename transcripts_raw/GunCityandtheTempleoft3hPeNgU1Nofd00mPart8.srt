00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
[Dramatic music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Last time on Gun City!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The Temple of the Penguin of Doom!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our heroes rode motorized Walmart scooters

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
down the mountains of Gadsville on the chase of a lifetime,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
narrowly avoiding the attacks of Ken Bones,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
nagging mothers, weird birds, and Nickelodeon slime.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
After making it through the gauntlet,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,360
They arrived at their Sky Galleon, where they made a call to break through the Ken Bone Barricade

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,680
by riding on that loop-de-loop Ken Bone, avoiding the gateway utter lasers and crashing into

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,320
their Sky Galleon, and flying up into the sky instantly.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,080
While safe aboard the Galleon, Sullivan was pressured into eating out a penguin statue,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,760
which gave the gang a direction to head next, deep into the Soy Wastes, to the town of Hoo

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Town.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,920
Unfortunately, the ship was tampered with by Pennsylvania Jim, leaving our heroes to try

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,720
to prevent the ship from crashing.

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,400
They did as best as they could, which meant the shields did not go up in time, and our

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,920
heroes plummeted to the earth with a massive, horrific thud and the icy, harsh, desperate

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:23,680
wastes of soil, left to nature's devices as the world turned black.

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
So are we dead?

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,480
We died, the world turned black, like all of us are dead.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Like hell?

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,720
We're all dead.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,400
So it's opening in hell.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm just kidding.

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,360
I don't want to be in hell.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,720
So you guys, you're a demon.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Nevermind.

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,600
I want to be in hell so bad.

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Yeah everything went black.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
If we do go to hell, can Caleb get like a huge buff?

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,760
Yeah, he would definitely be able to navigate in there, probably know some of the folks

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
in there.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
They'd be like, "What's up my demon?"

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Alright, let's go to hell.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, you guys can try to do that if you want.

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,040
I want to now. I don't think we should die.

38
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,040
So...

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Well, can we just like, maybe Caleb opens up a portal?

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Can we maybe like, just open up the ground a little bit?

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Yeah, let's open up a portal. Let's look in.

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Do I have a portal ability?

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
And we can go to Caleb's room to grab something.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
How far underground is hell?

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Okay, so where's hell?

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,200
so

47
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,040
uh... i hope i feel a lot of pressure to establish a kind of a little bit now

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,000
okay are you know i don't know how i need to say is that it's thirty feet

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
underground it's about and it is the underground and it's a little bit too

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,560
for the whole

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,080

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,440

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:03:05,840

57
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,840
like tricked me for a second all right cool so rolling now rolling 10,000 d20s

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,800
I'm being a good boy this episode and I'm letting Patches do his thing.

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
Honestly, he loves Patches.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm intimidating Patches.

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Yeah.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,000
Um, I guess you remember that you persuaded me one time and so now you're trying to find

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
a new-

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,560
Yeah, and you've been spamming every channel in the Discord asking people if they remembered

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,920
when you persuaded him.

66
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,320
I didn't spam everyone, I asked the people who are patrons and I asked the Gun City channel.

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
That's it.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,560
I do remember what you did.

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,280
It was so you could use a sword in a particular way.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
I don't remember that exactly.

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
[laughter]

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
So, yeah, everything's black.

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Honestly, pretty good move, I'm gonna say.

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah.

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
And as you guys sort of go in and out of, like, consciousness,

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,280
you feel, like, the frigid soy air around you.

77
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
You feel yourselves getting dragged occasionally

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
as you sort of half wake up, half go back to sleep.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,640
Then you sort of like half come back and you see a cloaked figure sort of by a fire and

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,000
you see the cloaked figure come towards you and it goes back to being black.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,920
And then it comes up again and the lights come on like again, like you kind of gain consciousness

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,240
again and you see the cloaked figure bent down and you recognize the cloak a little bit more

83
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,360
clearly now and it looks like it's snoochie-boochies and you sort of fade back into blackness and you

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,760
think you almost see like some sort of face underneath the hood it's hard to tell though

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,640
it looks like it's deliberately obscured not just by the hood but by almost like their face itself

86
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:20,280
and then everything goes black for a long time and then you hear uh uh patrick patrick patrick

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,000
and Patrick you are being shook violently as you come to by her ex who is shaking you.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,920
Marie goes over to you, Blotas and Ray William Johnson.

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:39,560
My two wonderful professors who groomed me, I thought we lost you forever.

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,360
And there I wake up and I instantly throw up on her.

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,240
Oh, Blotas.

92
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm like 10 feet away.

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,800
but I walk over and also throw up on her. I have a concussion and I'm throwing up but it's...

94
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,200
I have a concussion so it's making me projectile vomit. Rex is just like, "God,

95
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,240
damn it!" He's shaking me and I'm throwing up and it's spraying. "Oh my God!" It's only going on her.

96
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,920
"Stop vomiting on her! Oh my God!" And she's like, "It's all right, Rex. It's just how men say hello."

97
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
I said, "Hello."

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,920
We barbershop quartet.

99
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Hello, hello, hello.

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Roll a performance check.

101
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I got a 14.

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I got a 13.

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I got a 15.

104
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Yeah, yeah, it's

105
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,220
Flat you kind of you kind of mess up a little bit on the like hey

106
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,440
Hello like that kind of gets is a little off. But other than that like you pretty much got it

107
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,640
the

108
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,960
Rex is just like I'm kind of impressed. But that's are we going to Hollywood?

109
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,240
What can I say we have style

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,660
We fail upwards mm-hmm

111
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,880
so uh as a

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,960
You know yeah, you guys do your barbershop quartet you see Rex has the Yeti skin on him

113
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,920
And you guys notice that you're you're sort of also wrapped in some Yeti skin

114
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,040
And you you do also feel that the cold is is like

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,740
piercing like it it hurts you to walk to like be in the soy waste.

116
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:51,440
It's why it's been mostly uninhabited because it causes physical damage also,

117
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,940
which you'll start to notice and we'll talk through this a bit more but you all have for at least a temporary amount of time -

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,440
- 10 to your max HP because of how fucked up you got from the crash.

119
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
you can get your shields up in time.

120
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
So, um, at least temporary, you have -10 to your max HP.

121
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
You're just like, kind of like, fucking banged up.

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,440
But you're at full health, I should note, as well.

123
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
You're just weaker.

124
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
So I'm at 31?

125
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Yeah. So keep track of that too, so we can obviously put it back up.

126
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
I mean, I guess you'll just add 10, but...

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Um, Rex, uh, says, uh, um, to you all,

128
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,040
We, uh, you know, we, after I killed the Yeti and we got the, uh, and he holds up a little

129
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,520
Batman beyond action figure, got the artifact.

130
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,200
Uh, I, uh, we started, uh, trying to find a cave to rest in for some time.

131
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,760
We found this one and I saw that, uh, Snoochie Boochies over here and I thought he was trying

132
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
to kill you.

133
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,560
So I went to, I went to go put it, put his head in his ass, but, um, he ran, but I realized

134
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,380
now he was actually probably helping you.

135
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,620
So I feel a little bad for almost putting his head in his ass.

136
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,500
But you guys got healed up by that guy.

137
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Yo.

138
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500

Yo.

145
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Yo.

146
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,900
And Patrick Yoda, you feel around your robe.

147
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Oh, I'm feeling around.

148
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
All right.

149
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Sorry.

150
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,220
But I've been feeling around this whole time.

151
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
Come on.

152
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,220

153
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,380

and singing

155
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,740
appealing itself up you also find

156
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,940
a note

157
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,940
uh...

158
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,140
it says in in on the on this little this piece of paper in my perfect gray l_c_a_

pixel five i got a digital watch

160

717 oh

165
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,360
Yeah, I've had this on me the whole time

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,680
Think I don't remember. I have a concussion

167
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,400
Was just like a grocery list. I think it is

168
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,880
Well what you would recall all of you potentially

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
but

170
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
Is that you did have to go to?

171
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,520
the Wendig station

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:39,520
to take a train to get to the Hu town, where the temple is rumored to be near that Hu town, which is the last stop on the Wendig Express at Wendig Station.

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,520
The only sort of transport that is actually functioning in the Soy Wastes.

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:11:01,520
You would also know, by the way, just a little bit of background on the soy wastes, is that soy is sort of a, it's kind of also a drug in its own light.

175
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,520
If you like snort it directly, your mouth kind of goes open for like a bit and you get a little bit of a buzz.

176
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,520
Sort of like snorting, like if you snorted caffeine, it's like kind of a similar kind of experience.

177
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,220
Does that make your mouth open?

178
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,120
No, that's the soy.

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,220
The soy does that.

180
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:22,820
Okay.

181
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,920
Is that still okay?

182
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Like it's a joke in 2021 or is it kind of because I made it

183
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,920
because yeah, you think it's all right.

184
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:38,320
So yeah, yeah, so yeah, so that you would also know that's

185
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,020
about it for the details on that.

186
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,720
But yeah, so then you have this note in your pocket.

187
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,920
It's written in this like LCA pixel font.

188
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
um...

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,040
the air uh... your your your couple miles from the train station if i turn the

190
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,680
note upside down to the senate think funny like a calculator

191
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,200
it says boobs inexplicably

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,800
uh... you know

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,280
you can't have a little

194
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,100
or it says car sixteen roadie seven seventeen and i think it's going to back

195
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,080
over again

196
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,560
as you're turning it there's like no difference it really doesn't hurt it so

197
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,520

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,360
and all my god

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,120

201
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,080
some boobs

202
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,360

or and i don't know i have a concussion

205
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,360
and i think uh...

206
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,400
i think we should head to the train station all the meanwhile his head is in

207
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,720
the ground in this feeder dangling up. He must be scared of boobs. I start

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:54,280
tickling his feet. I don't like that. I slap his feet. I didn't like that. I

209
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,320
pull him out. He is like his mouth is like completely a cape. His eyes are

210
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
bugging out

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
what happened

212
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
i don't remember

213
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
we were in the ship

214
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
and

215
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
where did we come from

216
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
i ate out of the statue

217
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
and then we crashed

218
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
yeah sullivan you crashed

219
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
the ship

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
with a real persuasion

221
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
yes i knew i was getting

222
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
advantage on that shit

223
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
you guys pretty much always have advantage in bullying sullivan

224
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,920
I got a 10.

225
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,420
Oh, I guess the set free.

226
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Anyway.

227
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
You didn't do advantage.

228
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
You're right, I forgot.

229
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Yeah.

230
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Nat 20.

231
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
You got a crit.

232
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
A nat 20.

233
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Sullivan's like, "Oh, God."

234
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,420
You fucking dumbass.

235
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,420
I always do.

236
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Your arms were too small for the wheel.

237
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,420
You're the reason we're in this situation.

238
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
I don't know why I insisted on driving the ship.

239
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
I know how tiny my arms are.

240
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
You would try to.

241
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
To make it up to me, you can give me a piggyback ride to the next ship.

242
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
I don't know why I insisted on driving the ship.

243
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
I know how tiny my arms are.

244
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
You would try to.

245
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,420
I don't know why I insisted on driving the ship.

246
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I know how tiny my arms are.

247
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,900
no i don't know how tiny my arms are. To make it up to me you can give me a piggyback ride

248
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:07,900
to the next destination. Okay if you insist. You're so much bigger than me. I know. I climb

249
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,780
onto Caleb's back before Caleb gets on. Yeah and I'll give you a blow toss, a piggyback

250
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,900
ride, and then blow toss you get Patrick Gill to a piggyback ride. I just physically I don't

251
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:24,380
think you'll get to wherever you want to go. Okay that's fine ship destroyer. Hey ruiner.

252
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Okay, I'll try my best.

253
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
I hop on his shoulders.

254
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
Mm-hmm.

255
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
I hop on Cameron's shoulders.

256
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
I mean, he's already, like, crushed.

257
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,380
[laughter]

258
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
He just instantly...

259
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
He's just already flattened.

260
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
That's what does it.

261
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Like, he can't lift you up.

262
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
He's like a pancake.

263
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
He's, uh...

264
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,380
Okay, I pick him back up and I blow into his mouth to make him 3D.

265
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay.

266
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
And then we continue.

267
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
Oh, heavens!

268
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:00,380
the

269
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:30,340
the

270
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,600
(laughter)

271
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,180
- Smart.

272
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,200
- Anymore?

273
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,380
I did that before.

274
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,180
- I don't need no fancy escort, I'll take a normal slut.

275
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,600
- Hot dog, she says.

276
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,980
Yeah, so you guys can walk to the--

277
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,540
- I start sliding Sullivan along the ice.

278
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,580
- On the snow. - Curling.

279
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,420
- Yeah.

280
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,780
- Yeah, he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

281
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:19,580
a

282
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,680
about like an hour walk. Okay, you're gonna also take some

283
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,080
damage in that time. But not too much because you're you have

284
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,280
the Yeti cloak on also. I'm I was born in ice. So I don't

285
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,680
take any you are resistant. You are going to take half damage

286
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,980
because you are and I'm a demon. So I take even more damage.

287
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,180
I wasn't going to have that be a thing, but you know, I'll

288
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:55,020
take it yeah I yeah and Patrick Yoda you take just the average amount of damage

289
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:02,200
simple man I don't need anything special yeah um so yeah as you guys so let me

290
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,820
roll for that actually I now brought out my I've used my physical let me take

291
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,060
I'll take like five times the damage that's you just want to go to hell I

292
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:19,060
and

293
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:33,900
will

294
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,300
above my head so that snow doesn't touch him that means he doesn't get caught. I give him my coat.

295
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,660
Okay all right Sullivan takes no damage. You guys have persuaded me. How much extra damage do I take?

296
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,940
We've had we've had a Sullivan death scare like twice an episode for the past few. Yeah I'm gonna

297
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,700
try to make I'm gonna uh I'm taking Sullivan back to the lab and fine tuning him to be a little bit

298
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll take an extra four damage then.

299
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,100
Yeah.

300
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,600
Yeah.

301
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,100
Yeah.

302
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,600
Yeah.

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah.

304
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,700
And I want to take damage.

305
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,100
So the next night I'm trying to prove them tough.

306
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah.

307
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,700
Yeah.

308
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm also wearing cargo shorts in the in the freezing cold.

309
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Yeah.

310
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,100
Yeah.

311
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,400
And so as you as you guys sort of like approach the station,

312
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,100
it's like this blistering freezing cold and soy like you kind of

313
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:29,220
almost have to resist your mouth slowly opening up as you walk through it because it's just

314
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,260
like coming at your face so hard.

315
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
Hell yeah.

316
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Floppy flu.

317
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
Pause.

318
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Pause.

319
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:46,300
And you see sort of like the unmistakable, you know, gaping maw of the Wendig Station.

320
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,300
It's the face of the eternal enemy of online public libraries.

321
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,300
This lone structure that sort of punctuates this godforsaken place.

322
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Do any of us have books in our inventory? I just want to make sure.

323
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Yeah, just make sure to protect those.

324
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,300
They like vanish the second you...

325
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Didn't we kill him?

326
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Well, so this is actually a very cool moment for me.

327
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Two little war things we have to talk about.

328
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm so excited. So I love the lore one part is that we have sort of in the year 2300.

329
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,260
We have that first gun city adventure now whether or not that is like officially Canon at this

330
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,860
point or if that is sort of an alternate universe gun city adventure because that is technically

331
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,340
like 55 years in the future from this these events that have happened. There's that and

332
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,060
so that's where Chuck Wendig was. Then...

333
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,060
Ah, okay.

334
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Oh, so we're going into it...

335
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
We're going to kill him.

336
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,460
So we're going in a time machine at the end of the...

337
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,380
Yeah, we could do that. That's fine too.

338
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,900
At the end of the...

339
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,420
But then, um, uh, then...

340
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,780
That was our character. Our characters in the first Gun City were old, and we didn't

341
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,780
realize it.

342
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Or they were our sons.

343
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,780
Okay, I like that.

344
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,100
Or they were your sons. And you all have, like, sons that are just...

345
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Yeah, sons that are exactly us.

346
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm trying to make this work for you Patches.

347
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,140
No, no, no, I think that's so funny.

348
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Yeah, let's do that.

349
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
These are our identical twins.

350
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Identical sons.

351
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
Identical sons.

352
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
If there are any...

353
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
This is my identical son.

354
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
We were born 30 years apart.

355
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:38,820
If we have any autistic fans listening, this is a very big opportunity for you because

356
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,620
you can do some really nice actually is to other people on yes

357
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,020
room we actually like character is his son and I want to close on yeah I we

358
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,660
really heard the fans that can do that and hurt we need an artistic army don't

359
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,820
hurt people but the the other thing the other bit of lore so that's perfect

360
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:05,740
identical sons I that's canon for me that's cool that's golden the next thing

361
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:18,740
is

362
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,740
I thought you're talking about the place I came from.

363
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
Right, so you're from Whoville.

364
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
So that's what I'm interested in.

365
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
WhoTown is sort of like an outpost, because again,

366
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,740
very few actual communities in the Soywastes.

367
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,740
So WhoTown is sort of a small outpost that just has Whovians in it.

368
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
Do you have any relation to them?

369
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
Do you know them at all?

370
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,740
You're not from there then. You're from Whoville.

371
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,740
In this case, right?

372
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
Well, no.

373
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Okay, so...

374
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,740
So my identical son is from Whoville.

375
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Right. So that's why I'm-

376
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,740
But I am from the year 2011.

377
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,740
Because my father was a guy named Soldiers Wrath.

378
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Wait, who's your father?

379
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
That's my father.

380
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Who had a half-human-

381
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
The Christmas episode?

382
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,740
Yep. And you remember at the very end, the post-credit scene, he had a son and he said,

383
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,140
And he said, I'm going to cryogenically freeze my son.

384
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,220
Until I forgot about that.

385
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,020
Fifty years. So where were you from?

386
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,620
You're from who I was born in.

387
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,580
I was born a long time ago.

388
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,220
Yeah. And who?

389
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
Becca's then. OK.

390
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,860
But then I was cryogenically frozen.

391
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,660
I was, I guess, woken up in the preschool.

392
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,860
We all went to.

393
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,100
How are you? Futurama shit right now?

394
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,500
Yeah. So.

395
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,660
But so I was I was cryogenically frozen the minute I was born.

396
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,860
Right. Yeah.

397
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,300
So I don't have any memories of the past.

398
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
So do you know where you were?

399
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,860
I don't even know anything about the past.

400
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,860
Okay, so that's good.

401
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,420
We can keep it at that because, you know, maybe there's more we want to do with that.

402
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,540
But you know, you were frozen.

403
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,820
And get this, in the Christmas episode, that son, it was twins.

404
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,020
And my identical son was actually also frozen for even longer.

405
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,940
And he was frozen for 50 more years.

406
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,660
So my identical son's actually my twin brother.

407
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,100
Okay, I have a normal identical son.

408
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,900
None of this fancy, cryo, Walt Disney shit.

409
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,700
I just had a son that was just like me.

410
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I mean, I'm a Yoda. I can live to be like 900.

411
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,900
- No, we already... - That could just be you.

412
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,300
We already said there's identical sons.

413
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,100
No, Patrick was around back during the Christmas episode.

414
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,300
Yeah.

415
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,100
So am I the only one with an identical son now? This is getting really shitty.

416
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,900
No, I'm not saying Patrick doesn't have an identical son. Maybe he does.

417
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:43,460
I'm an identical son. I have that was the identical son on the adventure, but I go to was retired. Yeah, okay

418
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,440
Yeah, yeah, all right. It's my identical son on in in the first one

419
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,420
Mm-hmm, and then I mean I'm still around I'm just I'm at home

420
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,460
Okay, and also I just want to say every episode it's a different care. My guy is a different guy

421
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:05,420
It's like James Bond yeah, I'm blue this episode also right there

422
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,700
Yeah, right cool. I'll get Joey or Kai on that. Thank you

423
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,180
All right

424
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,520
So I just wanted to know where we were at with the the who town thing mostly

425
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,160
But I'm glad we also cleared we chopped a lot of stuff up right there. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, so we'll see how much of that

426
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,940
People give it for yeah

427
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,620
so yeah, you approach the

428
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,300
the

429
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
station and

430
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,860
Let me see where all y'all's passive perceptions

431
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:41,360
Patrick Yoda is insanely high.

432
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,960
Yeah, Patrick Yoda, you pick up like sort of like there's like this sort of,

433
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,060
you know, I see staircase that leads up to the

434
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,560
pick up the stairs.

435
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,160
You pick up that there are these like sort of like a

436
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,160
the wanted posters on the wall next to that staircase.

437
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,160
It's really crudely drawn drawings of the four of you.

438
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,160
I still have a concussion right now, so I pick up the...

439
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,160
I take one of the wanted posters off the wall and I say, "Who the fuck are these guys?"

440
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,160
I say, "I think it's those guys." And there's a bunch of guys who look like stick figure versions of us.

441
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,160
this

442
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,160
better luck next time

443
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,000
yeah uh... uh...

444
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,920
and you also see so that people who who run the train station up here so you

445
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,920
know it's it's a it's a more industrial

446
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,160
kind of uh...

447
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,200
you transition compared to most of the like more sleek sort of cyberpunk e

448
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,980
stuff

449
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,360
uh... that you would see in gun city

450
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,120
so there's

451
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,900
just a bunch of snow myseries who run the train station

452
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,440
uh... he misers that kind of help for with the fuel and heat the

453
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,240
The the fuel that sort of powers train station and then conductor

454
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,840
misers that sort of conduct.

455
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,240
Trains and stuff.

456
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,240
All right.

457
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,740
Yeah.

458
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,140
Yeah, I made sure it worked.

459
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,940
So yeah, and yeah with the scene is one posters Patrick Yoda

460
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
and then you sort of as you sort of turn the corner towards

461
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,540
the staircase you see there are a lot of just like armored

462
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,840
Ken bones sort of inner just sort of monitoring and sort of

463
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
like putz and around.

464
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,180
but they are there

465
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,660
you know uh... uh... i did say that there was going to be potentially

466
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,580
consequences for this actually so they're they're around

467
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,860
okay

468
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,000
so you need to get tickets we need to get disguises

469
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
well i can disguise myself

470
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,080
i could buy a bunch of ticket i could buy i could disguise myself and buy

471
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,840
tickets for us

472
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,980
that's a good idea that's actually not a bad idea at all

473
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,760
okay i'm gonna do that

474
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,920
okay cool who do you want to discuss yourself as?

475
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,200
uh... an arcade repairman

476
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,000
(laughter)

477
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,700
okay yeah you're an arcade repairman

478
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,620
okay i'll get back into the maid outfit then just in case

479
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,320

480
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,000
i don't remember what you did either. i think i was just me i don't think i did anything

481
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,880
i think you were like dusting a bitch with a feather. were you also an arcade repairman?

482
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,080
Can we just add Arcade Repairman outfit to our inventories?

483
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,880
I guess so, I can't not allow it at this point.

484
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,080
Because I did a whole thing with it.

485
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
Yeah, go into the ticket booth.

486
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,680
Mmm, okay.

487
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,080
Again, I'm just cleaning shit.

488
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,680
You see, Ticky the ticket bot is there.

489
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Um...

490
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,580
And he's like, "Can I help you?"

491
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,880
Hello, mate!

492
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,280
I'm here to buy three tickets for just me.

493
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,280
And I'm here to repair you!

494
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Who are you?

495
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
I don't know you at all.

496
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm the Arcane Rebam.

497
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
I'm your twin brother.

498
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I'm the Arcane Rebam man around here.

499
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm your twin brother.

500
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,280
I slap him.

501
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Ah!

502
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Just good old...

503
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,280
So many officers start to turn, just notice what's going on.

504
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Like, over there.

505
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Someone hit somebody.

506
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm like out of focus in the French maid outfit in the background.

507
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Yeah.

508
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,280
There's something sexy behind you.

509
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
Where?

510
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Um, you want three tickets?

511
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
Yeah, I reckon that's right.

512
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,280
And I'm here to repair you.

513
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,280
That'll be either coach or first class.

514
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,280
What's the difference?

515
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
First class is ten thousand tokens per ticket.

516
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:55,280
it

517
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:03,540
take on debt. What? You take on debt? I don't make the rules. Can I open up the control

518
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,760
panel in the back of this robot? You can certainly try. You're not a real arcade repairman. Well,

519
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:17,600
I don't have time to do some routine repairs I reckon. Yes, indeed. What? What are you

520
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,280
trying to do? I go up and start poking his eyeballs so he looks like an arcade game to

521
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,040
anybody's talking about. I'm just poking the lasers.

522
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,560
Yeah, I'm hitting it with the hammer, I'm opening it with the wrench.

523
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,240
Yeah, I'm opening the control panel. You want to do this, you have to do

524
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,560
slight of hand to make sure nobody notices. You guys

525
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,120
should set the first class ticket price to a dollar.

526
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,800
I got seven. Cameron, your turn. You're also an arcade repairman.

527
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,240
I clicked it, it won't work. 13. Okay, yeah,

528
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,760
you see uh uh one of the uh officers sort of like notice what's going on that somebody's got a

529
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,360
wrench and it's applying it to the ticket box and like hey okay but what's going on somebody wearing

530
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,280
an arcade repairman outfit so yeah no i know that's happening hey what's uh what's going on over here

531
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:17,320
where i see uh just a spot of routine updates i reckon indeed oh i think i dropped something over

532
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:31,280
for

533
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:45,200
are

534
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,760
causing a bit of a wreck is some of the snow misers are getting nervous.

535
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,000
All right, righty out.

536
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,520
Game, game on.

537
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,720
And I tell your friend over there that you know, if she's called you can have my coat

538
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,720
whatever no big deal.

539
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,920
He said he can have his coat.

540
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,360
Well, what are you are I reckon?

541
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,480
And what's your your coat?

542
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,920
My name is Ken.

543
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,520
I got I got it. I got to go. I'm I'm blushing to add these.

544
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,120
Get out of here. You big hunk of shit. Oh boy.

545
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,720
Um, um, it's often by the way is by the stairs like waiting for

546
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,820
you guys to get the tickets.

547
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,420
I forgot we needed four tickets.

548
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,220
We can we can we can do more repairs.

549
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,320
I can hide him in my big.

550
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,720
Did our repairs lower the prices at all?

551
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:57,640
the

552
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:12,800
to

553
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:27,800
to

554
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Well is this, is this coin, this Mike Pence coin I have, can I convert that to, uh...

555
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
The dollars?

556
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Can I convert that to dollars? Because it's a vintage coin and I know vintage coins are, uh...

557
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
They are, they do go for quite a bit.

558
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Yeah, they're worth...

559
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
They go for quite a bit.

560
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
And this is from 2021 and we're in the year...

561
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,800
You know what, do a, um... shit.

562
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
We're in a later year.

563
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,800
You should be able to do a check where you could sort of appraise it.

564
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,800
sort of an archaeologist. So just do a...

565
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm a genius. I'm a genius putting this in my inventory.

566
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Let's just do I guess a history...

567
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,800
no, insight. No. Yeah, let's do insight.

568
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,800
It's history check, history check, because it's sort of like a... you're appraising

569
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,800
historical worth of it. Six.

570
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
You can't quite like properly... I appraise it with an 18.

571
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Okay, yeah, you're able to appraise it very well. It's about 75 tokens.

572
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,800
75 tokens? It should be worth more than that.

573
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Oh, it's like you've been carrying it around.

574
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,800
You know, Patrick, I have to say, I've just appraised this item and I think it's worth about 300 tokens.

575
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Oh!

576
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Awesome!

577
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Ah, you landlubber!

578
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,800
It's about worth about 300 points!

579
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Beautiful, mate! Beautiful!

580
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:58,800
the

581
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:11,280
the

582
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,280
it

583
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,600
Some of you can go into first class. Yeah, but I have one

584
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,080
Yeah, you have yeah, it's first. So I have one is 100

585
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:32,200
Yeah, you have 100 and then you appraise the coin for three. Yeah, it's seven. No, it's 75 and then 50

586
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,040
and then

587
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,160
Okay

588
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Wait, no, I thought we would get around that

589
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,560
That's pretty close. You could get two of you in first class. I want to is there a camera go in first class

590
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,600
Is there enough for?

591
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,520
for them the other two people i can't do this bathroom you go in first class

592
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,480
yourself it's okay

593
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,120
i don't want to go first class i want to see i want to see how going first class

594
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,640
along with the other hand i sent patrick to first class alone

595
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,060
not only did patrick in the gun first class the argument there meant to go

596
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,080
well yeah i think it's going to better in this county a

597
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,560
he had waited until i got a little bit of a discount

598
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:19,480
I reach into the overall pocket of my outfit and I take out my arcade repairman ID card

599
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
as part of the disguise.

600
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
And everyone has to salute you as you board the train.

601
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,760
And I swipe it and the price goes down to one token.

602
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,440
So blow toss, blow toss, and I like the idea of blow toss and Patrick Yoda going to first

603
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,440
class and then we can have Ray William Johnson and Sullivan in coach.

604
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Seems like good, safe parries.

605
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:59,260
a

606
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
I know it's you.

607
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Don't tell anyone.

608
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Crikey!

609
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,700
I want to ride coach with Sullivan to make sure that he rides coach and doesn't try to

610
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
sneak up.

611
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,500
Do you guys need money or what's going on?

612
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Righto.

613
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,180
So what do you need, like $50 or?

614
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,180
We need $400.

615
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
$300.

616
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
$3,400.

617
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
$3,400.

618
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
$3,400.

619
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:48,100
the

620
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,300
enough though now yeah yeah I think so too except except I'm not sure it's

621
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,020
enough for Sullivan to ride first class now that I think all right he gets good

622
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:04,380
even if we have the money just want to go to yeah okay and I want regular I want

623
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:11,820
frequent cutaways to how he's doing okay can I get the seat like you know what

624
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,300
like on an airplane where it's like divided like first class and then coach

625
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,300
coach

626
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:29,300
experience entirely. Okay. I just wanted to be able to taunt him. Which is pretty funny.

627
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:37,540
I think he'll be okay. But he will be alone. We're sending him coach. We're just gonna

628
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:44,140
make you do scenes. By myself? Yeah. You have to voice everybody. We can play the other

629
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,940
characters and coach. We're gonna be busy enjoying ourselves in first class. We won't

630
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,380
be able to voice anyone. We'll see. We'll see how, we'll see. We're sending Sullivan and

631
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,120
coach it's decided. Who's enjoying, who's, uh, I guys can't see at home, but I'm tempting

632
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:05,780
my fingers. Who's going to enjoy. You look malicious. Yeah, I'm delicious. And you were

633
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,500
tempting your fingers, but you're tempting my dinger. If you know what I'm saying. That's

634
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:16,220
really good. That was good. That was good. The conductor miser says, uh, all aboard, all

635
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,520
aboard. So most of the trains in the station by the way, there's

636
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,220
only like a couple of passenger trains. So you know that like

637
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,120
whatever train you're going on is probably the right one. There

638
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:33,020
are 15 cars that are coach two cars that are first-class.

639
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,120
The other trains are mostly carrying resources to and from

640
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,820
the first-class cars mostly are going to have like sort of kind

641
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,060
of business magnets who are kind of striking it out on trying to make some money off of

642
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:57,860
the soy wastes, which is kind of this unenclaimed, sort of unmanned territory. Now, excuse me,

643
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:07,380
so I bet that might. Your experience getting on to first class, it's lush, there's, you

644
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,620
know there's a box there that can give you guys food and stuff the only other

645
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:18,940
thing is that there are pretty frequent Ken bone officers to around and so we'll

646
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,940
have to address how you guys sort of continue to avoid them your disguise

647
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,860
lasts how long again forever the whole game the whole train ride I don't think

648
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:35,180
it has a duration let me check it's an outfit is it the same right duration is

649
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:41,780
five minutes but I will say it is an outfit. It is in my inventory. Okay but I can keep

650
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,460
the disguise on and maybe it doesn't work quite as well. Well basically. Like your face is

651
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:53,220
back to blow toss. Yeah. So yeah as opposed to the face of an arcade repairman. A dirty

652
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,460
coal covered face of an arcade repairman. Which will sort of like you know I'll do some

653
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,300
like checks on my end but that's gonna start to potentially cause you problems since they

654
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:08,860
are actively looking for you guys. How long do we know but it's a it's going to be about

655
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,060
like an hour and a half. Okay, it's fine. Like it. Yeah, I'm sitting in the bathroom

656
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:22,060
the whole time. And then on Sullivan side is coach where most of the passengers are.

657
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:31,380
So coach is a very different experience. It's a lot of worker bots and bones that live and

658
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,780
sleep there. Some of them never get off their stop and then they just get fired and they

659
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,460
live inside of the train. They trade stories and Yu-Gi-Oh cards, other cheap artifacts as

660
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,380
currency. They eat SpaghettiOs and snort soy. Sort of like a hobo community has developed

661
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:55,300
there. And it's just like a massive place and it's just filled with burly, stinky people

662
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:01,420
And Sullivan is just sort of now also in there, just kind of pretty out of place.

663
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,900
Yeah. So that's sort of what's happening there now.

664
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,660
Now you guys are, you know, there's two cars up in first class.

665
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,740
So one of them has presumably one of them has

666
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,500
at least somebody you're supposed to meet

667
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,900
at some point, perhaps snitchy

668
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,540
boochies based on sort of the order of events.

669
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,660
so yeah we as we do you're you're in the car now you haven't

670
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,540
shrimp cocktail

671
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,100

672
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,620

00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,300

well me next and you

853
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Oh man, I am tempted to just...

854
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Roll a d20 if you get a 19 or a 20.

855
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:23,820
Oh, yeah, you try to hand it the hot dog just like explodes.

856
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:30,220
I just put my hand out.

857
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,220
Who did that?

858
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,520
Who did that?

859
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,720
He's like looking around.

860
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,920
He's like getting nervous.

861
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,120
He looks down at Sullivan.

862
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,420
He's like, I couldn't be you.

863
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,820
You're too sweet.

864
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,720
Now go get me some food.

865
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,920
I can get the popo off your ass.

866
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:56,760
this

867
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:03,760
the

868
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,280
through we actually first we cut back to Ray William Johnson who's just politely

869
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,520
drinking a martini. Yeah my legs are crossed. Yeah. I'm just drinking the martini so

870
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,840
beautifully in my maid outfit. Yeah, Ray William Johnson you look past the window

871
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:22,000
into the next car and you do see the hooded figure of Snoochie Boochie's in

872
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,240
there. You can sort of make that out now that you have like a moment alone with

873
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,240
No external stimuli.

874
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,240
This guy very clearly sees one car over in car 16.

875
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,240
And then cut back to the bathroom.

876
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,240
So you guys are harassing Gary C. Enterprise.

877
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
Like, "I'm really glad you guys are here.

878
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
As you can see, I stopped being a Sullivan the Frog impersonator.

879
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
I've decided I've got to have my own voice.

880
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,240
Got to be my own character.

881
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,240
And I have you guys to thank.

882
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,240
The business is doing great.

883
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,240
Now I don't just sell V-food. I sell real food."

884
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,240
Great, the business is doing great.

885
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,240
So where's our cut of the money?

886
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
How'd you guys get out of jail?

887
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Wait, hold on, hold on!

888
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Hold on, hold on!

889
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,240
I'm a big Caucasian man.

890
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Well, I was donating most of the money to...

891
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,240
You were donating the money? What the fuck?

892
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,240
The free you guys, the free you guys!

893
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,240
Who told you to donate that money?

894
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,240
You did. You said every cent...

895
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,240
You guys were being hauled off to jail.

896
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,240
You said if a single cent of this doesn't go to getting us free,

897
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,240
Go to getting us free. It's your head Gary

Donated to a free the free the free the poppy killers fund

Some of them hit the hit the highest goals you can see here now you do have to take out a few people to dinner

901
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,580
I'm afraid hold on one sec

902
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,220
God so can I get a shrimp po boy in here?

903
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:09,220
I'm caging now by the way. He's rolling dice - that's a bad side

904
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,900
Yoda by birth occasion by the grace of God

905
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,400
Okay, yeah you hear a knock on the door and

906
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,360
It is not Carson. It is a Ken bone guard who takes up the entire width of the door

907
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:32,480
Well, he can't you like wait if he did he open the door already cuz I mean the doors closed were in the bathroom

908
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,400
It's a lot. Yeah. No, that's what you see sort of I should say. That's what you say. Okay, so I turn invisible

909
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,000
Okay, just before anything else. Yeah, I

910
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,480
Open up Gary's backpack and I take out his spare suit

911
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,880
I put on a blue suede suit.

912
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,680
Now I'm a different guy.

913
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,280
I'm no longer an R. I put my arcade repairman suit back.

914
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,280
I put on Hatchik's arcade repairman suit on over mine.

915
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,280
And it's Yoda sized so you just, it's like you're wearing like...

916
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,680
There's like so much rustling that you can hear from outside the door.

917
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,880
And you see the Ken Bogart he sort of sounds like the

918
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,880
the

919
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:23,460
City 17 guys in half-life 2 but like with a Ken bone voice being put through and it's like

920
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,120
Cuz this one's like a suited up boys. Like there's a real right in there

921
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,560
Yeah, yeah, yes, sir

00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:39,280
Why are there two people I tap it was shoulder

923
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,920
Excuse me, ma'am. Hey, you want to join the four and a half foot high club?

924
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:58,100
In a different bathroom, that's what I meant

925
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:12,040
Roll persuasion. I just kind of assumed we were in a big bathroom. Stop talking. Okay

926
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:18,000
19

927
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,040
He's like we're moaning cuz I thought you were big character as the kid. Okay was I was

928
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,120
He says uh, hmm

929
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,840
All right, um

930
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,560
There's no food you want to go to the bathroom the other cart. Oh

931
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:41,600
Yeah, this one seems occupied. Yeah, I don't buy at least two or three two or three guys. I think we're having sex

932
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:49,080
All right, all right just just don't tell my supervisor, okay, I really shouldn't but you guys

933
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:55,440
I definitely won't let's go. Yeah, you guys go to the other cart as you're walking by you see Snoochie Boochies

934
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,840
He doesn't you know, he doesn't know you but you guys can kind of know each other to see each other

935
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:03,240
They're kind of, you know, there's like an acknowledgement,

936
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,640
but you're wearing a French made out.

937
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,040
Yeah.

938
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,740
Yeah.

939
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,840
Yeah, he might be a little confused.

940
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,340
Yeah.

941
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,840
Yeah.

942
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,440
And yeah, so you're going to end up in the bathroom there and

943
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,940
I will cut back to that soon.

944
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,440
Meanwhile doing some roles for Sullivan on the side.

945
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,340
See how he does.

946
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,140
Yeah.

947
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,440
I just started pretending to be Sullivan.

948
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:57,640
I

949
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:05,440
I want to, um, Hey, uh, Gary, I mean, now that, now that we're here, I think, yeah, sure.

950
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:05,960
What's going on?

951
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,280
I think it makes sense for, uh, you to give us all the money you made.

952
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,680
Yeah, that's a good point.

953
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,400
I mean, it's the fund is that we were here.

954
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,260
No, no, no, no.

955
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,660
You've got it.

956
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,540
You've got a good point, fellas.

957
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,880
Here's what I could do.

958
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,360
I can open, I can open up an account.

959
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:23,880
All right.

960
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,800
I'll transfer the money in there.

961
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,140
It's gonna take one in three days, but you'll see it all in there in one in three days. Okay, how does that sound?

962
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:34,000
So so we can get like a joy I can give you any cash I have on me

963
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,460
I mean not all of it. I need to you know, I don't win the account

964
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm scouting out a location in who in who town actually gonna be to try to have the first

965
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,040
Gun City restaurant in the soy waste. Huh? Where do you go? Yeah, pretty big and our names are gonna be on it

966
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,320
Well, I yeah, of course your plaque is up on every restaurant

967
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,480
It's as a three guys who murdered a guy

968
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:06,520
How many other locations guys who murdered a guy maybe that's what I should call the restaurant

969
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:14,480
Well, how many other locations are there yeah, there's there's three in gun city right now, you know, it's a small chain

970
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,880
You know sort of a boutique sort of chain. Oh, so how much weight how much money do we have? Oh

971
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,920
Oh, well, you guys have probably a couple hundred thousand tokens.

972
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,080
Yeah, I mean, put it in the account.

973
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,800
Couple thousand each.

974
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Oh, yeah. You just couldn't access it because you were criminals.

975
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,800
Can I get your phone number to?

976
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,280
Yeah, but you put your phone on my phone and we can exchange numbers

977
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,840
because that's how it works in the future.

978
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,720
Yeah, of course. Everybody knows that you guys stack your PS.

979
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,280
OK, but for me, my phone doesn't have that.

980
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,200
My PSP doesn't have that functionality.

981
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,240
Could do like 10 years ago.

982
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm going to need you to say your number out loud for me to write it down.

983
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Sure.

984
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
555.

985
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,640
Okay, I know that's a fake number for movies.

986
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,640
I'm not stupid.

987
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,400
No, no, we're in a movie all the time.

988
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,440
So I'm going to need you to read out your number for me out loud.

989
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,440
I put it in the chat.

990
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,960
Not sure who you're talking to anymore.

991
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,960
Oh, okay.

992
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,960

Okay, thank you. And I can call you any time of day, even in the middle of the night.

995
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,960
Especially in the middle of the night.

996
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,960
Cool, thank you, Gary.

997
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,960
Yes.

998
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,960
Is that okay?

999
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,960
Yeah, I don't care. It's already...

01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,960
I've gotten 180 texts since we started.

1001
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,960
Holy shit.

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:50,520
I'm up to 1700 texts today.

1003
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,520
It's probably fine.

1004
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,520
Yeah, it's fun.

1005
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,960
The phone company is going to reach out to you sometime.

1006
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
Good.

1007
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,880
And be like, "What's going on, man?"

1008
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
I'm popular.

1009
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,880
What's going on?

1010
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,760
Do thousands of people have your number or something?

1011
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,760
What's happening?

1012
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,760
No.

1013
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,760
Yeah, my friends.

1014
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,760
Yeah.

1015
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,760
All right, so what's going on now?

Yeah, so you got Gary C. Enterprises number.

01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,760
And hundreds of thousands of tokens.

1018
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Some serious money is on the way for you guys.

1019
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,760
Wait, one second. Before we leave the bathroom, before we cut away, I call the number just to make sure he's not

01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,760

Alright.

1039
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:50,340
I take a very sexually take off one of my stockings.

1040
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,840
Oh hot mama.

1041
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,340
Wrap it, shut up, and wrap it around his eyes so he can't see anything.

1042
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,340
Okay.

1043
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:58,340
Wow.

1044
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,340
These are not translucent, they're opaque.

1045
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,340
Yeah, opaque stockings, yeah.

1046
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,340
They're very expensive.

1047
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,340
[laughter]

1048
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,340
A lot of material goes into that.

1049
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:10,340
Okay, now next step open your mouth.

1050
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,340
Ah, why am I saying ah?

1051
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:21,340
Here comes my vagina and I slowly insert my sword into his brain.

1052
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,340
Okay, yeah.

1053
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:26,340
There it is.

1054
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:30,340
Roll an attack roll. It's going to be an auto crit.

1055
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:35,340
Yeah, so just do an automatic crit attack roll on this guy.

1056
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,340
Where is, what should I roll?

1057
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,340
So just roll the attack and then you can just press the damage in chat.

1058
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,340
So that's, okay, so that's 22 points of damage.

1059
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,340
Uh, he is just concussed. You just like, fucking like,

1060
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:51,340
fucked up his brain. He's just like,

1061
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
*pfft* *BURP* and he's just like,

1062
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:55,340
smashed his head on the, on the uh,

1063
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,340
sink. And then I flush him down the toilet.

1064
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,340
*laughter*

1065
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,340
You're gonna try to do that?

1066
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:04,340
I would like to.

1067
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:06,340
Okay, um...

1068
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:11,340
Stealth check, if you're gonna try to flush a whole man down the toilet.

1069
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,340
Well, you sound like I'm shitting.

1070
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,340
You sound like you're shitting, yeah.

1071
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,340
Why don't-- wait, why don't you chop him up?

1072
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,340
I'm not gonna chop-- that's disgusting!

1073
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
What the hell, dude? Ugh.

1074
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,340

1075
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,340
What the fuck, you're a freak, dude.

1076
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,340
You're weird. I-- I gotta tend.

1077
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,340
Yeah, by some miracle, they don't really notice you.

1078
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,340
Um, just stuffing this man in a toilet.

Yep, here he is.

1111
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,840
You're being confusing.

1112
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,640
I know that that is not the fourth one.

1113
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,520
Who are you?

1114
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,320
I forget myself.

1115
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
My name is Snoochie.

1116
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,320
Please sit down.

1117
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,320
We can talk more.

1118
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,320
Okay.

1119
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,320
I do not wish to cause a commotion.

1120
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,320
All right, well, if you want to.

1121
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,320
Yeah, you guys sit down.

1122
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:29,320
He says, "It's good to see that you are all healing from your wounds.

1123
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,320
I was concerned. I have been tracking you for some time.

1124
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,320
I know that you are..."

1125
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:40,320
Do you have any Jell-O I can eat? I'm sorry, I'm just so hungry right now.

1126
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,320
"No, only that the cursed Jim has the Jell-O."

1127
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,320
Oh, right, I forgot about that detail in the story.

1128
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,320
"Yeah, it was just a very nice coincidence.

1129
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,720
I

1130
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,600
Have been tracking you for some time. I know you are searching for the n-word pass and

1131
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:02,040
He sort of looks around the train cars, he said nobody's kind of looking and he takes off his hood and

1132
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,800
His face is like inexplicably a Tamagotchi

1133
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:15,680
He puts his head like not like a Tamagotchi device

1134
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,120
Alright, stand back, I'm going to repair it.

1135
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:22,420
*laughter*

1136
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,180
*laughter*

1137
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:28,560
He looks like a Tamagotchi creature, not a Tamagotchi device.

1138
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,440
Oh, okay.

1139
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,360
He looks like one of the creatures.

1140
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,560
Never mind, I mixed up what I was seeing.

1141
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,560
I thought you were a device.

1142
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,560
*laughter*

1143
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,760
And, uh, so it's like his pic- it's like a pixelated face that's similar LCA screen, like digital watch screen.

1144
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,780
Like in inexplicably existing in real space

1145
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:52,360
And then he puts the hood back up. He says I am the last of my kind

1146
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,840
All of us have died out these

1147
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,640
He's of course just what happens the passage of time

1148
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,680
however, I

1149
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,540
Believe I have a chance to bring my people back or at least

1150
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,000
Maybe live out my days and not so much

1151
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,560
lonely destitution

1152
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:17,940
You see Tamagotchi sorry mortal. However, for some reason my brethren have died

1153
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,320
But the inward pass you

1154
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,920
This is a great concern for me as well. Yes, I

1155
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,020
Need to be fed. We all did I

1156
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,560
Can't hot dog

1157
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,500
You see him like ravenously like I'm gonna give him another hot dog

1158
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,520
I give another hot dog. Stop. You're going to make me grow

1159
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
No.

1160
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
(laughter)

1161
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:53,360
You see, the N-word pass holds a great power for the Tamagotchi people.

1162
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,120
It is not just some common artifact.

1163
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:00,140
I know your employer desires it, and I understand this.

1164
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,680
But I can help you get it.

1165
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:08,480
And if you will allow me to have it, I could perhaps give you a counterfeit one.

1166
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,160
Your employer will not know the difference, but please, for the sake of my people, and

1167
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,320
most importantly, you must keep it out of that Jim's hands.

1168
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,340
That is a man I can see as ill-intent.

1169
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,600
He works with the Crayola.

1170
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,200
The Crayola, they despise the Tamagotchi.

1171
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,240
They see us as fads, and them as eternal toys.

1172
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,240
As what?

1173
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,240
Fads.

1174
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,240
Don't you, motherfucker?

1175
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,240
Okay.

1176
01:10:33,240 --> 01:11:03,200
the

1177
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,520
I humbly request that you help me. I promise I

1178
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:14,740
Can I can make it right with your employer and whatever circumstances you'll need please as men of archaeology

1179
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:18,280
You must understand why this is important. I

1180
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Don't remember why we need to find this

1181
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:30,020
So we don't go to jail, oh right

1182
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,960
But we got a lot of money

1183
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:41,120
To get out of jail. Yeah, that's true - true. I'm kind of fine to go back to jail now

1184
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,020
Yeah, you know I kind of like it. I'll help you out snitchy-boochie

1185
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,560
I kind of liked it in there better if if jail is your problem

1186
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,940
I promise to help you escape it this time. I got you are noble people. We do not back down on deals

1187
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,960
Okay, it's a deal. All right. Well

1188
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:01,800
Thank you. Why do you need this pass? Wait? Can I do an insight check to see if he's telling? Yeah

1189
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:16,800
is

1190
