1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Woo! by the Beatles)

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(Woo! by the Beatles)

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That was such a weak fucking woo.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He said slate again? Slate it again!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
(No)

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh he said no.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He said no we're starting.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That was a weak woo. Woo again.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
(Woo!)

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's loud but it doesn't have energy behind it.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,560
It just it sounds like you're really tired. I am a little tired

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,000
Like that you know it has to have like some some punch hurting my fucking ears. Yeah, well you do one

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,520
I think I should scream as much

14
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,680
Rip this stitches out. Yeah, you think you can rip your stitches. I can feel them dissolving right now, which is a dissolving kind

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,440
Yeah, water soluble. They didn't just glue it now. I wish they glued my head clothes when I was a child

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,360
Yeah, that popped it over my head. Here you can actually see the scar now. Holy shit this one. Yeah, whoa

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,940
Yeah, I told you

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:12,340
Yeah, my brother threw that big Millennium Falcon at my head

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,240
And you went to the hospital for that. Yeah, I got to get had to get staples. Oh my god. They stapled a patch of

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,980
Something on in my head listen. This is because you had a you have had so many head injuries in your life

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,500
I think you're perfect for this conversation. Uh-huh. We were talking about on the way over here

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,180
And can't really kind of candy

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,140
Not best probably even worse probably even stupider than that. Yeah, what when so a whale? Oh, yeah

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,120
This is your question, yeah, so well, this is my yeah, well, this is it's just a fun story brain to decode

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,720
It's a thinker of like what you have to there. Okay. Well, it's just a thing I said, okay

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,360
Which is that when you think about it right so whales they're mammals right they have lungs they're not fishes

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,500
Which means that because of that because of how evolution works they they were fish first

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,900
Because everything was fish first, and then they came out on land, and they got lungs and then they were like nah

29
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,500
And then they went back now this sucks

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,260
Why do they didn't even have gills

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,220
We're way worse

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,700
We can't breathe this water but we want to be in here really bad.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,300
The whales literally were like, "Fuck this man, I'm going back in the fucking ocean."

34
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,300
I'm sitting in the water until I evolve to be in here.

35
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Yeah, that's right.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm going to sit in this water until these legs come off.

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm going to sit in the water and I'm going to die, and my son's going to die, and his

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
son's going to die.

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
We're going to keep dying until we figure this shit out.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
But in about 40,000 years, it's going to pay off.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
We're going to get a little hole on top.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,120
(laughing)

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,480
- We're just gonna keep fucking 'til someone gets a hole

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
in the top of their head.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
How fucking awful is that?

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,240
- I'm gonna fuck a whole new hole into my wife

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,120
so that she can breathe underwater.

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
- Dude, and then I was saying,

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
they probably, millions of years passed, right?

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
They probably feel so good 'cause humans are on land,

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,900
they're enslaving wolves, they're slaughtering cows.

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,240
All these mammals who stay on land,

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
the whales are like, get fucked.

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
You guys are getting owned.

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,480
And then the 1800s come around, Captain Ahab,

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
He's out there.

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,560
They almost extincted the whales.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,640
They never did that to cows.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,720
- Captain Ate Crap.

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Yeah, he's a piece of crap.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,800
- But also, whales had been getting their blubber

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
munched on for hundreds of years

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
on the north side of the world.

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,760
- That's true.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,580
- But that was just like a bad neighborhood.

66
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,420
- But that doesn't count.

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,240
- They were like, we gotta stay away from them.

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
- Which whale is it?

69
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,900
- It's just so funny, for millions of years,

70
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,040
they were like, yeah, that's right.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,000
We go underwater.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
You can't get us.

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,640
And then we came up with a sharp thing on a string.

74
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,480
- There's two whales that have been--

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
- That pretty much defeated them.

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,960
It's like a whale, it's...

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,080
Okay, there's one type of whale--

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
- This was important to interrupt with.

79
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,840
- You are remembering Avatar.

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
- There's a whale that hates orcas so much

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,560
that they will like purposefully get in front of them

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,080
when they're trying to eat seals.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,000
- Just to block 'em?

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,340
- Yeah, just to like, fuck you.

85
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,440
You fucking stupid. - Is that true?

86
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
What whale is it, which whale?

87
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,480
- I think it's, I don't know.

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
- Was it Moby Dick?

89
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
- I think it's sperm whales.

90
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,640
- That's the only whale I know.

91
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Come on, man. - And get, yeah, get this.

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,440
- Shut the fuck up. - They called the whole whale

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,600
a sperm.

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,400
- No, it was the stuff inside their head was a sperm.

95
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
They had sperm inside their brains.

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,880
- Can you not be a nerd for one second?

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,200
- It's called spermaceti.

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
- Can you take one fucking second?

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,280
By the way, spermaceti--

100
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,600
- Literally they named it that because it looked like sperm.

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
- That's what you were named. - Looked like sperm

102
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,680
and vermicelli.

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,520
- They killed a sperm whale and they cut open its head

104
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
and it was filled with sperm and they went,

105
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,280
"Whoa, this is a sperm whale!"

106
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,480
- And they ate it like spaghetti.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
- And that was-- - And it was spermaceti.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,560
- That's where the term thick ropes comes from.

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,200
Mm-hmm you busted and utter looks like spaghetti. Yeah, what yeah, but I have never had a nut that looked like fucking spaghetti

110
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah, well you didn't change your diet. Yeah, no

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
You eat spaghetti you you come spaghetti, I don't think so

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,200
I think so everyone saw I'll have an alarmingly big jizz and I'll go ah

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,520
Yeah, yeah

114
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,360
That's cuz that would probably would have been the one that had a that made a kid if I didn't shoot it inside of a fucking

115
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,600
some old underwear mm-hmm

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,500
With a sleeve of a shirt you ever do

117
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,640
Well, I don't want to do sleeve of shirt, I'm afraid what if it goes out the other sleeve it goes all over the wall

118
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,980
Yeah, or the ceiling okay fucking Superman. How powerful is your fucking come there's like goes into the other room

119
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,360
How fast does it come out again? It's like I think it's a hundred million miles per hour

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,280
At 60 miles an hour not my shit

121
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,480
There is some statistic or something or some fact that like like it's a manser's fact for sure

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,840
60 who did they measure?

123
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,600
60 it's maybe 50 Barry Bonds. I don't

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,680
Know don't search

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:56,080
This jizz of all time there we go you needed the of all time is there a world record okay fastest ejaculate is

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,680
42.7 miles per hour, okay, whoa

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Whoa

128
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,900
42.7 that is a way faster than I thought was even possible mine. Honestly is probably probably not even

129
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,480
Mine is like a candle melting yeah

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,120
But dude even even like like think about a car that's going well

131
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,940
Yeah, I that's what I would love if you could get a really fast one off

132
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,000
And you could cut you could prank a speed trial like a guy cop with a radar gun

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You stand really close to him and you come right in front of his radar and he starts chasing heels. Oh, yeah

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,560
Oh, no, mine looks like when you're like done with a slurpee and there's that little bit left. You got just pour it out

135
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,420
Yeah, that would but the cop pulls over your cum though. You just come what I was thinking

136
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,560
It's like maybe there's like an old lady driving by really slow you come in front of the gun

137
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,440
So he thinks the old lady's going like well for me, it'd be like

138
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,160
320 miles per hour you're going to jail for jizzing next to an old lady. I'm not that close

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,440
I'm close to the radar gun the road is far away

140
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm going to go in it if I'm going to tell for anything is for jizzing on a car the fact that you were even jizzing in

141
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,960
The vicinity of either way you're an old lady can be an old man. Why did you say okay?

142
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,480
There's a solution. There's a solution to this also this takes place in Saudi Arabia and the old lady gets arrested for driving

143
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Anyway, there's a solution to this but it involves forced perspective

144
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,380
Yeah, so what you do is you got to paint your penis up like a car Lamborghini

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Uh-huh. Again, mine not being a Lambo. Golf cart. Yeah. Golf cart, I don't know, sedan.

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,960
Yeah, Fiat. Camry. Yeah, none of those either. Yeah. Smart car. I don't know. Yeah, smart

147
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,360
car. I don't know. One of those red and yellow cars, you drive with your feet. Unicycle.

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,280
You're on the side of the highway, your penis is painted up like a bird

149
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,920
scooter. The exact shape of a bird scooter, L-shape. You have to, then you nut while the cop has a radar gun on you.

150
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:58,240
Uh-huh, and then that's how you that's how you yeah, and he's like oh my god that radio flyer wagon is going 70 miles an hour

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Who put this little tykes on the highway, but if you have a scooter shaped penis you're come shooting directly into the air

152
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,720
That's a good point

153
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
You know I would be worried about

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Not if okay not if the first part the L part the tall part of the L is flush

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Okay with your with your your thighs it goes down straight down

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,620
Like halfway to your knees. It's really long straight down. Who are you messaging?

157
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,360
Just he's messaging some

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,240
California

159
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,140
California will wallen and here is a crime to masturbate your own home

160
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:42,280
It can't be a crime to masturbate in your own home, and yes, how fast I need to pull this for it to be illegal

161
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:48,760
So you ask Stephanie on the engage live can you put this onto the onto the screen?

162
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,020
(laughing)

163
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,860
- This needs to be solved.

164
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,700
- I don't think he can.

165
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,520
(laughing)

166
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,360
- He can't.

167
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
- No, he can't.

168
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,020
- Oh.

169
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,860
- Yeah, is it, if somebody, okay.

170
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,860
- How fast do I need to come for it to be illegal?

171
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,300
- There's a dangerous speed.

172
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,700
There's a speed at which it's basically a gun.

173
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,860
- It is a, you're a menace to society.

174
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,540
- Well, it said, what was it, like 42 miles an hour?

175
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,780
That's like, that's as fast as like maybe--

176
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,620
- That's as fast as a bullet.

177
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,980
- Yeah, like a pitching machine.

178
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
- Search fastest--

179
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,520
- Like a really bad pitching machine,

180
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,360
but a pitching machine, no less.

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,920
- Search how fast is a bullet.

182
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,120
- A bullet, if I had to guess,

183
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,840
is about 40 to 45 miles an hour.

184
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,760
- In MP, yes.

185
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,840
How fast is a bullet?

186
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,800
- 20,000-- - 1800 miles per hour.

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,720
- I was pretty close.

188
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,880
- Yeah, you were very close.

189
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
- Yeah.

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,640
- Yeah, still 1800 miles per hour.

191
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
- So how many, just do the math.

192
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,400
How many wads do you have to shoot for it to be,

193
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,320
if you're that guy?

194
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,840
- 1800 for it to be-- - I guess.

195
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,960
- Yeah. (laughs)

196
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,240
Yeah, I guess for me, yeah, about 1800.

197
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,640
I guess the closest example is maybe like that dart shotgun we have over there.

198
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,200
Wouldn't that hurt if you were a girl and a 40 mile per hour...

199
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah, you'd go, you'd fly backwards.

200
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Yeah, like in Evil Dead 2.

201
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah, it'd be like cable work, you'd get pulled against the wall.

202
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah, it'd be like the beginning of fucking Back to the Future.

203
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,760
You'd just be fucking shooting directly at a wall.

204
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Like a Jackie Chan movie.

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Ejaculate-y Chan.

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Ejaculate-chan? There we go.

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,260
- Ejaculete. - Ejaculete.

208
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,200
- Why didn't you just say ejaculate, Chan?

209
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Why'd you--

210
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
- 'Cause there's an E at the end of the name.

211
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
- Ejaculete. - Ejaculete, Chan.

212
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,520
- Ejaculete.

213
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
- Ejaculete.

214
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,640
- Did you ever arrive on an answer on if it's illegal

215
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,840
to come in your own home if you live in a completely

216
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
glass house with a bunch of big arrows

217
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
that point directly to it?

218
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,440
(laughing)

219
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
- Yeah, 'cause you know people are getting right up

220
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,960
to the edge of the law.

221
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,920
They're doing it with the door open,

222
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,000
They're standing facing outside.

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
- This is a building in that place Storm King,

224
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,160
is the Jismin's Hut.

225
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,200
- Well you used to live next to a school.

226
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
- Yeah.

227
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,840
- And your room faced the school.

228
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,240
- So not just my room, it was also my roommate's room.

229
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,640
- No, it was your room and you picked the room also

230
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
when you got to the apartment.

231
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,680
- I picked the room because I would get the cheapest rent

232
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,120
because I wouldn't have a balcony.

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,440
- Yeah, but the balcony.

234
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,320
- And it was kind of a, yeah, it was like cheapest rent

235
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,360
and also some upsides.

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
- No.

237
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,180
were there doing rear window, would you ever, like every time you masturbated you had to

238
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,540
make sure that every window was closed.

239
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,960
My bed was away from the wall.

240
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
So you didn't close the windows.

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,080
So you left the shades open.

242
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,720
No, the curtains in that room were always closed.

243
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
He just said he had clurtons.

244
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
He did.

245
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
He admitted he had clurtons.

246
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Closed curtains.

247
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Closed curtains.

248
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Clurtons are clear curtains.

249
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
I had to shower.

250
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I had to shower.

251
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,640
He just said he had clurtons.

252
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Clear curtains.

253
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,920
So yeah, his bed was away from the window, but there was also his entire wall.

254
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,640
Yeah, but where was your penis?

255
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
His entire wall facing the window was a mirror.

256
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Oh, my penis was on a magnifying glass.

257
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,140
(laughter)

258
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,140
My penis was on a magnifying glass being projected into the sky.

259
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,140
He lived in like a hall of mirrors where it's a bunch of angled mirrors,

260
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,640
so if you look in the window, just the entire, there's just a hundred images of him jacking up.

261
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,140
It looks like, in the reflection of a spider's eye.

262
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
It's like a fly's eye.

263
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,640
Yeah.

264
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Scary.

265
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,140
Yeah, a fly.

266
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,640
I said spider.

267
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,140
Yeah, he lived in the kaleidoscope building, too.

268
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,640
Really?

269
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,440
That's why the windows look like it's an expensive place to live yeah

270
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,140
But did you ever get nervous that maybe like a little kid would I was nervous that like I would forget to shut the blinds

271
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,980
After I'd get out of the shower because that just ruins a kid's life especially like you were a magic Harry

272
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,560
Bye, yeah, I know that would ruin a kid's life. Oh, yeah

273
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,400
I mean I got like I think I saw the light version of that like all the time like all the fucking Quebec

274
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Wah people at Hampton Beach all these like fat old guys who look exactly like I do now mm-hmm in speedos walking around

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,900
I mean there is only there's a thin piece of fabric between yeah seeing his whole stick and berries. That's not right

276
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,680
It's not right to be like that. It's not right to be extremely European in America

277
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,760
I hate Europe, and I want to see it fucking destroyed. Yeah, there's no doubt. There's no reason for a European style bathing suit

278
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm a little bit interested in going to a nudist beach though. Yeah, and being as long as it's girls only yeah

279
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,240
Except for me. Yeah, I go as long as I'm completely alone. Yep, you go alone. Yeah completely alone. You guys walk around the house naked

280
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,480
depends underwear

281
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,400
Yeah, I do. I have but the yeah the thing is that I mean I have I have a street-level apartment

282
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,120
So I feel like even if my curtain is even a little crack open that I don't realize that's trouble. Yeah, yeah somebody

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,840
Yeah, my roommate had a like a girl over one time

284
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,120
and I didn't know and I was just fully just in my underwear in the living room.

285
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,840
Oh okay I thought you're gonna say fully nude. Yeah underwear is okay. If you're at

286
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,620
somebody's house it's fine to see their roommate in their underwear. Yeah I guess

287
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,840
that's true it's just you like in from your perspective you're just like

288
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,600
shit I just like there's like a level of like. No you're like I might fuck. I guess.

289
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,480
I might fucking get laid. Yeah yeah I just I'm glad I don't have an in-unit dryer.

290
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,460
Yeah, you know that she's into people who are in live at that apartment. That's true

291
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:11,360
Yeah, so then you're like yeah, I live here too. Yeah, here's my nuts in my ass check this out. It's a dumbbell

292
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:21,520
Yeah the worst curling yeah, she walks in the dumbbells on your stomach you're trapped under it you're going

293
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm trying to impress you

294
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,120
- Arched back up, like the dumbbells on the back.

295
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,960
You're like, "Ahh!"

296
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,920
- "Help, help, I can't get up!"

297
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,760
- Pink underwear on.

298
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,920
- And then she's like, just anxious

299
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
that it's gonna roll off of you.

300
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,400
You go, "No, it'll clunk."

301
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
(laughing)

302
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,640
- It'll fall through the floor.

303
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,280
- "It's gonna clunk."

304
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,280
- My downstairs neighbors are already so fucking mad at me.

305
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
They can't clunk.

306
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,680
- "You gotta pick me up.

307
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,160
"You have to pick me up from underneath this."

308
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,760
- Or at least build a ramp for the dumbbell to roll down.

309
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,600
- "Please."

310
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,840
(laughing)

311
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,840
It's pretty hard to seduce women.

312
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Yeah, I discovered a new Riz strategy.

313
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Really?

314
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Oh yeah.

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Do you have Riz?

316
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
We talked about this on stream last night.

317
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I have a few Riz strategies.

318
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
What's your Riz?

319
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Well, okay, first of all, I'll tell you my first Riz strategy.

320
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Okay.

321
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
It's just you walk up to a girl, you say, "Hey girl, check my Riz."

322
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
And you say, "Hey, what's up?"

323
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Damn.

324
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Or you say, a reverse direction, you go up, you say, "Hey, what's up girl?

325
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
That's my Riz, y'all."

326
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
That's W Riz.

327
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Yeah.

328
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
That's W S Riz.

329
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,440
This is the real Riz secret.

330
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,940
Okay.

331
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,240
Okay, that this one, this one you can't steal because this is

332
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,540

333
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,340
This is the year of, wait for it, the bell hop.

334
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,240
What's the bell hop?

335
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,640
You dress up like a bell hop.

336
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,840
And say, may I take your bags to your room, ma'am?

337
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,640
You hang out at a-

And you take them to your room.

339
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,740
And you have the hat.

year of bill hopper

357
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,900
That guy has a 60 miles per hour cum shot.

358
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, for show.

359
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,400
Yeah.

360
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,980
But I think I'm going to get that complete outfit soon.

361
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,340
We were saying last night--

362
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,340
How pissed are you if you're the fucking Guinness World Record

363
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,860
person and they call you out to measure a guy's cum shot?

364
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,580
There's so many--

365
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,420
I mean, there's a radar gun.

366
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,020
I'm thinking about it.

367
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,660
There's so many sexual-- yeah, but somebody

368
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,620
has to be there to verify it.

369
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,960
There's so many sexual things for like Guinness Book

370
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,740
of World Records and stuff, like the biggest orgy and shit.

371
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
They have one guy and his name is Peter the Perv,

372
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,220
and he's really fat and he has a comb over

373
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,100
and he comes down and he does the breathing thing

374
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,000
where he's like.

375
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,860
- They get fax machines all day.

376
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,060
- He has waking sleep apnea.

377
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,100
- Yeah, I was gonna say he has a wake apnea.

378
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,580
- Another one on the line for Peter.

379
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,900
Peter, you go tackle this one.

380
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,620
We'll wait for a fishing thing.

381
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,460
- Yeah.

382
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,700
(grunting)

383
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,540
- He can't talk.

384
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,660
- He pretends he hates it too.

385
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,500
- Yeah.

386
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,620
(grunting)

387
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,480
- Peter, listen, I know you're not one for sex stuff

388
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,300
but you gotta go measure a guy's cum shot.

389
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,180
claims it's 45 miles per hour. And he's doing the thing, he's measuring it with,

390
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,540
he's holding his finger like this and he's just timing it with his eyes, seeing how

391
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,420
long does it take to go from my thumb to my index finger. They call me the human

392
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,340
radar. And he gets going, can you go again? Try it again. I missed that one. You're gonna have to

393
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,700
wait like 20 minutes man. That's the thing, if it was, my fastest cum shot would

394
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,300
probably be my first one ever, because I've only gotten slower since then. Yeah, because it's

395
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,060
been building up. Yeah, so maybe when I was like a baby, I probably had a really

396
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,900
fast come yeah yeah yeah that's probably why you had to wear a diaper yeah it's

397
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,380
true yeah I wore steel diaper my entire life

398
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,620
completely steel you're saying last night about the bellhop thing though it's not

399
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,860
like impersonating any other I guess I guess Bell impersonating a bellhop is

400
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,700
the same amount of bad as impersonating a cop I feel like yeah and you get in

401
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,500
trouble well yeah because you will you wouldn't cuz normally I mean I think

402
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,020
I think it's fine to go into any business and pretend you work there and help people out.

403
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,380
I think that's, you can't get in trouble if you go into say, a Target, you're wearing a

404
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Target outfit and you go, "Okay, here's..."

405
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
But if you're tricking a woman and having sex with you...

406
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,260
Well, okay, that's not what a bellhop does, okay?

407
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,260
That's bringing disrepute to the profession.

408
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
That's not what we mean.

409
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
That's not what we mean.

410
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,580
But if I go, for example, because I was thinking I would really like to dress up as a bellhop

411
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,260
and go into a hotel and just be a bellhop for the day.

412
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Yeah.

413
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Just for an hour.

414
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,340
But that's a profession where you're picking up people's bags and you're going to people's

415
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,340
rooms.

416
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,380
So I think you could maybe get in big trouble for that.

417
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,220
What do you think? No. I don't think you'd get into that much trouble. No, because there's

418
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:57,580
an element of serial killer vibes to it. It's like, "Oh yeah, this guy was pretending to

419
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
be a bellhop so he could follow people to their room and kill them." I just think people

420
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,260
would be scared I was going to take their iPad. Yeah. Well, that's worse than a serial

421
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,740
killer. In today's day and age. Yeah. Well, usually their heaviest bag is the one with

422
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,780
the most crap in it. Yeah. But you could sling that bag over your back. But don't they walk

423
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,100
up with you if you're the bellhop?

424
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,380
Sometimes. Sometimes not. Sometimes you just go straight up and they just bring your stuff

425
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
up and leave it there.

426
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,820
That's a pretty profitable impersonation. You're going to make more money doing that

427
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,820
on a day.

428
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,460
I'm not going to make any money. I do it for the love of the game.

429
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,020
And if you're a cop. Because what's the point of having, if you pretend to be a cop

430
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,540
for a day, which people do that, people pretend to be cops and they pull people over and shit.

431
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,140
Are you trying to just convince somebody to bribe you or something, like instantly?

432
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I guess.

433
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Because you can't really write a ticket.

434
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh my god, yeah, because then people think you're being a bellhop for the tips.

435
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,060
can pretend to write a ticket though that's really easy you just write it

436
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,020
down but you have to be on that official paper yeah that's true you can't print

437
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,620
that out yeah shit and I don't have a printer in my car yeah computer but I

438
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:02,420
don't even have a car it's easy it's easy you just you get you get a ticket

439
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,180
so you have to get a ticket okay oh and then yeah oh yeah I see where you're

440
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,380
going I was gonna say whiteout what do you

441
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,260
have a where you have an what do you have a stupid name yeah well I say why don't

442
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,140
you write out your name Bob Featherbottom yeah why'd you say my uncle's name what

443
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,260
if you're Bob Featherbottom and they're like my name isn't Bob Featherbottom

444
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,740
and you say no that's my name like a officer Featherbottom or you say no it's

445
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,980
like a John Hancock thing yeah it's the name of the person who really had

446
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,220
John's this year yeah it's like wouldn't like the elevator inspector we'd have a

447
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,140
very different world if instead of John Bob Featherbottom

448
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,580
Yeah

449
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,420
And John Hancock John I didn't go to a morgue and seeing all those fucking feather bottoms in there

450
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,980
That it wasn't John Doe. They've all they would all be laughing all the time. Yeah, the coroners great

451
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,220
They'd be corners already have six senses of humor. They eat sandwiches next to the body from what I know about them

452
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,180
Yeah, they love eating sandwiches over the body. Oh my god. Are you kidding me? They're eating and you know what sandwiches

453
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:06,680
They're eating double roast beef. It's always no cheese and with the one job. I couldn't do I could do I get the one job

454
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,700
I think I do I honestly think I could probably do every other job, but I couldn't do that. It's too too crazy

455
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, cuz what if some guy comes in and he's?

456
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,200
blasted to bits

457
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:30,360
No, just like imagine you're a coroner right and then the funniest body comes in you can't even take a picture of it

458
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,440
Yeah, that's the other thing yeah

459
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,200
Yeah. Well, no, I think being a coroner would be fun because nobody else wants to look at

460
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,400
the body. So you can say whatever into that tape recorder. Yeah. It'd be like, "Subject

461
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:57,800
had a tiny crotch area." True. And then the penis. "And his head's gone and a butt crack!"

462
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,240
It's like that guy, remember that guy who dressed up like he pretended to be a gynecologist

463
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,820
Yeah, I like that for a for a corner, but it's going and say everybody had

464
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,080
70 years in jail

465
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,620
Yeah, they don't play with that. They don't play with that. Oh, yeah, that's worse than a bellhop

466
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,540
impersonation on one hand the biggest form of flattery on the other hand one of the worst crimes to commit

467
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,920
I don't give a fuck one on once. I'm dead just let somebody fuck my body you said that before I think that's fine

468
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,040
Yeah, like if it stops people from fucking real bodies, then they can fuck mine

469
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah

470
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,280
In that way and science is the name of I don't my donate my body to my neighbor

471
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,620
Yeah, really. Yeah, what do you think? I'll do with it probably throw it away, but you have to try

472
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,760
I want to get my dead body one last act. Yeah

473
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
You want to do what be a lit-ass statue? Oh a statue?

474
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,780
No, but not as I just want to get it dipped in bronze to just and then get turned into a fucking

475
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,680
Bar of bronze I want to be it's not even body shape. Yeah, I'm done exactly like that monk

476
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,800
I want to be turned into the Buddha. Yeah

477
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,960
Yeah, I'm gonna be turning into a statue of the Buddha and then they'll find me in many many years

478
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,120
It'd be cool if they used my skeleton to

479
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,040
Scare a dog. No just like eat a dog

480
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,440
Like turn my head into like a mug my skull. Oh, you'd be a bloody brilliant mug be more of a tankard

481
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,760
Yeah, yeah, let's go. You have a form of a flag in I think

482
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,160
You'd be a propane tank

483
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:44,020
Click click click on the tree. Yeah, my my skull is the propane tank at the goth grill

484
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,560
Yeah, it's just like just a big tube coming out of my skull. Mm-hmm

485
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:58,600
donating my skeleton to the inevitable reboot of fear factor and what's going to happen is

486
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,480
they're eating something gross, they're eating bug eyeballs with poop sauce or whatever, Joe

487
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,440
Rogan is going to be Joe Rogan again, is making them do and then right as they finish the challenge

488
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,520
Joe Rogan's like alright well looks like everybody finished the challenge then a door's going to fly

489
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,920
open, my skeleton's going to fly out and grab them and they're going to go ah and it doesn't even

490
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,400
affect anything. It just happens in one episode. I want to be a soccer ball in Brazil.

491
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,240
Dude, that's so crazy that they like that video where they're like playing with

492
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,280
soccer with the beheaded guy. I don't know that. I don't know it either. Maybe it's a movie I saw.

493
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,840
That is, you're literally thinking of apocalypto. Yeah, they used to do that in like lion times.

494
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,120
Dude, that's so crazy that that's what Brazil is like all the time. There's two things down there

495
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,520
that I know about. They had a sport, but they didn't actually play with the head.

496
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,280
You don't know that, you weren't around back then.

497
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,880
You are right.

498
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,920
Didn't they say it was like, they also said that was true for lacrosse.

499
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,560
They said that like they would play lacrosse with people's skulls.

500
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,200
Or that's what the lax kids at my school would say.

501
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,120
Crackers in high school playing fucking lacrosse with people's heads?

502
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,360
They were saying that it was an ancient Mayan...

503
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,480
The fuck are you talking about?

504
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,200
They would say like, yeah, lacrosse is like, they used to like play it with people's skulls.

505
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
The sport they did actually is to play with human heads was field hockey.

506
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,280
That's what it fucking was.

507
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,840
Yep, hungry hungry hippo. Yeah, the original game the original with the real one

508
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,800
It was based on when they had real and real hip that happened one time

509
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,720
It was so you know it's so fucked up what what they they go like well

510
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,320
I don't care if it's true now where they go like you know hippos are actually the most dangerous

511
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,920
Animal they actually kill more people than sharks. Yeah, like shut the fuck up. That's a it's a fat hippo

512
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Yeah, if you're a white ball

513
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,080
If you're a white ball, they're dangerous you're a watermelon yeah

514
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,840
Humans oh yeah, who took this survey that took this fucking survey that's like all these white ball

515
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
Yeah, five or six white balls

516
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,440
Such a fucked up animal to be the most dangerous

517
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,760
Yeah, I agree cuz also that's the bad way to go. They don't even have they don't have anything they just

518
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,840
Does their fat guys that sit in the water yeah, they're trying to be whales yeah, they do trying to be

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,720
Well, I do move in fucking silence you ever seen those videos of them. Just like floating through the water. Yeah

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,360
They're basically alligators. Yeah, like a piece of shit floating

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,220
Your shit's gray. Yeah, you have giant shits. Yeah giant gray giant gray shit with watermelons

522
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Yeah, yeah

523
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:31,080
Look I drink half a bottle of pepto every morning so that I don't get stomach quakes

524
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,520
You have a pure black right angle shit. Yeah a fucking log

527
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,540
Yeah

528
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,020
They are they're shaving my poop down and they're turning it into like the like there's an Etsy store that sells all my poop

529
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,240
And they mold it into skulls and stuff with like a Dremel. It's pretty cool

530
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm imagining now you bring you you make it you take your poop

531
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,500
Mm-hmm you make my business poop you put it on a you put it in a ring like a gemstone

532
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,720
And you take it to an appraiser, you say, please appraise this.

533
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,680
Well, the ring is worth maybe $10.

534
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,960
The gemstone is poop.

535
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,360
It's not worth anything.

536
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
I don't know about that thing.

537
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,280
Poop is funny pretty much every--

538
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,400
I mean, every variation of bringing any kind of poop

539
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,120
into somebody's--

540
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,040
Well, this is poop.

541
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,540
Yeah.

542
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,320
You know what I saw?

543
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
Bringing in a pond star?

544
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,520
It's the jeweler's loop.

545
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,940
You know what I saw the other day?

546
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,760
There's a website.

547
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,960
It was on a Facebook Marketplace ad

548
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
or you can sell--

549
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,840

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,680

554
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,880

555
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,120

It's not real poop. Oh, it is. Oh, okay.

570
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,160
Soft and stinky patty of poop.

571
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,760
It's animal poop that you send to people.

572
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Well, let's keep scrolling. Let's see what kinds they have.

573
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,960
Yeah, okay. Gorilla poop.

574
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,080
That's got to be a hard hit.

575
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,800
Ooh, the combo pack. I don't want the combo pack.

576
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,920
That's a good deal, though.

577
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
The family pack.

578
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,520
The ad is literally a photo of a man's hand.

579
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
No paper trail.

580
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,160
Wait, go up. Go up a little bit.

581
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,040
So it says under it says soft and stinky patty of poo serving up the zookeepers finest

582
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,240
That's elephant crap gorilla poop is now we're getting really gross and the combo pack is all three in one big nasty mess. Yeah

583
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,540
The mega pack you've been pooped on want to know by whom over what does that mean?

584
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:01,220
They don't you don't really you don't get this kind of website that often anymore like this and then the glitter one. Yeah. Yeah

585
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,500
Yeah, I think that um wait top ten reason there's a list here. We got to read it top ten reasons to send someone poop

586
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,400
Oh, okay number one for your ex number two neighbors pet crapping on your lawn, okay?

587
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,740
Especially if it's a gorilla for you

588
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,540
I know

589
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:22,900
Hey, my name is elephant for a salesperson or mechanic that ripped you off five a last-minute gift for someone who has everything a

590
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:30,340
Gag true. I guess this is the perfect gift for somebody who has it all for that rich gloating friend knock them down a peg

591
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,100
Like, yeah, that's a good point. If you sent this to Scrooge, right?

592
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,600
Yeah.

593
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Those are Scrooge.

594
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,100
Yeah.

595
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,140
He'd open it and go, "Oh, God, I've seen the error of my ways."

596
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:40,640
Yeah.

597
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,820
I don't even think it would be an error of your ways thing. I think if you sell this right, like, it's like...

598
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,320
Well...

599
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,520
If the person who... Okay, imagine this. Scrooge is the person in this example.

600
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,020
Yeah.

601
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,160
Where he has it all.

602
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,900
He... And...

603
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,740
So, yeah, he doesn't have animal poop.

604
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,200
Yeah, I think Scrooge is so...

605
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Well, yeah, I guess if he has it all...

606
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,680
- Scrooge is so damn greedy, he's gonna open,

607
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,160
he's opening the package, he's like,

608
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,320
oh I hope this is a gold coin,

609
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm gonna put it in my room of gold coins,

610
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,880
and then he sees it and he's like,

611
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,440
oh it's gorilla poop, I'll just put this

612
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,880
in my room of poops.

613
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,720
My poop collection.

614
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,280
- But you'd have to get the combo pack.

615
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,400
- He's so greedy, he just wants it all.

616
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
- You would specifically have to get the combo pack

617
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,320
because it's like, oh, I have all of these poops

618
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,560
in individual jars.

619
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,680
- He wants the box set.

620
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,520
- I think you guys are missing a point.

621
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,440
- Here's all of the poops mashed together.

622
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,160
- Scrooge would want poop.

623
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,000
- That's all we're saying.

624
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,660
- No, Scrooge would open it and he'd say,

625
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,500
"Oh my bloody stars."

626
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,220
- Then at least we can agree that at least,

627
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,060
- "Oh my stars, I've been rude."

628
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,780
- Maybe we can agree that at the beginning of the story,

629
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,740
he wouldn't want the poop,

630
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,460
but after he's been changed by the ghost,

631
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,140
he might want it because he's realized

632
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,300
he doesn't like gold or nice things anymore.

633
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,140
- He'd say, "I guess I'll get it."

634
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,980
- He'll say, "I'll take this poop

635
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,940
"so nobody else has to have it."

636
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
- He's not a trash can.

637
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,140
- He's nice though.

638
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,860
He learns about tiny Tims.

639
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,660
I guess Scrooge, they don't talk about epilogue Scrooge at all.

640
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,720
Where it's like, yeah, he's a completely nice guy after, and he takes everyone's shit.

641
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,620
You imagine how easy it would be to walk all over Scrooge after Christmas day?

642
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Yeah.

643
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
I would be abusing that.

644
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Oh, I'd beat the fuck...

645
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,620
I'd be abusing that old man.

646
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Dude, I'd be...

647
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,940
I'd be going Stan Lee on his ass.

648
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,860
Yeah, I'd be making him like, give me like doubloons and shit.

649
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I don't know what shillings...

650
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I'd make him give me doubloons.

651
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
Yeah.

652
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,940
I've make him give me a computer so I can play the balloons game

653
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,200
Addicting games you get calm you get Scrooge after he sees all those ghosts, right?

654
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,820
You just ask him like every single day like can I have five dollars put that into savings?

655
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:45,100
Uh-huh your Scrooge account screw dollars every day. That's gonna compound. I just paint my ass blue and fucking ask for his whole house

656
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,900
Yeah, whoo. I'm the ghost of your

657
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
Blue

658
00:31:51,100 --> 00:32:02,980
Yeah, the ghost of blueness present ghosts are blue yeah, I would I would be like I would become me

659
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,140
I would disguise myself as a ghost of tiny Tim

660
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,540
And I'd be like whoo I died because you turned nice and I make him turn back. Oh, that's a good point

661
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,600
Yeah, ruin it and then the three ghosts would get pissed off. Yeah there

662
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,080
- Yeah, I guess there would have to be a ghost

663
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,120
that would say, the ghost of keeping a level head.

664
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,960
- Yeah.

665
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,520
- I'm the ghost of keeping it real.

666
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,840
- I would be so pissed off if I was Scrooge.

667
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,240
- Definitely a ghost nowadays.

668
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
- I got through the three Christmas ghosts

669
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,800
and I was like, thank God, I'm nice now, everything's fine.

670
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,240
And then I hear a knock on my door

671
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,120
and it's the ghost of New Year past.

672
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,960
- Yeah.

673
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,780
- It's like, seriously?

674
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,620
- Yeah.

675
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,460
- There's still gonna be three more of these?

676
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,280
- Yeah, well.

677
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,120
- And the ghost of Valentine's Day after that.

678
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,580
- You need to throw a rocking party, Mr. Scrooge.

679
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Okay.

680
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Alright.

681
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
The ghost of New Year's future would be like,

682
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
"It's going to be the year 2000."

683
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
And that's all he would say.

684
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
And the glasses will go like this.

685
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
We will have the best glasses.

686
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Miley Cyrus will have her beach party on New Year's Eve.

687
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
And there will be years where the glasses don't make very much sense

688
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
because they have ones in them.

689
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
Kenan Thompson.

690
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
It's gonna be scary.

691
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,880
Scary. I'm the ghost of the Super Bowl future.

692
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,280
It's the ghost of Don Pardo.

693
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Oh!

694
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,480
That's epilogue screw, just every single day there's a new set of ghosts.

695
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah.

696
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,980
Yeah, the ones that are, yeah, I'm the ghost of January 8th.

697
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,580
What happens on January 8th? It's two days after January 6th.

698
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
I, I...

699
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
The country needs to heal.

700
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:41,080
He's gonna be, the thing is, it's all, every single like day,

701
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,380
He's gonna be like oh, I fucking he always has a start with him being like I fucking hate

702
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:54,440
And he's like I fucking hate for the July this sucks, and then anytime he doesn't like a holiday BAM three

703
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,500
Yeah, sure out of the cut. Yeah, say I'm the ghost of

704
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,240
Martin Luther King jr. Day

705
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,840
future

706
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,600
Wouldn't it wouldn't it just be Martin Luther King though

707
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,200
three. The Christmas ghosts aren't just Santa. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, but the Christmas

708
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,480
ghosts are just... The ghosts are gonna play the Raptors today in an overtime thriller.

709
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,200
I'm the ghost of your birthday past. He's like, I already like my birthday. You don't need to...

710
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,520
Okay, I'll tell the other two guys not to come. The other two guys are coming with your present.

711
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,320
Yeah, but I saw the four hour shift, so I have to stay.

712
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,960
The ghost of your birthday future is like, "Next year you're gonna get a gift card!"

713
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,200
It's like, "I don't want to know that."

714
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,400
And it sucks!

715
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,640
That would suck if the ghost of birthday future is just telling you like,

716
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,920
"Next year your friends are going to be too busy!"

717
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,400
That would be scary.

718
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,240
"You're gonna have to plan to have it on the weekend instead!"

719
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,340
Damn.

720
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,320
That's sad. When you don't get to have it on your actual birthday,

721
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,680
and you actually have to fucking have it on the Saturday or the Sunday, the Lord's Day.

722
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
You just killed the vibe.

723
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
You killed the fucking vibe.

724
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,680
Well, guess who this happened to last year?

725
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Who?

726
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Motherfucking you.

727
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Mm-hmm.

728
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Nobody you know has a job.

729
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Why do you need that?

730
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
You guys weren't in town.

731
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Oh, yeah.

732
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
That's true.

733
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
No one was in town.

734
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Yeah.

735
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
And then I tried to-

736
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I missed your birthday two years in a row.

737
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Yeah.

738
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Yeah.

739
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Then I tried to-

740
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
And I'm going to miss it again.

741
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,440
We tried to go to a bar, and then we went into the building, and the whole- I was like, "Oh,

742
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,840
Yeah, it'll be nice. There's like a little back like patio. You can go all go hang out there

743
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,180
Hold back patio whole bar shut down wedding reception

744
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:47,300
Just go to whatever bar I did, but I was like shit. I told all these people if I can go here

745
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,960
Yeah, they had to text everybody individually and just say like you strike me as the type that would have a lit-ass birthday party sex

746
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,640
with fucking drugs and

747
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,000
Birthday

748
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,080
Dave and Buster's I would love I would go to them, but I've been in a long time

749
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,240
I do want to go to Dave and Buster's I do want to do something for my birthday this year because I am losing my health

750
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,040
Insurance, yeah, you should start planning now. I want to do a stunts birthday because I'm losing my health insurance

751
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,880
But that's the day no do it because that's the two days before

752
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm having my birthday two days before finna get hurt. Uh-huh July 21st. I'm gonna be jumping off

753
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,120
How does that work if you lose your health insurance halfway through a hospital stay like if you break your neck and no no two days

754
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,240
before yeah I know but okay three days before but if you go into the hospital I

755
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,400
do like your neck no I then you lose your health insurance on the fourth day

756
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,840
they're gonna pull the plug on you no yeah no no no I'm getting like I'm gonna

757
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,560
break all my bones dumbass wait is can you do that to get over the health it

758
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,600
because they have to probably cover you for your stay if you go in before you

759
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,800
lose your insurance yeah so could you do like Tom Hanks the terminal and just

760
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,160
spend the rest of your life in the hospital because you've been like

761
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,480
Admitted once and then you have insurance forever. Maybe there's a grandfather clause for insurance. Yeah, there is a good idea

762
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,520
I cause and he's old. Yeah, he's old as hell. Mm-hmm, and he lives in the South Pole. Mm-hmm for real

763
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,640
Yeah, I think you think he does Christmas stuff. No, he just does he just gives people like pretty shitty deductibles

764
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,000
He just tells people they're at the wrong pole when they pull up. Mm-hmm

765
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,520
When they pull up yeah at the South Pole at the pole, why is the South Pole so uninteresting to me

766
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,880
What are you talking about? They have all these cool jeans and sweatshirts.

767
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,400
Which one's on land and which one's in water? Is the North Pole in the water and the South Pole is on land?

768
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Do I look like a genius?

769
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,960
North Pole is on land because where would Santa's workshop be?

770
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
No, I think the South Pole...

771
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I think that... well, I just distinctly remember... you know, I think the North Pole is in the water because I remember being a kid and looking at a globe and being like...

772
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,000
No.

773
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,500
Yeah.

774
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,000
No.

775
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,500
Where is it?

776
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,000
No.

777
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
No, I think the South Pole is...

778
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
There has to be an island.

779
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,340
That's because Antarctica is ginormous.

780
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,180
You can even see it from the back.

781
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,540
- Look at this picture of the North Pole.

782
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,740
- Oh, there it is. - Oh, crap.

783
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,580
Yeah, it doesn't look all that much

784
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,020
like there's land there.

785
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,860
- Huh.

786
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,420
- The Arctic Circle. - Then where the fuck

787
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,660
is Santa?

788
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,260
- He has an underwater base, like in a movie.

789
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,500
- Santa is an Atlantean.

790
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Santalantean.

791
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,740
- Santalantean.

792
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,420
- This, wait, the North Pole looks like fucking shit.

793
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
- Yeah.

794
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,420
- This is the North Pole, bro? - This looks like a fucking

795
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,820
blue water.

796
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,060
- This is Santa Claus's whole hood?

797
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,100
- I guess.

798
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
That looks terrible, man.

799
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,740
Yeah, it looks boring.

800
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,300
Yeah.

801
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,100
At least.

802
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,460
They don't even show fucking Google Maps.

803
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,260
They don't even show boobs on Google Maps.

804
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,740
Google Maps is fucking up, not even putting a little tiny--

805
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,540
just a little blip that you can click on,

806
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,380
and then it's a 3D like--

807
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,660
oh my god, that is a perfect idea.

808
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,940
You click on the North Pole, click on Street View,

809
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
and then you can just see Santa's workshop.

810
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,460
I bet that they should do that.

811
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
I think they probably do.

812
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,620
Do that for the Christmas season.

813
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,420
Yeah, that would be a good thing for the Christmas season.

814
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,580
- They should do that for all the holidays.

815
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,180
- Yeah, like 4th of July town?

816
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,940
- Yeah, 4th of July town at the North Pole.

817
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,980
- Oh, that's a good idea.

818
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,380
- They should just all be at the North Pole.

819
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,060
- Bastille Dayville.

820
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,900
- Yeah.

821
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,460
- What's the point of it, Bastille Day?

822
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,620
- French independence.

823
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,260
- I wish that never happened.

824
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
- Yeah. - Yeah, it is.

825
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,980
- I wish that the French would be in--

826
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,820
- I wish they were dependent on me.

827
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,640
- Yeah, that's right.

828
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,480
- I wish I was their king.

829
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,300
- Because I would let them all starve.

830
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,100
- They all wear them damn pins over there.

831
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,940
- I think-- - Stank.

832
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,740
I've been thinking recently that actually France

833
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,220
would probably be, of all cultures in the world,

834
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,580
the one I would fit in with the most.

835
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,420
- Yeah.

836
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,540
- Tiny mustache, very rude, fuck you.

837
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,380
- Yeah.

838
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,140
- And I like to smoke cigarettes.

839
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,980
- That's true.

840
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,800
- And drink all day.

841
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,380
- I think, yeah, I think all you need to do

842
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,860
is just wear the most heinous track jacket in the world.

843
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,940
- Fuck you.

844
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,700
- I think I'd probably fit in with the high elves,

845
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,700
'cause I'm proper.

846
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,540
- I would do so well.

847
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,220
- You would not fit in with the high elves.

848
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,460
You'd be way too short.

849
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,300
- I'm elegant.

850
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,540
I could just go to Canada and I feel like I'd fit in you think you'd fit in in Canada

851
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:01,260
Yeah, someone told me that I am I'm a quintessential Montreal guy

852
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,780
What yeah, who told you that Michael?

853
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,340
Who Michael Hirsch?

854
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
Michael Hirsch fuck him

855
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,660
fucking idiot

856
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,060
Quintessentially, I don't know I trust him. I don't trust him. I would fit in in space. He wears rings

857
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,340
Don't trust the guy wears rings

858
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,600
(laughter)

859
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,680
- He's behind a paywall, he's not gonna see this.

860
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,520
- Oh yeah.

861
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,760
(laughter)

862
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,260
No, I like Michael.

863
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,960
Even though he wears rings all day.

864
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,060
Would you guys ever wear rings if you weren't married?

865
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,940
- I have one that I bought as a joke.

866
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,620
I'd wear a neck ring.

867
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,460
- That is a necklace.

868
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,480
- And then it didn't even fit.

869
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,220
It's a Harley Davidson ring that has a big skull on it.

870
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,200
- It would look exactly like a normal ring,

871
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,040
but around my neck.

872
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,540
I'd have a gemstone like this.

873
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:54,500
Decides up would it be unlock would you unlock it unlock? How do I ring if it all our powers?

874
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,660
I put it on my head as a baby. I don't think you're wearing a ring. It's not wedding related

875
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:04,580
Yeah, I'm giving you some power. I guess I would wear a green lantern ring probably about a clatter ring

876
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,740
What was that a ring a cool?

877
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,540
Rings next to the heart. It's like a thing that Irish guys wear. I don't know that

878
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,340
I don't know it my dad wears one

879
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,340
I would honestly if I could wipe one single country off the map

880
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,180
I wouldn't even choose evil Stan or fucking North Korea. I would choose Ireland

881
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,060
No, you would I would go if I had a power and go like yeah, then the entire Irish

882
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,140
Diaspora, I would just obliterate with a single fucking snap. I

883
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,900
Hate Irish people you know what I was laughing about

884
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,820
Kind of a TV reference here you guys watch better call Saul right now. I've been watching

885
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,660
Watching nope

886
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,620
Me neither. I've been watching through better call Saul and you know Chuck how he's he's scared. He's scared of electricity

887
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,300
Oh, yeah, I was laughing so hard. I would love to be in that in his world in that show

888
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,820
And I'd love to be in Chuck's house and have a little ray gun. I'm just going

889
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:10,080
It's like a like a 50s ray gun that has like a visible like lightning

890
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,100
- Green.

891
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,920
- Yeah, yeah.

892
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
(laughing)

893
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,560
- It's got a little Vandegraaff generator on it.

894
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,520
(grunting)

895
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,000
- Stop it, you're murdering me.

896
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,120
- That's really good, Michael McKee.

897
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,880
(laughing)

898
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
- That would be good.

899
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,980
(laughing)

900
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,400
- He, I think he's got a point in that show.

901
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,240
- What?

902
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,600
- That electricity probably does kill you.

903
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,440
- Well you fuckin'--

904
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,260
- Yeah.

905
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,760
Don't, I know the spoiler about it,

906
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,800
but don't say it anyway.

907
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,360
- I'm sorry, I'm not gonna say it though.

908
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,080
- But I still haven't seen the sixth season,

909
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,920
'cause it's a--

910
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,720
I watched a YouTube video the other day, this guy sleeps on duct tape because he has a wire

911
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,040
that runs all the way from his house into the ground and he sleeps on duct tape every night

912
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
so he keeps himself grounded.

913
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Wow.

914
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,800
And I was like, "Man, I should get some duct tape and do that."

915
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,960
Dude, I really, I wish I had like some, because the thing that's missing from my life is like

916
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,280
conviction, you know?

917
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
Like something like a...

918
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Ah, you should be convicted.

919
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,120
- I did.

920
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,320
- Nuts, I knew as soon as I said that.

921
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,080
As soon as I said that I knew.

922
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,080
No, but like the thing is, it's like something that,

923
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,600
I guess like discipline is the word I'm looking for.

924
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,200
- You need to be disciplined in prison.

925
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,120
(laughing)

926
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,240
Sent to a work camp.

927
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,080
- No, I don't do that.

928
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,900
- So like, like.

929
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,960
- Like you feel like you just do.

930
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,580
I was talking to somebody about this the other day,

931
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,560
like the reason why people like,

932
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,480
like Andrew Tate or like Jordan Peterson

933
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,640
is because it's the first person,

934
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,740
the first time a lot of people have ever heard

935
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,580
that you can't just like eat candy all day.

936
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,980
- Yeah. - Yeah.

937
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,060
- You need one of these guys. - It's willpower.

938
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,180
- It's just so hard 'cause like all the guys

939
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,500
who tell you to do that stuff,

940
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,100
you see them and they're like the biggest dorks in the world.

941
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,800
Like why would I listen to a dork?

942
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,820
- Yeah. - I would, dude,

943
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,660
are you kidding me?

944
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,820
I could bully the shit out of Jordan Peterson.

945
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,660
He could try to-- - No, no.

946
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,180
- He would try to-- - No, I mean this,

947
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,000
he would destroy you.

948
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,060
- Dude, he could try to mentally like--

949
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,540
- Your wit is dim.

950
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,380
Your wit is dim. - He would completely--

951
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,120
You sound like the pedophile neighbor and family guy not like Jordan Peterson

952
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:15,100
You you would get destroyed in a debate by Jordan Pete, I don't know it's not a debate in a debate

953
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,360
It's it's a it's it's a wedgie competition his steely

954
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,060
Are you doing the thing where you see so where somebody sees someone they don't like online?

955
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:28,200
They say I would give you my swirly. No, you're doing right now that guy eats 64 ounces of prime rib every fucking day

956
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,120
He would dominate you. Yeah, he would dominate you. I don't know. I don't think

957
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,320
I don't think I would listen, I think I could just say

958
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,560
shut up nerd to anything that he says.

959
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,360
- No, he would talk over you.

960
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,040
- Andrew Tate though, that's a different story.

961
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,560
- That guy-- - That's Mr. Plenty.

962
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,040
- That guy would-- - Check the leather

963
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,880
on the Bentley, yeah. - Pop your head off

964
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,800
on his legs. - Yeah.

965
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,040
There's a different route you gotta take with that guy.

966
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,160
- Yeah, what do you gotta do with him?

967
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,960
How do you take down, how would you take down Andrew Tate?

968
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:54,480
- I think that guy would probably Google

969
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,520
where his pizza came from and then snitch on him to the FBI.

970
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,360
- That would be fucking awesome.

971
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,600
- He's already been taken down.

972
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,440
- That would be fucking awesome.

973
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,120
- Did you see the only, he's like,

974
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,320
I have visitation rights for five people.

975
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,640
I'm giving four-- - Please some of their

976
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,440
bad bitches. - Four to my family

977
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,680
and friends, and the fifth one is Aiden Ross.

978
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,520
- Really? - Yeah.

979
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,600
(laughing)

980
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,680
- That is so awesome, bro.

981
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,880
- That's so funny, he just has like a little--

982
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,160
- God bless that kid.

983
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,040
- He has like a little fucking, like a little brother

984
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,080
that he, like-- - Yeah, I think it's sweet.

985
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,560
- Yeah, I don't know much about Aiden Ross.

986
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,320
- How are you gonna stop eating candy all day?

987
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,780
Oh, I've already stopped. I think this is a wake-up call in itself.

988
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,740
Oh yeah, the tooth. That's what you need. You need a medical emergency.

989
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:44,500
No, I literally, that's like the only way to stop me from smoking and stuff too.

990
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,300
If I fully just like, yeah, you have a little bit of cancer.

991
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,600
Oh yeah. Yeah, that always gets me to stop smoking is when I like.

992
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,100

1010
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:34,480
Dandy yeah, the thing is I didn't know you think an alpha can do this. He says those are moves of a dandy

1011
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,680
He's small AF. That's the other thing. I don't like too much. Yeah, he's tiny. I don't like that. He's right here

1012
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,980
He's so annoying. Yeah, he is he's here. Wait. Can I flick away? We both had the same idea at the same time

1020
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,180
It's like the title of like the thing because we're trying trying to fit bellhop into it 12 rules for life, okay?

1021
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:32,260
Well no rules for hops. Yes shit. Thank fucking God you were there

Just slow-motion videos of bellhops

1026
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,260
It's important

1027
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:57,220
You always want to push the cart you never want to pull it into the elevator push it and then pull it out

1028
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,860
That's right in pull it out one of the most that's the one thing

1029
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,300
I always do one of the most famous bellhops in the world Sisyphus

1030
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,020
He was constantly

1031
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:14,340
Pushing the pushing a car hops at the fucking Tower of Terror. Those are fakes. Yep. They're actors. You don't look up to them

1032
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,620
It's true. They're fucking frauds. They're not real you stay away. They're bellhop for pay. Yeah

1033
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,720
Yeah, you don't be a bellhop because you want money. You don't do a B

1034
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,220
You don't do a bellhop thing for tips. No you do it because you need to move things

1035
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:33,380
Mm-hmm. You need to move a point a minute. I do life you are you're gonna be moved

1036
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,020
You're going to be moving bags from point A to point B, but you're going to be moving

1037
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,820
from point beta to point alpha.

1038
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,820
Shit.

1039
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
Fuck, dude.

1040
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Shit.

1041
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,820
I think this is the next thing.

1042
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,220
I think bellhop movement 2023.

1043
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,220
The bellhoposphere.

1044
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,220
Bellhoposphere.

1045
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,220
2023.

1046
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,820
I don't think that it's going to be the next thing.

1047
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,820
Shut up.

1048
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,420
I think auto-tune rap music is going to be the next thing.

1049
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,420
No, that already had its day.

1050
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,860
That's already in the heyday.

1051
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:55,860
What?

1052
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,860
That already-

1053
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,860
It's sundowning, honestly.

1054
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,860
Have you heard of T-Pain?

1055
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,860
Yeah.

1056
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,860
No.

1057
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,860
That is a sundowning industry.

1058
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:02,860
Wait, that Twitch streamer?

1059
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,860
That's right. That's what I think he is.

1060
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,860
But yeah, rap music, maybe where they're like, "Blah blah blah blah blah."

1061
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,860
I think that'll be real.

1062
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,860
Alcohol? That type of stuff?

1063
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
Hmm, we should get you in a studio.

1064
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,860
Yeah? You mean it?

1065
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
I do mean that. You know who's in that music video?

1066
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,860
Katherine Heigl.

1067
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,860
We've already talked about this.

1068
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,860
That's one of my favorite rap facts.

1069
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,860
We're repeating shit from one week ago.

1070
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,860
That's one of my favorite rap facts, is that she's in that music video.

1071
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,860
She was already at the height of her, like, she was in 27 dresses.

1072
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,260
- You ruined her career.

1073
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,100
- No I didn't.

1074
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,920
- Yeah I did.

1075
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,260
- Her behavior ruined her career.

1076
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,100
- Is that true?

1077
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,920
- Is what I read, yeah.

1078
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,760
- Did she have bad behavior?

1079
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,760
- I read that she was an actorzilla, or what's the diva?

1080
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,000
- Actorzilla?

1081
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,680
- Actorzilla.

1082
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,260
- There was a movie shooting near my house recently

1083
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,160
and I felt so cool, man.

1084
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,600
I walked by the trailers.

1085
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,440
- Katie Huyck's there?

1086
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,180
- No, there's a bunch of people sitting there like,

1087
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,480
oh, look, and I walked by and I didn't even care.

1088
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,040
I love doing that, not caring.

1089
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,760
Like you know when you fly into New York City

1090
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,960
and there's people are like looking out of the window

1091
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,360
to look at the city and you're like,

1092
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,680
I don't care, I've seen it a million times before.

1093
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,520
And you feel so badass.

1094
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,600
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

1095
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,280
- I saw a big trailer in front of a bodega one time

1096
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,400
and it was like a, clearly a movie trailer,

1097
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,160
but it had the Wu-Tang logo on it.

1098
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,960
- Oh, probably for the Wu-Tang show that they made.

1099
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,520
- It's either that or--

1100
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,360
- Peter Jackson's Wu-Tang show.

1101
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,400
- It's either that or there's a new karate movie coming out.

1102
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,240
- Really?

1103
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,760
I haven't either but I know they made it on Hulu Hulu. Yeah, they got a white guy to play old

Just he's a smoker doesn't smokes

My dad thinks that is one of the most powerful songs ever written up there with I was gonna ask

1122
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,520
- I was gonna ask, I was gonna ask.

1123
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,360
- Margaritaville.

1124
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,960
- Did your dad think that that's Ja Rule,

1125
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,800
but that's your mom?

1126
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,620
- No, my mom thinks everybody's Ja Rule.

1127
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,960
- You know what I think is the most powerful song ever written?

1128
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,040
- My dad's favorite song is, my dad loves Akon.

1129
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,880
- Yeah.

1130
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,920
- I think the most powerful song ever played

1131
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,040
was in the one in Back to the Future,

1132
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,120
where it flies backwards.

1133
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:41,960
- That is true, really.

1134
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:42,920
- Oh yeah, that one.

1135
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,080
- Second place the one from Mad Max Fury Road,

1136
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,680
where the guy's jumping around on the car.

1137
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,680
- Third most powerful song, P.O.D. by Tenacious D.

1138
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,000
- Yep.

1139
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,520
My dad had, the other day I was with my dad,

1140
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,960
Christmas I mean, and a T.I. song came on

1141
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,600
and he started singing along to it and I was like,

1142
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,840
what the hell? - Which one?

1143
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,760
- You can have whatever you like.

1144
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,600
- Yeah, I figured.

1145
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,520
- And I was like, what the hell is up with my dad, dude?

1146
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,280
He's some fucking rapper now.

1147
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,680
And he wasn't saying the N word when it came up

1148
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,360
and I was pretty impressed.

1149
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,400
I honestly was like-- - Good move, dad.

1150
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,240
- Hi, dad.

1151
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,400
Not that I've ever heard him say it,

1152
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,320
but I guess I'd never heard him sing along to a rap song.

1153
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,880
- Yeah, there's a certain--

1154
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,200
As soon as he started singing along, I was like,

1155
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,040
I'm in big trouble.

1156
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:27,880
- Yeah, uh-oh.

1157
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,720
- I'm in big fucking trouble.

1158
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,400
- Did he conspicuously not say it?

1159
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,760
Did he look at you or do like,

1160
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,320
raise his eyebrows or anything?

1161
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,840
- And he just went fully blank, dude.

1162
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,160
He did the radio edit.

1163
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,000
- Damn.

1164
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,820
- Yeah.

1165
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,660
- Good for him.

1166
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,500
- He didn't even like, say it backwards or anything.

1167
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,840
- Did he say shit or ish?

1168
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,080
(laughing)

1169
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:49,400
- I love this, ish?

1170
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,480
Yeah, but he didn't do that.

1171
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,380
Yeah, he just fucking said nothing. He gave it gave it a quick pause. It was his time to take a breath

1172
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:01,440
Yeah, he's an old man. So it takes him. Yeah, it's hard to sing as an old man. Yeah, I remember the radio

1173
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,640
Of Boulevard of Broken Dreams always used to be on the radio and when I said what's fucked up

1174
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,200
It always sound like say what's nuffed up? What's up?

1175
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,120
It was all it goes what's left up and it always made me laugh

1176
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,880
What was that one fallout boy song where he said this ain't a scene. It's a

1177
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,680
a god damn arms race. Yeah and my mom one time got mad at me because I didn't know

1178
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,760
that he sang god damn in the song. Yeah you know what else is a funny one?

1179
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:43,560
I've been so mad about this. Another funny radio edit was was don't trust uh yeah never trust uh don't. I like bad bad that's my problem.

1180
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:47,400
Yeah that was really good. That was one of the all time ones. And yeah like to like to that's my that's my problem.

1181
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,960
- That's the problem.

1182
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,440
Just don't even make the song.

1183
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,880
- Repeating the word that came before

1184
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,680
is the funniest way to do it.

1185
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,400
- I would so much rather have David Guetta,

1186
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,600
Baby Rexha, I'm gonna have the best

1187
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,560
freaking night of my life.

1188
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,400
That is better.

1189
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,500
- The best one is obviously the bedrock one.

1190
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,880
I've said it before, but the one where

1191
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,760
Nicki Minaj says, "Boingus, let me put this

1192
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,360
"boingus on your sideburns."

1193
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,640
- Wait, I don't know that one.

1194
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,480
- Yeah, I've definitely talked about it.

1195
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,160
- I think it's time to put this boingus

1196
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,160
on your sideburns.

1197
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
He say I'm bad.

1198
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,800
- Radio edit of Bedrock, yeah.

1199
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,640
- Boingus?

1200
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,460
(laughing)

1201
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,760
You have to be mishearing that.

1202
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,600
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1203
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,800
- It can't be Boingus, man.

1204
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,240
- I totally--

1205
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,360
- I think it's time to put this Boingus on your sideburn.

1206
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,200
- We can't look it up,

1207
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,280
'cause we've looked this up on the podcast before.

1208
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,760
- No, Boinga?

1209
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,560
- We just looked up Boinga.

1210
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,400
- Wait, this is what you--

1211
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,220
(laughing)

1212
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,040
This is what she's putting on your sideburns, man?

1213
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,920
This is Boingus from Backyardigans?

1214
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,760
- Whoa!

1215
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,840
- Oh shit, he's green.

1216
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,040
The green got green screened out.

1217
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,000
He's green so he's transparent.

1218
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,840
I think it's time to put this boingus on your sideburns.

1219
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,960
Boingus.

1220
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,680
There he is.

1221
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,400
That's a boingus.

1222
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,680
I hope this is the clean version.

1223
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,160
The one thing-- I'm still mad about this to this day,

1224
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,880
and I've brought this up a million times,

1225
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,120
but there was a kid I got into an argument with because he

1226
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,360
was trying to tell me--

1227
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,280
he was trying to tell me that the song "Beep"

1228
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,960
by the Pussycat Dolls, he's like, yeah,

1229
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,380
you know it doesn't actually swear,

1230
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,960
they just say beep instead.

1231
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,800
actually pretty good song for that reason. I was like, well no, like I didn't know

1232
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,080
what the word euphemism was and I kept trying to explain to him like, no, like

1233
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,920
it's like, like that's the joke and he just kept going, no it's like a clean

1234
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,760
song. No, it's actually way dirtier because they're making you think of the

1235
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:40,320
words. Whoa! Reminds me of a certain Louis CK bit. Is this it? Here it is. You got to get to

1236
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,320
the Nicki part. And she knows she bad. Grocery bag.

1237
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:55,320
(Music)

1238
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,320
(Laughter)

1239
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Okay, alright. She says put this boingus on your sideburns.

1240
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,320
Now that I've heard it, it's, it's, it's, she says on this, on this.

1241
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,320
Yeah.

1242
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I think it's time to put this on this, on this.

1243
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,320
All right, but it's on you.

1244
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Way to just destroy the whole, the best part of the song.

1245
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,320
But she says "this on" and so they just took that.

1246
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,320
This on this on your side.

1247
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
It's boingus.

1248
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
But it does sound like boingus.

1249
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,320
It's boingus. She fucking said boingus.

1250
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Would you do Nicki Minaj's boingus?

1251
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,320
Imagine after a show, she picks you out of the crowd.

1252
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
She picks you out of the crowd and she says

1253
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
"You wanna see my fucking boingus?"

1254
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,860
You want to see my fucking boy?

1255
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:40,760
Also, also well the thing is it going on the sideburns

1256
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,880
I don't want to see your boingus cuz it's probably been ravaged by plastic surgery true

1257
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,960
Well that that's why first of all she doesn't have a pussy. She has a boingus. It's

1258
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:56,620
Her boingus is big enough that goes on both your sideburns wait a boingus is not a boingus is a cock

1259
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:02,860
No, that's a boingus right there a boingus is not a fucking vagina

1260
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:07,220
There's no world where you would call a vagina boingus. She has a penis dude

1261
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,700
She has to

1262
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:14,500
That's what she said. She's saying that you could she could put her boingus or on your sideburns

1263
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,740
But even then just like putting the boingus on the sideburns is like that thing's got to be

1264
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,740
ginormous

1265
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:27,200
Maybe she's got a big one a big boingus big boingus. Yeah, I mean yeah, she probably does I got lost in the boingus

1266
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,700
- Swam to her butt. - Swam to her flip.

1267
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,860
(laughing)

1268
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:38,540
- Drown in the boingus so I swam to her flip.

1269
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,480
To her rear.

1270
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,740
(laughing)

1271
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,220
- Her tub.

1272
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:49,540
- I would like to get down on Nicki Minaj

1273
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,460
and it's all just, it's all bop it stuff.

1274
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,820
It's like swirly pigtails that you pull

1275
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,500
and fucking flashing red lights that you have to slam.

1276
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,340
- And then there's one part where all the lights

1277
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:02,300
in the room flashing goes, "Uh-oh, Boingus time!"

1278
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,140
- Boingus, get as many bonus coins as possible.

1279
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,260
- Boingus coins.

1280
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,100
- Get as many Boingus coins as you can in one minute.

1281
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,740
- Three, two, one. - There he is, folks.

1282
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:14,180
It's Boingus!

1283
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,020
- It's Boingus.

1284
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,860
- You gotta pull Boingus in. - There should be more

1285
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,500
mini games in women's bodies.

1286
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,620
- Yeah. (laughing)

1287
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,700
- I honestly think that.

1288
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,960
It would make stuff a lot more fun.

1289
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,500
I'd be able to pay attention more.

1290
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,340
- Yeah.

1291
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,540
- If there was a Boingus that was flashing at me

1292
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,380
and I had to get as many coins as possible.

1293
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,460
- Catch the boingus.

1294
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,300
- Yeah, that's right.

1295
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,740
- Boingus is running around the room.

1296
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,740
- Yeah, the boingus pops out.

1297
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,740
- I have a boingus net.

1298
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,020
- Dude, oh, imagine that,

1299
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,620
you're about to go down on Nicki Minaj

1300
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:41,900
and then the boingus pops out of her house.

1301
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,020
Starts running around your house.

1302
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,860
- The boingus fell out.

1303
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,340
- Starts running around like that

1304
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:48,740
motherfucking funny ass video of the Shrek

1305
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,340
doing the dog run.

1306
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,140
And you have to chase it around

1307
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,980
and catch him and put him back.

1308
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,540
- It looks like the--

1309
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,660
- And Nicki Minaj's looking at you,

1310
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,940
she's like, "Catch the boingus!"

1311
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,020
It looks like the worm aliens from Men in Black.

1312
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,020
Yeah, exactly.

1313
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,580
It's running around, just jumping around, doing mischief.

1314
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,580
Boinging.

1315
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,580
Thing one, thing two.

1316
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,180
Yeah, it's throwing flour across the room.

1317
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:10,100
It's going in your cabinets.

1318
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,940
Catch him where he multiplies and then he splits in half.

1319
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:13,940
Banging pots and pans.

1320
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:19,020
Yeah, he jumps in water and like a gremlin, like a magui, he starts to multiply.

1321
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,340
Then you got a hundred boinguses.

1322
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,940
There's nothing to do but take out a flamethrower.

1323
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,900
That's going to hurt Nikki.

1324
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:30,440
Yeah, anytime when you get to that point the boingis is need to go and then she's one gets out of the room

1325
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,460
Yeah, that's world domination. They're crying from phantom pain

1326
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:37,180
