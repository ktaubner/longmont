00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
[Music]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, so I'll give you guys a bit of a recap on last time on Gun City, the noir spectacular,

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
case of the missing activist. You guys are three detectives for the Top 10's

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,960
Tattletail Agency. You were hired sort of last minute because Lenny Krapschitz, the

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,920
head of the agency, retired basically 10 seconds before you guys got there. You

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,400
guys are now looking for the husband of a one Hasekitsune, a wealthy V girl.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,600
So that's sort of like an E girl, but it's like a virtual girl. So they're sort

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,080
like they're static either not really don't really like they both exist in

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,760
this world and also in the virtual world which is called the matrix - and so

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,160
you're looking for her missing husband and she you guys went to her place up and

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,720
up on the spaz which is the sucka fucka auto erotica zone and you went to her

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,520
mansion which looks like princess peach's castle and you investigated and

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,640
looked around for to find some clues you chatted with her you also chatted with

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,640
her uncle a one techno slime tycoon Papi Chuko and from them you sort of gathered

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,000
that probably mommy good legs is like a good place to start to look for Sean

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,040
because he was a bit of a he's a bit of a sleazy guy despite being such a good

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:53,720
activist. And you also found Sean's cyber diary, which had like a, a, the last log was, was

18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,080
recorded two months ago about thinking of maybe getting back into posting, which he loved

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:06,880
to do so much. After that, you guys arrived at the Mommy Good Legs club. You watched Mommy

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:16,160
perform a few numbers and Patrick went to the bathroom and talked to uh oh shoot I

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,560
gave him a name the gun the Tommy gun with eyes sort of looks like Clippy I

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,440
forgot what I called him I God let me find a note oh yeah his name like was

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,920
like Gavin shit and he yeah he was a Tommy gun with I with with like Clippy

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,120
looking eyes and he uh he was just talking about a kind of techno slime where you

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,320
sort of like shoot into your eye it wasn't it was just like a weird

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,200
conversation Caleb aka Ray William Johnson I should say beat the shit out

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,800
of a bartender and sat on him and and shat on him too pooped on him and

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,840
blow-toss piss using his like negative like charisma just went on the stage and

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,960
demanded that Mommy Goodlakes talk to him.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,460
- I seduced her.

31
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,560
- Yeah, you seduced her by yelling at her

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,820
in front of everyone.

33
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,240
And then she said, "Okay, yes, after this last song, fine."

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,080
She did the last song, she went back into her,

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,500
like dressing room or whatever and said,

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,360
"Come meet me there."

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,800
And when you guys went to go try to meet with her,

38
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,560
you ran into, there was a stag party.

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,520
so much a gross brent's

40
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,160
who were just screaming and yelling and they said you can talk to his art girl

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
and uh...

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
people for mission

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,200
only a time uh... i'm so

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,920
so glad that you recapped all that design didn't remember any of the and now i was

45
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,400
a i i i i took diligent notes

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,520
we're ready to go

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,700
i'm sorry rumble

48
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,140
i'm ready to

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,440
ready to beat the shit out of some brits

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:24,920
Yeah, I'll set the stage. So, so yeah, so, so yeah, Caleb tried to intimidate them and one of them who's the the fiance and he's, he's like, yeah, I'm the fiance, you know, gonna intimidate me. And he said he wants to fight you. And so the fiance is there. He's got his stag mates, and he's got a little orphan boy also in his stag party. And they're sort of sizing up to fight you guys. And Caleb, you actually rolled the highest initiative. So you go first, I should say Ray William Johnson.

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,960
It looks like I rolled a two.

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,840
Hmm.

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Not what I have in my notes.

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Look at the feed.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Yeah, Cameron rolled a two.

56
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Cameron rolled a two.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh, I get to go first?

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
Cameron rolled a 20.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
No, that's not, no.

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,320
Cameron rolled a 20, I rolled a two.

61
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
No, I rolled a 16.

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,560
Yeah, wait.

63
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,200
Was it Cameron, not Caleb?

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,080
Oh yeah, that makes so much more sense.

65
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,520
I fucked this up. Let's re-roll.

66
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,360
Okay, no, you wanna re-roll?

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
No, I want my two.

68
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,160
you want to do you want to go last

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
i need my to

70
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,880
he has a special plans and going well i made my bed nice i'm sitting in it

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,000
okay i mean i got it right hey i got a wrong makes way more sense of the

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
camera we go first to see is how it works and i was go for a resume where

73
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,920
she is the entire decks

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,720
disease these tire initiatives for that's all i'm better

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,880
by i am

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,120
i'm more lucky than you at rolling eyes

77
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,280
uh... so there is this map here that we have a friend of us this is the

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,920
situation

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,080
Yeah, so for the viewers at home, I provided them a little, I think a fairly useful, just

80
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,520
battle map, just to try this out, see if this works to help give them a sense of space.

81
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,040
So each of those squares, and anybody who's familiar with Roll20 is going to love this

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,520
kind of audio, but each of those squares is considered 5 feet of space.

83
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,960
So if you need to sort of figure out where you are, or who you are in range of, you can

84
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
do that.

85
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,400
Does that mean that my body is 5 feet by 5 feet wide?

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:04,680
You're all basically just Roblox Minecraft Steves.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I wanna...

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,760
You guys actually aren't, but all the stag brits in front of you are cubes.

89
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,240
They are perfect cubes.

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
They look like soccer fans.

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
You know, the type.

92
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Yeah.

93
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay.

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Can I get going?

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,520
Can I start my turn?

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Absolutely.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,440
Alright, so I want to run up to one of them here.

98
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm just going to drag my little marker.

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,640
I want to run over here and I want to just hit him in the face with my lead pipe.

100
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Absolutely.

101
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,400
Yeah, let me roll an attack here.

102
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
That's an eight.

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah, that's not going to do it.

104
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,720
In fact, it's a crit one, but plus your seven attack.

105
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,320
So you swing at the fiancé, but because of the love of his woman as he's trying to cheat

106
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,900
on her, it empowers him and allows him to sort of swiftly dodge away, and you actually stumble

107
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,120
and you end up in between all of them.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Oh no, oh no, I'm surrounded.

109
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah, you stumble in and you're surrounded by all the stag mates and the child, the British

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,680
orphan and so they're like yeah yeah we're gonna poke you in the dick with our British sticks and

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,040
they are uh you you do have an extra attack as your character so you can try that out.

112
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,080
I can try uh what out? Just an extra attack you have an extra attack. Yeah I'm gonna attack the

113
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,720

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,720
So just hit, hit, so what you do now, hit dual pipes inside the chat.

115
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,520
That's 17 damage.

116
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
Yeah, you, you bash the shit out of him.

117
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,720
So you fall on your ass in, in, in, in the middle of all of them,

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,320
and they're all laughing, they're all throwing their, their heads back,

119

you see their awful teeth.

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,220
No matter how many thousands of years in the future we go,

121
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,920
the British just never figure out dentistry.

122
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,920
And you just bash him right in the fucking teeth.

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,620
And he's just like, they're falling out,

124
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,320

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,540
to slap at you and it doesn't work. So you get out of the way. That's what's up.

185
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,500
Now the last guy, he's gonna sort of peel away from that crowd and he's gonna go

186
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,340
after Patrick Yoda, who he sees as the smallest and therefore, so they're

187
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,100
all trying to feel big and strong. So he's gonna try to try to do some

188
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,620
kicks on your ass. Let's see how he does. So do I get to attack him now? Once

189
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,220
it's your turn, yeah. Oh my god. Yeah I know, it's pretty wild. Yeah. Yeah, but

190
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,820
What's your AC, man? Let's see.

191
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,020
- 13.

192
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
- Yeah, so he tries to swing at you.

193
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,020
He has a posh cane, and he tries to swing at you with it,

194
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,020
but he just totally overestimates 'cause you're a little dude

195
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,260
and he just goes right over you.

196
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,220
- Okay.

197
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,200
- Yeah, that's their turn.

198
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,620
I mean, that's all they can do.

199
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,940
So it is actually your turn, Patrick Yoda.

200
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,780
- Okay, cool.

201
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,380
So what I'm gonna do-

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,220
- Hell yeah.

203
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,740
- Is I'm gonna take...

204
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,700
So Cameron's surrounded by guys right now, which he loves.

205
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,660
He likes this.

206
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,620
- No.

207
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,860
- He loves to fight. - Absolutely not.

208
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,200
- He loves to fight.

209
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,180
- I like he does. - That's right.

210
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,900
- I do like to fight. - Yeah, that's what I was saying.

211
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,180
You love being surrounded by guys 'cause you love to fight.

212
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,260
- No, I like to fight one-on-one on or against guys.

213
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,100
- No.

214
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,820
- You like to be one-on-one with a guy.

215
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,340
- Yeah. - You like to fight.

216
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
- Yeah. - Yeah.

217
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,400
- So what I'm gonna do, I'm going to use my hoverboard,

218
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,500
my hoverboard swing.

219
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,360
- Hell yeah.

220
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,360
and I'm gonna try and take out the three people

221
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,200
around Cameron up top.

222
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,000
- Okay, so the way you would do that then,

223
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,440
because, so your hoverboard can really only,

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,280
all right, so you just roll.

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,960
- My hoverboard boomerang?

226
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,520
- Yes, that's how you would do it, precisely.

227
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
- Yeah, I just got 18.

228
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,060
- Hell yeah, okay, cool.

229
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,440
So if you're trying to swing at the three guys in front,

230
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,760
that actually beats all their armor class.

231
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,760
So hit the hoverboard boomerang inside the chat.

232
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
- I got two.

233
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,760
- Wow, okay.

234
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,600
- God damn it.

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,420
(laughing)

236
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,260
- Yeah.

237
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,040
Oh yeah, so you swing the hoverboard

238
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,840
and it just like clocks all three of those guys

239
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
in the front for two damage.

240
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,280
But what is it, how does it work?

241
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
How do you throw it?

242
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,600
Describe it to me.

243
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,600
- So I kind of kick the back of my heels forward.

244
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,360
shit like this and then it goes around in a circle okay yeah so you do like a

245
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,720
little actually you know what you did you did you did so I want you to describe

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,560
your kill on the fiance because I just realized that Cameron beat the shit out

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,840
of fiance so bad that you did kill him just now okay so it kind of so it goes

248
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,880
around the three guys and then it just continues to spin on the fiance's head

249
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,580
until he gets CTE so bad that he dies. Okay yeah so he's like holding his head

250
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,260
and he's he's he's screaming "my mom warned me about this" and he just crumbles to the

251
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,080
floor, X's go over his eyes, Jollibee police come and take his body away and

252
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,920
throw it in the incinerator. But don't stop us from from fighting at all. No this

253
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,460
is population control. Gotcha. Yeah so yeah so he's gone so that was a sick move.

254
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,460
It is now your turn, Caleb.

255
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:53,460
Um, okay. So they're all grouped somewhat together, so I'm gonna use my grenade.

256
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Oh, you're gonna use the sexual grenade.

257
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I'm gonna use the sexual grenade. I don't think I've got the chance to use that yet.

258
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
Will that hit? Will that hit me?

259
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,460
I- God, I hope so.

260
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
Yeah, it will hit you.

261
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
No. Sorry, buddy.

262
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,460
No, you don't-

263
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
Sacrifice doesn't have to be made.

264
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
You don't use the sexual grenade.

265
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,460
I'm already using it as we speak, and there it goes.

266
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,860
Oh yeah that's definitely that definitely beats your armor class. That's a 20-foot

267
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,540
radius from point of explosion that's gonna hit everybody. No, I'm immune.

268
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,420
Depends, what's the point? What's the point of explosion? Oh, hit it in the

269
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,460
square in the back. Yeah, I throw it in the furthest square on the map. Can I mark that?

270
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,900
Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah, just like here basically? Yeah. Yeah, perfect.

271
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,820
Okay, so that hits. So basically you hit you throw it in the back it uh and 20 feet is four squares

272
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,860
so you get everybody in there uh yeah hit the sexual grenade damage now uh yeah so you throw

273
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:55,260
your your sexual grenade which is like a pulsing like like nut sack it looks like and when it lands

274
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:02,220
it explodes and like semen piping hot semen comes out of it and just splashes all over these guys

275
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,140
And actually describe your kill on the orphan boy.

276
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,660
You just killed an orphan boy with semen, dude.

277
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
With cum?

278
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,820
No, okay, I can't have that.

279
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,860
I jump in front- I say, "No, not like this."

280
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,660
And I jump in front of my own- No, say it in your voice.

281
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
"Not like this."

282
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,100
And then I jump in front of the- I cover him like a man jumping on a grenade.

283
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
You cover him, but not me?

284
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
But it's kind of the opposite.

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,500
No, dude, I don't give- You're not- No, we'll just wait, okay?

286
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I got a plan here.

287
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,260
I cover him, I protect him from my my own cum. Okay. Okay, the all familiar, but then I

288
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,980
experience the all familiar feeling of cum, my own cum hitting my face in my

289
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,660
ass. Okay, so. Do I need to take damage now? Yeah, you do need to also take damage. So,

290
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,020
yeah, well first, well actually, you know what, first we'll hold an athletics check to see if

291
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,220
you can succeed in um, oracarabatics. I can do that easily with my minus one. Yeah, you

292
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,660
You somersaulted onto the child and protected him from your own semen.

293
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,900
Um, yeah, Cameron, you take 14 damage.

294
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,400
Um...

295
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
[Laughter]

296
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,220
And make a- make a, uh, a deck saving throw, also.

297
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,720
Me?

298
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,220
Yeah.

299
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,220
24.

300
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
You're fine, okay, cool.

301
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,220
So, you're able to- to wipe the- the explosive fiery cum off of you after it initially scalds you.

302
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:34,260
Now let me see how they all do in terms of their deck saving throws.

303
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
They do fine.

304
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,980
They're all able to shake it off, but they're all looking really fucked up.

305
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,700
That was a really bad hit by them.

306
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,180
Except for the orphan.

307
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,780
Yeah, except for the orphan who you saved.

308
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,500
You take 14 damage.

309
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,900
I also take 14 damage?

310
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Yeah.

311
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
No, you don't take 14.

312
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,420
You actually just roll a deck saving throw.

313
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Oh, he takes 14.

314
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
No, you're not the boss.

315
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
He takes 14 damage.

316
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Roll a deck saving throw.

317
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,180
Roll a deck saving throw, actually, Caleb, first.

318
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:04,180
uh... really job

319
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,120
only got a ticket

320
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,060
when i was a little shy so i was a little bit myself

321
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:15,540
i sacrifice myself to avoid being a pedophile he's like any good american

322
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,300
you take nine days which uh...

323
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,400
from from the the residue the comrades to do this on you

324
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,040
So how much total damage do I take?

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,120
You just take nine, you don't take the fourteen also.

326
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
What?

327
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
Because that was your throw.

328
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,360
He threw that and then, oh well I guess you know what, he was doing that to protect the

329
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360

331
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,520
What if I pray to keep Caleb alive?

332
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,240
How does, would that work?

333
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Can I do a reverse on not letting this kid get covered and come?

334
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,920

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,180

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,160
i i am so i am

339
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,320
absolutely plaster

340
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,480
with my own com and i'm sitting on top of a spot of a boy okay you also take

341
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,080
time covering a boy and i'm covered in com

342
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,080
And you're- and you're-

343
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,480
There's no good way to say this.

344
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
You're also de- you're also knocked out.

345
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,280
No, I have 1 HP. I have 1 HP now.

346
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
If I take 14 more-

347
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,280
You take 14, you also take the- the 9 from your failure.

348
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Yes, that puts me at- that puts me at 1.

349
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,280
No, so if you're at 15 HP-

350
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
No, I already added the 9 to that.

351
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
That's what-

352
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Oh, okay, I didn't realize that.

353
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Okay, okay.

354
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Dude, that'll teach you to throw a cum grenade at your friends.

355
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,440
It was absolutely worth it.

356
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,120
The boy is looking up at you, he's like, "Thank you, sir!"

357
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
I feel like he...

358
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
We neutralize...

359
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
There's no way he keeps fighting us, right?

360
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Yeah.

361
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,240
No, we turned him to our side.

362
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
We could probably convince him to be an ally.

363
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,280
He crawls out from under your limp demon body and scurries away, rethinking the crowd he

364
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
runs with and what it means when you grow up.

365
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,640
We just saved a child.

366
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,800
We saved a child's soul.

367
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,400
does he break the seal of cum that marries my body to the ground around him?

368
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,260
I've kind of created a dome. No comment on how he did that. Okay. I can't possibly

369
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:35,240
imagine how he did that. Pure ingenuity. Yeah. Pure childish ingenuity. Yeah. So, it is now

370
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,760
It's now, uh, uh, Blowtoss, it is your turn again.

371
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Alright.

372
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,560
Um, so, I, there are two...

373
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah, they're looking pretty bad.

374
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
They're not looking good.

375
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Yeah.

376
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,720
Please kill us!

377
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,720
I don't have any area of effect, right?

378
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Yeah, I don't.

379
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,440
note cards and they hold up all tens. Okay. Ten, ten, ten, ten. Okay, yeah, that's right.

389
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah, so that one's dead and so now you have another attack too. Yeah. And there's

390
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,240

394
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,160
collapses slumped over dead on the ground.

395
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,700
The one guy who's left is sort of panicking now.

396
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,880
And he's gonna try one more--

397
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
- Oh, he's right in front of me.

398
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
- Yeah, he's gonna try one more time

399
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,480
to try to swing at Patrick Yoda.

400
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,120
I don't think it's gonna go too hot for him.

401
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,520
Actually, actually it did go very hot for him.

402
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,680
- No!

403
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,000
- Yeah, inspired by his fear, he got a critical hit.

404
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
- Damn, no!

405
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,640
Yeah. How bad?

406
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,840
Uh, we'll see.

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,340
Critical.

408
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,840
It's probably...

409
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,240
It's nine damage.

410
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,940
He's not that strong.

411
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,440
So he just...

412
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
He just tries to kick...

413
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
He kicks you basically right in the gut.

414
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,440
Alright, so I have seventeen hit points now?

415
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,340
Yeah.

416
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
Fuck.

417
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,140
Alright.

418
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,940
Uhhhh...

419
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Now it's your turn.

420
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,040
And he's like scared.

421
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
Alright, so what...

422
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,040
What I'm gonna do...

423
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,240
Hmm.

424
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,140
This is interesting to think...

425
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,940
About.

426
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:30,380
I think maybe I might do a yo- no wait that's different from last time okay um

427
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,860
I'm gonna hit him with the hoagie surprise whoa do it okay well this all

428
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,180
just switched around what's the hoagie surprise sorry sorry yeah describe your

429
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,180
Describe your hoagie.

430
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Ok, hold up. Let me find hoagie surprise in here.

431
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,180
Ok, so my hoagie, it is just a classic.

432
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,180
It's not in your spells.

433
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,180
It's not in my spells.

434
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:05,180
So it's just a classic, it's probably just like an Italian job from 7-11.

435
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,180
It's got the hot peppers on it, it's got the garlic mayo.

436
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:20,700
It's called 7,000 11,000. Yeah, it's an Italian job from 7,000 11,000 and so I

437
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,140
hit him with the hoagie surprise. Oh you fucking yeah roll for damage let's see

438
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,480
you do. Yeah describe your kill you bludgeon this guy. So I pull out the

439
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,020
hoagie it's a very old hoagie it's I mean I've been carrying this thing on all my

440
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:43,700
missions the bread is stale the meat is disgusting it's like it's just like it

441
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:50,020
is so gross and the bell peppers there's like mold coming off of it so the bread

442
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:56,780
is so hard the bread is like just like the strongest wood on earth right and I

443
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:03,220
think that's cannon yeah bread the bread is as hard as the strongest wood on

444
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:15,420
earth which is is it teak wood I don't know so let's let's find out strongest

445
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:24,620
wood on so lignum vitae yeah so it is a lignum vitae well this is this says an

446
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:35,180
Australian blokey. So... A blokey? Yeah. That's just any old guy in Australia. There is a landmass on planet E-Bomb

447
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,700
that has almost the same ecology as Australia except all the people are also

448
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,540
marsupials so they all have pouches too. Yeah. But yeah it has that kind of wood. So

449
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:52,340
I it is just as hard as that and I hit him over the head with it so hard that

450
00:26:52,340 --> 00:27:00,820
the top of his head slides off. It looks like I'm opening up a Wonderball to get

451
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,820
the Mario stickers out of it. Yeah. Yeah, so he has stickers on his brain. Yeah, so

452
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm basically, I knew that he had some stickers in his head. Mm-hmm. And I just

453
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,080
wanted the stickers. Yeah, add Mario stickers to your inventory. I will. Okay.

454
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,280
yeah he gets how many how many Mario stickers did I get how many are

455
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,960
typically in a water ball like - I don't know should we roll for it yeah let's

456
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,440
roll roll roll d4 okay there's one Mario sticker in there there's one but yeah

457
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
but it's it's the mark it's it's Mario sunshine sticker which is the best okay

458
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,280
all right controversial Mario sunshine sticker yeah and so he the guy he gets

459
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,320
hit in the head with the hoagie and he's like it's still better than British food

460
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,280
and he dies and yeah so so everyone knows self-effacing I love them for that yeah

461
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:04,280
dry British wit we all know exactly dude Ricky Gervais is so funny man he rocks

463
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:17,220
You know God? Yeah sure. Yeah you know what you know I love him yeah it's all just

464
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,480
rubbish to this guy. You gotta be kidding me. Yeah he doesn't give a flog about it dude.

465
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,640
Oh my god. He seriously doesn't. He looks like a fucking pig. So yeah you guys win. You guys

466
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,160
beat the shit out of the British, the British stag party, the rowdy boys. Yeah I

467
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,880
don't know that I won. I'm covered in my own cum and I have 1 HP. I look

468
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,400
around I look around at the dead bodies of the stag party and they're all covered

469
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,120
and come from the sexual grenade and I look into the camera and I say this

470
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,000
thing started as a stag party but now it looks more like a and then there's a

471
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,360
censored bar that goes over my mouth and stays up for a full minute.

472
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,880
It's a really long time.

473
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah that's yeah yeah the audience loves that it's very funny.

474
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
(laughing)

475
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,800
- Yeah, so the whole bar--

476
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,760
- Blowtoss, you crazy for that one, bro.

477
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,380
- Well, I couldn't hear what he said.

478
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,120
All I heard was a string of beeps.

479
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,240
(laughing)

480
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
- A string of beeps?

481
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,320
So they used the beeps?

482
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,160
They stop and start?

483
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,760
- String of beeps from--

484
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,320
- They keep stopping and starting.

485
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,360
- They stop and--

486
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,680
Yeah, they Morse code the actual word.

487
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,520
- Yeah.

488
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,000
(laughing)

489
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,800
But luckily I knew Morse code

490
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,300
and I knew what he was saying.

491
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Because of my time as a Morse code captain.

492
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Yeah, so everyone in the bar who knew Morse code is like, kind of looks a little disgusted, but everyone else is just, was sort of turned to that, sort of does a polite golf clap, they're all kind of happy to see that SAG party dead.

493
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Nobody likes a group of British guys together.

494
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
Of course.

495
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Yeah, it's really horrible.

496
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:08,300
And the orphan boy, you see a single tear. He sheds a single tear and he leaves the bar in a hurry.

497
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,300
But yeah, you guys have a clear way now to Mommy's dressing room.

498
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,300
You see the security guard outside, sort of his steps aside. He's like, "Whoa, yeah, of course."

499
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,300
So yeah, you guys can do whatever you want. What's going on? What are you thinking?

500
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,300
I say we head there. I say we head there.

501
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:33,300
dressing room. I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna look around. I turn to Ray

502
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,380
William Duss and I say, "Hey, why don't you consider healing up? You look pretty rough.

503
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:46,380
You're covered in cum." No, I'm alright. I don't think you are. I think I'm fine. I think you should probably wipe that cum off your face before you go back in.

504
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,980
No. You know what? No. I think you gotta heal up a little bit. No, it's called fashion. You

505
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Just a little bit.

506
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,980
Just a little bit of one hardship.

507
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Probably would help us out.

508
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,980
No, it would make us worse.

509
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,980
Just heal.

510
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Because now I look scarier.

511
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,980
Well, I don't think that will help anything.

512
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Don't wipe the come off and just heal up your power.

513
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
Your hit.

514
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Okay.

515
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,980
How do I heal?

516
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
So yeah, you have the ability to heal.

517
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,980
I forgot what the spell is called.

518
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
You also see people, you say

519
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,480
say like I you I seem scarier and you do see people actively avoiding you which I

520
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,840
guess you interpret as. Yeah because I'm covered in stinky, stinky cum but like yeah like I

521
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,320
haven't had it's not like I've been eating just like meat and like salt for

522
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:41,140
like months so that's like all I like my cum is really fucked up. It's one of the

523
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:49,320
worst things I've ever heard so I think it's called going viral is your healing

524
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:56,760
ability okay so it costs three techno slime points by me to heal how many

525
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,640
techno slime points you have so far yes so you can spend three oh yeah so that's

526
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:12,640
up to you so if you cast if you spend three you will heal ten points to each

527
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:21,480
member of your squad but if you by dispersing faves and RTs but if you for

528
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,880
every extra point you spend above three you heal three more points okay so level

529
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,440
one would be spending three mm-hmm okay so I am gonna spend I'm gonna do level

530
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,000
three so that'll be five points total right okay yeah so you spend five points

531
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,280
Yeah, and everybody heals

532
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:54,440
Everybody heals 16 HP. No, I'm not 16. Yeah, everyone heals 16 HP. So nice, dude

533
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,480
You're welcome

534
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,520
Yeah, and so now you have one techno slime point left

535
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,680
Obviously you still have those refills

536
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,560
But yeah, when you run low on techno slime.

537
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,640
- Oh damn, I got extra health points from that.

538
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,200
- Yeah, so-- - Can you go above your cap?

539
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,840
- So you would go above, so in D&D,

540
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,940
you would go, quote unquote, go above your cap

541
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,020
when you like, and it would be called,

542
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,300
like it would have to be specifically called

543
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,900
temporary hit points.

544
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,560
- Okay, so I would just put-- - Which we don't have,

545
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,460
but we can, yeah, well so yeah, exactly.

546
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,040
So otherwise this would just max out,

547
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,400
But what we can do is we can make the excess go into your temporary hit points.

548
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,120
I think that's a fine ability to do.

549
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
How long do they last?

550
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,400
So they last until you take a short rest or a long rest.

551
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,380
Which we can go over what short rests versus long rests are.

552
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:56,160
But basically a short rest is just like a 30 minute rest and you spend hit die to gain

553
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,100
hit points back.

554
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,560
Which we can talk about whenever that's relevant.

555
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,360
So if you guys ever want to like, be like, before we go in here, let's take a 30 minute,

556
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
you know, nap.

557
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,200
Yeah, before this fight, let's nap.

558
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Yeah.

559
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,840
No, no, I get it.

560
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah.

561
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,040
And then a long rest, you gain all of your hit points back.

562
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,320
You gain your, I'm going to say you gain your techno slime abilities back also.

563
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,140
And because that would be like a spell slots.

564
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:31,100
And then you also, you would gain half your hit die back used, I forgot what that rule

565
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,900
is, I don't ever go by it, it's stupid.

566
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,420
Yeah, so what do you do to heal them up?

567
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,060
What's your, I called it going viral, but I mostly wanted you to describe how you heal

568
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,580
your friends and your son.

569
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,820
What's my viral post?

570
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,500
I hit command C on the keyboard in my brain

571
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,340
and it fills in, not wearing my glasses anymore,

572
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
I've seen enough.

573
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,580
(laughing)

574
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,900
- Yeah.

575
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,900
- And then I become the president because it gets so big.

576
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,340
- Yeah, yeah, and that always,

577
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,700
that will always, you can always use that one if you want to.

578
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,540
- That's the thing about that one,

579
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,780
And you can use it about once a day.

580
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,540
For about, yeah, you can use that for the rest of your fucking life and everyone will always

581
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,020
think it's novel and like they haven't seen it before.

582
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:41,620
Yeah, somewhere deep in the heart of cyber Texas, a young goblin named Thomas is seething

583
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,620
at a monitor.

584
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:52,380
Because I, I, when I made the first campaign, um, I had Thomas as a character, um, a potential

585
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,060
character and I had him as a bugbear, because they're like just big hairy dudes, um, and

586
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,620
I had him just killing, uh, being the shit out of Michael Rapaport, but I like him as

587
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,020
a goblin, as a Texas goblin.

588
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,740
Yeah, no, yeah, he, he's a, he pretends to be, he's a cave goblin.

589
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,620
Exactly, he's a cave goblin.

590
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,820
Yeah, and he's crying at a on it to it to an Android phone that he's holding

591
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,500
and

592
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Yeah, and he's like I should have made t-shirts

593
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,180
Yeah, yeah, so you guys are yeah, you're all healed up

594
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,300
so yeah, you know at your hip points here, whatever your character sheets and

595
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:37,360
yeah, you guys walk into mommy's dressing room or into I should say the the backstage of the

596
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,340
You know place of the mommy's good the mommy good legs. And yeah, it's sort of a typical

597
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,260
You know backstage of a theater so it's just decrepit

598
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,380
The wallpaper is peeling

599
00:36:52,380 --> 00:37:00,220
There's some like affects of you know cyberpunk decor in like neon lights, but they're like flickering

600
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,140
It looks a little bit cheaper than it does

601
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,820
outside in gun city proper and

602
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,820
And you get to a door that says mommy on it.

603
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,820
What do you guys do?

604
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,820
I knock on the door.

605
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,820
I jump on the door.

606
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,820
I go two feet. I try to drop kick the door open.

607
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,820
Okay, yeah. Roll an athletics check to see how you do.

608
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
Should I roll? Okay.

609
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Athletics or acrobatics.

610
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:49,660
back

611
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,660
It's a suicide door from a car.

612
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
Yeah.

613
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,660
It's a front door that it detaches out and then opens sideways.

614
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,660
Yeah, you hear like all these locks unlocking and like

615
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
like like *clicking noises*

616
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
and then it opens towards you

617
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,660
and just like takes up the whole hallway as it does.

618
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,660
And you walk into

619
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,060
Uh, uh, and you see it's, it's, it's Mommy's, Mommy's room.

620
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,660
And, uh, uh, it's a, it's a very, it's a very nice looking room.

621
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Let me, let me, uh, *clears throat*

622
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,160
*inhales*

623
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,160
You hear a mechanical sound go on from behind the door,

624
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
and you watch as the mechanical door unfurls,

625
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,660
security locks unwinding in a clockwork, get-smart fashion.

626
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,660
When the door finally opens, you're hit with a scent not unlike Chanel No. 5.

627
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,740
Mommy Goodleg's dressing room is velvety and lush with curtains and beads and draperies

628
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,220
and other girl shit hanging around.

629
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,220
You see her finishing removing her makeup as she's looking in the mirror.

630
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,420
So what do you boys want?

631
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,620
I look around the room for coins.

632
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,020
Okay.

633
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:11,700
Do I have to roll an investigation?

634
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Yeah, I guess yeah. Roll investigation. Also, do you care if you're-

635
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,800
Seven.

636
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,300
*laughs*

637
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:22,100
Before you do that, do you care if you're noticed looking for coins in her room?

638
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,920
No.

639
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,380
Okay, yeah, so you just start like turning over stuff, looking for coins.

640
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,700
*laughs*

641
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,500
She's like, she's like looking like, she's like looking like a real femme fatale.

642
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,960
She looks like Yaddle, I think to you, is what you said.

643
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,460
*laughs*

644
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,900
So her legs are kicked up on her dressing and you just are like unfazed, just walk past

645
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,980
her and just start turning shit over.

646
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,500
Looking for coins.

647
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,980
She's like, "What are you doing?"

648
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,860
Well, I'm looking for coins, obviously.

649
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,820
I don't understand how you didn't get that from what I'm doing.

650
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,620
He wants to buy some candy.

651
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,100
I'm trying to play at the arcade.

652
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,420
is doing like the thing from located at the back of the bar I'm trying to find

653
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:18,820
I'm trying to play the we have joust and we have dig dug - he's doing the the

654
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,540
Benedict Cumberbatch Sherlock thing where like words are flying up in front of his

655
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:31,740
face but it's just pennies and just pictures of coins yeah yeah it's uh yeah yeah she's

656
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,200
He's like, "Yeah, we got Dig Dug. That was a big get for us."

657
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,200
"It draws a big crowd of perverts who love Dig Dug."

658
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
"Um..."

659
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
"I'm not a pervert, but..."

660
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
"No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of saying that."

661
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
"I do love to inflate a dragon."

662
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,200
"Alright."

663
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,200
"There's nothing sexual about it."

664
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
"Inflating a dragon."

665
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,200
"Roll a persuasion check, 'cause you're trying to persuade her that that's not sexual."

666
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
"And I think that's hard to accept."

667
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,000
Yeah, she's pretty certain that what you said with that seven, she's pretty certain that

668
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,120
what you're saying is like probably sexual, but she's trying not to show it, that she's

669
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,560
noted that on her face.

670
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,400
Again, let me reiterate it, it's not sexual at all.

671
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
I just want to play some Dig Dug.

672
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,280
Yeah, at this point you have to roll deception.

673
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,680
I have it on my Xbox arcade at home.

674
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,400
It's gonna be very hard to deceive her.

675
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,360
- So I have to roll a deception?

676
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,000
- If you're gonna insist, if your goal is to deceive her.

677
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,640
- Okay, I got a 15.

678
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,000
- Yeah, it's just not, you just,

679
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,120
you kind of dug yourself in a hole.

680
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,600
It's a good roll, but it's not enough

681
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
at this point kind of thing.

682
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
(laughing)

683
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,720
Yeah, she's like, "No, for sure, definitely."

684
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,080
So did you guys, besides coins,

685
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,360
you guys were, seemed pretty insistent to talk to me

686
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,520
and I think I know what you're here about, so.

687
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
- Nope, just coins.

688
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,080
- Hey buddy, why don't you go look

689
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,920
for coins back in the bathroom?

690
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,800
- Yeah, I put my arm on him and I interrupt

691
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,640
and I say, "Sorry about my friend.

692
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,040
We were wondering, do you have any recommendations

693
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,580
for lunch in the neighborhood?"

694
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:25,200
- Oh, well, as far as places to eat, there's--

695
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,220
- Yes, places to eat, you stupid bitch.

696
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:34,620
I said it was night time it seems more like dinner time I guess roll straight

697
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:40,700
time is what it is they call her stupid bitch try charisma check to see if you

698
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,580
can come across as cool so just hit the charisma button on your abilities on the

699
00:42:45,580 --> 00:43:01,980
the far left. You just seem like a regular misogynist. She's like, "Well, I don't have

700
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,220
to help you all, so if you don't get right to the point right now, I might as well just

701
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:11,900
get my security in here and get you all out." Sean McElwee. What do you know about him?

702
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:22,340
Sean, so you're looking for Sean. Shut the fuck up Patrick. I don't have any of his coins.

703
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,340
He never, he never let anybody have his coins but him. I heard he has a shit ton of

704
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,740
buffalo nickels. You heard right and he loves those nickels. Which are very offensive because they

705
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,620
feature a photo of a Native American on the front. He was trying to collect them

706
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:42,460
all to stop them from being in circulation. He was such a good activist.

707
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:49,100
Yeah that's why I have all this red skin gear in my apartment. I'm trying to keep

708
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,300
other people from having that. Yeah so I started hanging the Confederate flags in

709
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:00,220
my room. I was just trying to stop. Nobody has a Confederate flag. Exactly. Oh why do I have to

710
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,140
hang them? It's just so I know. I can keep track of it that way. Exactly. Yeah I know

711
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,740
I know how many I have to, how many are left.

712
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,240
- Yeah, right, in the world.

713
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,080
- Yeah.

714
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,060
- So yeah, she says,

715
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,480
"Well, ah, Sean."

716
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,500
She sort of sighs.

717
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,200
She crosses her legs.

718
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,040
Whap!

719
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,280
Her thighs slap against the other thigh.

720
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
- Nice.

721
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,540
- "Well, I found his persistence charming,

722
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,000
"but ultimately he was,

723
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,740
"well, I have eyes, ears, and a working olfactory system,

724
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,140
So I wasn't enamored with the fella.

725
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,820
I don't know what happened to him, if I'm being honest,

726
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,260
but I want to help.

727
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,540
He was a, he was a beloved man.

728
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,520
I found his disappearance strange.

729
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,580
- How, how so?

730
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,980
- Wait, we should ask how she knows him.

731
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,820
- Oh yeah.

732
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,300
Well, he came to the club all the time.

733
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,180
- Yeah, but, but why?

734
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,020
Tell us straight up.

735
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Was he two-timing his old girl?

736
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Uh, ooh, roll a persuasion check on that then.

737
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
Yeah, such a...

738
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
It's a classic...

739
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,020
...pervasive sentence, that is.

740
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,020
Classic noir question.

741
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,020
Yeah, yeah, she's...

742
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,020
She's, no, that's enough. I mean, she's okay with talking about it.

743
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
She's fine with... that's fine.

744
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Thirteen, she says, uh...

745
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
I...

746
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:35,300
Look, I didn't see him two time, but he was grabbing at every v-girl who was in here.

747
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,580
How'd he do that?

748
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,580
They're all computers.

749
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,580
Playershit.

750
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:47,300
Yes, he had the Playershit mod installed as part of it.

751
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:55,020
But frankly, while Sean had his vices and his demons, I do believe he wanted to make

752
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:03,220
gun city a better place just I don't think he always had the best methods how

753
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:10,100
so what word what what was he doing what's the deal what are you doing how

754
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:16,700
about you just tell us the solution in the mystery look I don't know anything

755
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:23,060
about any solutions no spoilers how about you just tell us the ending

756
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:29,540
I'll roll persuasion for that. Yeah, roll a persuasion check to see if she can tell you the ending.

757
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:35,540
Yeah, with a solid six she lets you know the ending of the story.

758
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:46,020
No, she says, "Look, I, I, I, Sean was always trying to..." Are you all familiar with, I

759
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:54,260
imagine the matrix 2 correct oh yeah I've seen the first one hmm however I've

760
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:01,880
never seen most of the matrix movies which we're curious which where did you

761
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,620
stop I've only seen the animatrix you know saying I saw half of the first one

762
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:15,900
at cyber community college I actually only played enter the matrix so I get

763
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,420
what you're saying. I've never watched any of them because they're basically my life.

764
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:30,580
She says, "Well, The Matrix 2 is... well I'm not a fan of it if I must be honest. It's

765
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,940
where all the all the clubs seem to be moving there now. People don't like flesh

766
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,380
and blood. They want to... they like bits. They like ones and zeros. They like to

767
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:44,800
enter the virtual world. And Sean thought that would be the best place to do what

768
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,780
he wanted to do and get done what he wanted to get done.

769
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,860
And so he started to post there a long time ago, posting every day, countless, countless

770
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,000
posts about all kinds of issues that plagued him.

771
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,220
But he got far, but he never really made a dent, and he sort of seemed like he gave up

772
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,620
hope towards the end.

773
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:13,780
But he started coming here more often, and I started asking him, "What's going on, Sean?

774
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,220
You're not tipping as much, what's wrong with you?"

775
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:24,680
And he said he had more important work to deal with and I haven't seen him since.

776
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,680
How important?

777
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,580
I didn't follow up.

778
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,100
Yeah, like what was he doing?

779
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,300
Exactly, what was he doing?

780
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
What's his favorite movie?

781
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,300
Oh, it's The Help, of course.

782
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,540
(laughter)

783
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:51,740
- Well, obviously.

784
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,240
- Isn't it everyone's?

785
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,820
- Yes, we all love the help in Gun City.

786
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,700
- You're of course talking about

787
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,900
the remake that was made this century.

788
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,460
- The all white remake?

789
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:11,660
- Yes, of course.

790
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,540
the white help

791
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,060
you know we all know the white help

792
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,260
it came out right after white hamilton

793
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,660
i remember

794
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:30,900
the white help starring sean king

795
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,220
it's too good

796
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:38,260
it's too good

797
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,720
what an amazing performance

798
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Yeah, he's incredible.

799
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,720
Him and Sean were great friends.

800
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,720
They used to post together all the time.

801
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
Yes, similar kinds of people.

802
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,720
What exactly, what was the kind of changes that Sean was trying to make in Gun City?

803
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
What was he posting about?

804
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,720
Well, he started talking about penises more and more.

805
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:08,720
He started talking, he seemed obsessed almost with their shape, with what they're made of.

806
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:30,440
of

807
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:40,640

there's nothing wrong with that I must have had you confused you yeah no you

811
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,440
You hate penises.

812
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,200
I do.

813
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,840
Once again I'm the only one burdened with the dark truth.

814
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,840
Can I say that into the camera?

815
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,840
*laughter*

816
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:11,480
And well, yeah, so he just...

817
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,480
He started getting obsessed with them and...

818
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,840
He started to talk about abolishing penises.

819
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
I... I...

820
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,240
Couldn't make heads or tails of it to be honest.

821
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,540
Look, I...

822
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,520
Well, it's probably tails, because that's the lower half of the body.

823
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,520
That's a good point, Patrick Yoda.

824
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:37,020
Look, I can't have you all in here for so long. People are going to start...

825
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,520
People will talk.

826
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,020
Let them talk.

827
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:45,720
Right, that's usually what people say after that, but...

828
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,020
But if you could all just...

829
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,720
Just leave, and you can come back here in the morning, and we can talk more about...

830
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,820
about Sean. I think I know what we can do next to find out.

831
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:57,820
What time?

832
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,820
10am.

833
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,820
You want to get brunch with us?

834
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,820
Sure, yeah, we can have some of these.

835
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,820
Wait, so that was a friendly toast.

836
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,820
We have Subway Jared here, he can whip us some breakfast sandwiches for a while.

837
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,820
Oh, no!

838
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,820
Finally, you answer my original question, you bitch.

839
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,820
No, he's been lobotomized, it's different.

840
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,820
Okay, the misogyny again. Okay.

841
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,820
It's not misogyny. I am not male nor female. I am computer.

842
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,820
Right, I forgot misogyny is dependent on...

843
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,820
It is.

844
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,820
Just the tin. Yeah.

845
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:34,820
Also, remember, you said tin. I might be a bit late because of computer people time.

846
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,820
Well, keep that in mind. It will probably be closer to 10, 20...

847
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,820
I almost spit on my white cloth.

848
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,820
Damn. Damn, dude. Okay.

849
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,820
Uh, yeah, so...

850
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,820
She started shushing you guys...

851
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,820
I heard Hillary Clinton ran on that back in June.

852
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,820
Fuck up.

853
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:10,820
I heard that was the time she used to run on.

854
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:17,340
until back in 2016 that was the time.

855
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,380
Can we not bring up that election?

856
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,220
It's triggering my anxiety.

857
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,380
Yeah, roll a constitution saving throw, Caleb.

858
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,380
19.

859
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:37,500
Yeah, you remember sitting in your parents' brownstone and just watching the numbers come

860
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:47,500
in on CNN. Yeah. And your mother just clutching her Rolodex of pedophiles that your father

861
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:53,020
knows and works with every fucking day. Yep. As the numbers came in and that memory sort

862
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:59,060
of flashes back into you and you remember watching Wolf Blitzer just shit his pants.

863
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:03,300
But you push that memory out of your head. You're like, "It's okay." I successfully un-remember.

864
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,300
Yeah, you unremember the orange... well you know.

865
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,300
Okay, well I wasn't...

866
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:19,300
So, yeah you guys, do you guys occupy mommy's dressing room or do you skedaddle?

867
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,300
We do an Occupy style protest.

868
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,300
I just start sleeping right there.

869
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,300
Can we at least finish looking for coins?

870
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,300
*laughter*

871
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,300
Yeah, you guys wanna all-

872
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,300
We got machines open right now!

873
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,300
Yeah, all of you guys roll investigation checks, see if you can find as many coins as you can.

874
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300
Yes, dude, finally the real game.

875
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,300
Mm-hmm.

876
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,300
I got a nine.

877
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,300
No, I got a nine.

878
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,300
I got a nine, too.

879
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,300
Oh, wait.

880
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,300
I got a sixteen.

881
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,300
I got a sixteen as well.

882
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,300
Pretty awesome.

883
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,300
Yeah, see, you guys find a few, uh, uh, um-

884
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
*burps*

885
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Oh, how many quarters did we find before?

886
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
Oh, yeah, we each have ten quarters.

887
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Okay.

00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:21,300

891
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,300
Okay, you rolled a, you rolled a, uh, what's it, a strength save?

Um, okay, uh, do you want to roll initiative?

893
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,300
Do you want to fight Caleb?

894
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,800
No, I just punched him in the head and I took all of his quarters.

895
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
No, you didn't.

896

Well, it's gonna spin around your head like I did with the guy before.

974
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,060
Yeah, there's not a button to give up.

975
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,060
Play this out, play this out, play this out.

976
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,060

And then I attempt to pickpocket Caleb.

00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,060
I karate chop his hand.

985
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
I karate chop his hand.

986
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,060
Hold on, I got a 16 for slaying Caleb.

987
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,340
I think that was his disadvantage, I fucked him up.

988
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,860
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

989
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,740
Alright, then I'll roll again, sleight of hand.

Yeah, roll again.

00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,500
Okay, and Caleb, roll a, um, I guess perception to see if you notice it.

992
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,220
Perception.

993
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,220
*laughter*

994
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:33,020
You absolutely notice him, just like, his grubby little hands, just like reaching for

995
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,020
it.

996
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,020
Okay.

997
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,020
karate chop his hand as it tries to enter my pocket.

998
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,020
Alright, then I'm all done.

999
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,660
As it tries to enter the pocket of my JNCO jeans.

1000
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,660
Then I'm all done.

1001
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,660
Okay, cool.

1002
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:49,420
Yeah, so the hall, yeah, there's just a shit ton of commotion in the hallways and you guys

1003
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,420
walk out.

1004
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,060
Wait, Patrick, did you take that damage?

1005
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,500
Wait, how much damage do I take?

1006
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
You take 12 damage.

1007
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Really?

1008
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,020
Yeah, because I hit you with my dong blade.

1009
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,020
Right.

1010
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,020
Yeah, also make sure you guys add the help.

1011
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,740
I have 21 hit points now.

1012
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,120
You gained 16 back.

1013
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,940
You all gained 16 after healing, so make sure you add that too.

1014
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,940
I only have 21 hit points now.

1015
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,940
Oh no!

1016
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:16,940
Oh no!

1017
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,740
Yeah, some people don't have...

1018
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,500
Some people in Africa don't have any hit points.

1019
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,180
So why don't you think about that?

1020
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,460
Some people in Africa are starving for hit points.

1021
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,460
Exactly.

1022
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,460
Yeah.

1023
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,980
Are we all going home?

1024
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:41,980
wait so yeah you guys walk out of the bar and uh uh Jamal the worm calls you all over as

1025
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:48,300

1028
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,420
You're a worm.

1029
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,340
Okay, well, all right, you shat on my head. So I don't

01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,980

1031
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:14,340
With all due respect, Jamal, you are a worm with shit on your head.

1032
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,820
Yeah, I'm not sure you have any standing to call people weird

1033
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,340
looking.

1034
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,420
Okay, no, I mean, okay, well, good. I mean, look, I'm just

1035
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,700
glad that you said that with with all due respect. So now I

1036
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:32,700
Yeah, I'm just like taking that in and, "Oh, I feel good.

1037
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,700
Ooh, ooh."

1038
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,700
All right, well, let's go see what this guy's all about, right?

1039
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,700
Yeah.

1040
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,700
We don't clean up Jamal at all.

1041
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,700
We just leave him there.

1042
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,700
Yeah, absolutely.

1043
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:48,220
Yeah, you guys walk outside of Mommy Good Legs and you walk through the doorway and you're

1044
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:55,220
You're flanked by those two giant legs that crowd the entrance.

1045
01:01:55,220 --> 01:02:04,340
And you see, skulking in the corner of this little alleyway where Mommy Goodleg's bar

1046
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:15,780
club exists, is a little man with the flattest head.

1047
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,060
He has like just the flattest head you've ever seen.

1048
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,060
And he, he, he has like two beady eyes

1049
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,500
shifting back and forth.

1050
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,860
He looks like a weird fucked up penny.

1051
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,380
And he says, he says, "K, come here.

1052
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:36,980
"Come here, I got something to tell you guys."

1053
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,420
- What?

1054
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,560
What do you gotta tell me?

1055
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,020
- You gotta come closer.

1056
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,100
Don't, don't do that.

1057
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,740
- I put one of my coins right on his head.

1058
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,740
I pick the coin up off of his head and put it in my pocket.

1059
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:48,740
Damn.

1060
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,740
My name's...

1061
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,740
Let me subtract a quarter.

1062
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,740
Yeah, and I get to add one.

1063
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:52,740
Nice.

1064
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,740
I'm going to get them one at a time, dude.

1065
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,740
My name is Michael.

1066
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,740
He starts licking his lips.

1067
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:56,740
Sorry, did we ask?

1068
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:57,740
Oh, no.

1069
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:58,740
No, I guess.

1070
01:02:58,740 --> 01:02:59,740
What is your name?

1071
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:00,740
What's your name?

1072
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,740
My name's Michael.

1073
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,740
My name's Michael the Clown.

1074
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,740
Thank you.

1075
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,740
Thank you.

1076
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,740

1078
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,740
Thank you.

1079
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:08,740
Thank you.

1080
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,740

1081
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,740

1082
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:11,740
Thank you.

1083
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:12,740
Thank you.

1084
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:13,740
Thank you.

1085
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:16,540
Thank you Michael the crawler?

1086
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,540
Yeah, that's my name.

1087
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,540
That's you? That's what you look like?

1088
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:26,540
I don't know, I never listened to the episode where you guys mentioned that name. I just sort of thought.

1089
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,540
Um...

1090
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,540
So uh...

1091
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,540
Look.

1092
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:36,540
He's just licking his lips a little bit more. He's like,

1093
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,540
"Look,

1094
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,540
uh, my uh, my employer

1095
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,540
needs to talk to you all if you're gonna

1096
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:53,660
I'm just uh, keeping uh, insisting on investigating this uh, disappearing Sean fella.

1097
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,660
Where do you work?

1098
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,460
Like Staples or what, who, what's the deal?

1099
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,940
You work for Office Depot?

1100
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,380
Yeah, can you get us a good deal on printer paper?

1101
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,380
We like to draw.

1102
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,620
I don't work for Staples or for Office Depot, okay?

1103
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,940
I don't work for any of your places.

1104
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,460
Look, meet me at the abandoned porno factory.

1105
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,460
Tonight.

1106
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,780
In an hour, we can talk then.

1107
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,300
Why not just now?

1108
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,700
Can we just follow you there?

1109
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:26,660
It's too many prying eyes, too many jolly big cops lurking around.

1110
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,540
That's all right.

1111
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,540
They work for us.

1112
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:32,300
Yeah, we know that they actually work for us.

1113
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,100
That's not how private detective agencies work.

1114
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,420
Nah, it works.

1115
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,540
It works that way.

1116
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,580
That's actually how it works.

1117
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:42,580
That's how it works, I rolled a 9.

1118
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:46,580
Okay, I don't believe you.

1119
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:50,580
Yeah, he's familiar with

1120
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:54,580
just like how that works. I turn to

1121
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,580
RayWilliamJohnson and say, "You try deceiving him. See if he'll believe you."

1122
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:02,580
Alright, let me try.

1123
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,580
15. Yeah, that's actually how it works.

1124
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:09,060
Okay, maybe that is how it works, but...

1125
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,060
[laughter]

1126
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:16,180
Look, look, look, I'm just trying to follow orders over here, okay?

1127
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,180
Yeah, so we're-

1128
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,940
Well, how about you don't follow the orders?

1129
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:22,500
Well, maybe you just sweeten the-

1130
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,500
That's just a stupid question.

1131
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:28,580
Why don't you just sweeten the deal in that case?

1132
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,580
Look I got-

1133
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:30,580
Here's another quarter.

1134
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:32,580
He starts crawling in a circle.

1135
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,580
Okay, as he passes by me-

1136
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,580
Look, alright, okay, alright.

1137
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,780
Alright, we're on his head. I take it out of my pocket

1138
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:45,460
Fuck have I have one Super Mario sunshine sticker. I could give you

1139
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,020
Wait, what are we trying to get?

1140
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:53,620
If you tell us what we were asking for in the beginning

1141
01:05:53,620 --> 01:06:00,580
Guys are just sort of the most aimless detectives

1142
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:10,780
Just like there's information that could be gleaned.

1143
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,580
We just want to know, I guess, who you're working for?

1144
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,140
We just want to know what we want to know from you.

1145
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:23,420
Yeah, I pick him up by his lapel and I say, "Tell us the Konami code."

1146
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,860
Up, up, down, down, Ike.

1147
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,220
Is it left, right, left, right, then A, B, A, B?

1148
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,220
Why do you sound so nervous? I've seen lie to me. I know it's somebody.

1149
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,220
I'm not trying to lie, I'm just trying to remember.

1150
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:41,220
Ray, we can look that up on E-Bombs World. They got a t-shirt of it.

1151
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,220
We live on E-Bombs World.

1152
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:47,220
There's a t-shirt we can buy of it.

1153
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,220
True.

1154
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:54,220
We don't need to know that. We just want to know what we were asking about.

1155
01:06:54,220 --> 01:07:01,740
All right, sorry, okay, let's hey buddy listen, and I put him down listen. Let's just start over okay

Sean McElwee and

1159
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,340
I could give you a sticker

1160
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,460

1171
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,100
I go behind the dumpster and I find two cups and a piece of string.

1172
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:27,060
You can also, you guys can also do an insight check to see if you...

1173
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:29,060
Yeah, I pretty much do an insight check.

1174
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,420
Believe him when he's saying that, um...

1175
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,380
I got a 7 for the insight check. I'm gonna do an insight check too.

1176
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,380
I got a 12.

1177
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,380
Okay, let's see how he does.

1178
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:41,380
Yeah, Caleb, it's all on you.

1179
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,380
Oh, oh boy. Basically I suck.

1180
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:51,380
Yeah, so you can tell that Michael the Crawler is not being totally truthful with you guys.

1181
01:08:51,380 --> 01:09:00,380
He's uh, he seems to be, he's saying like, oh, like, there's too many cops around here,

1182
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,380
but there seems to be another reason why he doesn't want to talk about it here.

1183
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,380
I bet he's setting up a trap.

1184
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,380
Yeah.

1185
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,380
Okay, I look...

1186
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,380
Wait, would you have to roll a perception to see if he was setting up a trap?

1187
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:15,380
I wanna look Michael Kraler in the eye and say, uh...

1188
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:20,380
Yeah, we'll definitely meet you there. You should go back to your house right now.

1189
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:23,380
- And just get ready. - Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1190
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:25,380
Can I use Yoda's mind right now?

1191
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:27,380
To read his mind and find out?

1192
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,380
- Whoa... - Yeah.

1193
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,380
- Okay, I don't say what I just said. - You definitely can.

1194
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,380
Okay, Cameron doesn't say what he says, and I use a Yoda's mind.

1195
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,380
Yeah, so Yoda's mind...

1196
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,380
So it should cost...

1197
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:44,060
Oh shit, actually I don't know if you have enough Techno Slime points for it.

1198
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:46,700
I have uh, I have five.

1199
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:51,340
Yeah but it costs five thousand dude.

1200
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:56,260
It costs ten so I made it cost more because I figured that in a detective game you would

1201
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,260
be using that more.

1202
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,460
You should inject Techno Slime right now in front of Michael Kraler.

1203
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,580
You can, you can do that.

1204
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:06,620
Okay I just injected, I have ten Techno Slime refills.

1205
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,460
So I'm gonna use one of them.

1206
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:12,780
So each of them, yeah, add five techno slime up to your total?

1207
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:17,500
If he's techno sliming, I mean I do it sort of socially, if anything.

1208
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
So I also start.

1209
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,860
You all shoot up in front of this guy.

1210
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:26,700
I put on Lil' Winn, I feel like dying, and I shoot up techno slime.

1211
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:33,540
Okay, everybody, everyone who's shooting up techno slime in front of this weird flat-headed

1212
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:36,860
man, roll a constitution saving throw.

1213
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:40,980
because we're gonna start addressing the techno slime addiction system now okay

1214
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,980
I'm gonna shoot up techno I know I have a way I still have this I still have

1215
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:49,460
disadvantage on hold on let me redo that again no you don't yeah I do I had it on

1216
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,980
I see so wait that's fine though no just keep the 16 yeah I'll keep the 16 so I

1217
01:10:54,980 --> 01:11:02,460
got a 16 I got yeah so you yeah yeah so you withstand the the techno slime our

1218
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,740
camera you injecting techno so I'm also injecting techno slime even though I

1219
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:12,180
haven't used a single point of I'm peer pressured very easily yeah so you and

1220
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:19,020
you and Patrick Yoda are able to withstand the effects of using techno

1221
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:27,820
slime and but but um Ray William Johnson you're only gonna get three points of

1222
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,980
techno slime back for that okay and you just and you have disadvantage on dex

1223
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,460
rolls for the next in-game 10 minutes. So all that's really happening is, you know,

1224
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:41,460
you're feeling a little bit woozy, your vision's a little bit blurry. Describe

1225
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,220
the feeling of that sort of like that initial wooziness of using

1226
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:51,740
TechnoSlime when you go too hard. Yeah, so basically I start... at first I'm like,

1227
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,340
"Okay, this rocks, you know, this is the all-familiar high." But then I get

1228
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,380
pretty paranoid, you know, and then I start getting so paranoid

1229
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:03,300
that I'm wondering if I even took techno slime

1230
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,500
and then I'm thinking about like the dealer I bought it from

1231
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,300
and then I'm looking around and I say to

1232
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,780
Blowtoss and Patrick, I say,

1233
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:17,580
"Hey man, do you guys feel a little weird right now?"

1234
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,300
- I say, "No!"

1235
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,140
- No?

1236
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,380
- I feel completely normal.

1237
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,820
If you feel weird, there's probably something wrong with you.

1238
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,980
- Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1239
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,340
Do you guys wanna just like watch a movie or something?

1240
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,160
I don't know.

1241
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,940
I'm thinking of going to bed right now.

1242
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:32,180
(laughing)

1243
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,780
- Well, all right, well.

1244
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,100
- You know what, actually, I'll just see you guys later.

1245
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,220
I have to go home, and then I leave.

1246
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,060
- You leave?

1247
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,860
- Yeah.

1248
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:44,120
- Okay.

1249
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,860
- I go to a Korean gaming cafe,

1250
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:51,700
and I drop myself off in one of the ports.

1251
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,480
- Yeah, you go to the Korean gaming cafe next door,

1252
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:02,320
called Kim Jong-un's sister Korean Gaming Cafe.

1253
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,560
(laughing)

1254
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,520
- Yeah, I just called that. - I don't remember her

1255
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,360
fucking name.

1256
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,180
- Yeah.

1257
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,960
- Yeah, so, yeah, you go there.

1258
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,760
There is only, the only game there is,

1259
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,120
is Cooking Mama.

1260
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,800
But she's wearing, she's wearing a do-rag

1261
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,220
and she's cooking up meth and crack.

1262
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,240
Yeah, she's in the kitchen.

1263
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,380
Yeah, so, yeah, you're doing that

1264
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,580
while they're continuing to talk to Michael.

1265
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:32,900
So yeah, Patrick, you have refilled your techno slime.

1266
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,100
So you've done, yeah, Michael LaCroix

1267
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,300
was just watching you like do drugs.

1268
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:39,600
And it's just like--

1269
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,180
- Like you would a detective.

1270
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,600
- Yeah.

1271
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,800
And so do you wanna now do Yoda's mind?

1272
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,540
- Can I use, okay.

1273
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,620
- Yeah, use Yoda's mind.

1274
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,380
- 30 feet again?

1275
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,360
- No, I mean like, so it has an ability.

1276
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,360
So, the way Yoda's mind works is, it has a 30-foot range.

1277
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,040
But what it allows you to do is,

1278
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,040
you can basically probe the thoughts of a person.

1279
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:14,560
And you can get those initial thoughts,

1280
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,280
so you can see their surface thoughts,

1281
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,440
and then you can also get a deeper

1282
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,840
sort of look into their mind if necessary.

1283
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,040
- Okay.

1284
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,240
So, but first you're gonna get those initial thoughts.

1285
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,940
If they fail, the wisdom saving throw,

1286
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:32,580
which your spell DC I believe is pretty good.

1287
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,680
Yeah, it's a solid 16.

1288
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,040
So let's see how he does.

1289
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,380
I don't think Michael the Crawler is that wise.

1290
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:44,160
Yeah, the stats here, he's not.

1291
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,600
- Damn. - Nice.

1292
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,760
- All right, so now I--

1293
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,600
- Yeah, you got it, yeah.

1294
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,240
- I find out all of his info

1295
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,240
and I found out all of his, his account,

1296
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,520
his banking password, his bank passwords,

1297
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:01,160
and the passwords to his,

1298
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,840
I found out the password to his FARC account

1299
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,840
and his Gaia Online and his Habbo Hotel.

1300
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,480
- Okay.

1301
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,840
- You also, you also figure out his surface level thoughts.

1302
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,460
So he's thinking, and what he's thinking is,

1303
01:15:16,460 --> 01:15:20,420
why won't these guys just come with me to the damn factory

1304
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,500
with taking them so long.

1305
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,840
Do I find out why he wants us to go to the factory?

1306
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,780
uh...

1307
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:30,260
uh... if you probe deeper

1308
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,340
well i have probed deeper

1309
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:37,100
yeah okay so we'll probe deeper so he has to resist again

1310
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,440
uh...

1311
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,880
so let's see if he can do it

1312
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,740
while you probe deeper

1313
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,220
into his mind

1314
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,300
uh... let me uh...

1315
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,300
Double check how I wrote the fucking spell.

1316
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,300
I think I did it the right way.

1317
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:56,800
Yeah.

1318
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,300
I find it out.

1319
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,300
Let's find out.

1320
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,300
I'm sorry, I have to roll.

1321
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:06,300
Yeah.

1322
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,300
So what you find out is...

1323
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,300
You basically gain insight into their emotional state.

1324
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:18,260
emotional state and it's something that they worry over love or hate.

1325
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:27,020
And you realize that their emotional state at this point is fear and agitation.

1326
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:31,780
And what they're worried about, Michael the Crawler, what he's worried about is that you

1327
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:37,380
guys are going to figure out that he wants you to go to the abandoned porno factory for

1328
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,860
nefarious reasons.

1329
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,660
Oh, okay.

1330
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,660
Yeah.

1331
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:50,980
So I immediately beat the shit out of him. I immediately hit him with a hoagie.

1332
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,500
Fuck I forgot I'm already gone. Yeah you're gone Caleb you're out. Yeah you're

1333
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:59,380
just in the Korean bar right now chilling out. Just having an absolute freakout.

1334
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:04,620
I'm trying to distract myself but then I'm just thinking like what happens to

1335
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:11,500
them when they turn into dust? Like are they conscious still somewhere? Yeah the

1336
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,640

You heard me.

He's like really trying, he's really scared, he's trying to figure out what you said.

1354
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:15,160
Otaz, you tell him what we're all about.

1355
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,720
I'm gonna make it real simple for you, okay?

1356
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:22,600
Either you tell us what we asked you and what we want to know from what you didn't want us to know

1357
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,720
from what Patrick was trying to figure out what you didn't want to know.

1358
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,400
Before I read your mind.

1359
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,600
Before he read your mind.

Bitch.

1361
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,080

And where is Sean?

1385

01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:09,280
Yeah, he takes you in the 2007 Ryan Dunn.

01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,480
And you turn the air conditioner up.

1471
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,840
Porsche 911, he presses the air conditioner up.

1472
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,960
GT3 Ryan Dunn edition.

1473
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:23,640
And he does a U-turn and goes back to the alleyway where the two of you guys are standing

1474
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:28,320
there with the exploded corpse.

1475
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:34,960
I get out of the car and I look at the scene and I'm just like, "What the fuck happened

1476
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,960
here?"

1477
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,600
"We don't know what happened.

1478
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,240
His got kind of exploded.

1479
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,240
The rest of him went."

1480
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,240
"Yeah, that, yeah."

1481
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,240
"Okay, okay, I'm up to speed now.

1482
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,240
Thanks, dude."

1483
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:56,640
"Hold on, throw your computer at my mind so you can figure out what the hell I'm talking

1484
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:57,640
about."

1485
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,640
No, I, it doesn't matter. I don't care what happens.

1486
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,640
I don't even care if you throw it at my head. I'm giving you a free throw.

1487
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,640
It's almost like you want me to throw it at your head.

1488
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,640
I don't want you to throw it at my head because you can find out my other thoughts.

1489
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,640
Can I roll an insight check?

1490
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:13,640
Yeah.

1491
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,640
Okay. I want to see if he...

1492
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,640
This guy's obsessed with insight checks now.

1493
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,640
I love it. I'm very insightful.

1494
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:25,640
Yeah, I mean, so you can tell what his meaning is. What is it, Patrick Yoda?

- Do you guys wanna go home?

1502
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:04,380
Or do you guys wanna go to the abandoned,

1503
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,100
what do you guys, or somewhere else?

1504
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:10,340
- I kinda wanna see what's happening

1505
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:12,700
at that porno factory, if I'm being honest.

1506
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:16,280
- Let me propose a tactical strategy.

1507
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,900
- What if we scout it out?

1508
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,860
- Let's, yeah, let's set up a stakeout around the factory.

1509
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,780
- Yeah, that's definitely something you can do.

1510
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:26,060
See, I can go there if we scout it out, but if we're going there just...

1511
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:28,060
Just because, I don't think...

1512
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:32,460
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who...

1513
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:35,340
Blow up the cocks of crawlers.

1514
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,780
And fake people!

1515
01:27:36,780 --> 01:27:38,860
So, and fake friends.

1516
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:41,180
So I say we have to bring them to justice.

1517
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:44,540
We have to bring all the fake friends to justice!

1518
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,620
So we should set up a stakeout.

1519
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,700
And figure out who's at the porno factory.

1520
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:54,900
yeah i love that idea

1521
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,620
uh... okay cool

1522
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:59,300
uh... okay so uh...

1523
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:01,820
y'all happy and let's get this thing going

1524
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,900
it's funny how it keeps saying hop and he's a frog

1525
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,380
okay alright

1526
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:09,860
you little frog boy

1527
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,900
we laugh for thirty minutes

1528
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,660
i'm thirty five

1529
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:17,120
so

1530
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,720
We just point and laugh at Sullivan.

1531
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,800
Yeah, he feels good about that.

1532
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,720
He enjoys it.

1533
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:27,320
He likes all of it.

1534
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:31,800
You guys hop in the Ryan Dunn vehicle

1535
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,480
and you head over to the abandoned porno factory

1536
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,400
and you stake it out.

1537
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,360
So we need you all

1538
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,320
to describe what you're doing for the stakeout

1539
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,040
and then we're going to roll stealth checks.

1540
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,400
okay

1541
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:54,920
i'm looking i'm i'm posted up i'm like hiding in the bushes read health check

1542
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,160
i'm hiding in the bushes right uh... right

1543
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,400
by the the porno factory

1544
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:04,120
and a holding my two lead pipes up to my eyes like binoculars to look into it

1545
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,000
look look

1546
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,760
into the factory parking lot and see if anyone is

1547
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,880
is falling in

1548
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,440
showing up

1549
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,680
okay cool

1550
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:17,560
We would yeah I'm looking at a at a call of duty heartbeat sensor.

1551
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:18,560
Okay, hold on.

1552
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,840
Let me let me roll my stealth.

1553
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,040
And it says it it says it says there's people on it.

1554
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,000
But I don't know if it's people walking around.

1555
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,240
Oh, wow, that's a that's a terrible role.

1556
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:34,560
I'm just kind of I'm like, I have a U-Haul box.

1557
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,040
And my head, I cut out a head hole.

1558
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:44,000
I'm kind of just T-posed in the middle of the street across from the porno factory and I'm

1559
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,200
going like "I'm just a box!

1560
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:55,320
I'm the man in the box!"

1561
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:01,240
I feel like you're underselling what 8 Stealth gives you.

1562
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,920
I don't think that's so bad that you have to yell that you play pretend in the street.

1563
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:12,400
I'm not playing pretend, I'm just standing in a box and I'm singing Man in the Box by

1564
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,720
Alice in Chains.

1565
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,720
That's not even...

1566
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,880
You wouldn't even notice that if you had a keen eye.

1567
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:22,200
I got a 19 and yeah, I'm basically...

1568
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,480
I take the heartbeat monitor thing back.

1569
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:30,480
I'm looking through a pair of binoculars but it's backwards like Steve Martin in the Pink

1570
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,480
Panther remake.

1571
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:32,480
Okay, good.

1572
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,080
i got a twenty three by the way so i'm the best at stealth but that's great

1573
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:37,920
i'm pretty much better

1574
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,880
it's literally a twenty three so

1575
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,720
it's way better than you could ever even dream to do in your life

1576
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,680
you literally can't get to a twenty three with your stealth bonus so

1577
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,640
just consider that

1578
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:52,760
he's actually right about that i'm sorry i am actually right about that and everything so

1579
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:55,160
just consider that next time

1580
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,280
you gotta consider this what do we see

1581
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,700
you guys look into the abandoned porno factory and uh...

1582
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,060
uh... you're staking it out

1583
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:12,700
And you see two, um, huge, like, not huge, huge, like 20 feet, like seven feet iron

1584
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:18,040
men, like these like large iron men, one of them wielding what looks like some

1585
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:26,560
sort of, you know, blue sort of saber with like two or two spokes, um, coming

1586
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,280
out of it and sort of, uh, I'm, I'm telling them, um, what you're telling,

1587
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:38,300
what your narration right now. I'm saying all of your narration to them in a Bluetooth headset.

1588
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:42,300
Yeah. What does it sound like? What are you saying?

1589
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:53,300
Saying, "Hey! There's a guy and he's got some kind of lightsaber! And he looks like Iron

1590
01:31:53,300 --> 01:32:00,300
Man! And they look the same! It's two men! Two guys!"

1591
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:05,300
I'm muting my Bluetooth earpiece the second that he starts talking.

1592
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:13,300
I'm saying it loud enough that you hear it from far enough away, but you can hear it

1593
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,300
in the distance like...

1594
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,300
[Muffled]

1595
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,300
Like that.

1596
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,300
[Laughter]

1597
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,300
You can hear it that way.

1598
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:30,860
So the uh the and you see another another one another iron iron guy looks nearly identical to the other one

1599
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:37,420
but instead holding a a a sort of pistol of some sort that uh, uh seems to be uh,

1600
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:44,140
has a bunch of sort of like I guess spokes or spikes coming out of it and they're standing

1601
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:48,860
standing in the abandoned porno factory, which which you guys would know has not been in use for

1602
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:58,300
for decades now. Porno was banned from Gun City many years ago. It was considered ableist by

1603
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:06,460
the Stakehams Federation of Bodies and Spaces. So there's been no porno here ever since the Himbo

1604
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:18,220
debacle of 2300. And you guys are seeing them standing there and they're just standing still,

1605
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:25,980
looking out it looks like. Not doing anything in particular. I give them the

1606
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:35,460
finger. Noticeably? Yes. Okay yeah so one of them notices you giving the finger

1607
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:46,180
then and starts to walk over to you. I give them both fingers. You give them both

1608
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:52,460
fingers yeah and it's the one with the the the sort of energy sword looking

1609
01:33:52,460 --> 01:34:02,100
thing and he he starts to say what you do here citizen show your business I'm kind

1610
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,900
of I'm kind of looking at Caleb in my box in the middle of the street and I'm

1611
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:12,900
like

1612
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:16,140
straight

1613
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:21,140
uh...

1614
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:22,940
he's he's he's with me

1615
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:24,340
uh...

1616
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,140
he's my best friend

1617
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,460
and

1618
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,100
denied

1619
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,660
the just at our covers the we're here we're here

1620
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,660
I didn't say that!

1621
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:43,660
He was like "That's too much rage against the machine!"

1622
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:09,660
You have one more warning before you get off the premises of the abandoned Bortle Factory.

1623
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:15,500
yeah well you have one if you wave your way to one more finger don't you don't

1624
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:22,300
don't do that to give them the middle the middle toe there's no way you can even

1625
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:30,700
there's no way you could do that roll I'm roll for that roll I guess athletics

1626
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:37,020
nothing it's nothing to me never seen anyone do a middle toe that's fine you

1627
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:38,620
You kind of do a middle toe.

1628
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,620
It's just not a thing.

1629
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,620
I give you the middle toe.

1630
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:42,700
Which is like even worse than a fuck you.

1631
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,620
Because it's like I don't even, I can't even give you a hand right now.

1632
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:46,620
Right.

1633
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:47,620
You get my foot.

1634
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:51,580
Which I guess I don't have any shoes on.

1635
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:54,060
It's stinkier than a finger.

1636
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,140
Not mine.

1637
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:56,140
It's the stinky middle.

1638
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,740
Yeah, I give him the stinky middle.

1639
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:06,340
Don't you dare give me the stinky middle.

1640
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,780
I already gave it to you, buddy.

1641
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,780
No, no, no.

1642
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:09,780
Give him the stinky middle?

1643
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,780
What is that?

1644
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:14,780
I gave him the stinky middle.

1645
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,780
Here, here.

1646
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:16,780
Damn!

1647
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:17,780
You give him one too.

1648
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:18,780
I'm flipping him off regular.

1649
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:23,780
No, give him the, come on, give him the stinky middle or else it's like.

1650
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,860
Alright, I'm going to sit down on my hoverboard and give him two stinky middles.

1651
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,220
Now I feel like I have to give him another one.

1652
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:35,860
Okay, you all, both of you, roll, roll, sorry, roll the legs check.

1653
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:56,860
I

1654
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:00,100
each of you describe how you fail and how you succeed. I want to hear what you guys have

1655
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:01,100
to say about that.

1656
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:08,300
So I try to sit on my hoverboard and then I end up, um, so because it's got like a, a

1657
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:13,260
cyber grip tape, my butt kind of clings to it. And then on my hoverboard, I'm just kind

1658
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:19,780
of like spinning indefinitely. I've got my two, I've got my middle fingers up and I'm

1659
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:28,500
spinning like fucking a million degrees on my hoverboard too fast and I'm just

1660
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:38,980
kind of going like this is a successful stealth mission yeah basically I do I do

1661
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:45,180
a full lotus position okay my demons he jumps from the one leg that he was on

1662
01:37:45,180 --> 01:38:02,340
on

1663
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:17,340
real

1664
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:20,340
Can I sneak past the guy and get into the factory?

1665
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:29,340
Yeah, uh, uh, let's keep your stealth check actually, and I will instead roll there in sight.

1666
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:31,340
I feel like he's very distracted by these stinky middles.

1667
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:36,340
He's insanely distracted by this. Let's see how he does on this perception.

1668
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:46,340
Yeah, of course he doesn't notice you. So if that guy doesn't notice you, you approach closer into the factory while they're giving the stinky middles.

1669
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:53,340
and you see the other guy there as well, he also doesn't notice you.

1670
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:58,340
And you start to see, you go in there, you see the conveyor belts

1671
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:04,340
that used to print out the pornos, and then the scanner that used to upload the pornos

1672
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:07,340
into the Dumb Matrix 2.

1673
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:11,340
And you see a few rats scurrying around.

1674
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,340
This is truly an abandoned place.

1675
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:21,220
But you can certainly investigate and look around and you you have free reign of this place at this point. Okay, I'll investigate

1676
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:25,360
I'm gonna roll an investigation check. Yeah, go for it, homie. I got a 16

1677
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:33,760
Yeah, okay. So so you you scour around you find some old max and mags and you find some

1678
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:38,980
pictures of you find some JPEGs of Sarah J lying around and

1679
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:46,820
You also find a door that looks a little less decrepit than the rest of the

1680
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:49,820
factory

1681
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:51,940
But it's also locked

1682
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:53,700
so

1683
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:58,260
You might have to try to either bust it down or pick the lock or something to get in there

1684
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,620
Hmm. I'm gonna I'm gonna try and

1685
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:04,820
Beat up the lock with my lead pipes

1686
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:06,900
Okay

1687
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,900
Do you want to do that?

1688
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:11,180
stealthily or not?

1689
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:12,180
Question for you.

1690
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,180
Hmmmm.

1691
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,180
No.

1692
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,340
While this has been happening.

1693
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:18,380
Yes, cutting back to you guys.

1694
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:27,020
While this has been happening with Cameron, I somehow hit the Spotify button on my hoverboard.

1695
01:40:27,020 --> 01:40:33,340
And now as I'm spinning around, it's playing Ride and Solo by Jason Derulo.

1696
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:40,340
I'm spinning in an indefinite circle and it's going "I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo"

1697
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:47,340
and I'm kind of like George Jetson right now and I'm like "HOW DO I GET OFF THIS THING?"

1698
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:51,340
"I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo, I'm riding solo"

1699
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:55,340
Uh, Caleb are you doing anything also while this is going on or are you just still flipping this thing off?

1700
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,340
Uh, yeah, I'm laughing.

1701
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,340
Okay, good. So...

1702
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:03,980
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1703
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:09,820
Okay yeah, so uh, uh, yeah Cameron you start, or I should say Blotoss, you start bashing

1704
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:16,820
this door, uh, and you start to bash it open when the other Iron Guard, uh, comes up to

1705
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:21,420
you and says, "Stop, you are violating the law, you are trespassing."

1706
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:23,980
I'm a repairman, I'm fixing the lock.

1707
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:27,340
Yeah, roll deception with disadvantage on that.

1708
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:30,220
disadvantage that's very believable

1709
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,320
you just snuck in

1710
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,420
eighteen with disadvantage

1711
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,620
wow damn ok

1712
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:37,940
yeah

1713
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:39,540
yeah he's like

1714
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:43,860
next time please let me know

1715
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,460
yeah i can't promise that but

1716
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:48,460
we'll see

1717
01:41:48,460 --> 01:41:49,700
ok

1718
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:51,460
it's not a big deal just

1719
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,540
you know

1720
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,920
let me know

1721
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:59,600
and i actually i have to apprentices that were supposed to uh... watch me

1722
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,280
repair this lock and still learn how

1723
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,720
i think they're outside somewhere if uh...

1724
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,980
you could grab them for me he and bring them in here

1725
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:13,260
yeah i wrote a letter that i believe us be for a few hours

1726
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,380
and properly with advantage

1727
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,380
uh... fourteen

1728
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,380
nevermind

1729
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:24,900
yeah uh... that five would not have done it before teens find out

1730
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,380
uh... is like

1731
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:28,340
okay shorty one second

1732
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,900
and so uh... he starts a walk outside

1733
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:34,700
and uh... meanwhile the other guys drawing his energy sword

1734
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:38,260
and he's like he's like if you keep playing a jason derulo song i'm gonna

1735
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:42,460
fuck you up your you're a bitch and uh...

1736
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:45,820
please press the stop button on the hoverboard

1737
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,220
and uh...

1738
01:42:47,220 --> 01:42:50,840
the other one comes up to him and is like "yo dude these guys are chill they're with the

1739
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,300
repair who inside the factory"

1740
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:58,020
and he's like "oh ok for real they're kinda rude"

1741
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:59,520
"yeah i think it's

1742
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,020
i think it's just like a cultural thing

1743
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,140
oh ok i don't wanna

1744
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:07,300
i don't wanna get cancelled so" and they both just sort of like

1745
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:08,700
let you guys in

1746
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:11,460
so if you wanna wanna go into the factory

1747
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,860
uh... you can now

1748
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:14,420
uh...

1749
01:43:14,420 --> 01:43:17,820
Caleb's zoned out. Caleb's head is empty right now.

1750
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:21,180
I'm still staring into space.

1751
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:26,460
No, I've been meditating this whole time.

1752
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:29,420
Remember? I've been meditating. I've been distracted.

1753
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,920
This one guard is completely transfixed by me.

1754
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,780
Just looming with four middle fingers.

1755
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:38,220
He's trying to do the math to see how that adds up.

1756
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,880
And it's not making any sense to him.

1757
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:45,080
Yeah, I'm gonna roll a calculus check for him to see how he does on that.

1758
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:51,980
Yeah, it's just intelligence. He doesn't do too hot, so he's having a really hard time adding it up.

1759
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,380
Yeah, I got one of the guys. I bet you relaxed, Cam.

1760
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:58,880
No, I already got you guys inside. Were you seriously not listening to that?

1761
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,280
No, but I'm just hanging out with him.

1762
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,880
You weren't listening to any of that?

1763
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,480
No, I listened to it.

1764
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:15,260
Yeah, and as they were as as you guys walk by them, you notice that they they they sort of seem like static like they're made of static like they're

1765
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:21,700
They they like they're they're kind of fuzzing like you're kind of fuzzy around the edges

1766
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:28,580
And as you walk by them and into the into the abandoned porno factory with this mysterious door

1767
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:33,340
That seems to be less decrepit than the rest of the abandoned porno factory

1768
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:40,500
And I think that's a good place as any to cap it off.

1769
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:46,860
With you three standing outside the mysterious door, waiting to see what's on the other side

1770
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:47,860
of it.

1771
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:49,180
If you guys are good.

1772
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:51,180
I'm so excited for the next one.

1773
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:52,180
Yeah.

1774
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:53,180
Ended on a good note.

1775
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:56,180
And I didn't even have my recording.

1776
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,180
have my recording turned on.

1777
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:13,180
[Music]
