1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:21,560
did a clap yeah. Well, along an early clip, a very early clap. I am in a war

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,020
me to actually really we're both in wars. Yeah. I think your war is cooler

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,980
than mine. No, okay, well, then you start with your war because I want to

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,020
I need tips and tricks on wars now.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,020
I don't know if your war is what I'm thinking of. I'm not sure my war will help you that much with yours.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,020
Okay.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,020
But I've been traumatized. I've been given PTSD.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,020
That's the beginning of war.

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,020
Yeah. Well, it's actually what happens after war.

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,020
Yeah.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,020
Now that I'm realizing it. So maybe my war is over. Because I don't think you usually get PTSD until afterwards.

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
Yeah, I guess you're right.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Yeah. I was at war with the biggest cockroach of all time.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,020
Oh, God.

16
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,020
Dude, it was so fucking horrible.

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,020
horrible. Yeah. Oh, worst experience of my literally I'm still I'm having

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,620
I'm having PTSD flashbacks every day to this cockroach. It's I'm not that like

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,820
I'm not gonna pretend I'm like brave, but I'm not that squeamish around bugs.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,220
Yeah, I don't care that much, but this like I was it literally ruined my life

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,320
is so fucking big. It was crawling up the wall. Is that where you saw? Where

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,020
did you spot this sucker? First? I did not spot it. This is this is part of

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,660
of why it was so traumatizing. I was you heard tales asleep and I was shaken

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,900
awake at six thirty a.m. on on Sunday, because my fiance was getting ready to

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,720
work and she saw it in the living room and shook me awake and said, I'm sorry to

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,860
wake you up, but there's the biggest cockroach I've ever seen. It's in the

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,860
living room, so I got up. I went gigantic crawling up the wall, probably like

28
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,460
like fucking huge. Yeah,

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,180
I was completely still asleep and like just looking and it was dark in the

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,620
room. I don't want to turn the lights on because I didn't want to run away, so I

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,860
could only really make make out the shape of it. Just like a big black

32
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,800
going up the wall yeah. So I go it hides behind the curtain of the window. It

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,000
knows how to hide dude. This thing was crazy. I this is literally a full war.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
This is so insane. Okay, so I get the raid. I get a shoe. I go. I put I put

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,620
clothes on to cover my entire every inch of my body.

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,620
You put on coveralls. I was well, I'm a man to look for it and only my

37
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,860
underwear and I was like I cannot you can't expose your no, I can't see every

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,160
yeah, it's going to that's on me yeah. So I'm going to start dissing you. I

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,420
start knocking against the curtain with the shoe just kind of hitting random

40
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,380
spots to see if I can just kill it like you know, get a quick wall bang just

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,940
lucky. Yeah, yeah, it drops down onto the floor. It goes into a corner. I go

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,500
up with the raid. I spray it once with raid it dashes. I spray it again. It

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
goes under the couch like it like runs. No fuck dude. It survived the raid.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,000
so then I'm like what do I do I'm standing guard there is I have like a

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,340
railroad apartment, so there's only one way out of my living room, so I'm

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,540
standing in that door with the shoe in the right. I'm like if it's trying if it

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,660
tries to get into the rest of the house, I'm going to kill it now. It's just

48
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,380
I'm just thinking this is going to be my entire day because she's leaving for

49
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,240
work is not going to be able to relax. So I'm going to go we're about to go

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,420
move the couch out so I can go try and get it again right as we're about to

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,620
move the couch out. I see it going up the wall behind the couch and I'm like

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,580
okay, get I'll get I'll get it. I get the shoe, it goes up onto the wall. I

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,760
hit it once with the shoe. I hear it dropped to the ground, keeps running

54
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,480
around. I hit it again with the shoe here, another it runs back under the

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,740
couch, so it survived to raid blast two shoe hits at this point and I'm like

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,420
I'm like I'm freaking my entire body. I can't I literally is not a car. I hit

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,700
with the shoe. I literally fully my like I actually just went.

58
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,280
Did you think at this point that this was some kind of Native American spirit?

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,120
I think it was a deeming. Literally, this is so crazy man. I it affected me so

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,940
shouldn't be surviving. The story isn't even over. Oh God, so then I'm like

61
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,600
fuck. How do I get it out from under the couch? I'm not going on down on my

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,360
hands and knees to try and see where it is. It's going to fly into my face or

63
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
something of course, so this and this is where I got. I kind of I got a little

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,480
crafty and this is how I so do you remember

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,520
do you remember that light we had for the old set that we would velcro up to

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,840
the top, though tiny. I don't know what it's called, but it's like a studio type

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,120
that, but it's tiny and it's really, really a little after that. Yeah, I have

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,040
that in my house. Okay, so what I do is I give that to and I and I put she puts it

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,980
on the one end of the couch under it. I've returned up to the highest setting

70
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,200
and then I'm standing at the other side of the couch. She turns it on. It

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,080
literally blasts the entire underside of the couch. So you see the lit up so I

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,300
could look for I could I was hoping to scare it out and then like kill it right

73
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,140
there. You know what I mean, but it doesn't come out. I'm like did you see a

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,640
shadow of it like a long shadow. I did. I wish I did that would be really scary.

75
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,400
It's smoking a cigarette, so then I go down on my hands and knees. I'm like

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,240
okay, this I have to get my face down here. I look down one side of the couch.

77
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't see anything. I crawl over to the other side. I look down. I see it and

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,720
get this it's on its back and it's convulsing. So somehow it had it somehow.

79
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,400
I had some kind of delayed damage to it with either the raid or the shoe where it

80
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,640
survived long enough to take more damage and then go under the couch and then it

81
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,520
stunned like a mortal combat like finish him. Were you scared because you

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,480
already knew this was one tricky cockroach? I would literally it's I was

83
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,320
not a fucking thing, so we pull the couch up. I'm like go go go pull the

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,240
couch up. So I pull out really fast. I spray it with more raid. It's

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,440
literally still twitching around while I'm killing it. I go I get I get a

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,680
trash bag. I get trash bags to put over my hands like gloves because our

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,200
paper towels are too thin. I'm like I'm not fucking so then I pick it. I

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,680
pick it up with paper towel and trash bag hand and I'm so my body is

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,480
reacting to it to with so much disgust and fear yeah that I'm squeezing my fist

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,920
so tight just because I'm just like and I can just feel it like being crushed to

91
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,200
dust in my hand. I go to flush it down the toilet. I open my hand to drop it

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,020
like I can. I'm literally like bit like my finger. I can't pry my finger. I'm so

93
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,760
fucking because I'm like I was a like five minutes ago and now you were

94
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,120
throwing into battle. Yeah, I'm completely and I open my hand and I like

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
can't control opening my hand and when I do first of all the cockroach falls out

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,080
and it's like all its legs are falling up because I squeezed it so hard, but

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,820
then I drop the paper towel into the toilet because and I have to reach into

98
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,760
the toilet next to the cockroach to get the paper to

99
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,380
here's my nightmare scenario as I go to flush the paper towel. It clogs the

100
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,220
toilet and then I have a clogged cockroach to and then the cockroach

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,280
wakes back yeah exactly. I fully was believing that could happen yeah. I kind

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,660
of was expecting him to come back to life again. I literally think you

103
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,640
probably did in the sewer. He's probably like it was crawling

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,540
out somewhere on on Rockaway, just like right into the ocean and right now he's

105
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,240
just crawling with his last two legs towards your house. Just so slowly

106
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,300
is up the beach. It was so come on for you horrible. I know it coming for you.

107
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,600
I also that's the thing I tormented this creature. You just did them. You did as

108
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,820
much as you can to something without killing it. I literally yeah. Why does

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,200
you within an inch of its life. Why do so many things get sprayed with raid?

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,480
This is why I don't keep raid in my house, 'cause it's bad for you. It's

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,080
really, really bad for you. But you spray raid on a bug, they never die.

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
They run around, they get at every other surface in your house. Yeah. You

113
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,240
might as well just be spraying raid. I've never had raid in my life. That

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,860
was something that my fiancee brought into my life. I never had that in my

115
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,520
house ever. Why do women, why are women not concerned about stuff that gives

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,000
you cancer like that? They just don't care. 'Cause they'll love their baby no

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,320
no matter how I sleeps with her phone under her head,

118
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,980
literally under her head, like no not under the pillow. She sleeps on her

119
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,280
phone and it's and I'm like because he doesn't like headphones and she wants to

120
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
listen to a podcast right. So it's like bone conducting. Yeah, so

121
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,340
so I tell her every single night you're going to get a

122
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,720
giant Jimmy Neutron head and you're going to and it's going to be because

123
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,800
you're going to get a smart tumor of all time. Yeah, and she's like

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,520
they just don't care at all. No yeah, I

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,680
this is all the only thing I care about is avoiding cancerous diseases. Yeah, I

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
don't like raid very much. I don't like the way it smells or tastes

127
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,880
the way it feels between my fingers. It doesn't seem very good. Yeah, spraying

128
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,480
my hand with rate and then grabbing the well, I'm going to be honest. Your war

129
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,940
is much, much more interesting than my war. You really you really understood my

130
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,260
more and here's why my war is just beginning yeah, yeah, my war is just

131
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,440
beginning. I would like to issue a warning to an unnamed waste management

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,300
company. Okay, so this is dangerous. You know a waste management company means

133
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,900
have you ever watched TV? Oh, you think they might be the mafia monsters? I

134
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,820
don't give a fuck.

135
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,720
we paid this waste management company for or we didn't pay them. Actually, we

136
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,940
never

137
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,580
it's part of the issue, I guess, but the war they said we were going to pick up

138
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,280
your your waste. We're going to manage your waste. I don't care what they do

139
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,200
with it. I said all right, buddy, I'll sign this contract one year of waste

140
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,520
management. Yeah, that seems like a great deal. One amazing yeah, a whole year

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,040
what just a little money. Let's do it. Yeah, if all this is going to cost me is

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,020
money, then I wouldn't what the fuck am I doing not paying and I'll get in

143
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,460
trouble if I don't get my trash picked up. Yeah, no, of course, I'm going to sign

144
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,580
manage this. I sign it

145
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,100
one week goes by no trash pick up. I text the guy. You know what jack the

146
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,580
garbage man, so he's in my phone as it's the only don't know his last name. That's

147
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,100
what he says when he answers the phone.

148
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,180
We didn't get a pick up last night. He says well, sorry about that. We'll try

149
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,260
again tonight. I guess they tried again unsuccessful unsuccessful figured out

150
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,520
couldn't hack it. No, you know this happens

151
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,080
seventeen more times, maybe yeah seventeen more times to the point where

152
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,120
I just stopped texting him and I don't pay the bill and I've texted him every

153
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,400
single time. Eventually, I just stopped. I don't pay the bill. They send me a

154
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,580
collections notice for four hundred and fifty dollars for paying for trash that

155
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,240
they've never picked up a single fucking time. You know to play devil's advocate

156
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,840
here, it can be tough to tell that there's actually a trash bag inside the

157
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,260
trash can that you might assume that the trash can is empty is completely empty

158
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,300
when yeah when it's been your boss or maybe even if you get five hundred

159
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,340
times, maybe that's maybe that's our stuff that we left there. That wasn't

160
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,860
garbage that we were hoping to use the morning. So I sent an email in response

161
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,380
to the collections thing last week. I say, hey, I'd like to cancel this. I'm

162
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,060
down. I'll pay a cancellation fee. If I have to, I don't give a fuck. I just

163
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,340
never want to get talk to you people ever again. Yeah, I have a different

164
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,660
garbage collection. Go with a different guy now with a different guy strong and

165
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,100
he picks he is really amazing. He does it for half the price. He picks it. He

166
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,540
picked it up the first time or the second time the second. He missed it the

167
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,740
first

168
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,460
he missed it the first time, but we gave him one right yeah. You got one as long

169
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,640
as he's better than the last guy. So the guy they don't respond to my email.

170
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,340
Then they sent me another collections email yesterday. So I text the guy I

171
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,400
text Jack. I say hey, I don't want to do this anymore. I can't Jack. I can't do

172
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,280
this anymore right. You've disappointed me too many times. I don't want this. He

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,340
calls me and boy we went at it. Really?

174
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,340
It started off a little passive aggressive.

175
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,340
Hey Caleb, it's Jack the Garbage Man. Yeah, you know, I'm just, I'm on vacation

176
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,340
and I just didn't, you know, I'm taking time to call you because it seems so

177
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,340
crazy, right? By the end, Jack,

178
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I've read your fucking Google reviews. You do this to

179
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,340
everybody. We're screaming at each other. It was a huge blow.

180
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,480
so I would like to say this war is on yeah and you you want to be careful

181
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,680
when you let your guys out on this neighborhood on the block, because

182
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,120
we'll pull up with an army of five strong

183
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,720
and we'll start. We won't fight. We'll sing in sync to you guys, and you won't

184
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,400
get hurt, but maybe what do you think you're going to do take us to small

185
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,100
claims court? We're already in jail. Yeah, where the hell are you talking?

186
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Yeah, we're in jail.

187
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,720
Why am I paying for garbage collection? Anyway, that's the real question,

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,080
but these guys are going to I honestly think if anybody, it does small claims

189
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,920
representation in New York City. I think that we might have I think we're a good

190
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,400
class action. I've looked into these guys right. I think we might have a class

191
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,880
action lawsuit and I bet nothing we've said just now in the past five minutes

192
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,480
would damage any of it. What I'm going to go to war, chop his legs off. That's

193
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,160
not illegal.

194
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,120
No, I won't chop his legs off.

195
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,320
he's to he's that's too good for him. His legs might be a little too short.

196
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,460
Yeah, that yeah, exactly. I couldn't even reach him. Might not make it much of a

197
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,400
bend over. I'd hurt my back. I've actually never met the guy. That's the

198
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,680
other thing. The new garbage guy, I met him the first day he came in the office.

199
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,800
Let me guess, he shook your hand. He came, he shook my hand. He came to the

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,040
office. The office looked like fucking shit. I mean, it was the worst it's ever

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,760
looked, and he looked around. He said, "This place is great."

202
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,160
And I was like, "That's what I want. I want a liar. That's what I like to work

203
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,580
with I like working with a liar. This is a really nice liar

204
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,720
when the garbage man shakes your hand and he goes. Oh sorry, it smells like

205
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,300
garbage. I'm a garbage man.

206
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,480
He didn't smell like garbage, smelled amazing yeah, but that's put in a lot of

207
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,500
work in order to to smell good as a garbage. You have to do the most. That

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,280
means you are doing the most yeah, but anyway that's the beginning of my war

209
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,960
we're. I'm going to keep you guys updated with some kind of war journal

210
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,120
war stories. Yeah, maybe there will eventually be probably a

211
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
documentary about this war on HBO Max, but I wouldn't be

212
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
surprised. They do documentaries about everything nowadays. They

213
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,000
do a documentary about a guy walking around New York City.

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,680
Is that true? Yeah. What's it called? How to a John Wilson.

215
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,880
It's literally just about a guy who can walk around. Why would

216
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,920
it that's and it's informational or it's just it's pretty

217
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,300
intro. I would say it's half and half informational and random.

218
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
Some things are just

219
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,560
kind of whatever, but some stuff is actually there's some good info in there.

220
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,500
You learn about scaffolding. I'm really that episode of John Wilson made me so

221
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,520
scared of things falling off of buildings when I walk in man had a walk

222
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,660
through Manhattan looking. Well, that's not going to save you all that's going

223
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,720
to do is that a little fear.

224
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Oh, like I can't move. I don't think you can move. I think you'll be frozen like

225
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,360
the deer in the headlights of a car falling. Oh, no, no, I am no Cameron

226
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,260
with a with a water bug on the wall. No, I'm a doer. I'm an I was hey. I was a

227
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,260
do. I did not give up. You did not give up. I proud of you for that. I didn't I

228
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,660
didn't even you know what I was on my station. I did not even leave that

229
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,220
yeah for even a second. I said, Can you go get my phone so I can use the phone

230
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,900
flash like can you make your fiance be a little drummer boy

231
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,080
next time I let her come. I have a war. I let her completely pretend the

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,500
situation was not even happening. Yeah, as soon as I saw it crawl back out, I

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,420
said leave go out of here. This is very reminiscent for me of my mice

234
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,520
experience. Yeah, what I'm hoping is that this is a one time thing, because

235
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,540
if there's another one of those types of things, I don't think I can hack it. I

236
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,120
really I'm not even kidding. I've been having are usually lone wolves. Yeah,

237
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,800
they travel. They don't they usually have. I also when they reproduce, they

238
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,460
usually have one baby at a time. I raise it for about nine to ten years before

239
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,160
can move on yeah. So as long as you wipe out two of them, you're pretty much

240
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,120
fine yeah. So there might be one more, but who knows yeah, but truly I've been

241
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,240
having bug dreams really and I've been so on edge. It's actually like ruined my

242
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,680
life. Do you like bugs? I don't you do like I don't like I mean I don't like a

243
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,540
bug in my house, but you're not afraid like you're not skittish around bugs

244
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,420
like I am I'm skittish. I'll say I'm skittish around like bees. I don't like

245
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,220
bees very much. I don't like stuff that can sting. I somehow lost my fear of

246
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,060
bees yesterday yesterday. Yesterday B was on my head and I my wife said

247
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,900
there's a B on your head and I said I don't care. That's because you couldn't

248
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,180
see it. Is that why I could feel it, though, and it didn't sting me and I

249
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,060
realise that it was pure fear man, but you were a beehive. It did not think I

250
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,780
was I was trying to make a beehive hairdo on my head with all its other

251
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,460
be friends, but it didn't happen. Yeah, I don't know this. I like really felt

252
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,260
it in my body this time. It really I think I maybe developed a fear of bugs.

253
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,700
I was like actually making involunt, like I was literally going.

254
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,160
I like not I'm not even kidding.

255
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,500
I was it was crazy man. Do you think you think you gave your fiance the Ick?

256
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,180
No, I gave her the opposite. I was strong and I I had a she pulled you

257
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,420
back into the bedroom right after you're covered in garbage, garbage bags

258
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,220
and paper towels. You smell like raid yeah

259
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,300
sweat covered in sweat. I forgot about this part of it, too. I literally

260
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,180
I was so it was like I haven't been sleeping very well, so I was also like

261
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,260
so tired and I was like okay. I think I should probably try to go back to bed,

262
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,620
but I like lay down and I couldn't even like close my eyes. I was still like

263
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:04,880
kind of just like thrumming with nervous energy, and so I and so she already

264
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,660
went to work. I'm just alone in the house and I just got up and I went out

265
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,140
and I just went and had Dominican breakfast by myself. It really early in

266
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,140
the morning and it was so nice a solo breakfast. Yeah, I haven't had a solo

267
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,740
I'm going to solo like sit down meal, full yeah, full sit down breakfast,

268
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,680
yeah, talking to a waiter and yeah yeah yeah waiters. The first person you see

269
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,600
that nobody else in the restaurant just made my coffee, my eggs, my sausage, my

270
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,640
salami, my cheese, you got that my pancake, but I go base yeah. It was so

271
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,940
good and the pancakes they I couldn't even eat the pancakes. It was too much

272
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,440
food. Yeah, it's too much. They always give you too much food. It's like four

273
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,460
dollars, but I was just sitting there looking out the window thinking God look

274
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,900
like the hustle and bustle of everyday life Sunday morning, everyone's off to

275
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,540
church

276
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,240
or or some kind of bad job from after their Saturday party. Yeah,

277
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,640
look at me suckers, but look at me, nobody in breakfast like this. No, no,

278
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,800
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

279
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,540
I killed a bug

280
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,940
yeah and I'd like a discount. I killed a bug this morning.

281
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,780
If I smell weird, it's because I killed a bug. If I smell weird, it's bravery

282
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,880
lifting off of my thin white body. Yeah, and you know that I went to the

283
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,780
bathroom in that restaurant and you know the type of bathroom they have in a

284
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,420
restaurant like that where it's small and you think there might be a bug in

285
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,880
there. I think I know the exact bathroom that you're talking about. Yeah, I

286
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,740
didn't go to the one that will place that you're thinking. Okay, I went to a

287
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,000
new place. It was okay. It was one also the time. It was also one of those

288
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,920
places where they have a

289
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,620
taxi dispatch inside it. So a guy's on the phone the entire time later, you

290
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,840
going okay, you have to go here. Okay, no this you're getting this call go here

291
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,180
and he's on a he has a computer and a phone and it's in the middle of the

292
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,880
restaurant. He has a full like desk and he's just talking the entire time and

293
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,020
he was also the waiter, but you got scared of the bathroom because it was

294
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,540
yeah. I give it that was the first maybe a bug could blend in yeah. That was

295
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,300
the first incidence of my of my bug PTSD. I wonder if I'm going to have trash

296
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,100
PTSD after my war and start getting scared. I've had trash PTSD just because

297
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,320
for that guy not picking it up every time every yeah, he already gave me PTSD

298
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,640
yeah walking around the corner. No thinking is that can going to be empty

299
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,980
or full

300
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,080
don't we I mean I might go to jail for real from what I'd

301
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,420
no no no I'm not going to hurt anybody. Legal issues, I am going to scream at

302
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,480
this guy's at this guy's phone a couple more times yeah and probably end up

303
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,680
they're probably going to win. I signed a contract of course yeah probably

304
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,320
going to win. What do we yeah? What can I do? What are we going to do hire a

305
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,640
lawyer for money. It's really not it's like I mean it's it's a year contract.

306
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,920
The thing is I'd be I'd be happy to do it. If they said they're charging you

307
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,960
the full year for breaking it. No, I haven't broken the car. I mean they

308
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
cancel what I'm what my argument that I'm telling this guy on the phone is

309
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,280
you didn't fulfill you never yeah, I mean yeah, I feel like we could win.

310
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,040
You never have have picked up the garbage a single time. I have I told

311
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,120
him I have security footage of our cans sitting there for four days straight,

312
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,480
never getting picked up a single time. Yeah, we there's no you don't have you

313
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,520
never did anything yeah and yeah. You know we could win this week. Can you

314
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,060
imagine how incredible it would be if we took him to small claims court and

315
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,840
they let us film it?

316
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,200
That would be good. That would be really got to be pretty good. Yeah, I would

317
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,480
love to get deposed. Yeah, I've always wanted to get deposed man. I would get.

318
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,860
I would do the full little Wayne thing, where it's my even if it was my own

319
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,320
lawyers asking me questions yeah, just be like

320
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,060
excuse me. What was that like ask me a question? They would ask in a

321
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,960
deposition. I don't even know what they would ask me just about about my life.

322
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,800
What was your life like

323
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,800
so remember you're under oath? What was your life like

324
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
it was all right

325
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,320
yeah, completely out out of it. This interest yeah yeah, yeah, little way

326
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,060
and did he did a deposition where they're like they like he's like correcting

327
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,980
their grammar and shit like never asked never answers a single. Oh, that's

328
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,320
great yeah, which I think is the move pull a zuckerberg.

329
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,360
I would not pull a zuckerberg. I don't think actually I'm probably I'm too. I

330
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,540
would be over emotional. This was the first time I ever yelled. I'd be crying

331
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,440
at this is the first time I've ever had a

332
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,880
disagreement with a guy at a who works somewhere yeah, where I was like I was

333
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,260
like no, just it's okay. Just do just ruin it. Just I'll pay whatever and

334
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,900
not ruin my life. That's how I usually am yeah, because I feel bad that

335
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,740
somebody has to have a job yeah, and this time I really was like

336
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm coming for you. Yeah, no, he deserves it. Yeah, this guy. This is

337
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,580
it's not over. It's not hasn't even begun. It's far from it's far from

338
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,220
beginning.

339
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,940
It's far my friend. This is far from even beginning far from beginning this

340
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,860
there. This will be a pro. They're cutting this out of the movie and you

341
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,740
might be scared. You might be scared for me or for them,

342
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,280
because this prank war yeah, the only thing that you the only kind of company

343
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,620
you want to be in a prank war with less than a garbage company right, which has

344
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,020
unlimited garbage at their is a comedy entertainment online video is a group of

345
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,980
comedians buddy, because we're going to think of stuff that your little numb

346
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,140
nuts little brain could never think of me. Yeah, you're what oh you're going to

347
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,460
put garbage in my can. That's where it goes. That is not a prank that I don't

348
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,800
give a fuck put as much garbage in there as you want the other guys picking it up

349
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,100
now. This is what I think we could actually completely sell the rights to

350
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,180
this story to either maybe David Fincher, maybe score says he would touch

351
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,580
it, but I think maybe we could sell it to score says he and we could say like

352
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,980
oh, we could maybe sell him a fake story where we give him all this lead up and

353
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,220
and we add the detail that the waste management company did turn out to be

354
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,400
the mafia. Oh, that would be a good movie for him to make. That would be

355
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,020
pretty good.

356
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,280
Step into the modern world and make a movie where the main characters are

357
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,300
podcasters. They should make... Is there a movie that's about just like a

358
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,020
guy who has to just like,

359
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,540
who has to battle the mafia just by himself? I feel like probably. But not

360
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,020
like... But he's not like... Yeah, he's not even anything. He's not like a

361
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,440
cop. I'm sure somebody will comment what it is. I'm sure there is one.

362
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,380
just like a that's always the best part of of the Sopranos is whenever it's like

363
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:20,900
a normal guy like the screenwriter guy or the guy like guy who's addicted to

364
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,240
gambling yeah, that's always the best. I love problem. I take them serious

365
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,260
enough yeah when they're like oh, whatever

366
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,420
kill me yeah

367
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,260
every single time. I would love to be in that situation and not get killed.

368
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,140
The thing is you if I if I was dealing with these fucking guys, I just like if

369
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,980
the episode where where what's his name? What is the the young guy's name

370
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:54,540
Anthony Junior? No, the guy in the middle of the ages. Meadow. The guy in

371
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:01,220
the middle of the ages under Tony, Tony's cousin or uncle's son or whatever.

372
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,660
Tony's chair. When Tony's chair goes into the pizza place and gets all mad

373
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,300
because I guess I and shoots him in the foot. Yeah. Why does that guy that guy

374
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,040
knows this dude's run? Why didn't he own a gun? Yeah, why what are you going to

375
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,280
do

376
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,080
blow his head off? I don't fucking know that's what I would do if I was this guy.

377
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,580
Well, I was watching a there's only fucking eight guys. If you kill every

378
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,220
single one of them, do you know that movie sonatine the like Japanese Yakuza

379
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,040
movie? No, I just watched that the other day and that has another really funny

380
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,040
running at the beginning, where it's like a guy who runs like a thing. He

381
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,580
runs like a gambling store. They call it a den or whatever it is, and he's

382
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,220
like he'd though, like Yakuza guys are like kind of like harassing him to pay

383
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,360
them and he's like he's like I'm not going to pay you what just because

384
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,180
you're Yakuza, whatever I'll go to the cops and then they just kill

385
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:00,140
way. It's so funny just yeah every that's the best part of any mob movie

386
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,040
is like the guy's like I don't care. Who do you think you are and he

387
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
immediately gets fucking killed. I am getting shook down man. I really this is

388
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,460
this is this guy. I never thought about this at all until you said is a

389
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,980
garbage man or waste management. Yeah, there are mafia guys yeah in New York

390
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,040
and this guy's rich enough. He's going on vacation. He doesn't use his last

391
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,360
name.

392
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,180
He's exactly because it's probably Italian yeah and he's probably knows

393
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,140
that I would be. I would be wise to something, but what he doesn't know is

394
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,880
that I'm seventeen and a half percent Italian and that my grandpa was really

395
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,100
out of the Irish Mafia. Yeah, better watch out. Yeah, look the fuck out. Yeah,

396
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:44,540
they don't know that my grandpa was had a deal with an Italian Mafia. Wow, do you

397
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,700
know that? No, you don't know this about my family, my grandpa, my great grandpa

398
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,140
used to be rich,

399
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,380
not millions. This was hundreds of hundreds of dollars, thousands of

400
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,820
dollars, not hundreds of thousands, probably either. He went into business

401
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,260
with a couple of guys in New Jersey.

402
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,020
he opens a pool club with them in New Jersey, like a pool, not not like

403
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,540
billiards, like they they they build a pool and they start having people come

404
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,600
in and they sell food.

405
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,380
Okay, that's a classic mafia plot, a classic mafia plot. They love swimming

406
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,220
a funnel cake,

407
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,620
but make sure they have to fucking shower before the in the pool. It's

408
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,500
fucking dirty.

409
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,940
They got a shower off before and after the bull. They're going to get covered

410
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,900
chlorine. I guess the guy the guy my great grandpa, I guess he I guess he

411
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,360
didn't pay something yeah. Anyway, they said they were going to kill him, so he

412
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,200
just abandoned the whole business moved to North Carolina, move it yeah and

413
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,560
started working, but making it worked in a steel treatment plant got mesothelioma

414
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,780
passed away. So you used to be able to do that. You used to be able to just

415
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,760
kind of move to another town, but nowadays the Mafia they got Facebook.

416
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,480
they got my space, they got map, they got linked in yeah, this is a generation

417
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,120
google maps. This new is there is the mafia still going on. I think so. I

418
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,200
think they're like guys who are like oh yeah, I'm going to be in the fucking

419
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,640
mafia, probably not. I can't imagine there's that many. It's not the cream

420
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,120
of the crop. At least no yeah, I think it's I think it's the same. I mean I

421
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
mean not to go back to the sopranos. I think it's this thing where it's yeah,

422
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,160
it's just like kind of impotent. I don't think it matters that much anymore, but

423
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,920
I'm sure that I can't imagine they were just like oh, let's stop

424
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,020
whatever this family, let's let's let's get rid of this family. I mean not the

425
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,200
family, but you know, cut your losses at some yeah. I'm sure, but you know, I

426
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,640
don't think they're doing very much. Rudy Giuliani put all your uncles in

427
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,760
jail. Yeah, it's like what am I going to do just to try to do this shit again? I

428
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,640
don't want to do that. I want to be I want to be a

429
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,080
I want to be on. I would just move to a I want to be on a website. That's what

430
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
people want to do now

431
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,920
website. I want to be on a website. I want to build websites or no. They want

432
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,640
be on you know, like this around a website like they want some kind of

433
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,040
website job, notoriety yeah or maybe they say I want to be a garbage man,

434
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,500
but then they're I want to be yeah. You know what I'm going clean. I want to be

435
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,760
a good old fashioned garbage man. I want to do things the right way. I want to

436
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,140
work my way to the top and this is a private garbage collection company, by

437
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,780
the way, which under pays their people because in north or in New York, if

438
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,020
you're a garbage man, you make like like a public like a city garbage man. Yeah,

439
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,680
you make like two hundred thousand dollars a year. You make like insane

440
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,260
most of my mansions. They're like the top of the one percent. That's a most of

441
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,900
the Hamptons is that's all these videos. These little kids coming out and hugging

442
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,000
the garbage man yeah be spitting in his face, creasing his sneakers.

443
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,280
What the hell are you doing? Would you walk up to Warren Buffett and shake his

444
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,540
hand and I do that to every thank you, Mr. Bother. I would walk up to Warren

445
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,180
Buffett with and I'd have a pie and it's I'd be dressed up like a butler. Your

446
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,620
nice and he go and have an order one smash in his face. That's what I would

447
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,220
do. Yeah, we should be doing that with garbage men because they're

448
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,320
millionaires. Yeah, they have had it too easy for too long. I agree. They get to

449
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,520
drive those trucks around. You know who else has had it too easy for too long

450
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,820
man politicians politicians. I went to Washington DC this past weekend. Yeah,

451
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,720
how was the on or what's it now Adam Friedman

452
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:18,400
that would have been probably cooler. I think the one would love us. I would

453
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,480
love to hang out with him. Yeah, we need to link up. Yeah, I think we should link

454
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,080
up with it. Does anyone know him? Does anybody have a connect on Theo Vaughn?

455
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,080
We don't even get him on the like I'd like to take him at a dinner yeah. Yeah,

456
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,280
I don't want to. I don't want to hitch my truck to that. No, no, he's a radic.

457
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,480
He's doing his thing, man. God bless him. He's going to take everyone down with him. He's

458
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,920
in a different lane than us. God, I love him. I could watch him tell stories for years. Yeah,

459
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:52,160
the first time ever that Instagram has served me just random clips of a comedian or a podcast.

460
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,120
And I've actually watched every one and enjoyed it. Yeah, they're great. I always get, yeah.

461
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,920
I'm not going to say people's names, but Instagram always, for some reason, just recommends me

462
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,220
only a million stand up reels yeah, just like I'm not watching it. Why

463
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,440
what makes you think I would want to watch this because I only follow stand

464
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,380
up comedians. Is that why I guess that is why I only get stand up reels. I

465
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,440
just say do not interested, not interested, not interested, not in yeah

466
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,580
anyway. These politicians had it too good for too long. Yeah, I went to

467
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,960
Washington D. C. and I went to the African American History Museum.

468
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:30,320
I bet you two had a laugh there. No, no, no, I made it. I made a very smart

469
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,820
choice, which is I decided to we walk into the history thing and it's

470
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,960
already just so so depressing and very sad, like from the first second and I

471
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,660
walk two sections ahead so that me and so that

472
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:51,900
Adam never says anything crazy like it makes some off color joke where I am in

473
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,340
the vicinity where I have to hear and react to it. So I just walked to

474
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:00,000
things and me and him just had two very separate, very somber times nice and

475
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,160
and at the end we had banana pudding, which was actually really nice. The

476
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,240
banana pudding is amazing. If you go to the

477
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,060
yeah, that's cool. Yeah, it was amazing. I haven't had museum food since I was a

478
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,200
kid. I love museums. I love museums. I love museums, dude. I and I love the

479
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,740
Smith. I love Smithsonian's. I wish we had gone to more while we were there

480
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,360
because the

481
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:25,040
natural history museum, the Smithsonian natural history is so good, which way is

482
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,860
that the one we went to

483
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,780
I went to the one with the dinos. Yeah, we went to that one. Yeah, that one's great.

484
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,340
The air and space is one of the best ever. I went there as a kid, I think. It's amazing.

485
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,740
They have spaceships that are ducted to the ceiling. Yeah. And you can imagine that you're

486
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:44,680
in. It's a great museum. Have you seen the titanosaur skeleton they have or in the...

487
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,500
The one here, the natural history here? Yeah. I don't remember if it's a natural history

488
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,860
or not, but it's like on a 120-foot long dinosaur. There's a really big one at the natural history

489
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,860
everyone here. Maybe it's that it goes out of the building. It goes out of the

490
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,700
building. It goes out of the room on both. They have like a giant room for

491
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
it and it goes through the door. Yeah, it's cool. It's crazy.

492
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,660
Yeah, there's so many myths about dinosaurs that I've been learning are

493
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,220
being busted in the last 20 years. Dinosaur shit goes crazy. They don't look

494
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:15,620
like they didn't look like lizards at all. No, they're birds. That's another.

495
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,420
That's another thing that I just did. Like I think either the Twitter just

496
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,620
kind of like use some kind of dark magic to learn that I will always click on

497
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,700
is a dinosaurs. I get I got fully my like Twitter for you page is fully

498
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,220
dinosaur Twitter, which is like a community. I didn't know existed. It's

499
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,960
like it's like it's like there's a whole bunch of people and they're all

500
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,860
friends with each other and they just post about like scientific papers. You

501
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,820
feel left out when you look at this. You say I don't understand any of it. It's

502
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,340
all like you see that news paper about the Spinosaurus. I'm going to look

503
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,540
where I see any papers yeah. I get dinosaur journals every month. There's

504
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,500
a I don't know crazy. I'd like to see a dinosaurs journal yeah. They were

505
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:58,440
I bet they're writing some crazy stuff, probably about how big I am. I'm so big

506
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,820
so misunderstood, but my bones are light because I'm avian in nature. People will

507
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,380
probably think I'm a lizard, but I'm a well, that's how they they discovered the

508
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,280
dinosaurs had feathers. They found a velociraptors journal and I was like,

509
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,500
I forgot to comb my feathers today. Everyone laughed at me. They said

510
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,740
everyone sure looked at me. I forgot to come at the nest feathers. Maybe this

511
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,860
meant something different. Yeah, maybe they meant scales. Yeah, they had to have,

512
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,080
but it makes so much more sense that they're birds. No, it's a they they

513
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,800
looked they look like birds. Yeah, all the skeletons look exactly like they

514
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
didn't have beaks. I guess most of them. I think some of them did them. Some

515
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,160
had beaks. Yeah, I think they were beaked man. Yeah, it's also is so crazy

516
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,240
that do you know people just didn't care about dinosaurs at all until like

517
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,040
the fifties? Yes, I do know this. It's so not a lot of people like my

518
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:48,720
family. We knew people growing up who thought that dinosaurs were

519
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,360
a

520
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,460
distraction from the devil yeah, but even even beyond or just fake, even

521
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,060
beyond like even yeah, even in like the science community like they discovered

522
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,740
dinosaurs and like the eighteen hundreds or whatever and

523
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,140
people were just like like it was considered like a fringe scientist,

524
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,780
like it was considered like oh you're like a weird like this doesn't matter.

525
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,100
Why do you care about it? Is it that insane, a giant fucking bones of like a

526
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,980
t rex and in a mountain and you're like, how can you be a whatever man? Let's do

527
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,320
physics and yeah, it's probably an older version of a dog. Yeah, let's give a

528
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,880
new type of blue water. Yeah, that hydrates you and call it a gatorade.

529
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,420
Yeah. Oh, let's invent gatorade. No, no, no, leave those bones in the ground.

530
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,820
Let's go fuck with all these electrolytes and these dies for your

531
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,040
water. Let's make a drink. That's too sugary. Yeah. Oh, I got an idea.

532
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,460
Here's here's the first guy who saw a dinosaur bone ready.

533
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,820
Huh dinosaur bones pretty gay. Let's go home. Let's put cocaine and soda.

534
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,720
that's probably what they like. I said yeah, it's so crazy man, because also

535
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,520
the one they thought when they even when people started to get a little more

536
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,680
interested in, they thought they were because they thought they were or they

537
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,880
they because they're cold blooded. They thought they're like big alligator

538
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,080
lizard type things, so that everyone was so all the scientists were like yeah,

539
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,080
because dinosaurs were like alligator type monsters or whatever. They probably

540
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,760
just like an alligator. They probably just sat around all day and didn't do

541
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,000
anything and then they just died. So we don't care very much about them, but it

542
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,540
turns out they run around like also haven't haven't crocodiles been around

543
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,680
like since dinosaurs were around. I think they might be older. That's so

544
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,040
scary, but that that there that proves to you that it's that they weren't

545
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,580
lizards.

546
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,240
We already had these guys survive.

547
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,880
Yeah, see here's the reason why you know most of most of the things that ever

548
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,380
lived on earth are extinct. Yeah, of course, it's crazy. Yeah, so much you

549
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,060
think about like you think about a crocodile and you can trace that all the

550
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,640
way back you go okay. Well, there was a crocodile alive seventy five million

551
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,280
years ago and it looked like a crocodile, but it was twice as big and

552
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,760
I guess long legs. That's why I get really scared when you see when you go

553
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
to one of these natural history museums and you see the five and a half foot

554
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,400
long mosquitoes yeah or the big ground sloths. Well, yeah, you look at the

555
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,800
grass, you pick a look at a picture of the ground soft and you're like okay,

556
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,560
well, I can tell what that turned into that to do a tree sloth that turn into

557
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,620
my brother. So many so many

558
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,560
animals that you see a picture of and like you're reading a dinosaur book or

559
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,180
something. Yeah, a picture of it. It's like oh, this just didn't turn into

560
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,000
anything. Yeah, this one was well. There's very you see a dinosaur like oh,

561
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,620
this looks a little bit like an elephant, but it didn't turn into an

562
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,900
elephant. It just went away. They break away in these awful branches. Yeah,

563
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,560
evolutionary cul de sacs where they get to the end and there's nothing left and

564
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,000
they just fucking spin around till they die. Yeah, crazy, scary, because what if

565
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,820
that happens to us?

566
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,160
You know, people are evolving. I heard this. You know, people are evolving.

567
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,400
I've heard this. Yeah, we're growing larger

568
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,740
brains, brain and hearts for loving.

569
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,620
We're getting we're being we're getting friendly,

570
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,260
I do think there's too many people where we probably

571
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,000
there's no way that we can all evolve because there's too many people. Yeah,

572
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,260
does that make sense? Most of us have to I mean if we're going to evolve,

573
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,280
we're all going to die because that's what evolving happens, but I mean we're

574
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,140
getting there's so many people being born and so much genetic variance that how

575
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,940
can we how can we even there's no like also we don't really have natural

576
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,220
selection like that anymore

577
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:22,260
right because we help out ourselves yeah because the weakest people are again the

578
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,740
politicians right and the politicians are self selecting yeah and they're

579
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,980
saying more weak people or politicians more garbage men who can who can do

580
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,980
anything they want more garbage. You know a diplomatic community like family.

581
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,420
we're going to get rid of body builders yeah, but body builders need to go.

582
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,000
We're going to kill the

583
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,860
waving their hands like this kill the body builders. We hate the body

584
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,360
builders. They're too strong in it and they're just a place to get rid of body

585
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,120
builders. We don't like body builders. They're out there trying to outlaw

586
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,660
self tanner, a rock star, get rid of straight rock stars, get rid of them,

587
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,520
get rid of them. Oh David Bowie fingered of a fifteen year old yeah, they're

588
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,820
doing this and trying to get rid of a rock star, but let's breed more Olivia

589
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:09,200
Rodrigo's yeah, more industry plant, Bs more Greta fan fleet. That's actually so

590
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,340
true nowadays. Natural selection is literally about being in the industry.

591
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,740
Yes, people who don't go into the industry, they starve and they die. They

592
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,740
do people and then everybody who goes indo goes big time, sells out, becomes

593
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,420
the president or the king of a country, which is the ultimate sell out. Yeah,

594
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,380
if that's why I would never, ever, ever become the president, do you know,

595
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,260
because I put my hand on that Bible and I'd go. Yes, I solemnly swear to sell

596
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:39,020
the fuck out yeah and stop around about the amount of hate that we get on a

597
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,620
motherfucking daily basis. I imagine that

598
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,340
multiplied by ten trillion. That's what the president gets every day, but he

599
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,060
likes it. Yeah, you have to like it to get a job like that. Did you watch a

600
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,100
republican debate? No, I would have watched it if trump was in it. Probably

601
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,020
yeah, I did watch the trump tucker thing. I watch I because I only saw the

602
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,360
this is guaranteed to be funny. Yeah, the debate is going to be maybe oh, maybe

603
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,000
one guy's funny accidentally because he's like oh, I'm so stupid like like a

604
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,640
Ben Carson thing yeah, but no it was all just, but everyone's just competent

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,040
making good points. Everybody's just like so smart man and it wasn't even

606
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,400
funny. It was just like very interesting. It's true yeah, just real

607
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
shit. You know I'm just nodding my head along. I want to be laughing right. It's

608
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,240
like I'm just watching a conversation with me and my friends. Yeah, exactly.

609
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,440
we need to lower taxes sitting yeah all the sitting around wearing red ties

610
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,600
sitting in the you know those plastic chairs around the fire pit, those

611
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,440
plastic chairs, fifteen week abortion mandate yep and we got our camp chairs

613
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,280

615
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,440
I do I delighted

616
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
I

617
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,980
delighted in my love for her. I just recently did that's huge, but

618
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,180
get me up on that stage. What do you have to lose? Put me in there? Yeah,

619
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,120
there you're no, but none of these people are going to like that about

620
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,040
almost everything.

621
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:17,380
I agree, I agree, that's what I why not after one of the shows this guy,

622
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,700
Daniel Gafford, the the Center for the Washington Wizards came to the came to

623
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,880
the show NBA player, he's seven feet tall. Yeah, he came and hung out with his

624
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,520
backstage and I just kept asking him. I was like, just let me play man. Yeah,

625
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,720
just let me play one time and I was like I'm a I'm a lob threat right like

626
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,800
just just one time you run off the court and I'll run on to the court. We'll

627
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,440
do it really, really fast. Yeah, no one can tell the difference and he was just

628
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,840
like, ha ha, maybe man.

629
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,960
He just kept saying that and I kept being like no man, I'm fucking serious.

630
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,760
seriously. I really, really, really want to do your job for one day. I've gotten

631
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,320
in trouble before saying that to people. To who?

632
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
I said it to

633
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,840
this guy from Smosh. You said, I want to be you? Basically. What'd you say? I

634
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:12,400
told him to put me on. You said put-, okay, to which one? Ian? Yeah. You said,

635
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,760
put me on? Not in those exact words. What did you say to him exactly? I think

636
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,840
exactly I said, and I can't remember exactly how I put it, because I

637
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,160
I was kind of drunk, but I think I said something along the lines of give me

638
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,160
one trillion dollars and put me on your shoes.

639
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,760
And what did he say? He kind of didn't really say anything and scowled a

640
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,360
little. He's not as nice as Mr. Daniel Gafford, man. No. This guy was cool.

641
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,360
He didn't give me the ha ha maybe. Him and his wife were really nice. But he was very nice.

642
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,860
Yeah. And kind of that way that I ended the night with that I feel bad about.

643
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:51,060
So you, he wasn't really nice to you being very, very rude to him.

644
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:55,060
that no well that's how rude it's a question. A question can't be so rude.

645
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,220
Well, I would say the rude part of that is assuming that the that the guy who

646
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,860
runs smosh has a bunch of money.

647
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,380
You can't run smosh that a bunch of money. I would say give me a trillion

648
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,780
dollars to a homeless guy. It doesn't matter how much money they have.

649
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,540
Okay, go do it. Okay, I've done it before you've asked.

650
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,540
He says can I have a dollar? You say, oh, I have a really a fucking trillion

651
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,700
dollars because one time that might work. It could where it might be a guy who's

652
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,160
studying yeah, there's a might be walking Phoenix. Yeah, that's a thing

653
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,060
since you asked I've been treating everybody every homeless guy very, very

654
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,520
well, just in case they're walking to every homeless guy and say I loved you

655
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,600
and Joker. I think I think your madness is unbelievable. Yeah, you play madness

656
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,520
so well. I've caused a lot of problems by by encouraging madness and these your

657
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,540
chest concavity is Loki freaky. My friend, I really want to lose like a

658
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,180
hundred pounds for a movie role so badly. Yeah, I want to be cast as

659
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,880
maybe

660
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,580
like who could I be? You should be in the remake of the machinist.

661
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,080
That's a great idea. I think I would crush. We were just talking about

662
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,980
that movie the other night. Are they remaking it? No, I don't think so.

663
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,080
I never have even seen that movie. Me neither. I've seen the pictures.

664
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,680
That was one of the movies that I was always, I wanted to watch so

665
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,980
bad when I was in like middle school, but I like psyched, I was too

666
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,580
scared of it, of watching it. Because of the skin he was. I thought it

667
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,540
was going to be really scary and I just psyched myself out every time I never

668
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,180
watched it and I still have yeah. I did that with gamer and then I watched it

669
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:22,320
and

670
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,820
it wasn't that gamers fire gamer is

671
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,620
I mean we've talked about those kind of movies before, but those movies are

672
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:29,900
like

673
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,820
really what I thought movies were going to be like the rest of my life. I was

674
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,220
like oh okay, they figured out how to make a movie. There's people's heads

675
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,900
blow up. There's like insane CGI. I like those directors are doing something new

676
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,140
that I was excited about, but I can't. Oh, I think that maybe they're doing a

677
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,640
Hellboy movie. Really? The guys who, the guys, they're the guys who did Crank and

678
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,520
the Ghost Rider movies. Oh, they did Ghost Rider? Yeah, or maybe just the

679
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,700
second one. And Mom and Dad, you ever watch that movie? Uh-uh. That's the one

680
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,780
where there's, like, a virus that spreads that makes all moms and dads want to

681
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,920
kill their kids. It's crazy. What? And it's called Mom and Dad? Yeah, and it's

682
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,920
like a con-, it's Nicolas Cage and

683
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,820
Selma something. Selma Hayek? No, the one from the old Hellboy movie.

684
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:19,860
Selma and Louise. I don't remember her name, but they play, but it's like

685
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,380
half a comedy and half like the most horrible, horrific thing of like

686
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,100
moms and dads like running at their kids and being like, "Come here!" and

687
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,760
trying to kill them. It's crazy. That would really scare me. It's a cool

688
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,940
movie. I've been trying to... Okay, I tried... I stayed up for an extra

689
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,660
15 minutes last night in bed, thinking about how to become very rich off

690
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,800
of a video game because I was thinking of all these video games that these little

691
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,620
kids play are all scary, the scary games, right? And it's all stuff that is just

692
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,420
things that are, that you think about when you're a kid. It's the

693
00:44:52,420 --> 00:45:02,100
fucking mascot horror stuff. There's that game Grandma. Teacher. Yeah, the

694
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,240
teacher baldies basic types there. All of these games are all all stuff you do as

695
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,300
a kid. It's all stuff as a kid. It's a part of your life. So I was saying what

696
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,940
if we wanted to make one of these games because these people make fucking dude

697
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:20,100
hello neighbor. Yeah, these guys made like they sold some show to like Disney.

698
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,700
They made like a hundred million dollars off this fucking game. Oh my God wait.

699
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,540
That's what we can do. What is vulture off all this stuff? We'll just go. Let's

700
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,580
just shop around a bunch of TV adaptations of all these games.

701
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,540
that is smart as fuck. We don't have to get the rights. Fuck no. No, we pretend

702
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,300
we have them. Yeah, wait, wait, wait. You didn't get the right. You just made it

703
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:39,620
up.

704
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:44,260
So fuck it. We'll just see the right. That's made up. Yeah, wait. It's not real.

705
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:50,980
You made up fucking Baldy and Freddie. Yeah, yeah. We'll just take it. Do

706
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,540
something about it. It's a fucking iPhone. Oh my God. And you know what?

707
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,340
You have the perfect perspective to write an adaptation of Baldy.

708
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:03,240
finally a story about story about Baldy in school from an actual Baldy. You

709
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,580
think I would be long. We have let haired people of hair take over the

710
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,980
narratives of Baldies. Can I say Baldies?

711
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:17,980
You can't say Baldies man. That's the guy's name. I didn't even think I

712
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,780
didn't realize he was bald. Actually, I don't know even what he looks like. He

713
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,020
is bald now that I think I mean apparently they sold been selling a lot

714
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,820
game baldies gate three. I didn't even know it was such a big that's a

715
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,460
different, but I've seen that's a different ball. I guess it's that's

716
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,740
different. Yeah, it's a completely different ball guy. I'm scared to play

717
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,460
that game scared of any game that will destroy my life. You can imagine it's

718
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,780
hard for you to imagine something balder than you is that what the fuck you

719
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:46,140
made me spill my coffee. You did that shit right then and it's just going to

720
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,580
sit there. You're just going to have to think about that. I see the name of

721
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,380
in that game and I get scared because I read it and I say bald and gay me. I

722
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,280
think it's talking. I think it's saying something about me, but you're neither

723
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,940
bald nor gay or yourself. Imagine Twilight Zone kind of oh yeah, what if

724
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,260
I what if you were bald?

725
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:13,860
Imagine a world this man lost all his hair, this man stuck in a prison of

726
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:20,560
sexuality and lack of hair. Well, the weight prison sexuality, no hair,

727
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,560
Okay. Well, it's about me. Twilight Zone reboot would be good for us, too. We

728
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,560
could kind of pick up the pieces of the Jordan Peele. I didn't watch it. It was

729
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,160
a bad. Apparently, it was bad. I don't watch it either, but I saw they had

730
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,360
Camille Nangiani in it. Yeah, and he played the funniest comedian in the

731
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,760
world. And I said, wait, this is a documentary.

732
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,760
I think if Jordan Peele did something in this past few years and you haven't

733
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,560
heard about it once and probably must be really, really bad. It must be

734
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,060
really good. People like him. But what is when you were a kid? Yeah. What is

735
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:53,900
is the kind of thing that you slaughter so slender is I mean they already made

736
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,880
that game. Oh well, okay slender man in the seven right, okay, I understand now

737
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,860
yeah with the question. So the question is like should be a game of should be a

738
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,740
game of yeah, okay, like what's not even scary like because I wasn't scared of

739
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,940
the teacher when I was a kid, I guess not by a pedophile. They already did

740
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,460
that with hello neighbor. That's what it's about kind of yeah. It's like a

741
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,620
it's like the pedophile neighbor next door like that's what you're scared of,

742
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,520
but my neighbors weren't pedophiles. They were just old old guys. You wear masks.

743
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,100
My neighbors were my friends. Yeah, I like my neighbor. My neighbor was a

744
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,660
really, really scary. All my neighbors, except for Mrs. Boyle.

745
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,780
You had a Mrs. Boyle. You can imagine exactly what you looked inside. Oh, my

746
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,020
God, yeah, I really can, but when I was a kid, you know what I was saying?

747
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,020
Here's what I was saying. I think she died. That's sad. I think Jerry lives

748
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:44,300
there now. Here what I was thinking was, yeah, two things. One is either like

749
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,800
that your parent like you go over to somebody else's house and they throw up

750
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,640
and you have to go. They have some yeah

751
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,140
and you have to stop there from getting sick.

752
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:00,040
You know you go over to somebody else's house yeah and they have like weird

753
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,080
rules right like I hated that. Yeah, you know it's maybe even worse than that

754
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,340
when you're and maybe you I mean I think you maybe you might have been a

755
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,440
different type of kid than me. So maybe this didn't bother you so much. Okay, you

756
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,980
go to your friend's house and they're talking back to their parents.

757
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:19,860
I mean, if you listen, you just assume that I like disrespect, okay, I'm just

758
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,440
not sure because me personally, I would never have talked back to my parents.

759
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Yeah, I was a respectful and polite child. Of course, I followed the rules.

760
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,780
I had most nasty children in my life man, but you know you call their moms

761
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,860
bitch. Yep, that was maybe one of the most horrifying things. How's that

762
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,980
possible? Because how can you do that? I even beyond just saying do this do that

763
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,620
yeah, please yeah, what are they your slave? No yeah, no, it's your mom raising

764
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,760
you, that's your mom and your dad popped out of them. That's your papa, that's

765
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,780
your papa and your mama. What do I call my mama papa because I popped out of

766
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,640
her that's right and I know you call yourself the papa as you popped out. I

767
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,960
call her the puppy dad mom say hey puppy

768
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,580
okay,

769
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:06,580
so I saw an old ass guy struggling up the stairs with with the Walker and I

770
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:10,500
called the F slur by a guy with a Walker today. Damn or not. I guess you're kind

771
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,520
of a new style of guy that the old head can't quite comprehend. This is old is

772
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,920
old fucking guy. It was the same guy. He was struggling up the stairs and he was

773
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,640
his back like

774
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,000
he had a hunched back or he was about to walk up the stairs and then a guy's head

775
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,080
was a guy walked up to him and went, you need help poppy and then you laugh.

776
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,660
That guy just this guy would not have liked that. No yeah. Imagine it like

777
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,060
just imagining a kind of a Clint Eastwood style old guy being called poppy. You

778
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:40,320
Any help, Poppy? I think this is the same guy that Joe and Alex were telling me. They were

779
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,560
filming something outside and he was like, because I think they told me he had a cane,

780
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,920
and he was like, "What are you guys filming?" And they were like, "Oh, we're just filming

781
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:58,840
a short whatever." And then a person walked by who was wearing really short shorts and

782
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:04,340
like a really short pink top and he just like went like, oh my God,

783
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,640
I think it was probably the same guy because they said that it was a veteran

784
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,120
with a cane. The tragedy of being an old guy like that and you're in New York,

785
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,860
man, you're torturing yourself. And I gotta say this guy, that situation, this

786
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:23,780
guy called me a fucking F word, yeah, and just like that to his self, yeah,

787
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,720
and I was a little bit like I mean it's always little weird guys who you could

788
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,720
row around that do that. It's always old guys who know that they have immunity.

789
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,880
Because if I'd ever... You can say whatever you want to me, if I touch this

790
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,040
guy, I'm the bad guy all of a sudden, 'cause I killed a man. But this guy,

791
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,120
he looks... He looks just about the gayest guy I've ever seen in my life.

792
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:53,400
He has... His head is at complete dick height. He's like, could be fully

793
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,840
roly polyed into like the perfect sex position. I mean, this guy could be

794
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,000
manhandled and should be manhandled. So that's what I was saying. I guess this

795
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,680
guy is is internalized homophobia. I guess when I first thought of it, I was

796
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,400
thinking, okay, maybe I guess being a being an old racist homophobe guy who

797
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,880
lives in Brooklyn. Yeah, that's that might be like being allergic to bees and

798
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,080
being a beekeeper. Yeah, you should probably get to go somewhere else. You're

799
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,160
saying they should be in charge. Well, I'm saying that's what it might. I'm

800
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,520
saying that's what it might be like right, which the beekeeper isn't in

801
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,900
hard to the bees. He works, he works with them. He doesn't work, but I think

802
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,100
maybe it's more like their bodies. I guess maybe it's more like you are the

803
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,800
bee, because if you sting someone, well,

804
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,540
what do you expect? You die. Yeah, you're first you die, because again,

805
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,340
you're going to give yourself a heart attack. If you got to move somebody,

806
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,660
your stinger comes off your body, you die, but you'll be a keeper gets stung

807
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,100
by a bee. It's like, well, what do you yeah, you don't go? Oh yeah,

808
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm the beekeeper. Yeah, exactly. I'm walking around. I'm the beekeeper. He

809
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,620
maybe it's actually the other way around. He's stingy and I go

810
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,780
whatever I guess you're an old guy. This is happen. I he calls me that word and I

811
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,180
say this has happened to me hundreds of thousands of times.

812
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Now come here and I'm going to take your honey from yeah. Come here, get

813
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,620
some honey. I'm going to massage you till your honey comes out. I'm going to

814
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,340
find your girlfriend and flip her over.

815
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,900
How about that? That's what you have to say to an old guy like that. Oh, you

816
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,380
think I'm gay? I'm going to fuck your girlfriend. Yeah, yeah, let me see your

817
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,340
girlfriend. I'll I bet your girlfriend's ugly and old yeah, I have sex with her.

818
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,440
Yeah, you're the gay guy having sex with old women who look like men by that

819
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,040
time, but she how white and thin their hair is. The thing is, because if she's

820
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,660
dating this guy, she'll probably say yes to have sex with me, because it's such

821
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,380
an upgrade. Because you look like him? No. No.

822
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:43,220
No. I don't look like this guy. I don't know. It could be a lot of reasons why

823
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,220
you said that. I don't look anything like this guy. Why are you saying that one

824
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,620
thing you said? And we were, I was, both of us was white. Okay. Well, that adds

825
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:56,080
kind of a sinister tent to the situation. How is white on white crime?

826
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,240
That's what you're saying. Yeah,

827
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,280
kind of

828
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,580
I don't even know kind of know what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing

829
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,320
the rest of the day?

830
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,820
I have an exciting package coming in the mail that I can't tell you what it is,

831
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,000
but I'm going to send you a picture of it when it arrives.

832
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,340
What I just don't want to say it. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's

833
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,720
excited. It's really exciting. I think you might like it. I'm very excited

834
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,160
about it.

835
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,480
Can I guess? You can guess. Well, okay, I'll give you one. I'll give you I'll

836
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,280
tell you, you know, I'll give I'll give you this. It's an outfit.

837
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,960
Damn,

838
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:40,080
that's actually exciting as fuck. Yeah, I have to basically do some Photoshop and

839
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,520
go to the grocery store. I need to buy new pants. My pant I was in. I bought

840
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,400
some new pants yesterday as part of this outfit, not these. Oh, not this. These

841
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:55,820
old. No, I this this new outfit. Is it a job outfit? Yes, yeah, I like this kind of

842
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,980
thing. The why don't I dress up like I have a job anymore? That was this job.

843
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm like I'm more excited about this outfit than I've been excited about any

844
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,820
outfit I've ever had. I'm so happy. I'm so excited to see this. It's not for the

845
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,060
podcast either. So nobody ever said until it's I had to buy pants. Tell me if you

846
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,180
guys went to the any of the D. C. Shows

847
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,080
the first two shows. I did them with a giant rip in the crotch of my pants that

848
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,360
I'm worried that people saw we wearing on these yeah. I was wearing on these,

849
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,320
but they were black undies and blue jeans briefs or boxers

850
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,100
or boxer briefs or do they have brief boxers

851
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:38,440
here's what brief boxers are their boxers that only last for a moment. Yes,

852
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,920
like this leading on yeah, edible, but edible underwear are brief boxers. No,

853
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,960
you don't even have to eat it. You snap your fingers and you they they poof

854
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,800
away. Yeah, they blow away like a like a do when a guy turns to dust in a movie

855
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,760
that's scary,

856
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,120
but it's beautiful in terms of romantic sex.

857
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,660
That would be nice if I could because I the thing is I like taking my shirt off.

858
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,260
I like taking my pants off hate taking my socks and my underwear. Let me do

859
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:10,460
this. Yeah, I don't care if they're single use here's now. Here's the

860
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,940
problem with this design. I'm thinking of you're in a work meeting you're up

861
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:18,120
presenting in front of every in front of the office. Obviously, you got pants on

862
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,600
yeah, but you know maybe you're expecting to have a little fun after work in the

863
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,680
car with one of your co workers and which that's just a random detail. That

864
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,360
doesn't matter,

865
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,160
but you have these under, but maybe you have these under. Maybe that's the

866
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,280
reason you have these underwear on or maybe you just mix it up, but maybe

867
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,680
you're going to have sex in the car with your co worker in the launch break, but

868
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,380
then maybe you give the presentation and about how you're going to switch over a

869
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,020
new system and your boss says, wow, that's great. It seems like it's going

870
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,640
to be so easy to switch over in the new system. In fact, I think we'll be able

871
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:53,280
to switch just like that right in front of everyone. Everyone sees a bunch

872
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,040
underwears worth of dust falls right out of the legs of your pants.

873
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:01,520
Here's the other scenario. I was thinking if you have these clap or the

874
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,240
snap on snap off underwear, they're only snap off. I don't know if you can

875
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,280
use snap, but that's another good idea. They got the metal snaps. Yeah, that

876
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,700
that's that would help me a lot. Yeah, you go to a

877
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:18,740
poetry reading. Oh, be a poet. And you're wearing hundreds of and your character

878
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:23,780
is underwear man. Yeah, right. You might be good for just make sure your poem

879
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,980
isn't too good, 'cause over a hundred snaps and you're done. Or maybe you

880
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,020
ate a...

881
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:34,580
You ate something crazy right before you got there and you shit your pants.

882
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:38,460
but you say luckily I have under one will hold I have underwear on under and I

883
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,820
have these giant wide leg dickies where if it wasn't for these underwear, these

884
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,260
things would go right down there, but then there's a very rude patron at the

885
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,900
bar who says

886
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:52,700
excuse me, bartender, bartender, yeah,

887
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,060
I'll have a me or tea pain yeah.

888
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:02,740
What about a shoe where it has like a Chinese suicide net around it, so if poo

889
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,380
falls out your pant leg, it catches it.

890
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:08,580
Why would you want to cat then it was roll into your shoe?

891
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,480
Well back to the drawing board at this one, I guess

892
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,120
I like the idea. I do think we are

893
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,640
okay. Here's an idea. I thought of a while ago. There's another poo shoe

894
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,380
related. Yeah,

895
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,780
it's a shoe on the bottom of it. It has

896
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,280
reversed

897
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,520
like a stamp pattern. Okay, Caleb was here. Cameron was here

898
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,420
you can step in dog poo

899
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:41,600
make stepping in dog poo fun and marks your territory. I like that yeah or you

900
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,300
know you can put whatever, but a stamp shoe where you can step in poop.

901
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,700
That's a great idea or you step in the sand and it shows yeah, yeah, well

902
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:53,580
mostly my ideas for poop. So what do you well the water mud away the sand water

903
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:56,460
you're going to wash the poop away. No, this what is it what I can be or it

904
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,860
could be concrete like for walking in wet concrete. Yeah, well, so there's a

905
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,800
lot of ideas, but mainly the ideas for poop

906
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:08,440
I do think that so zooming out a little bit yeah. When was pants invented?

907
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,160
Well these pants are so small from all the way out here. It was zoomed out.

908
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,920
Oh that's funny. Yeah so I bet that well could you consider a loincloth of pants?

909
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:25,240
Or is that underwear? That's a skirt. Yeah so I would probably say they didn't

910
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,900
reinvent that until

911
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:33,500
9000 years ago and the shirt, my guess, the shirt was probably a couple years

912
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,440
after that right. I feel like the shirt maybe came before pants because

913
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,160
I feel like you could cover everything.

914
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,600
Yeah, well, but I guess I don't know why I think that, but it feels like maybe

915
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,600
that's true. I can imagine someone winning the pooing around. Yeah, you're

916
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,760
probably right. You cover up the stuff. More important stuff to cover up, but I

917
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,520
was thinking maybe they have a, they're holding, no yeah, you're right. I'm

918
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,740
look up when pants came out, but it's been,

919
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:04,020
you know, near thousands of years since we had a big clothing item invented

920
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,980
between the 13th and the 10th centuries BC.

921
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:14,820
So that's okay. I'm not so far off. Yes, three thousand years ago, a few

922
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,260
thousand years off. Yeah, only three times longer. You wanna see what the

923
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,380
first, the oldest known dressers look like? Yes, I do. I do want to see them.

924
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,000
I've seen people wearing these. Oh yeah, that looks that looks amazingly modern.

925
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,040
That is crazy. Those are like those ones that have the like the ridges on these

926
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,040
are like Kanye West things yeah yeah, I've seen I've seen Patrick wear these

927
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,580
pants. No doubt yeah, which by the way Patrick you've been really quiet today

928
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:43,100
kind of a joke for the audio listen. Yeah he's not can't see that he's not

929
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,380
yeah yeah he's not here. He's in solitary confinement yeah yeah

930
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,980
well, that said, do we have anything to plug? Oh well, there's a huge episode

931
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,020
coming up next month.

932
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,120
You can't say much else about the battle of the century, September

933
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:05,720
twenty-seventh. It is kind of the this is a bit of a stop gap episode, but it

934
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,620
will be the opposite of this one in every single way. The actually I had I

935
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:14,320
forgot that we I had a list pulled up. We obviously we were not going to do it

936
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,720
now, but I can't. Oh, well, I completely lost. I was going to say we could read

937
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,620
something from it, but what was it I closed it?

938
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:24,020
It was I don't even remember morning.

939
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,320
This is truly a throwback to the very beginning of the podcast. You and me at

940
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,820
work. I mean I just I don't know thrilling conversation that I didn't

941
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,320
even remember that I had or anything on my phone to look at

942
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:41,120
was great. It's wonderful. This was special. This was special. Yeah. Thank

943
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,420
you. Well, that's that bye y'all.

944
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
you woke up immediately.

945
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,320
Yeah, here's what happened in the dream.

946
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,800
I was outside, there was lightning striking all around.

947
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,760
I thought, I should go inside so lightning doesn't strike me.

948
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,620
So I start to run inside.

949
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,800
Then lightning strikes near me.

950
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,380
I think, oh, I'm safe.

951
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,380
It only struck near me.

952
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,380
That was lucky.

953
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,920
But then it goes into the ground and it goes, and it goes across the ground like a video

954
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,920
game area of effect.

955
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,920
What if you woke up?

956
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,720
It goes into my body and then it goes up my body like, and I shake around and I fall to

957
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,600
the ground and then my heart stops.

958
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,880
And then I survived and I got up and I said, in my dream I said, "Wow, I thought I was

959
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,840
going to die, but it actually just felt weird."

960
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,240
What if you woke up from that dream?

961
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,920
That's how in real life you'd say like, "Sheesh."

962
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,320
If you woke up from that dream and your finger is just in your outlet in your forehead.

963
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,880
You're doing sleepwalking.

964
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:37,240
You woke up and it's like, you're like, your nightstand is here, your bed is here.

965
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,360
I moved everything out of the way.

966
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,240
I'm chewing on my phone charging cable.

967
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,240
fell down perfectly into the outlet on the wall.

968
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,840
My outlet shaped, hole shaped, finger shaped.

969
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,340
Well, you have a hole with your finger in your mouth.

970
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,240
I know you, you sleep with your finger in your mouth.

971
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,740
Scratch your balls, put your finger in your mouth.

972
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,140
I wonder if I've ever done that myself.

973
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:07,340
You know when you, it's your butt and then you stick your fingers in your mouth.

974
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:08,240
We all do it.

975
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,340
I don't do that.

976
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,540
We all do it, man.

977
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:14,800
You don't have to be afraid to admit it. Okay, I do it. You're right. I do that

978
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,220
shit.

979
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,820
I stick it in my mouth.

980
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,620
What is up with you? Disgusting

981
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:25,220
the mall

982
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,520
train

983
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,120
while you're like looking around

984
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,420
your Christmas shopping, your Christmas shopping for your girlfriend, you're in

985
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,520
the middle of Victoria's Secret. The woman's about to walk up to you and

986
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,120
you're just going

987
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,120
it

988
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,960
I was like a like a like sound is an apple. When you put your finger,

989
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:46,640
your

990
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,640
*laughing*

991
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,640
*laughing*

992
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,640
*laughing*

993
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,980
(explosion)
