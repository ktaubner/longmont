00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Last time on Trebuchet Vill-

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
[Laughter]

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sorry.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, Orc Tank.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,880
Our heroes attempted to pitch their wild and wacky idea for an amusement park called Idiotland

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,780
Stupidville to some of the richest creatures in Gal Gadot, the largest majority orc city

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,240
in the Terrifier Kingdom, built from the bones of long dead Kaiju Manji.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,600
Prior to going out and pitching to the orcs, the gang leveled up to level 3, among the

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,640
most important levels in 5th edition.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,880
Dogen spit in the face of his dirt god, but no dirt came out, because he was mad that

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,320
Dogen tricked him all these years into chewing dirt to commune with him.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,520
So he did not chew dirt this time, and that's why no dirt came out when he spit.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,920
He has become an oathbreaker, so it means he's renouncing good for an evil paladin.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
And he's turning to the evil Oreo God, who is now canon.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Dogen the Oreo God.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
As of last week, his name is Dogen also.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Dogen the Oreo God, yeah.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
Okay, and I knew that too.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Dogen the Oreo God.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Oreos, God. Oreos.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,420
You should change it to Duncan.

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,920
Duncan?

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,420
Dogan.

25
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,920
Duncan.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,420
The Oreos, God.

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Patrick Yodar decided to learn-

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,420
Duncan's a different God. That's the Donuts God.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,420
I said that.

30
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,920
Patrick Yodar decided to lean into the inquisitive archetype.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,920
He was choosing his roguish archetype, so he chose inquisitive.

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Perhaps his curiosity and his penchant for mischief and shoplifting

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,920
have made him more wary, more observant, and more cautious.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,680
cautious, although there are things he still remains painfully unaware, like the growth

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,300
spurts of the verdant.

36
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,840
Evil Steevel got some spells, while the Nards sit at the top of the kingdom, and King Nardwar

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:17,520
has outlawed slavery throughout the kingdom.

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,040
The orcs love of slavery defies its decree.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Yeah!

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
And that's the pitch that the gang made.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Who's doing that?

42
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Wow, there's going to be anybody at the sound design on this D&D campaign.

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,040
It's so immersive.

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Slaves!

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
Slaves!

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
I love slaves!

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Slaves are so awesome!

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Go slaves!

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Slaves!

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I want slaves in real life!

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Patrick, what are you saying?

52
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Pat, why are you saying that?

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Pat, why did you say slaves are cool?

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Pat, did you say "I want slaves in real life" really quietly?

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
No.

56
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Why did you say that, man?

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
It's weird.

58
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,040
The five orcs in the orc tank are going to be slaves.

59
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Slaves!

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Slaves!

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Slaves!

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Slaves!

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Slaves!

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,440
Five orcs in the orc tank questioned the adventurpreneurs, challenged their metrics and their vision,

65
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,460
and eventually made several offers.

66
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,240
The one that most intrigued Evil Stevel at least was the offer of two fish from and/or

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,240
for the giant walrus that wandered into the orc tank arena of Getsumdum about a year ago

68
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,040
and hasn't moved since.

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,920
In Orc Tank, when you accept an offer from one of the orcs, you have to fight them in

70
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,320
in combat. If you win, you can take their offer. If you lose, you die. Also, if you win, you

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,000
can take their offer, but you can also field additional offers after that are still on

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,200
the table. No one's ever fought, no one's ever taken an offer from the giant walrus

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,400
because the walrus never really makes an offer.

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720
Yeah, we were the first ones.

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,320
You guys are the first ones. It's a big deal.

76
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
It's called being a trailblazer.

77
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,160
Yep, that's right. We're the first ones who had a good enough idea for the walrus to make

78
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
an offer.

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
We're breaking the glass ceiling.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:50,360
we rolled initiative earlier in the evening so the order here we definitely

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,320
we it's not a trick or cheating or anything yep no earlier because people

82
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,160
will think it is we're not fudging the story of the game no each got dirty 20s

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,720
no it's not true patches isn't making these up off the top of his head to tell

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,040
the story he wants to tell well I'll re-roll right now

85
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll re-roll no I got a 19 you are the only you are last in the order the

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,440
walrus is second to last okay you want to re-roll I just re-rolled I got 19

87
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm happy being last all right Sullivan goes first I'm gonna shine from behind

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,640
actually so Sullivan does not go first he does he got a 17 plus 2 and so that's

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,880
Well, they're tied then no cuz camp Sullivan has a better initiative initiative bonus than me

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,040
We are we can't take we're nice. I have an initiative bonus scene is what I rolled before you do have initiative

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,280
I didn't actually roll a 19 just so I rolled a 12 and then what's my initiative bonus?

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,720
It's on your character. So your character sheet check it out

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,140
It's probably I think your decks is pretty high. Yeah, probably like plus

94
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,020
uh... of my initiative but we're lost three

95
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,620
plus three so i rolled a twelve plus a fifteen yes yet you're still in the same

96
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,220
spot because i'm sure you're in you

97
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,760
uh... don't ever taken at nineteen i didn't roll in nineteen just now i was

98
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,220
joking and nineteen is what i wrote letter so it's all to record this the

99
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,980
first time

100
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,940
i don't know yet i did okay okay so in that case in solvent is blood actually

101
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,380
before

102
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,860
after you because i know

103
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,620
he better be

104
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,380
I didn't know that, I thought you got a 17.

105
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Please don't hurt him.

106
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,300
I actually have plus 6 initiatives, so Sullivan's actually after me.

107
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,180
So the arena is about like, you know, it's about like two football fields by two football

108
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,180
fields.

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
It's pretty massive, right?

110
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,540
It has a whole crowd of people from the city.

111
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:53,940
You guys and the walrus, so you see the other four orcs of the orc tank sort of walk towards

112
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,180
the side of the arena and go into like a little private boot box to watch a fight.

113
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,100
The walrus sort of is just kind of like confused about what's happening.

114
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,500
That's good, we got a surprise attack.

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Yeah, and you guys are sort of in the middle right now of the arena and you see an announcer

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:23,180
go "Ladies and gentlemen, now the giant walrus versus..."

117
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,180
What do you guys call yourselves?

118
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,180
Uh, Stevel's...

119
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
The three best friends.

120
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,180
No, Stievel's Angels.

121
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,180
No, it's not Stievel's Angels, it's uh...

122
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Evil Stievel's Angels.

123
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,180
I'm gonna have you both roll to see if you can persuade me.

124
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,180
Uh, maybe it's uh...

125
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,180
What about the good guys?

126
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,180
How about Stievel's Angels?

127
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Dogen's Devils.

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,180
What the fuck?

129
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,180
All of you roll a persuasion check.

130
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,180
yodelers.

131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,180
We're gonna need some more dice out here.

132
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,180
Get the 20. There it is.

133
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,180
Patrick Yodar?

134
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,180
How'd you do?

135
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
17.

136
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,180
Patrick Yodar has a +8 on persuasion I know.

137
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,180
So unless you get a crit.

138
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
No.

139
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,180
Patrick Yodar is gonna be able to decide what the name is.

140
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Our name is uh...

141
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,180
Steevels Angels.

142
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,180
It's uh...

143
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,180
Patrick's Angels.

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Patrice's Angels.

145
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,180
The worst name I've ever heard.

146
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm fine with that, he split the difference.

147
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
And Patrice's Angels!

148
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Patrice's or...

149
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,900
See, it doesn't really roll off the tongue.

150
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,780
It's not a very good name.

151
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,100
I think maybe, hold on, we want to change the name.

152
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,780
Maybe if we have a bad name, they'll underestimate us.

153
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,780
It's maybe a good idea.

154
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
It might be strategic.

155
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,620
If we get a bad name, hold on, I've got a worse name.

156
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,620
The Poop Guys.

157
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,620
That's a better name.

158
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,620
The Poop Eaters.

159
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,620
That's a way better name.

160
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,880
The shit fuck the homeless guys

161
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,740
homeless guys homeless guys

162
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,380
three three homeless guys three homeless

163
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,060
And three homeless guys

164
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,220
Technically true. Yeah

165
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,400
Where I fucking live you said a bush once

166
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,100
Hardly a home

167
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,160
it's so uh... yeah it's so

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,220
initiative starts of the walrus has like a position in the turn order

169
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,820
but he doesn't really know what's going on

170
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:28,600
so uh... dogan you definitely have a opportunity here for uh... a surprise

171
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
round

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,160
uh... ok all would have an opportunity basically for a surprise round

173
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
uh... again

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,720
yeah i'm going to just i'm gonna surprise round i'm going to attack

175
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,540
the walrus with my war hammer which is not a shovel anymore because i don't like

176
00:08:42,540 --> 00:09:02,020
and

177
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,520
lazily just sort of

178
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,940
wobbling back and forth is getting a little wary of you but not really sure

179
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,900
what's happening. Okay well I rolled a seven.

180
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,140
Okay, a seven.

181
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,080
Plus what?

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880
A seven. A seven total? A seven total, yeah.

183
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,980
Okay, you

184
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,340
trip.

185
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,380
He has a low arbor class. Oh no. You just sort of trip and like your spoon goes

186
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,260
flying out. And hits him? And uh... just like five feet in front of you. And it hits him?

187
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,100
does not damage does not hit him he gets your about a dozen feet in front of the

188
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,980
walrus

189
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,380
who is now just kind of just like

190
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,660
he's just kinda like confused and a little startled by you

191
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,620
uh... it's Sullivan's turn

192
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,840
uh...

193
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,460
Sullivan sort of like looks at you guys and says like

194
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,780
should I

195
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,500
should I attack him?

196
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,460
yeah what do you think? Sullivan don't attack him we why would you attack

197
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,060
we want him to invest in our idea

198
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,440
but the rules to go listen go up

199
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,900
get real close to him

200
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,620
okay give him a kiss right on the lips

201
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,580
i don't

202
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,940
come on go ahead

203
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,820
right between the tusks start pushing him by his butt just like pushing him in

204
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,700
uh...

205
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,260
stop puckering up you got some chaps there you want me to kiss him? yeah right on the lips he's about to be your boss

206
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,380
wow uh...

207
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,820
alright so he's gonna have to i guess roll an attack roll i guess to do that

208
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,540
I guess it's an attack roll.

209
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,980
He does anything we say.

210
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
Pretty much.

211
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,180
Alright, where are the d20s?

212
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
There's one right here.

213
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,220
Oh, thank you.

214
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
Okay.

215
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,340
Start emptying out more of the dice bags while I roll.

216
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
So we can just...

217
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
I'll empty your bag.

218
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,780
Don't say that.

219
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,660
Okay.

220
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,580
So he goes to like, at the very least, embrace the walrus.

221
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,140
And with that, um, uh, you can get all the audio of that.

222
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,140
That's a good sound.

223
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:05,100
Yeah, and with that, uh, uh, solid zero, like that eight with no bonus on it, he, uh, he

224
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,100
instead sort of like, accidentally like grazes his hand just across the walrus' stomach and,

225
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,580
and uh, uh, the walrus is sort of like, "UGHHH!"

226
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
What are you doing, Sullivan?

227
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Walruses hate that!

228
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I'm sorry!

229
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
I didn't mean to do that!

230
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
We said to kiss him, what are you doing?

231
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
I tried.

232
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Oh my god.

233
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
I got nervous!

234
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
How do you, how do you fail a kiss?

235
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,980
- Have you ever kissed before?

236
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,880
- We're gonna take you out tonight.

237
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,380
- Oh God, he's never kissed before.

238
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,400
- We're going out tonight.

239
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,220
After this is over, we're going out tonight,

240
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,420
we're getting Solomon his first kiss.

241
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,220
- I think technically I'm still, I mean,

242
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,940
I'm not saying this solo--

243
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,140
- Technically they're still married, I think.

244
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,540
(laughing)

245
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,380
So, yeah, but we don't remember.

246
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
- Yeah.

247
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,400
- That's why you're too loyal.

248
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,580
- Too loyal to what?

249
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,940
what yeah I don't know I remember something but nothing sorry I was zoomed

250
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,620
out in the moment somebody ever wants to tell me if I if they think I did the

251
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,620
attack role as the option for kissing right I think that makes sense but I

252
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,900
thought it was funny I would love to know okay now it is so far okay

253
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,980
Patrick's turn so far you've done no damage to this walrus that doesn't even

254
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
know it's fighting.

255
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
So I'm curious.

256
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,980
I'm going to shoot it in the head with a bow and arrow.

257
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Yeah, go for it, brother.

258
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,480
Yeah, this is a...

259
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,700
Let's think of this as an investment.

260
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,860
I guess I don't really...

261
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
I really don't understand.

262
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,060
Are you trying to say something cool right now?

263
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Yeah, I was.

264
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Did that work?

265
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I don't know.

266
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
You have a plus eight in charisma.

267
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
I don't know what's happening.

268
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,980
Say like, "I'm going to invest this arrow in your damn baller's brain."

269
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,480
- I think this arrow's like on a chart of sales.

270
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,780
It's like an arrow that goes up on sales.

271
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,040
- You're about to be in the red.

272
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,960
- What was that animal in that book

273
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,880
that's been going around, Moby Ditch?

274
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,120
- Moby Ditch?

275
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,620
- Yeah, it's one of his fucking dirt books.

276
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,460
- Ditch Whale.

277
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,320
- I think it was a dirt whale, yeah.

278
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,880
- A dirt whale?

279
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,360
It's kind of like a worm?

280
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
- What are they saying in that?

281
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
Maybe I could--

282
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,220
- What does this have anything to do with--

283
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,060
- I was gonna pull a quote here.

284
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Call me announcer, call me dirt mail.

285
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,060
And he's loading his crossbow I think!

286
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Look I, I, I, I need it.

287
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
The whole audience is booing you.

288
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,060
It's the most boring fight of all time.

289
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
Ah shit, alright, alright I guess I'm just gonna.

290
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060
Touch the walrus.

291
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Guess I'm just gonna shoot him with an arrow.

292
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Sixteen.

293
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,060
Check your plus, it's pretty good brother.

294
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Uh, it's your crossbow, I can also check on mine.

295
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,060
my hold on let me just pull that up

296
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
um

297
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
oh wait

298
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
he's talking that whole time didn't even pull up the crossbow

299
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,060
it's plus 5 so it's a 21

300
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
oh shit

301
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
uh that hits 100%

302
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
yeah in his head?

303
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,060
uh if you yeah I would say if you wanted to hit in his head it does

304
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
I did say I was gonna hit his head

305
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
yeah you did so it's 1d6

306
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
oh 1d6

307
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
1d6 and then we're gonna add 3 to that

308
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,060
6

309
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,060
damn ok

310
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,060
so yeah you just like are babbling about random shit

311
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,620
And just like like just casually launched a crossbow on the walrus. He's just

312
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,300
and just like

313
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,640
Like it just screams like bloody murder

314
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,340
He's now kind of aware of what's going on

315
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,420
I would say evil you see you want to lower my voice there evil. I would say it's Europe

316
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,800
You still get you still the surprise round is still going on. Yeah, it's all happening within the same six seconds

317
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,620
I did not realize the the walrus would be so mad at that

318
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,440
I think I'm gonna want to use Chill Touch.

319
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Hell yeah.

320
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Um, to try to take out the crossbow bolt and then stick it back in in the same hole.

321
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Ooh.

322
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,640
I will allow that.

323
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
You should try that shit.

324
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Okay.

325
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
So...

326
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,960
I don't, I, I, that sounds fucking cool.

327
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,240
What do I roll here?

328
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Um, you would roll...

329
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Attack roll.

330
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Alright.

332
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
A one.

333
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Ooh, crit one.

334
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Oh my god.

335
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
- Oh my God.

336
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,480
(laughter)

337
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,820
- The, uh, you take out the crossbow bolt

338
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,140
and you pat his head with a chill touch.

339
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,380
(laughter)

340
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,220
Whoops.

341
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,460
- That was really, actually really kind of you, Steevel.

342
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,800
- My non-dominant chill touch hand.

343
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,120
- Level three changed you.

344
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,580
- I don't have a lot of control over it.

345
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,700
- You're a nicer guy now.

346
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,620
- So, yeah, maybe I became a little bit sweet.

347
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,120
Maybe I've been evil this whole time.

348
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,960
Level three changed me.

349
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
- Sweetie Steevel.

350
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,920
That's a rough, yeah.

351
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
- The walrus. - Evil Sweevil.

352
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,600
- Evil Sweevil. - Evil Sweevil.

353
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,040
- Sweetest Beevil. - Sweetest Beevil.

354
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,040
- Sweetest Beevil. - I don't know,

355
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,520
we'll come up with a new name later, it doesn't matter.

356
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,160
- This arena has made us, it's very flustered I think.

357
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
- Yeah, something about this really.

358
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,920
I got a lump in my damn throat.

359
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,080
- Yeah, I think, Ken, our stage fright.

360
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
- It's the stage fright. - Oh my God.

361
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
- Butterflies in my tummy.

362
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,080
- Will you guys stop talking?

363
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
- Oh, that guy's part of the audience.

364
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,220
- Come on, guys, like, head's exploding with anger, he's not seeing blood.

365
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,420
- I forgot about my stage fright.

366
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,980
- So the walrus is now up,

367
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,620
who he is, I'm gonna give him a chance to attack in this case.

368
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,140
He's going fucking nuts. He's going to go after Sullivan, 'cause Sullivan's right in

369
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,940
front of him.

370
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,860
And I think, is that how it's arranged on that? Yep, it's just Sullivan.

371
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,300
So let's see how that goes. Wow, he got a crit one.

372
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,980
So he tries to body flop on Sullivan and instead he falls backwards.

373
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,780
He just like goes "RUAAAGH" like he hasn't fought in so long.

374
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,420
He just rolls backwards like "RUAAAGH" he's like on his back.

375
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,140
He's all upset.

376
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,540
He's like so upset about it.

377
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,180
I can't wait.

378
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,260
I like, can I real quick just like walk up to like the middle of this like kind of fight

379
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,980
that we're trying to have.

380
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,300
Yeah.

381
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,220
Just look at everybody be like "What are we doing guys?"

382
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,060
Yes.

383
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,660
I mean we've just been-

384
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,460
As a reaction, you're doing a speech.

385
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,960
Just barely, just whiffing punches point blank.

386
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,560
Just looking at- just fucking slipping on banana peels and shit.

387
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,460
Hey, I hit my target. I don't know about you guys.

388
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
How about this? Not you, but how about this?

389
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,160
What if we just call it a day?

390
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,960
We just restart. We just go-

391
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Walrus, you still want two fish, right?

392
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Alright, listen here buddy. I'll give you two fish if that's what it's gonna take.

393
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,460
Roll... God, I don't know. Persuasion on the walrus? He doesn't know what fish are.

394
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
He doesn't know what fish are?

395
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
He kind of knew.

396
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
He said the word fish.

397
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Oh yeah, I did do that, huh?

398
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Wannick?

399
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,460
(laughter)

400
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,460
You know what? Never mind.

401
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
With that "wannick" the walrus just like...

402
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,460
Like you're like wandering up to the walrus.

403
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,460
He's like on his back, like whining.

404
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,860
He just fucking farts in your face.

405
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,100
(laughing)

406
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,660
Not even on purpose.

407
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,300
- This is getting worse by the second.

408
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,660
- He just like farts.

409
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,220
- Yeah, I'm starting to taste that.

410
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,420
That is disgusting.

411
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,260
That is one of the grossest things.

412
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
- Oh God, I was gonna say.

413
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,300
- It tastes like two fish.

414
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
- You know, we're outside too,

415
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,940
and the fact that I can taste it is just awful.

416
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,300
- It's like he farted in a sedan.

417
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,780
God damn.

418
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,940
With the windows up.

419
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,140
Yeah, you know it tastes a lot like pickled onions. Can you taste that?

420
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,540
The giant walrus has the ability to hold his breath. That's like a known ability.

421
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
He holds his breath.

422
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
For 30 minutes.

423
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
What?

424
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Yeah, I'm running in a circle and like a green cloud of fart is following me in a circle.

425
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,540
I think the cloud's forming a fist.

426
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,880
Alright, I'm going to say that the walrus, which typically has a multi-attack, is not

427
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,620
able to with that one.

428
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,140
So I'm going to say we're going to go back to the top of the order.

429
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,420
Dogen, you're up.

430
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,980
Okay, alright, this time I'm going to make this count.

431
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,100
You're still, yeah, you're definitely still, like, you're close enough that you can try

432
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
to hit him, I would say.

433
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,580
I'm going to, you know what, I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds.

434
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
Alright.

435
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,340
I'm going for it.

436
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,060
Tell me about Inflict Wounds, brother.

437
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:32,740
Well, basically, you know how like when you take an Oreo and you twist it apart?

438
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,780
Yes, yeah, I'm familiar.

439
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,100
So it's like that, but I can just take a, just, you know, just like the cookie part of an Oreo,

440
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,140
I just have one of those in my pocket and I put it on their skin and if I twist it,

441
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,940
it can pull out, like it can like peel them apart.

442
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,460
You can pop their heart.

443
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,260
You're in a temple of doom, this poor walrus.

444
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,820
It's the only thing that's gonna work, okay?

445
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,020
Okay, I believe you.

446
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,100
Yeah, roll a melee spell attack.

447
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:01,100
*laughter*

448
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
That's crazy!

449
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh my god.

450
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,100
How did it do that?

451
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,100
We can't even count that.

452
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,100
It was as no number was up.

453
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
Non-NA.

454
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,100
Okay, that is a 13.

455
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
That absolutely hits.

456
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Okay, that's...

457
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
That's 3d10 necrotic damage.

458
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Yeah, okay.

459
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
So, get wicked wild with it, brother.

460
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Let's find you a d10, yeah.

461
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,100
You can just roll one three times.

462
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,100
No, you gotta roll three at once.

463
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
You gotta roll all three at once? Yes sir.

464
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
That is...

465
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
24.

466
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
God damn.

467
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
Can you describe, like I'm gonna give you free reign

468
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,100
to describe what you do with that kind of damage.

469
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Yeah, well I do the Oreo thing

470
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,100
and it just like takes out like a cylinder

471
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
of like blubber

472
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
of like

473
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
and it just, it looks

474
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
and I pull it out and I take another Oreo

475
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
cookie and I put it on the other side

476
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,100
It's like a 100x stuff Oreo filled with walrus blubber.

477
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,000
- Yeah. - Do you eat it?

478
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,640
- Hell no, that's disgusting.

479
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
- Why not? - Oh my God.

480
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,300
- I only eat Oreos with cream.

481
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,720
- You feel the dark presence of the Oreo God

482
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,540
like times wobbly. - And these times

483
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,520
blubber is clean.

484
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,880
- I put it, I put it, here's the, I put it in my bag.

485
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,440
I'm starting an Oreo collection.

486
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,360
- Okay. - That's my character's

487
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,320
new twisted thing is he collects the flesh

488
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,520
of everybody in Oreos.

489
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,200
- I'm gonna add that to add to your inventory.

490
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
- I turned it into a-- - It is one of the

491
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,120
weirdest things I think I've seen.

492
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,160
Well, I can't help it, I'm evil now.

493
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,300
Yeah, this is like a new turn for this guy.

494
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,800
Blubber Oreo.

495
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,520
I don't know, I think I'm not used to it.

496
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
I think maybe--

497
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,400
You'll get used to it.

498
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
Yeah, as time goes on, maybe I'll become used to it.

499
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,160
The thing is, it's still the same old me.

500
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,000
I just do weird stuff now.

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
Yeah, no, that is not the same old,

502
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,200
you just made Oreo out of walrus fat.

503
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,680
I would have done that before.

504
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,440
While the walrus--

505
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,280
While the walrus was still alive, too.

506
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,800
I'm just more confident now.

507
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,080
Yeah, the walrus, he's screaming in pain.

508
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,160
I mean you've beheaded a guy but we've all done things but

509
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,260
Yeah they should say one more thing for me. That walrus is still alive.

510
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah well I didn't kill it.

511
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,920
Oh I guess okay I mean I'm not gonna kill it. Yeah rather I killed it. Now that I'm thinking about it

512
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,300
you didn't kill it Knight. It's fine. I'll just heal it later too. Well

513
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,460
I guess it's my turn in the game. Go Sullivan.

514
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,860
Go Sullivan. Eat your birthday.

515
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,800
Sullivan is going to do. We're gonna party like it's Sullivan's birthday.

516
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,500
I wish it was Sullivan's birthday. Drink Bacardi like it's Sullivan's birthday.

517
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,700
Sullivan is gonna do a uh... instead of trying to kiss the guy, he's gonna do

518
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,580
um... fairy fire.

519
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,580
So um... this walrus has to uh... Instead of trying to kiss the guy, he's gonna do fairy fire.

520
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,380
Alright.

521
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,460
You know, you're gonna be thankful if it goes well, I'll tell you that much.

522
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,380
So the walrus has to try to

523
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,700
avoid the fairy fire if it's coming towards it.

524
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,180
and he does console vans

525
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,860
uh... spell spell d_c_ is not very good

526
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,080
so solvent russic s very fire on them

527
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,160
and the walrus is just able almost like sees the lake blue sparkling energy

528
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,820
that's gonna like wrap around and create a guys all advantage and sort of like

529
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,260
uh... that's it away with a flipper

530
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,140
and i think it's a man in the crowd you suck up

531
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,860
that's what i say when i see guys i'm about to thank solvent about you really

532
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,500
thankful that i have a nice dot is anyone in the crowd ur it gets close to

533
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:23,080
like a child and then dissipates right before it reaches it and Sullivan's now

534
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:31,820
gonna do gonna gonna look to Patrick Yodar and he's gonna say Patrick Yodar

535
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:38,920
you are you will go far in this fight tonight it rhymed yeah and he said that

536
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,300
because he gives you a bit of bardic inspiration so it was beautiful I

537
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I actually, uh, actually really, can you write that down for me?

538
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Uh, yeah, uh...

539
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,300
I have a little bit of parchment in my back pocket if you could...

540
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Okay, yeah.

541
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,300
While I'm attacking, can you just write that down?

542
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Yeah, absolutely.

543
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
And then I'll put it in my back pocket and I'll just...

544
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Yep.

545
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Do you know how to write?

546
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Oh, yeah, I'm one of the few who are literate in Trebuchet Village, so...

547
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
You know how to write?

548
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Yeah.

549
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Is there another way I should say that?

550
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Are you lying to me? I think you might be lying to me.

551
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
I'm not lying.

552
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,220
Can you read? I can read, yes.

553
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,380
I can't read every language, but Common for sure.

554
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,300
Can you do complex calculations?

555
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,580
Yeah, that was what I was going to ask next.

556
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,100
Well, that sort of depends.

557
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
How complex?

558
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I did want a general score.

559
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Yeah, he's lying.

560
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
What number am I thinking of?

561
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Yeah, answer that.

562
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,100
While this is going on, I'm like...

563
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Six?

564
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Absentmindedly just like...

565
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
No.

566
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Oh, that's the number I'm thinking of.

567
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Zero.

568
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Oh.

569
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
My favorite number.

570
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Well...

571
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,940
All right, so I launch you while while that's happening. I'm so consider shooting. Yeah, yeah, so roll d20 you also have us now

572
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,100
You have a cat one bardic inspiration. You could use as well. Okay. Do I have to use it right now?

573
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,540
No, you can use it whenever you want. It's a d6 to any ability check or attack roll. Okay, or that you do

574
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,180
All right. I think I'm just gonna go plain here. Yeah, go for a plane plane shot

575
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,860
You can use it after the roll, but before I declare the result, okay

576
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,180
17 again. Yeah, we lost five that's for sure. Yeah, we're damage. So that's a d6 again

577
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:20,920
Three plus three so there's six damage to this walrus it walrus is not looking too too hot right now

578
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,320
You guys are just chipping away at it

579
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,020
So it's just like

580
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,460
bitch now it's a walrus his turn so he's gonna get up and he is gonna try to

581
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,300
belly flop again this time on Dogen because Dogen took out a chunk of his

582
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:53,820
flesh so see how he does that's a natural 20 oh man so that's gonna be a

583
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:02,540
crit so let's get the give me some d8s at least one is fine no okay so I'm

584
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,420
I'm gonna roll this a few times.

585
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,260
- Uh oh.

586
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,660
- Okay, that's not so bad, it's a one.

587
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
- Oh, okay.

588
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,220
It's another one.

589
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,060
- Oh baby.

590
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
- All right, you're getting--

591
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,980
- Oh dude.

592
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,540
- A five, okay, and another one.

593
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,060
- Oh my god, dude.

594
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,220
- That could have been very bad.

595
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,380
Instead, you take 14 damage from that.

596
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,220
- 14?

597
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,040
- That could have been--

598
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,460
- What are you talking about that could have been,

599
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,460
That's pretty bad.

600
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,020
That could have been, I mean it could have been anywhere between...

601
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,460
Alright, I'm at 11.

602
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,380
You got this, bitches.

603
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,700
I believe in you.

604
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
38.

605
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Mmhmm.

606
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,900
And, uh, kinda closer to what we got this time.

607
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,740
Alright, so, uh, now he's gonna go after you again, since the body flop went so well.

608
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
What?

609
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
He's gonna go after you again with his tusks.

610
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,900
Um, so he's gonna roll a d20, let's see how he does.

611
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,580
Is he trying to bite me?

612
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,900
He's gonna try to like just like fucking gore you.

613
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,860
His mouth is going towards me?

614
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
His uh yeah yeah.

615
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,180
I hold out the oreo that I made out of gum.

616
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,100
Oh you gonna make him eat his own damn food.

617
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
He's gonna do it himself.

618
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,580
Dude it's it's up to him.

619
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
All right.

620
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
You gonna make him eat a snack man out of himself?

621
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
It's his own choice.

622
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
You gotta figure out how that resolves.

623
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
You gotta.

624
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,380
Wow it worked.

625
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,300
It worked it worked in the universe we live in now.

626
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,140
We got a crit one.

627
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,500
He yeah wow amazing.

628
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,180
So he goes to get you, and he sees his flesh, and you watch his eyes well up with tears.

629
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I think he thinks it's his son.

630
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,620
Yeah, his son is a little Oreo.

631
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:46,140
If you had Walrus POV right now, you would see it becomes like a baby Walrus.

632
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
It goes "mrm, mrm".

633
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,140
And he just stops short of attacking you.

634
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:59,940
It just rears back and just like is thinking more than a walrus has ever thought before.

635
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,100
And now it's Evil Stevel's turn.

636
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Okay.

637
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
You said he's not looking so good?

638
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
No.

639
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,900
Alright, I'm not going to waste one of my awesome super spells on him.

640
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,940
That's what I call them.

641
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,940
I'm going to use...

642
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,620
Yes sir.

643
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm going to use Ray of Sickness.

644
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Fuck yeah, dog.

645
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
Problem?

646
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,980
That's so funny you had that in your...

647
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Ray of Sickness.

648
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Describe to me Ray of Sickness.

649
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
Ray of Sickness is I mean...

650
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,980
I don't know.

651
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
I've never used it before.

652
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Hell yeah. I guess we'll see. I'm guessing it's gonna be

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
like a green beam of vomit.

654
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,980
It literally says a Ray of Sickening Greenish

655
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
Energy lashes out.

656
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Yeah, so I'm pretty smart. So it'll come out of

657
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
my hands like kamihamiha

658
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
and it will hit him.

659
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
And I guess he gets like sick in a couple days?

660
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Uh, yeah.

661
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,700
I mean he basically on a failed save he'll get poisoned so it's a it's an attack

662
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:03,220
Plus it does damage right? Yes. Oh, yeah, it does damage. So roll roll a d20 to see if it lands and then I'll see if I can save

663
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,740
Shit balls

664
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,740
There we go - fuck

665
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,940
You shoot this ray of sickness out

666
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,620
And it just sort of like dissipates as it's reaching towards him

667
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,440
and he's still like staring like sort of like he's hearing like a

668
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,720
Like a Mazzy star song in his head as he's like zoning out

669
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:38,220
Can't believe that he like saw his own flesh before him. I think he didn't notice I went

670
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,220
able to do another turn

671
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,440
Nice try pretty funny, but it's Dogen's turn okay

672
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,660
I okay now it's time to get really evil

673
00:29:52,660 --> 00:30:00,900
the crowd hears that and goes like nuts when they hear so I hold the Oreo over

674
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,220
the spot that it came from and I'm trying to hit it in with the shovel to put it back into its place

675
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,220
like hammering in a nail

676
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
this is awful

677
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,220
and I'm and I'm gonna do this attack on every enemy from now on

678
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,300
Wait, plus what though?

679
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,380
Seven.

680
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
That hits.

681
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
A seven hits?

682
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
Oh, you got a seven.

683
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
I think you said plus seven.

684
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
No.

685
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
No, no, no.

686
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
A seven.

687
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,380
So you go, "Can you tell me what happens if this fucks up?

688
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,340
Because it's pretty funny."

689
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,260
I hit my thumb with the shovel and it puffs up really big like a cartoon.

690
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,260
And I go, "Ouch!"

691
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,020
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
You go, "Yeah!"

693
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
Yeah, exactly.

694
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,020
I start hopping around in a circle.

695
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Yeah, the walrus is still in a daze.

696
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Sullivan, it's Sullivan's turn.

697
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,020
And after his, the terrible showing of his fairy fire,

698
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,020
he's instead going to take out his knife, his dagger,

699
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,020
and try to just stab the walrus.

700
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,020
As it worked for him last time,

701
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
the last time he stabbed, he stabbed the brave lion,

702
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,020
so he's going to try it again.

703
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
D, 20.

704
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
There's two right there.

705
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,520
there you kidding me there's one right there oh no wait nevermind it's not d20

706
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,880
here stupid oh my next time next time we'll just have the dice there's one

707
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,760
right there for and okay that is six or nine that's a six and that hits that's

708
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,120
whoa this guy's AC is cuz plus three that hits and so solvent is gonna need a d4

709
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,200
so it's a triangle the pyramid the triangle fucking all right and let's see

710
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Yeah he does.

711
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,700
He has a four?

712
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,200
Nice, Sullivan!

713
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
So Sullivan runs up to this thing,

714
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
after you try to like, knock the flesh and hit your thumb,

715
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,200
it's like you pull back, and Sullivan rushes in,

716
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
and then just like goes like,

717
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
"AHHHHH!"

718
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Just starts stabbing him in the stomach,

719
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,560
uh... normal

720
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,920
like finally snaps out of its days after seeing its own flesh after all these

721
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,080
failed attempts at attacking it

722
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,480
and uh... assault asserts damien sammy and stamming it

723
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,880
the walrus starting a really fucking pissed off

724
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,160
uh... you're up

725
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400

728
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,800
and uh...

729
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,040
i just i look at the crowd

730
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,640
like they bruise

731
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
and i point my arrow

732
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
at the whole

733
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,480
I'm just like you know like windmill swinging my arm like huge balls huge

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,200

735
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,780

00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:47,440
yeah right they're all chanting your name huge balls 18 that fucking hits

737
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,840
oh god I can I just do one lick of damage and then I hope you can

738
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,420
What? D6 for damage?

739
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,280
Yes. Okay. And we get a...

740
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,000
Preview. Roll again.

741
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,860
There's two. So bad at rolling it onto the table. You just shoot at him and yeah it goes in the hole and just like

742
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,780
you almost can feel, see the arrow like nestle in there like it's a fucked up thing and the crowd is going nuts

743
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,420
and the walrus is like "No, no, no!"

744
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,940
I think it's just like so upset about it. I just, all I do is I look at it

745
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,520
put the arrow like into my back and just

746
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,580
flip it off

747
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,580
that's gonna do psychic damage oh yeah how much do i do i roll for psychic damage

748
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,340
no

749
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:34,100
not quite uh... how bad is the walrus looking

750
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,460
he's looking pretty bad a couple more hits i think he's gonna die uh... yeah he's

751
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,780
definitely looking bad

752
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,820
he looks like shit

753
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,320
walrus ass i say that to the crowd

754
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,860
this walrus looks like shit right now yeah this walrus looks like shit

755
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,740
which you big ass buck teeth. Yeah look at this stupid ass walrus. Yeah he looks so awful.

756
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,220
He looks like shit. Can we roll for psychic damage? Yeah guy he looks like shit. He looks

757
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,900
terrible. If we bully him. If we bully him. I don't care about bullying him I just want

758
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,140
the crowd to cheer for us. I'm just saying for the long game. Yeah kill his ass. I still

759
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:13,140
have stage fright though. Fuck that walrus. The walrus is. Get it out. What what what what

760
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,420
hours no don't don't do that to him it's the hardest feeling. It's a humongous stadium right now.

761
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Just picture everybody in the crowd in their underwear. I mean I know half of

762
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,060
them are already in their underwear they're orcs but I mean picture the half

763
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,260
that is not in their underwear specifically in their underwear. All right

764
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:44,180
all right I think I got it okay. Man you are the most beautiful woman I have ever

765
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:50,540
a scene you have humongous breasts imagine it's all guys

766
00:34:50,540 --> 00:35:07,180
actually you know what never mind I think I think the response that was good

767
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,220
The crowd is loving this we're gonna make a t-shirt of this phrase later.

768
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Hey! Get him out of this hotel!

769
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Woo!

770
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Like it's just, it's silly.

771
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,220
That's our new pitch.

772
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,220
I got this for you.

773
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:30,220
T-shirts here! Get your t-shirts! Get me out of this hotel t-shirts!

774
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,220
So anytime you finish a joke just say, "Get him out of this hotel."

775
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
I got it.

776
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Alright, so the cowboy hat's gonna add to that.

777
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
Thank you.

778
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
You're welcome.

779
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Uh, it is, uh, the walrus's turn.

780
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,220
[laughter]

781
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,220
So he's gonna try to belly flop on--

782
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,220
You're gonna be called to get him out of this Hotel Jones.

783
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:56,220
He's gonna wander over to, to, uh, uh, he's not really close enough to get to Patrick, I just realized.

784
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,220
So he's gonna try again against, uh, uh, this time against Sullivan.

785
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Let's see how he does.

786
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,220
Okay, so that hits our poor Sullivan, our poor sweet Sullivan.

787
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Let's see how he does. Alright.

788
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,220
Uh, yep.

789
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,220
-Oof. -Oh ho ho.

790
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
Alright. Uh, that's one.

791
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,220
-Oh boy. -Oh no.

792
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Alright, two. So, Sullivan takes a...

793
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,220
Uh, oh god.

794
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Sullivan takes 16 points of damage.

795
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
He is down to 2 HP.

796
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
This walrus just body-fights.

797
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,720
I was like, "Ahh! Ahh!"

798
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,220
Solvin's like trying to run away wherever he goes, the shadow's following him.

799
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,720
And eventually he just like...

800
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,520
gets crushed.

801
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,220
And the only thing that saves him is that he goes directly into the hole...

802
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
[laughter]

803
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,720
...that Dogen made.

804
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,720
And now the walrus is gonna try to gore Solvin.

805
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,220
Is he stuck in the hole?

806
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
What?

807
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,720
Well, he's stuck in the hole, how can he gore?

808
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,220
He's gonna go back out.

809
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
His legs are sticking out of the hole.

810
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,720
Yeah, his legs are wiggling out of the hole like a Winnie the Pooh thing.

811
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
He's like, "Ahh! Ahh!"

812
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,920
So if the walrus attacks the hole, he's gonna attack himself with his big tusks?

813
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,520
I would say potentially.

814
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
That's pretty bad. Does that hit Sullivan though? Because he has a...

815
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,320
So the walrus could be inflicting damage upon himself right now.

816
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Right, or Sullivan could be like biting the walrus from the inside.

817
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
It does hit Sullivan, unfortunately.

818
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
So...

819
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,720
This is... I mean, I'm just gonna...

820
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
There's literally no possibility...

821
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,120
Maybe when Sullivan falls...

822
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,320
Sullivan might be dead, so I should roll for that actually.

823
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,160
When Sullivan dies, maybe he voids his bowels and it gives the walrus sepsis.

824
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Let's see...

825
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,080
What if Sullivan dies?

826
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,800
Is he just gonna straight up die?

827
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
He might.

828
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,400
Like, not like unconscious, like die?

829
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Let's see, 'cause that was...

830
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
That can't happen.

831
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Oh my god.

832
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,920
2 plus... what was that second roll?

833
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
It was a... yeah.

834
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
I don't know.

835
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
I don't remember.

836
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
It was actually a negative one.

837
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Okay, he almost died, but he didn't die.

838
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,520
He is knocked out, though.

839
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,280
Uh, yeah, if you get negative your full HP, I consider that death.

840
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,180
That's how I do it.

841
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,240
Oh my god.

842
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,080
So he almost died. He was about two hit points away from dying.

843
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,400
That's really scary to me.

844
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,120
Uh, yeah.

845
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,160
I'm gonna fuck this guy up.

846
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,000
Solvin is knocked the fuck out.

847
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,080
Uh, that was the walrus's turn.

848
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,000
Uh, still in the hole, just...

849
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,280
Yeah, the walrus just like, somehow like, fucking like, gored him a little bit with his tusk from the hole.

850
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
I mean, Solvin just like, stopped moving.

851
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,320
You just see these like, frog legs dangling from the hole inside his body.

852
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Um, but yeah now it is your turn Evil Stevel.

853
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
Okay. Um.

854
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
*clears throat*

855
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Let me get my book of spells out.

856
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I will use...

857
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Ah, my book of spells is loading.

858
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
*laughter*

859
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Uh.

860
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
Is, uh,

861
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,320
It's gonna, for me it's gonna be, uh...

862
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Yeah! Get him out of the hotel!

863
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Get me out of this damn hotel!

864
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,320
See, I told you it's gonna be amazing.

887
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,120

902
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,960
second pitch. Just that sure. I mean you guys saw how funny this was. So I think you do

903
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,720

905
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:31,160
to

906
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,000
kill this thing or just knock it out with inflict wounds, which is why I think this rule by

907
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,720
5e is crazy, but I like it.

908
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,320
Yeah, I'm knocking it out. I'm knocking it out by the milk goes into the hole, the milk

909
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:52,040
drips into the same disgusting hole, and the milk goes into the walrus's bloodstream, and

910
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
it becomes unconscious.

911
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,200
Yeah, it's just like it as you do that

912
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:08,320
Just like it that walrus that can't say anything but sometimes fish just say lactose

913
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:15,560
it's just like collapses on the ground and the audience goes fucking nuts and

914
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,640
these

915
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,220
Goblin medics run out and they like prep the walrus and like revive it and it just sort of like wakes up days

916
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,820
It is like starts to charge you guys. I've been like one of them like when they got ones holds a fish up

917
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,820
I mean

918
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,860
Like feeds it a fish and it's like sort of calmed down a little bit

919
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:39,100
And you see the other orcs come out you see the announcer come out and the answer goes the winners are

920
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:46,980
The poop eaters it was that three homeless did three homeless guys. I didn't remember sorry three homeless guys three

921
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500

923
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500

so, it's not allowed here

925

926
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
so you guys can go with the walrus

927
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
with your

928
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
extremely confusing offer

929
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
or you can talk to the other orcs

930
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500

939
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,940
uh... reporting is said

940
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,540

941
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,940

942
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,180

maybe a fucking go out for once maybe don't stay in the stadium

946
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,900
that's what i have a lot of what i thought i had a hotel

947
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,900
it's not a big it's not a funny anymore. You owe me 600 dollars. You owe me 600 gold coins.

948
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,180
This guy is like a little kobold, he's like scurrying away. He's like scary. I can see you.

949
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,800
Cameras, get this guy. Follow him out of the stadium if he tries to run away.

950
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,540
He owes me 600 gold coins for saying his catchphrase. Yeah, follow him out of the stadium from a really low angle.

951
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,980
Yeah.

952
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,620
Get up in there. So do you guys, are you guys gonna... He's wearing nothing but a kilt.

953
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,260
You can clip through it. Get under the kilt.

954
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,800
Are you guys gonna go for the walrus

955
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,000
or do you guys wanna do other offers?

956
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,040
I think honestly,

957
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,880
I think we should feel more offers.

958
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,720
Here's my idea.

959
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,600
Here's my idea.

960
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,020
We feel more offers, we now sweeten the deal

961
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,920
with the let me out of this hotel t-shirt line.

962
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,840
What do you think?

963
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,680
Yeah, we can sell it at the--

964
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,840
Well, we sell it at the park.

965
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,680
Yeah, we can sell it at the park.

966
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,280
Okay, all right, and okay.

967
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,680
We could have a ride maybe called Escape the Hotel.

968
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,840
Yeah, it's the haunted hotel.

969
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,920
Escape from Hotel.

970
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,560
Escape from Hotel, that's a good name.

971
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,920
And it's haunted.

972
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,840
And they could have little cardboard cutouts of me.

973
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,000
Like I could be the like,

974
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,440
you must be this tall to enter a ride.

975
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,920
- It's a good one, and then maybe--

976
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,440
- And I could be like one of me that says,

977
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,040
we're going to Burger King, baby.

978
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,140
- Yeah, that, and then I think maybe like,

979
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,000
you know like the ride starts out,

980
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,600
so you get into the hotel.

981
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,320
- Yeah, and you're in a car.

982
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,960
- You're in a car, you get into the hotel,

983
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,120
and maybe I'm one of the people that says,

984
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,280
enjoy your stay, if you dare.

985
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,560
- That could be good, that could be really good, yeah.

986
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,560
Can I be like the old-timey prospector before you drop off the log flume?

987
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Well yeah, well I mean, you see Sullivan is trying to write all of this damn thing.

988
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Are you getting that? Can you write?

989
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,560
I'm trying, I'm trying to keep up with all of it.

990
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
I still don't know if Sullivan can write.

991
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,560
I think this is a good idea because the fish thing didn't really make any sense money-wise.

992
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,560
I think we should field at least one other offer. I'd be open to two.

993
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Yeah, I think one offer is good.

994
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,320
is good. I say I want to talk to Mr. Awful. I think that's our guy. I want

995
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,280
I want there to be I want on in this escape the hotel ride I want there to be

996
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,880
one one room where you can buy and sell drugs on the ride. Yeah that's a good

997
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:16,120
idea I think maybe I think maybe Ola the the the what did that orc lady I kept

998
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:23,280
yelling it. Yeah that was her name her name was Ola. It was Ola? It was Ola. H-O-L-A?

999
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:32,280
It was OLA. I was trying to avoid that sort of thing, but yeah. I mean I was trying to avoid that sort of thing, but yeah.

1000
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,280
What sort of thing, Sullivan? A Hispanic name? You don't like saying them?

1001
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,280
The DM's brain breaks.

1002
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
You got a problem with Latina baddies?

1003
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,280
No, none at all.

1004
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,280
What do you think, Steve?

1005
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:53,400
So, so Patrick thinks we, we, we fight Ola. I'm saying Mr. Awful, you're a tiebreaker here.

1006
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,040
Or you could make it even harder.

1007
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,560
There's also Venni Vidi Vici.

1008
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,160
I don't want to make it harder.

1009
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,160
Or I guess you could also fight Gelatinous Cuban, but he has never...

1010
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,360
But I am pretty interested in Gelatinous Cuban.

1011
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
[Laughter]

1012
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,040
But I don't want to make things harder for us, so hey.

1014
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,360
I think Gelatinous Cuban is now seven and a half feet from you guys.

1015
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,960
- You guys, listen, here's my thing.

1016
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,040
First of all, he's right there.

1017
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,880
Right, second of all, it might be fun to jump in him.

1018
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,720
- You know what, you know what?

1019
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,540
You know what all you gotta do

1020
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,380
is throw a little bit of sand at him.

1021
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,220
- Really?

1022
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,360
- Yeah, try it, try it right now.

1023
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,040
Try, pick up some sand off the ground and throw it at him.

1024
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,360
- Okay.

1025
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,440
It just goes into him.

1026
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,040
- Oh, I just, he got bigger.

1027
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,480
He got a little bit bigger.

1028
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,640
- Yeah, didn't it look cool though?

1029
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,480
- It did look cool.

1030
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,520
- It is an extremely easy fight

1031
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,240
if you fight gelatinous Cuban

1032
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,720
with no clear offer for what you would get out of that.

1033
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,240
I, I, I'm going to attack him right now.

1034
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,480
I think if we could sweeten the deal, if we take out two of them.

1035
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,280
We could sweeten... What? What would the deal be? What are you talking about?

1036
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,240
I mean, there's one of them. First of all, there's one of them.

1037
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,160
I feel like we would be doing them a favor if we just killed... I think we'll sweeten the deal.

1038
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,560
We take out Jalat and Escubin. We've already taken out the Walrus.

1039
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Two of them.

1040
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,760
Three won't want to fight us.

1041
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,760
You know?

1042
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Maybe you'll be-

1043
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
But we have to fight them.

1044
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
We have to fight them.

1045
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,760
What's the problem?

1046
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,120
Well, yeah, but you know, maybe she has a chance, you know, if we go with Ola or whoever.

1047
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,120
Oh, it is a girl.

1048
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
Okay, alright, then the girl.

1049
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,260
I want to kill a woman.

1050
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,260
So we don't want to-

1051
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,560
You'll kill her or you won't?

1052
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
I want to-

1053
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,560
Alright, so-

1054
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,840
I only will kill women.

1055
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
So here's the question.

1056
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Alright.

1057
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,960
Do we fight gelatinous Cuban-

1058
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,240
I don't think we do.

1059
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,200
Show that we can fuck up gelatinous Cuban so bad and the whole time we look at Ola and

1060
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,680
this will happen to you. Did you see how I mean all we have to do hey Ola you see

1061
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,880
what we just did to that walrus we're gonna do that to you that's it that see

1062
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,960
yeah but if we knew it twice I mean you know maybe the first time she thinks

1063
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,400
like oh it could be a flip. I pick up Patrick Yodar and I throw him into gelatinous cube.

1064
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:00,320
Alright I'm with him I think we go with Ola. Alright. Ola or so Ola over

1065
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:13,400
Kevin? Sure, yeah. Okay. So. Ola. Now. No, I'm just saying hello. I... pause. Como, como

1066
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,640
estas? So with Ola, if you guys want to go for Ola, she's like kind of the only

1067
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,960
like legitimate like business person in the platonic ideal of business that

1068
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:34,540
people espouse right? Mini Vidi Vici is more of a BC guy. Kevin Ritterfin and Mr.

1069
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:42,280
Awful are criminals. Ola is the first orc to have done magic in like a hundred

1070
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,200
years and has built a legitimate business. If you go with her she will

1071
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:55,160
offer substantial capital but you will also want probably around 40% control.

1072
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,960
Is that a good or bad?

1073
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
I think it's good.

1074
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,960
Whose phone is that?

1075
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,960
That's not my phone.

1076
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,960
I don't know.

1077
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Yeah, they just keep, they do it every 15 minutes.

1078
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,960
Oh, they're going to do that every 15 minutes?

1079
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Yeah, yeah, because they keep pushing it.

1080
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:08,960
They can only give you a three hour flash flood warning.

1081
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
That's so cute.

1082
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,960
For every 15 minutes, they think that it will continue to be a flash flood.

1083
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
You guys might be stuck here.

1084
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,960
Yeah.

1085
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
For the folks at home, we're recording this inside our house.

1086
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
During the day, we're recording this.

1087
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
We're recording this.

1088
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:16,960
We're recording this.

1089
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
We're recording this.

1090
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
We're recording this.

1091
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,960
We're recording this.

1092
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
We're recording this.

1093
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,960
We're recording this.

1094
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,960
We're recording this.

1095
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,400
were recording this inside during the worst hurricane in the world which

1096
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,720
apparently I had no idea was happening I didn't even yeah I didn't have an

1097
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,600
umbrella I had to wear I mean I brought number one Caleb shirts right now yeah

1098
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,720
it's really great I did I did do some shit to my pants just to you just sit in

1099
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:51,360
your hands what that's not a beer that's right yeah the claw yeah you know what

1100
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,400
that's good for you guys that's a good point that is not a good idea

1101
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,400
no it is how still tell not to do that all you can do a lot of finding a fun

1102
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,780
way to inform the audience as to what's happening

1103
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,000
i love that he's doing that secretly and this is serious and comfortable yeah i

1104
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
did that i know we're at the party you change your pants it's sparkling water

1105
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,360
so it is a man balls around fire you know it's a good

1106
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,440
it

1107
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,040
but what

1108
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
You just ruined your mic in some way.

1109
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
I shut it off. I was pretending to be like,

1110
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,040
"Oh, you know what's the coolest feeling in the world?

1111
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,040
Putting your balls in sparkling water."

1112
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,040
What? What are you talking about?

1113
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Why did you turn your mic off?

1114
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,040
I turned it off because I didn't want the audience to know.

1115
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,040
It'll make sense when the audience...

1116
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,040
No, it won't. None of this is going to make sense.

1117
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,040
This is going to be the part where they tune back in

1118
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,040
because they're like, "What the fuck are they talking about?"

1119
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
I tuned them back in.

1120
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,600
I guess I'll have to get credit there.

1121
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,040
So I think my failure at doing a bit brought the people back.

1122
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,720
So you guys want to fight Ola?

1123
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
I guess if we have to.

1124
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm going to kill that.

1125
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,400
You're the one who wanted to.

1126
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,400
I don't want to fight.

1127
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,560
You're the person who suggested it.

1128
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
I don't want to fight again.

1129
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,140
But you were saying we should do two more fights.

1130
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,840
You were saying we should fight two more people.

1131
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,080
Well if we fight, you know, a fight against gelatinous cube.

1132
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,080
We are going to take a long rest no matter what.

1133
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,880
I need to. A fight against gelatinous cube would be nothing.

1134
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:32,760
You need to go home. I don't. I'm the strategizer. You need to go to bed. No I don't. Yes. Okay.

1135
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,160
All right we're gonna take a long rest. Yes. You guys are all gonna take a long rest. I'm

1136
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,440

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,440
Now I can't go into the hotel and ruin my new image.

1140

Yeah, I think you're walking into the hotel and like a magical paparazzi like takes like a magic photo of you.

I know he be fucking the objects!

1187
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,940
I say that really loud when we walk in.

1188
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,940
And you know he be fucking the objects.

1189
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,940
And you know the objects get fucked.

1190
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,940
lovely that's exactly right.

1191
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,940
And I'm also a singer.

1192
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:20,940
She's the only female singer in the land with a full beard.

1193
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:24,940
I don't recognize Evel Stevel and I'm like oh my god.

1194
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,940
Hello young one.

1195
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,940
Would you like to autograph?

1196
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,940
Let's not do this in the hallway. There's paparazzi.

1197
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,940
There's invisible hands all the way up here.

1198
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,940
Let's wait until we get into the hotel room.

1199
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,340
until we get into the hotel room. Oh yeah. So this is the... Lindsay Lovely's been seen

1200
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,140
with Dogen the Oreo.

1201
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:56,920
Yeah. They have a, they have a OMZ. It's just a orc version of TMZ. Just gonna be like, "Oh, did you

1202
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:08,200
guys see this about drinking blood out of a big mug? Harvey Goblin. So it's a

1203
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,880
two and a half star inn so the only... Ah shit. Yeah his dream... That's pretty good.

1204
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,800
Blinky's dream is... You don't know anything about hotels. I think that must be pretty good.

1205
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,960
- It used to be the first three star hotel in Gal Gadot.

1206
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,560
- Well, here's a tip.

1207
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,440
Maybe--

1208
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,480
- Yes, please tell me, my name is Blinky.

1209
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,740
- Here's a tip.

1210
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:34,880
Don't require tips.

1211
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,720
- Here's an idea.

1212
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,540
- That's a good idea.

1213
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,720
- I have a good idea.

1214
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,420
What if you had superstar, pop star,

1215
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,300
Lindsay Lovely performing in your lobby?

1216
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,360
I think that might be--

1217
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,440
- Yeah, I think that is as her manager and as--

1218
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,140
Maybe and maybe she could have a sexual male backup dancer perform behind her

1219
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:58,720
Yeah, I manage both Lindsay Lovely and the sexual male backup dancers

1220
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,820
Temporally, I just need to know when this is happening. Are you Lindsay Lovely right now?

1221
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,640
Is this when you first checked in before orc tank?

1222
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:12,820
No, I we checked in before orc tank and then we came back and I and he because I'm famous now

1223
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,880
He had to throw me in the Lindsay Lovely

1224
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,420
outfit yeah which then people because I have such huge boobs just assume I'm

1225
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,860
famous mm-hmm and so now I'm telling them that I'm a pop star my name is

1226
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:28,860
Lindsay Lovely and I'm wearing tap dancing shoes now and he yeah I have I

1227
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:41,620
have guys guys guys kit I would have to keep re-rolling I mean I got a crit got

1228
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,620
Once we resolve this I have a plan I need to talk to you guys about.

1229
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:52,620
I just want to, before we go any further, I just want to let everybody know I have a magical Bluetooth earpiece.

1230
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,620
Yeah.

1231
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:02,620
So, in 30, so yeah, it takes 10 minutes, no, just the time it takes.

1232
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,620
Because it's not like the sky, it's like a spell, it's not like the sky itself.

1233
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,620
Yeah, it's just permanent.

1234
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:07,620
The sky itself is an hour length.

1235
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,620
It's permanent so you can take it off.

1236
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,460
- Guys, check it out.

1237
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,980
- Yeah, it's just a physical thing, so it just lasts.

1238
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,500
- Okay. - Lindsay, baby.

1239
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,340
- Yes, doll.

1240
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,780
- Tell me, how would you like to come with us

1241
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,100
and pitch a brand new idea to Ork Tank tomorrow?

1242
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,420
We could maybe pitch a new album for you or a music video.

1243
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,540
- Where did the other dwarf go that you were with?

1244
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:27,860
- Oh, oh. - Where did he go?

1245
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,980
- He went to the bathroom.

1246
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,900
- Well, he doesn't like hotels.

1247
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,180
- Yeah, he had to go to the bathroom, though.

1248
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,580
- Yeah, so he's gone. - Oh, get him out of this hotel!

1249
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,740
- Let me out of this hotel is his catchphrase.

1250
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,740
Yeah, his name is E. Westin.

1251
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,740
Because he doesn't like the bathrooms at hotels, so he had to go to a bathroom in the street.

1252
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,740
Of course, Miss Lovely.

1253
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,740
You don't speak for him, he's not here, and he can't address it.

1254
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,740
I'm his manager. You're not.

1255
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,740
He hates going to the bathroom, you know why? Because he hates wiping.

1256
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,740
Yeah, and he makes terrible smells.

1257
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:53,740
None of this is true.

1258
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:55,740
He's actually a pretty normal guy when you get to know him.

1259
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,740
How do you know that?

1260
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,740
How do I? Uh, well, you know.

1261
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:01,740
I mean, famous people, we brush shoulders with each other.

1262
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,740
That's kind of a... That makes sense.

1263
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,740
Yeah, you brush shoulders.

1264
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:15,220
don't brush his ass. I'd brush his ass. He hates wiping. It'd be good to brush someone's ass.

1265
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:19,660
I hate wiping. We could clean in his ass. Yeah with a what kind of like a steel

1266
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,500
brush. I'm done with you. You are fired. I'm not fired. I'm your manager. You can't fire me.

1267
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:30,580
I could be your new manager. You don't fire your manager. You know how to cast disguise spells? Maybe. He doesn't know how to do that.

1268
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,740
- All right, you're rehired.

1269
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,580
- Yeah, that's right.

1270
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,620
- Listen, point is, I think that both of us

1271
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,820
would benefit greatly from me doing a set in your lobby.

1272
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,660
You could pay me some coins.

1273
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,620
- One song.

1274
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:45,060
- One song, one opportunity, one shot in this lobby.

1275
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,100
- And you know, we could go do it right now.

1276
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,140
- I can't think of anything better.

1277
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,540
That's an amazing idea.

1278
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:51,380
- We'll just do the one song.

1279
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:52,820
- Three stars, here I come.

1280
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,100
- And what is it, like, what is it?

1281
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,660
- How long is the song, four seconds?

1282
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,660
- Well, how long, yeah.

1283
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,620
(laughter)

1284
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,700
- How long does the disguise get last?

1285
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,780
- Until you take it off.

1286
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,620
- Definitely.

1287
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,440
- Okay, cool.

1288
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,820
- I mean, until people start to pick up on the fact

1289
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,220
that these are fake boobs.

1290
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,420
Like, my boobs are not fake.

1291
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,260
(laughter)

1292
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,460
Are you kidding me?

1293
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,300
- Yeah, they're size 38G.

1294
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,780
- These are natural.

1295
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,700
- They look like airships.

1296
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,700
- Dwarf with bolt-ons.

1297
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,860
(laughter)

1298
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:22,700
POV.

1299
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:28,820

That is gonna...

1311
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,540
That is gonna get people to come to the hotel.

1312
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,540
We have a wizard who's gonna do a laser light show during it.

1313
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,220
You see a YME, he's like, "What? What do you want me to do?"

1314
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,220
"Hey, hold on, just give us..."

1315
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,420
You go wait inside.

1316
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,420
Anything from the magic fridge...

1317
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,420
Why does he have tits now?

1318
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,420
Shut up. Anything from the magic fridge, you can drink it.

1319
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:15,420
Excuse me?

1320
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,420
Uh...

1321
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,420
Anything from the magic fridge...

1322
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,420
I know it's you, what the fuck?

1323
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,420
Anything from the magic fridge, you can go drink it right now.

1324
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,420
shit okay.

1325
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,180
He just sort of walks away.

1326
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,180
I walk him.

1327
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:31,420
But don't touch the grog.

1328
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,740
Actually everything but the grog you can, the grog is for me.

1329
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,740
Okay fine.

1330
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:44,220
Yeah so you guys want to prep for this evening of song and dance?

1331
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,220
No prep.

1332
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,220
I'm off the dome.

1333
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,260
Like shwe in the morning.

1334
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,740
I've got a dance choreography planned out in my head.

1335
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,740
I have a...

1336
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,060
It's very simple and very in your face.

1337
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,060
I have a I have a keytar made of bones.

1338
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:02,060
I'm the manager but I'm also the keytar player.

1339
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,060
Thorax is on the bass.

1340
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:05,060
Yeah.

1341
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,060
So it's it's it's a couple hours go by.

1342
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,060
Sullivan is security. He stands in front of the stage.

1343
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:12,060
He's not.

1344
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,060
Well who's the drummer?

1345
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,060
There's no sunglasses so he just has two eye patches.

1346
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:21,060
I don't think this is a good idea.

1347
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,020
You know what this is not your show you don't have to worry

1348
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,580
Okay, and yeah, there's a couple hours go by

1349
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:34,460
The power is

1350
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:39,700
Liquor and I'm flashing blinky's warm place is packed it is

1351
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:46,820
10 p.m. On in the evening is prime time for like a late-night show oh

1352
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,480
Oh man, the lights are literally flashing at Caleb Farman right now.

1353
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,760

01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,520
Purple lights.

1363
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,720
Okay, the audience is here.

1364
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:08,200
Everywhere, yep.

1365
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,320
They're purple lights everywhere.

1366
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,040
Purple lights flashing.

1367
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:10,920
Get me out of this hotel t-shirt.

1368
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:16,680
Lights that are flashing between, not knowing that you're him, but it's all coming together.

1369
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,360
The lights are purple and yellow and they're strobing.

1370
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,360
They're strobing between purple and yellow.

1371
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,960
Yeah, you see Wimey weaving his hands together, casting dazzling light spells.

1372
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,960
It makes your head hurt within like two seconds.

1373
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:29,460
Yeah.

1374
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,260
Thorax is starting the bass line to sort of get things started.

1375
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,260
We're doing the sound check right now and I'm like,

1376
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:43,260
"I just can't, uh, I mean, my, uh, yeah, I think you gotta turn the keyboard up."

1377
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,260
Turn the keyboard up.

1378
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,260
You gotta do the keyboard and the bass at the same level.

1379
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,260
Alright, okay, alright. With the same level.

1380
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:53,260
Same level. I mean, I have 15 pedals down here.

1381
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,260
Okay, alright, alright, okay.

1382
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,260
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that goes into this, I think.

1383
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:07,260
He's EQing the audio, raising it up with magic.

1384
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,260
You see Thorax sort of like, looks at you like,

1385
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:14,260
"I don't know why the bass and the keyboard need to be the same level."

1386
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,860
They gotta be the same level.

1387
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:17,360
I literally start the song.

1388
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,360
Yeah, you start the song.

1389
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,360
Look, you gotta pedal.

1390
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,360
The whole crowd is waiting.

1391
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,360
Get a backbone of this band.

1392
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:31,360
Yeah, sure, but it's just literally all we have is a keyboard and a bass.

1393
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:36,360
You see Prince Jumanji in the audience go, "Yay, you guys rock! Woo!"

1394
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,860
Are you guys the three homeless guys still or what?

1395
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,860
No, we're Lindsay Lovely and her three homeless guys.

1396
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:45,580
Lindsay Lovely and her beautiful boy band.

1397
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,140
Lindsay Lovely and the Beautiful Boys.

1398
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:48,940
Okay!

1399
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,940
Alright!

1400
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,900
Alright, you go back up to the room. You're not allowed down here.

1401
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,820
I know! I just wanted to see!

1402
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:57,900
They don't draw X's on your hands down here.

1403
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:03,420
Before we start performing, I need to have a huddle with my band members.

1404
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,580
[Laughter]

1405
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:06,540

1409
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,780

1410
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,780
Nope, we have to do it on stage.

1411
