00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:06,000
I went to the store and I was looking for funny beers and I saw they only have like two of

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,720
this kind of beer.

42
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,640
And I think.

43
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,760
So you figured it was popular.

44
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,160
Yes.

45
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,840
I figured it was interesting.

46
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,680
It's a Corona beer.

47
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,760
You know, everyone knows Corona, right?

48
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,760
but it's a rifadita,

49
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,520
which I guess just means that it has juice in it.

50
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,080
And I think it has like red fruits in it.

51
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,360
- This is a seltzer then.

52
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,120
This is not a beer.

53
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
- I think it's a beer.

54
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,400
- Take a sip.

55
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,220
This is not a beer.

56
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,420
There's no way this has,

57
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,120
this is a malted beverage.

58
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,880
- It's a complete beer.

59
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,960
- Is it?

60
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,320
- Yeah.

61
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,520
- Am I really quiet?

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
No, we can hear you.

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Okay, good.

64
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
What do you have, Rex?

65
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Well, actually, give us a rating.

66
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,080
Sorry, I'm very thrown off right now because of something that we'll talk about in just

67
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
a moment.

68
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,640
It tastes like soap, but I'm not disgusted by it, I guess.

69
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
So it's a 6.1.

70
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
6.1.

71
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,640
And now a numerical scale?

72
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,640
Like a 5 something.

73
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay.

74
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
5.4.

75
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
5.4.

76
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:28,000
All right Rex, what do you have? So I went to the beer store and I chose a

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,680
six-pack of beer that was the most stolen from. So I had to combine two

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,760
six-packs because I figured if people are stealing them that's probably the best

79
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,000
one. I have really bad news for you. These are not stolen from beers. People, almost

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,240
every bodega in New York City, you can grab one beer out of a six pack and buy just one beer.

81
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,760
Well, even better.

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
So it's the most...

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
So I was buying the two six packs.

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
It's the one that people bought the most but didn't want six of, they just wanted one.

85
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,240
And that's perfect because I am not going to have six beers, I am going to have one.

86
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,480
That's right, exactly. So what do you have?

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,360
And that was a Sour Monkey.

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,800
It's a classic, dude. Sour Monkey, Sour Triple. Give it a sip.

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,120
Never have.

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,600
Give us a rating. You never had this? It's good.

91
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,760
Yeah, it's good.

92
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,840
That's like the backyard barbecue sour.

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:35,200
Yeah. I'd say that's like a 6'4". Like a 6.2 out of 10. Very solid. Very reliable.

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,160
Tasty, but not being too tasty. Sweet, but not too sweet. Sour, but not too sour.

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,400
I think they're very high alcohol content, too.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720

98
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Well, guys, I have big news.

99
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,420
What are the news?

100
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,960
There are new rules to groggless ogless.

101
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,160
OK, OK, because my wife has.

102
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,500
And I want this to be on permanent record,

103
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,860
completely given up on groggless ogless.

104
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,400
OK, got a car situation has driven her to problematic drinking.

105
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,020
We're going to put her in some kind of a home away from our home

106
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,620
until she gets better.

107
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,100
But I have now given myself in groggless, ogless beers.

108
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,300
We drank off.

109
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
I have beers we drank off.

110
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,740
So no more in a beer.

111
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,080
All you sober gophers that have been looking at me as your new wisdom king.

112
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,540
That's over. I never liked you.

113
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,920
I always thought you were boring.

114
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,520
I have a margarita. Yummy.

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,760
I made hot stips, margarita, at my house with Hornitos, tequila, it has black pepper notes,

116
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,840
I looked this up on Drizzly, I used triple sec, I made a jalapeno simple syrup, and of

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,160
course some good old fresh lime juice with a tajin rim.

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
- Oh, you already are doing one I've already done.

127
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,080
So it's fine.

128
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,900
- I know, that's what I'm saying.

129
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,740
- Just shut it around.

130
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,560
- Yeah.

- Guys.

132
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,220
- Also, I'm almost done with this one already.

133
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,060
It's okay, I got it back.

134
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,880
- That's like an eight ounce beer.

- Holy shit!

136

137

- It's so small, dude.

138
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,000
- Yeah, that's like a beer for kids.

139

Grab Margarita.

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Yeah, that's ridiculous.

147
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,600

150

I'm going to give this a 7.9 numerical and a 6 foot 10 basketball.

151
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Wow.

152
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
That's yummy.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is yummy, y'all.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think it's the highest-ranking drink we've ever had.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,080
No, I think I rated something a 6'11" the other day. I don't remember what it was.

157
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,680
And we've gone into 7 feet before, I think. Yeah, it might have been a non-alcoholic

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
seltzer. It might have been. Well, yeah, that's a different, you're right, that's a

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,280
different scale. On the alcoholic scale, oh, I think prime, I gave it a 6'11".

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,400
Okay. Bro, there is no way you're eating on the mic during the podcast. Yeah, come on, bro.

161
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,280
We do this for one hour a week

162
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,840
You have 20 or 20 24 other hours you can eat if you count from 11 o'clock last night

163
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,360
Guys, I'm almost done with my my my girl beer. This is a girl beer. Okay, I want to get into the meat of today's

164
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:58,120
Which is y'all I show speed just flashes meat on live stream

165
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,400
What do we think I show me more like that's what's trending on Twitter is I show me

166
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,140
I'm gonna be honest if I did the exact same action as hit my dick would not

167
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,680
Fall out of my pants. There is no

168
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,540
fucking world you could not do

169
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:24,460
You could put a fishing line on the end of my penis pull it as hard as you can and it would not pop out of

170
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,620
my boxers

171
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,860
It might it might do a little a little gopher out of the you know, you might see it

172
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,260
I'm not gonna say it's not gonna make an impact

173
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,460
But it's not coming what looks like 70% out of that thing. I

174
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:45,620
Think the important thing here is that his dick had to already be hard

175
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,340
Right, it's not okay

176
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,860
Watch it again. It's not hard, but

177
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,820
You just now jam pants now here's here is my here is what I will say

178
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,780
His dick was definitely out already. He was playing with his dick while he was streaming

179
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,640
Because and this is not to say that his dick is too small to pop out

180
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,480
It's too big the the bottom of his dick would go past his fly

181
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:19,420
It would not pop out if it was in his pants it flew into the fly

182
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Yeah, is it not already out at the beginning?

183
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,280
No, it's it's it's pajama pants. It's it's got a completely open hole. Well

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,520
There's a lot see this is what I why I wanted to bring this up this is a

185
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,920
Yeah, this is a

186
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,280
Like the what's the name of the JFK footage

187
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,320
There's a pruder film this is a we'll be watching this over and over for years and years

188
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,840
We will have AI remasters of it constantly new information coming out. How did this happen? I

189
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Really don't want us to study it any longer

190
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,880
I don't want to I've seen his dick by this point like about 10 times

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,440
I have to and I don't want to do it in trouble with twitch for this because it does

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,380
Things on YouTube. I mean it really doesn't I

193
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,420
Feel like you're not allowed to flash your penis. You're definitely not allowed

194
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,740
I don't think you're allowed to show your penis anywhere.

195
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,500
… banned for some amount of time. I'm assuming not forever because he probably

196
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,220
brings a lot of revenue to YouTube. But there will be consequences.

197
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,860
How popular is he? He gets like 60,000 viewers.

198
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,380
So popular. He's like one of the top five streamers.

199
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,420
Okay. How many of those are just like 11-year-old children?

200
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,180
I mean, they still watch ads. If you click the #ishowspeed hashtag,

201
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,340
and you just like, just scroll every single video.

202
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,340
It's the same video over and over and over again.

203
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,020
I think he might be done.

204
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,340
- He's not done.

205
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,780
- I think he might be done.

206
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,900
- No, no, no, no, no.

207
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,740
He's not done.

208
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,920
I saw a lot of opportunities in the comments.

209
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,340
This girl says, "Speed should join me on my OnlyFans."

210
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,260
There's a picture of her ass.

211
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,780
- That's dope.

212
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,340
- You are recording, Rex.

213
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
I can see your tiny little mouse voice, the waveform.

214
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,740
- My waveform is like nothing.

215
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,240
- Why, okay, you are in New York, home of the podcaster.

216
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,060
How have you made it two weeks without a single microphone?

217
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,940
- What are you talking about?

218
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,300
I am using, I'm...

219
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,940
Using this Blue Yeti microphone.

220
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,940
But I am on a laptop.

221
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,180
- Can you like talk into it?

222
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,220
Can you put it in front of your mouth

223
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,860
and see if that makes any change?

224
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,480
(sighs)

225
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,840
- Oh no, he's sighing 'cause he has

226
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,340
to hold his microphone, y'all.

227
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,480
- A boo.

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,640
- No, that's too close.

229
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,840
- A little too close, but much, much better.

230
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,640
- I could put it on this laptop.

231
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,480
- Yeah, that's fine.

232
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,960
- But it's resting on the nipple.

233
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,960
- Rex, you've been officially a New Yorker for so long,

234
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,600
at least a week, I think.

235
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
How has it been? How's living in New York?

236
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
It's good.

237
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I haven't talked to you in, I think, a week.

238
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Well, I mean, the really important thing here is that I am not...

239
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't have my actual computer yet, so I'm not gaming.

240
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
So why would I talk to you? I hate you.

241
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
True. Yeah.

242
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
That's true, yeah.

243
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
You have almost no relationship outside of playing League of Legends.

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Yeah.

245
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,600
And even when we play League of Legends, I say maybe five, ten words an hour.

246
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:47,160
Quiet fella. Yeah I'm not I'm not much of a talkative person so yeah you know I

247
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:54,080
did I will say however I did message Julio last night and I said sorry to

248
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,800
bother you if this is too late but would you like to play some video games. That

249
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:06,440
is not what you said. Read it read what I said. Why is this drama? When I gave

250
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,120
- In a minute, when I gave him a minute,

251
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,420
or is it too late for you?

252
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,280
I don't think this is a drama.

253
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,360
- Right, which is exactly what I said.

254
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
- No, that's not exactly what you said.

255
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,920
- That's basically what, I mean, come on, you're being...

256
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,480
- I know, because he's trying to portray himself.

257
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,400
You're trying to portray yourself as though

258
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,560
you're very humble, very, oh, I don't mean to bother you.

259
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
- He literally says at the end of the message,

260
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,640
or is it too late?

261
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,160
- Yeah, absolutely, giving you the ability

262
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,080
to very easily either deny me or--

263
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,760
Did he say anything to this message?

264
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,800
No, he said nothing.

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
He didn't even respond to it.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Wow.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,880
Despite the fact, his shit was green on Discord.

268
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,480
I know he was awake.

269
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,680
My computer is on.

270
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
And I just leave the--

271
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,880
I just get up the computer.

272
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,920
And he's a power waster.

273
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
He doesn't care about the environment.

274
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,680
This is disgusting, man.

275
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,560
This is so fucking disgusting.

276
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
This is why I can't talk to you.

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,120
I have a better story about me hating the environment.

278
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
This past--

279
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,240
- Is this like when you killed all those birds?

280
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,560
- No.

281
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,400
I didn't even kill a single bird.

282
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,840
- You did.

283
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,880
- No, I dumped a bunch of like,

284
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,440
wait, actually now that I think about it,

285
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
so to start with the birds is I just dumped a bunch of like,

286
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
what is it, just spices on my balcony

287
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,960
so they would never like hang out in there anymore.

288
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
- You killed them.

289
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,360
- They kind of stopped coming there,

290
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,000
but they did, I was thinking that they were like

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,540
making a nest on this like old AC unit

292
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,540
that's just like not in use and just in the wall.

293
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,340
And I could hear them like scratching and tapping and shit.

294
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
But now that I think about it,

295
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,300
I haven't heard the birds in a long time.

296
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,060
- That's 'cause they fucking abandoned their babies

297
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,660
that you killed.

298
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,780
- Yeah.

299
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,620
- That's fine.

300
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,300
Anyways, this past Friday,

301
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,300
my landlord came to fix my cistern,

302
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,380
which is-- - Fix your cistern?

303
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,220
- Cistern, which is--

304
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,620
- You guys do that down there?

305
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,460
- It's a hole, it's a hole on the floor.

306
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,720
- Your sister is a hole.

307
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,820
- It's a hole in the floor that just stores water.

308
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,420
- My sister, she had to get fixed 'cause she's a hole.

309
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,260
- I'm gonna keep moving.

310
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,860
This is completely, this is--

311
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,420
- You removed her reproductive organs

312
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,620
'cause you think of her as just a hole.

313
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,540
- She came and she was trying to fix the system.

314
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,940
- If she came, like--

315
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,180
(laughing)

316
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,580
- I've just been dumping hella water.

317
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,580
- Your landlord came and your sister--

318
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,420
- I've just been--

319
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,620
- After a fixer. - Wasting water.

320
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,460
I've just been wasting hella water

321
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,100
for the past entire weekend.

322
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,260
That's my whole story.

323
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,300
Well, I like our version more.

324
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,100
Yeah, our version was a bit tad bit funnier that your landlord

325
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,300
came in and fixed your sister and came in her and also she's a

326
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,100
whole but my landlord is an old woman and she's insane.

327
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,700
She's got to be pretty crazy to do a sexual shit to your sister.

328
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,300
Yeah, I was really like for you guys to meet her your sister.

329
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,600
My landlord my insane landlord.

330
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah.

331
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,580
- Why would you want us to meet your landlord?

332
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,460
- Just so you see what I deal with on a show off.

333
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,380
So I search enough and--

334
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,700
- All, every landlord is crazy.

335
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,980
- Caleb and I live in New York.

336
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,700
And you think we don't have exposure to weird landlords?

337
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,820
- It's so much different.

338
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,460
It is so much different.

339
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,260
- And I've been here for nine days

340
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,060
and I already know how insane my landlord is.

341
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,140
That shouldn't explain.

342
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,780
- Landlords are so fucking crazy.

343
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,900
Did Cameron tell you guys about our office landlord

344
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,700
who we have like a little gate in the front of the office.

345
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
We were literally there.

346
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,220
Oh, you were there?

347
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,140
We saw it happen.

348
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,500
We were both there.

349
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,140
You should tell your side of the story.

350
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,500
I don't have a side of the story.

351
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,580
Just that it's so funny that he was like, somebody's going to...

352
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,260
We have a gate on the front.

353
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,460
We lock it.

354
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,220
But I guess Cam left like four inches of like slack in the gate.

355
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,460
And he just tied it at the bottom.

356
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,780
Yeah, he locked it at the bottom of the gate.

357
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,860
And your landlord just pulled up out of nowhere.

358
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,860
He parked on top of the curb and he just like flashed out of the car and just goes,

359
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,740
"Yo, if you don't, if you tie that on the top," because someone who's like really,

360
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,940
really skinny could just pull the gate and just walk in.

361
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,820
A gate that's like not even like...

362
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,260
Maybe three feet tall.

363
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,660
Yeah.

364
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:18,900
Right.

365
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,580
It's so small.

366
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,580
A gate that Noah could jump over in at least one direction.

367
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,220
An easy jump for anybody pretty much.

368
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,260
Maybe a hand jump, maybe you have to use your hands

369
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,580
to hoist yourself over for some guys.

370
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,420
Yeah, right.

371
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,140
But almost anybody could get over this gate.

372
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,820
And he was claiming that somebody who was four inches wide

373
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,380
might slip through the crack and do graffiti.

374
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,580
And I love that that's his idea of who does crimes

375
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,780
is skinny people. Skinny guys.

376
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,140
And not athletic guys.

377
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,660
Skinny, skinny guys who can slip through cracks.

378
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,280
holes a crack that a shoe couldn't fit through so you'd have to bring your feet above the

379
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,720
Gate it really made no sense. Yeah, I'm so used to this shit

380
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,760
I think I was the thing I was I was most amazed at is I was I was like

381
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,140
What she's like just coming and going and just like scoping out

382
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:20,340
Like what can I complain about what is wrong with with the office today couple weeks? We were there. He was doing that because

383
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,220
he

384
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,220
He just kind of has no idea what's going on ever

385
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,980
and but he was also very skeptical of us because he didn't know what a podcast was and

386
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:41,580
He didn't believe how much money we made and we thought that we he thought that we invented patreon

387
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:46,060
To fake how much money we make when we showed him our patreon

388
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:53,260
He was like so I mean for all I know you guys made this website and you put all these fake numbers on here

389
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:01,100
and yeah it took a lot of time to get him to believe us. The awesome thing about

390
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:10,020
that is like it's really easy to corroborate Patreon's existence. Yeah.

391
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,900
Because you just have to know at least one other website. Yeah. Wikipedia. You had

392
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,780
a you had a similar experience right when you're like trying to rent a place in LA

393
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,260
like two years ago? Oh yeah but that's different. I was literally

394
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:34,780
sending them like blockchain transactions. Can you not just send them

395
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,140
like bank statements of like look at all this money that I'm receiving? I was not

396
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:45,180
putting money in my bank account. Okay so it was literally not a them problem it

397
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,460
was a you problem. You were being difficult for no reason.

398
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,760
Okay, I wasn't being difficult. I just get paid differently than

399
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,040
you.

400
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,260
Sending an old person like, Oh, yeah, check out my blockchain

401
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,780
profile. Can I rent this fucking place? Now I understand why they

402
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,940
didn't want to rent for you to you for so long.

403
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,580
I mean, I was still pulling fucking money into my bank

404
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,860
account, but it wasn't regularly. Like like a paycheck would be,

405
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,540
You know, it was irregularly like a drug dealer would do.

406
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,660
How are you, uh, how are you showing your, your, your, your income now in New York?

407
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,940
Do you have like any issues with that?

408
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,380
No, not at all.

409
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,140
Do you want to know the ins and outs of the legal structure I built for myself?

410
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,780
Yeah.

411
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,060
Go ahead.

412
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,540
LLCs and S-corps.

413
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,300
Yeah, go ahead.

414
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:38,660
Well, I have a S-corp in, uh, uh, Sheridan, Wyoming, uh, on coffee.

415
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,120
Why did you do Wyoming?

416
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,720
Cause I always hear that Delaware is the best one, but also,

417
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,320
isn't that kind of a trick because you end up paying double tax because you're

418
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
supposed to, tax is paid where money is made, as they say?

419
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,840
Yes.

420
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,200
So the secret is that Delaware

421
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,800
is a fake state where corporations incorporate and

422
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,080
they don't have any real crime.

423
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,900
They only do like corporate litigation.

424
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,080
That's all their courts do.

425
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,160
All the judges, everyone involved, that's all they do.

426
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
- Okay.

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,960
- There's no one that does any crime there.

428
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,060
They don't do anything.

429
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,220
Wyoming is the same thing, but for like crypto people

430
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,240
because they have some weird bitch

431
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,200
that's the governor that loves Bitcoin.

432
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,200
And so it's very favorable to exist there.

433
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,360
And then I use a service where I send them money.

434
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,420
And then two weeks later it goes into my bank account and they handle

435
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:52,080
withholdings, they handle like, uh, pay stubs, uh, insurance, things like that.

436
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
This is genius.

437
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,140
Yeah.

438
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,120
And it looks like I'm a licensed freelancer.

439
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,920
So I get like an actual pay stub now.

440
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,480
- Whoa.

441
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,540
- And I only have to pay them $150 per paycheck.

442
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,800
(laughing)

443
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,640
- Money talk.

444
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
- Yeah, that's nothing.

445
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,820
- Yep.

446
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,460
- That sucks ass.

447
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,040
- Yeah, it's hell.

448
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,760
But, no, that's life.

449
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,040
So that's what you have to do to show weird old guys

450
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,080
who aren't hip and with it with financial technology

451
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,080
that you make bank.

452
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,920
- I feel like crypto--

453
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
- Also I have a good credit score.

454
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,880
Crypto is a lot easier to explain than Patreon, I think.

455
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,160
- No. - To most landlords.

456
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
- I don't think so.

457
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,200
- Absolutely not. - I feel like most old white guys

458
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,640
know, especially rich guys, like landlords,

459
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
know what crypto is.

460
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,040
- That doesn't, no, absolutely not.

461
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,180
And they don't understand how you could possibly

462
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,000
receive a paycheck on it.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,480
- Yeah, I completely disagree.

464
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,000
- You might be complicating it

465
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,080
with the paycheck thing, honestly.

466
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Yeah, you can say, "Hey, I make this amount of money.

467
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,360
It goes to our LLC and we pay ourselves through it.

468
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,660
And this is made through a subscription service that we run."

469
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,520
That's easy.

470
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,360
Subscriptions.

471
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,200
That does sound really easy.

472
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,320
Old guys fucking have 90 subscriptions to everything.

473
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,160
That's true.

474
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,540
That's a good point.

475
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,380
I think it would be,

476
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,880
can you imagine how easy our lives would be?

477
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,440
We both should have just said that we do sports betting.

478
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,240
We do daily fantasy sports betting.

479
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,440
My landlord literally, I know for a fact,

480
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,280
he would have been like,

481
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,840
"Oh yeah, whatever, no, yeah, no problem.

482
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,240
What, you guys make $15,000 a month doing sports betting?"

483
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
Yeah, I believe that.

484
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,560
We would have even had to show him.

485
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,960
- Got an algorithm for DraftKings.

486
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
- We could have just made up a fake,

487
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,000
we could have given him one fake daily fantasy lineup

488
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,280
and been like, "Yeah, dude, go ahead, Patrick Mahomes."

489
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,000
And he would have been like, "Oh yeah, okay."

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,520
- Give him some picks.

491
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,840
- Yeah, just give him some picks and then that's it.

492
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,100
- So the hardest thing when I was looking for a place

493
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,580
was it was COVID and I lived in California where they refused to kick.

494
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,400
People out onto the streets and they were like, Oh, we need to make sure you're

495
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,620
not gonna, you know, just not pay rent as though that is like a thing someone does,

496
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,580
you know, taking advantage of lenient rules.

497
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,900
No one's ever done that.

498
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,160
Now it's like, you know, I, I literally like I have my, my,

499
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,640
there's a tax guy that I'm vaguely familiar with. And I was like, Hey, like,

500
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,320
can you like write me like a letter or some shit that will help me out with

501
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,880
this? And he wrote it and sent it to me. And before I even sent it,

502
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,520
I was approved to get this apartment.

503
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
Oh, nice.

504
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,280
So it was like trivially easy.

505
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,320
Have you seen that financial guru guy on

506
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,160
YouTube who has people on all the time who are like, "I make $70,000 a year. I don't

507
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,440
understand why I'm broke." And he looks at their bank account statements and he always...

508
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Oh, yeah.

509
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,680
It's always like... He's like, "It says here that you spent $2,300 on Taco Bell last month."

510
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,240
Wait, wait, wait. Is it the guy with glasses and big...

511
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Yeah.

512
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Is this Dave Ramsey?

513
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Yeah.

514
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
Dude, I love that guy.

515
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,680
No, it's not Dave Ramsey. No, no. It's this younger guy who doesn't... He's not rich.

516
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,000
He just is a guy who preaches...

517
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
like a financial responsibility.

518
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

519
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,140
He just has people on, these fucking, the biggest losers in the world.

520
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,660
I don't know why they put themselves through this.

521
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,000
It makes no, it's like, it has to be some humiliation.

522
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
They love it.

523
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,300
They love it, dude.

524
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,940
And they go on and they're like, and he's like, it says here there's a $1,600 charge

525
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,040
in one day from something called Steam.

526
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Can you explain what that is?

527
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,400
(laughing)

528
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,880
The guy's like, "Oh, well, you know,

529
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,440
"I had to buy the expansions,

530
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,360
"and then I had to buy the skins."

531
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,800
And he's like, "I don't know what the fuck

532
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,520
"you're talking about, but I want you to know

533
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,220
"you make $2,000 a month, and you spent 75%

534
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,160
"of your paycheck on whatever this is."

535
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,440
- I love when that guy just gets so exasperated

536
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,840
and he's like, "What are you doing?

537
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,440
"You owe so much money, you can't own anything.

538
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,760
"You need to be paying for the rest of your life.

539
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,040
"You need to stop doing this."

540
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,880
And they're just sitting there like,

541
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,440
"I don't know, fucking whatever."

542
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah, I mean, it's a perfect—I recommend anybody to watch this guy on YouTube.

543
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,120
He's so, so, so good.

544
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,920
But I always do have—as I watch it, I'm like laughing at these guys and just hoping

545
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,000
to God that somehow he never gets a hold of my financials because it would be the exact

546
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
same thing.

547
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, of course.

548
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah.

549
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,320
I did also stumble upon that YouTube channel.

550
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,360
I think it was either last year or two years ago when I was like so in debt and I owed

551
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
so much money.

552
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
I had no money myself.

553
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,360
I was just like, "Oh, let me just watch these guys' YouTube videos."

554
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,200
I was just like laughing at people in Texas just paying a hell of money for like UberEats.

555
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,880
Yeah, these people make like $6 an hour and they own houses.

556
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,600
And he's like, "Why do you own it?

557
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
How is this possible?"

558
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:10,040
And they're like, "Oh, well, I took out $800,000 in student loans when I first started going

559
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
to college."

560
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
College is a big one.

561
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,360
I kept the student loans, and then now I pay for my house with that.

562
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,480
They keep buying cars for no reason.

563
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,080
It's like, "You don't need a car.

564
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't need a new car.

565
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,440
You can just buy a used one.

566
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,920
You don't need to be paying this."

567
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
That is always a funny...

568
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,800
He's always like, "Why do you need a car?"

569
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,160
And they're like, "Well, to get around."

570
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
They do live in Texas.

571
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
- Where do you work?

572
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
- So they do need a car.

573
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,440
- And they always say, "I work from home.

574
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,540
"I freelance from home."

575
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,520
(laughing)

576
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,580
Or, "I'm unemployed."

577
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,040
- Yeah, that's the real secret.

578
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,640
You don't need a car.

579
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
You almost never need a car.

580
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,760
- You don't need anything.

581
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,720
You don't need anything.

582
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,720
- You literally, okay, I've lived in Arizona,

583
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,520
which is just as retarded and sprawling as Texas.

584
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,160
- Most cities have some kind of shitty bus

585
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,480
that you can take.

586
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,880
I will say, you really have to get lucky

587
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,780
to have your house and your work be remotely close

588
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,120
to a bus station in most places.

589
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,800
But there is definitely cities where you make it work

590
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,260
and do it cheap.

591
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,900
But it's also nice to have a car.

592
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,700
- Oh, for sure.

593
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,520
- Yeah.

594
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,600
- I mean, that's the thing.

595
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,420
Your car should cost $2,000 until it can cost $40,000.

596
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,760
- Yeah, until you can buy a car,

597
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,040
a watch that looks like your car.

598
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,880
- Yeah.

599
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,840
- Like Cobra Tate Bugatti. - You should be driving

600
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:38,680
a 2000 like a $2,000 1994 Lincoln until you can buy a BMW and cab.

601
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
Have you guys seen the video?

602
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,120
Any car in between is just a waste of time.

603
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,240
Have you guys seen the video of Andrew Tate buying the Bugatti watch that's the exact same

604
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,120
model as his car?

605
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,920
No.

606
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,080
No.

607
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,160
No.

608
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,720
No.

609
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,280
He buys a watch that is like a it looks like a Bugatti the same Bugatti he has the Bugatti

610
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,080
Chiron or whatever it's called.

611
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,640
Yeah.

612
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,480
And I was wondering if you guys think I should get that same thing, but with my Ford Focus.

613
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
What?

614
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
Just a red watch with zip ties on it.

615
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Speaking of cars.

616
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Bunch of alarms going off.

617
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
A bunch of tickets.

618
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Yeah, attached to it.

619
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
The brakes are all fucked up.

620
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Post-it notes.

621
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Yeah, mismatched mirrors because one got knocked off.

622
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Heineken, still Heineken smell all through the watch.

623
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,240
How's the car situation?

624
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,680
Is it still fucked?

625
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,680
It is now officially at a parking lot across the street.

626
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
Yo!

627
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,240
But it has no license plate.

628
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,080
That's fine.

629
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,600
And it can't legally be driven.

630
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,600
And now we have to go, we have to go get it,

631
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,040
pay to get it all fixed up so that it can then be inspected.

632
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,880
Right.

633
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
And then we have to get new tags for New York

634
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
and then we have to get insurance for it.

635
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,360
So I just don't, I don't wanna do it.

636
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,120
My idea, my idea, my new, my brand new idea.

637
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay.

638
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
all these cars like driving around New York with a,

639
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,160
with like a paper, uh, license plate, like a temporary paper license plate.

640
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Yes, a 30 day deal.

641
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,560
You steal one or you just copy one and just put it in your car.

642
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,860
And you copy one every single month.

643
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,760
I don't get pulled over.

644
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,960
I don't do naughty things when I drive.

645
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,760
If I had fake tags on, I could probably drive for five years without any.

646
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,360
In New York, they don't check, they don't run people's registration on the highway

647
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,660
like they do in other places.

648
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,400
I don't think I would get pulled over even one time.

649
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,460
Well, there's a secret to driving, which is you don't do two crimes at the same time.

650
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,260
So if you have a fake license plate, you don't have registration,

651
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,300
you're going the speed limit, you know? Exactly.

652
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,360
Wait, how do you how do they even take you down?

653
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,760
What tipped them off? What do they come for you?

654
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,060
Because you got a million tickets.

655
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah, there was the car got towed.

656
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,400
They do like once every couple of weeks or once a month.

657
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,500
They send out a boot army, an army of booters

658
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,300
who go around and they boot cars

659
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,140
and have too many tickets. - I hate booters.

660
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,020
- Dude, and these guys, they make me sick.

661
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,620
- They love their job.

662
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,540
- Dude, they really do.

663
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,180
The people in my neighborhood who do parking tickets

664
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,880
fucking love their job.

665
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,600
They hang out, they drink little coffees in the car,

666
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,560
like waiting for seven o'clock to hit

667
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,020
so that they can start legally ticketing people.

668
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,140
And they are disgusting.

669
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,060
I want to mow them down.

670
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,060
I need them to die. I just don't understand how you join the NYPD,

671
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:34,980
one of the most valiant organizations in this country.

672
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,660
Very cool guys.

673
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:41,020
And these, but, but you know, for a fact, when you look at these guys,

674
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,060
they're all five foot two and like 65 years old.

675
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,820
They joined when they were 50 and they were like, please,

676
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,540
please, please put me on parking duty.

677
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,940
It's what I was built for.

678
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
I've been waiting my entire life for this opportunity.

679
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,580
They never wanted to chase down bad guys.

680
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,460
They didn't want to be an old West Sheriff

681
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,540
like all cops should want to be.

682
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,380
- Yeah.

683
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,180
- They're not white hat.

684
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,700
They are disgusting parking worms.

685
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,540
- Yeah.

686
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,660
- No idea.

687
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,580
What do you do, what do you, to fight back,

688
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,340
you should do what Rex did and do some praxis.

689
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,740
- I should satire them.

690
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,020
- You should do what Rex did.

691
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:28,340
satirical show that is making fun of their, of how lazy they are. That's what I

692
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,540
should do. Thank you for this idea. You're so right.

693
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,820
No, that was not my idea. My idea was the thing that Rex did. We were working on like what,

694
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,420
insurances or some shit? And they just fired you because you kept giving

695
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,020
everyone loans, so like you just kept forgiving everyone.

696
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Yeah, I put them on the do not call.

697
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,020
He's told this story a million times. It's to prove he's a good guy.

698
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
It's not to prove I...

699
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,020
It's not true. It's just not true. It's fine.

700
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,460
I don't have it in me to be harsh with people.

701
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,060
Yeah, so you should do that. You should become an NYPD officer and you should shoot cops.

702
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
Dude, this is the problem.

703
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:08,420
No, you should become a parking officer and give the other parking cops tickets to show them how it feels.

704
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Do you realize what I look like? If I applied for the NYPD, I would literally be on the WGA picket line

705
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,820
putting a baton through somebody with blue hairs mouth.

706
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,120
That's what I would be doing.

707
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,360
I'd be I'd be breaking people's tracheas with the butt of my gun.

708
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,460
That is what they want me for.

709
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,960
They would not want me on parking duty.

710
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,800
I'm six foot five, 280 pounds, pure muscle.

711
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,700
There's no there's no world where they put me on fucking parking, dude.

712
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,200
I think they do.

713
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,760
Think it would be funny to be a full time podcaster, part time

714
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,700
police officer.

715
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,540
Yeah. I mean,

716
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,780
Oh, I heard you got like a new part-time job. Like what do you think?

717
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,620
You work at like CVS?

718
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,780
What do you think would ruin my life more?

719
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:04,020
Is it like, like being like if me and my wife got divorced and it was really,

720
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,940
really like super messy, Johnny Depp, Amber Heard style,

721
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,300
or, and it all became public somehow,

722
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,180
or if it was revealed that I was secretly an NYPD officer.

723
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,680
I have a question about this hypothetical.

724
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,180
Who are you shitting on the bed or is she shitting on the bed?

725
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:26,380
I mean, honestly, probably me.

726
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,780
But not, but just because almost every single night I almost shit my pants

727
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,080
while I'm in bed and then I run to the bathroom and I wake her up and that

728
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,280
would definitely be disclosed in court.

729
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,580
With the people that listen to podcasts about LIST, being a cop is worse

730
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,680
than being divorced.

731
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,220
Well, not divorce.

732
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,940
I mean, like, like an, like reveals that you're an awful person, that kind of thing.

733
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,500
I mean, Johnny, Johnny Depp's divorce, the whole thing was that he like abused her.

734
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,140
So are you saying you're like abusing your wife?

735
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,340
Yeah.

736
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,180
We are team member.

737
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,660
I heard that's what's coming out.

738
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,220
Yeah.

739
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,700
Yes.

740
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,340
Yes.

741
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,020
Yeah.

742
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,180
Yeah.

743
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,580
Yeah.

744
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,260
So if I, so let's take that to the extreme.

745
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,060
If I, Whoa, not very, very cool.

746
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,860
Very, I want everybody to hear what Julia just said.

747
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,180
Repeat that.

748
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,820
- You'll get that right back.

749
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,860
- Say what you just said, yeah, that's a home run.

750
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,980
That's way in the left field.

751
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,180
That just landed in a popcorn bucket.

752
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,060
Tell me that again.

753
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,860
- I said what I said, let's move on.

754
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,100
(laughing)

755
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,180
- Yeah, so okay, so you're right.

756
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,560
I guess I don't know that much

757
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,980
about the Johnny Depp, Amber Heard thing,

758
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,340
except for the poop bed thing.

759
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,340
But say that I was doing, say I got really into kickboxing.

760
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:48,860
kickboxing and I was doing like kangaroo style double foot kicks into my

761
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,340
wife's face, kicking her through windows and stuff. It would definitely be worse still if I was a cop I think.

762
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:03,340
That would be worse. Yeah. Yeah, because you would be a cop on top of already doing that.

763
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:12,340
do it again. You can't do it again. Oh my god, two home runs in a single inning. That's crazy. It doesn't work more than once, man.

764
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:22,120
Even as a wow, how retarded was I? It doesn't work twice. It doesn't work twice. It completely worked twice. You are funny

765
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,200
because you are trained to be a cop. I'm not training to be a cop, I'm

766
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,580
training to be a professional bodybuilder. Why are you so defensive about cops not beating

767
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:36,620
their wives yeah I'm I didn't say that they don't I just show me your beds

768
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:43,620
officer you have to tell me if you're a police officer yeah how about all these

769
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:56,940
fake eyeballs that I have I bought these like three years ago I think I was gonna

770
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:05,940
The funny thing about Caleb is he'll just like talk to you like once in a while and just tell you about these insane purchases that he makes.

771
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,940
You're like, "Why do you do this?"

772
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:13,940
They're pretty funny, right? I mean, come on.

773
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,940
You see why I bought these.

774
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,940
I chose the worst moment to take a drink of water.

775
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,940
It honestly looks like your actual eyes, which is crazy.

776
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,940
That's what you look like.

777
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
No, I lost it.

778
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,940
It's okay, you got like 20 more.

779
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,940
Yeah, I do have a big pack of them.

780
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
They're all different colors though.

781
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,940
And I think the green one is probably the funniest.

782
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,940
Do you want to do a Bishu Jiraiya exclusive with that other purchase that you made?

783
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
No, no, no, no, no, I can't talk about that.

784
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Okay, we won't talk about that.

785
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,940
I'll talk about it one day.

786
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
He just does shit for videos and I...

787
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
But I do just blow an irresponsible amount of money on something.

788
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,940
He hasn't made a video.

789
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
When's the last time you made a video actually?

790
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I made a couple TikToks six months ago.

791
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
Those don't count. Those don't count.

792
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Those don't count? It's the biggest platform in the world.

793
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,940
No, the password one was funny.

794
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,940
Thank you, Rex.

795
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
You're welcome.

796
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,940
I watched them all. Because I only follow four people on TikTok.

797
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Who do you follow?

798
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Addison Rae.

799
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
No.

800
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
You, Pat, Cam, and Julio.

801
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
Cam doesn't have a TikTok.

802
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:32,380
Pat told me that someone he knows showed Addison Rae Pot of a List.

803
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Really?

804
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
Yeah.

805
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Yeah.

806
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,940
That he didn't get any info on who was her favorite host or anything like that.

807
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,260
But hopefully she might be listening to this right now.

808
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,260
You know what?

809
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,720
Actually, I was thinking this earlier today.

810
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,040
came into the Twitch chat and people

811
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
would just start like, started like

812
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,960
mentioning like, oh, I know Paul from

813
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,680
this. And apart from that, one of them,

814
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,840
which Cam said it was a dream, he said,

815
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
oh, I know Paul from YouTube

816
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
recommendations, which is crazy.

817
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,960
That's so good.

818
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,080
That is what you want.

819
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,440
Yeah, that is what you want.

820
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,640
Yeah. But another person came in and

821
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,200
was like, oh, I know you guys from the

822
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
yard. So I was like, OK, if we get one

823
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,960
person to listen and subscribe and give

824
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,680
us money from every collab, we should

825
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,120
just do a million collabs and we'll just have a million listeners and payers.

826
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,640
Yes. Yes.

827
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,080
No, no doubt. No, 100% guarantee.

828
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,720
There's no doubt. Guys, there's so many reasons. We don't do advertisements.

829
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,760
We're not like these scumbag other podcasts that do all these advert.

830
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,280
Manscaped. I don't know what that is.

831
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,800
I don't know if you use 15% off or if you use the code Kaleb at checkout,

832
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,040
maybe you'll get 15% off, but I don't know what the fuck that is.

833
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
What is manscaped?

834
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:42,960
Yeah.

835
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,640
What, do they have superior grooming products for men

836
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,120
that don't give you razor burn and actually are more hygienic than any other item on the

837
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
market?

838
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Maybe.

839
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I don't know, but we don't do ads.

840
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,080
So there's a lot of reasons like that.

841
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
I hate ads.

842
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,120
Do you have three razors?

843
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,520
How many razors do you have?

844
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,560
Shaving your three important areas.

846
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,360
I do not often shave my third most important area.

847
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Or my first, depending on...

848
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,000
I mean, for Rex, it's definitely...

849
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
Mine is definitely his number one.

850
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:22,920
for me it's my third. You're saying that to me your third most important area is your

851
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,760
number one for me? Yes, yes. Like in terms if I had to rank the areas on my body that

852
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,760
are most important to shave I would say head is number one, my beard and mustache is number

853
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,320
two and my ass and balls and dick are number three. For you it's the worst. Hold on, hold

854
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,340
- Hold on.

855
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,800
- For you, you think that that's--

856
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,340
- Ass, you shaved your ass.

857
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,040
- I've talked about this before.

858
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,000
I recently shaved my ass.

859
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,120
A month ago I shaved my ass baby bald.

860
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,240
- You're ridiculous.

861
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,400
- I shaved my ass baby bald.

862
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,840
I walked around feeling like I was taking a,

863
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,000
giving birth to a porcupine every single day.

864
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
- You're still doing it.

865
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,640
- I'm not still doing it.

866
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,320
- You said you did it a month ago.

867
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
- Yeah, a month ago that was the first time I'd done it

868
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,600
in probably three years.

869
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,680
What is he doing?

870
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,380
I don't know.

871
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,880
I don't know.

872
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
He's pulling up air pods.

873
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,380
They drop.

874
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,380
[LAUGHTER]

875
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Wait, this is so fail.

876
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,380
This is so fail.

877
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,380
This is so fail that we need to stop talking about my ass shave right now.

878
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,380
Incredible fail.

879
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,380
It's just so fail for him to be dropping his air pods.

880
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,880
I thought he was going to show us his ass for a second.

881
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,380
I thought he just was going to leave.

882
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
I thought a fire alarm was going off or something.

883
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
Well, you would hear that.

884
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,380
I guess you're right.

885
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,880
What's up?

886
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,380
What did I miss?

887
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,540
Okay, you know nothing. I'll show to a whole different topic. Yeah, I know topic

888
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,740
Fucking what's up with the Hawaii fire? So you guys know that?

889
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,580
I did not

890
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,860
Know anything about it until I overheard somebody in Walgreens today say that a hundred people have passed away

891
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,860
And I hate all death, and I don't think that this is

892
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:07,720
Funny and I don't know why you would bring this up. Yeah, I don't know why we're even talking about these horrific fires

893
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,560
But Jubio thinks that this he I guess thinks this is the funniest thing. I don't think this is funny

894
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,160
I don't think it's funny that they used direct energy weapons

895
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,620
to light normal people's things on fire and then this Oprah's house

896
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,980
What they did did you know that do you see that the video that the with the Chinese lasers?

897
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
No

898
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,860
Why?

899
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,940
They were talking about Gundam. No, there were Chinese lasers pointed at

900
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:50,220
You said Gundam is Chinese lasers, yeah lasers in that show

901
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:59,420
You don't deserve the home run button they do have like I

902
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,380
Think I think you all have them. I think you all have the buttons

903
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:11,280
At the top of the screen do not see them website barely works for me

904
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,500
Yeah, I don't have any buttons brother I can't even click the call settings button to make

905
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,900
You know if I had the bang button I would be using that

906
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,340
Wait stop working

907
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,900
I

908
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,340
I forgot what we're talking about.

909
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,620
Do you know that there's like,

910
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,180
gundams for every country and the Mexican one is like so racist?

911
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,380
Really?

912
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:31,540
Yeah.

913
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,340
Sombrero?

914
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,820
It's like a cactus with a sombrero eating a taco.

915
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,420
That is fucking awesome.

916
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,300
How's that racist?

917
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,540
That is not how we look.

918
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,580
Yeah.

919
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,180
You don't look like a fucking robot either.

920
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,300
The actual law was wearing sombreros eating a taco.

921
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,780
You think Japanese people look like fucking robots?

922
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,420
What do you mean that's not what we look like?

923
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,060
Come on, man.

924
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:53,780
If the American one was a very brave person,

925
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,680
and I wouldn't be like, "Oh, yeah, they're being racist

926
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,320
"'cause they're saying all Americans are brave."

927
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,660
- Dude, he has like a sombrero, he has like a big mustache.

928
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,580
- These are things from Mexico, man.

929
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,420
- It has.

930
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,420
- Look at me. - Complete cacti.

931
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,520
- You look like a cactus.

932
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,500
- Wait, hang on, what does the USA want to declare?

933
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,780
- And you have a mustache.

934
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,740
I don't know why you're complaining about--

935
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,780
- And you're wearing a sombrero for the audio.

936
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,180
- Representing me by having a mustache

937
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,100
and a sombrero, holding a chihuahua.

938
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,540
- Oh no, they're paying homage to our--

939
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,800
They're paying homage to our 5,000 year history.

940
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,680
You know, the USA Gundam, it has a big gun on it.

941
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,780
Yeah, of course it does.

942
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,820
I'm not I'm not complaining about that.

943
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,420
There's no I don't see any problem.

944
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,120
That's objectively true.

945
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,080
I don't understand what your problem is.

946
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,760
And you tell me, Jubio, do people in Mexico wear sombreros?

947
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,000
No. Sometimes, sometimes people in America wear sombreros sometimes

948
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,100
and they're making fun of people from Mexico.

949
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,200
When I went to Mexico, I bought a sombrero.

950
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,240
It cost $20 plus a dollar for his coke.

951
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,640
Yes.

952
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,740
So, so people wear sombreros in Mexico.

953
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,640
Do people have mustaches in Mexico?

954
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,840
And don't you say no, because you have one tickling your your upper lip as we speak.

955
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,800
You have a Hitlerian mustache.

956
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,240
You do have a...

957
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,040
We've talked about this.

958
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,200
You have a natural Hitler mustache.

959
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,440
It literally only grows in in the Hitler zone, as they call it.

960
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,920
Hitler, yeah.

961
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,760
- Yeah.

962
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,560
- Okay.

963
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,600
- Do you know that that actually,

964
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,160
where you have that and where Hitler

965
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,760
actually had his mustache is considered

966
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,440
the zone of death when it comes to

967
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,280
abscesses and pimples on the human face?

968
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
- Why is it called the zone of death?

969
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,800
- 'Cause if you mistreat an abscess or a pimple

970
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,560
in this area between, like the triangle

971
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,940
that is formed between the very top of your nose

972
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,520
and the corners of your lips,

973
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,720
something that you have like a very high chance of it,

974
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,480
of basically like, if you get an infection,

975
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,680
it can go into your sinus and then into your brain.

976
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,360
So that's like dermatologists say,

977
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,800
like don't touch any pimples

978
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,600
that are like above your upper lip.

979
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,520
It's pretty scary stuff, huh?

980
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,920
- That's crazy. - Yeah, that is scary.

981
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,440
- You can die from almost anything.

982
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,760
- That is cool.

983
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
- You can overdose on drugs. - I love being fragile.

984
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,540
I was looking at,

985
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:22,360
Do you think bacteria fadges are like alien technology?

986
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,460
- Bacteria, what the fuck did you just say?

987
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,200
- I don't know what--

988
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,960
- Too much, you know like the little thing

989
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,660
that looks like a spider with a cube on its head?

990
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,360
- What?

991
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,200
- No, I don't know what you're talking about.

992
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,040
- Oh my God.

993
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,520
- Is this you looking, you look to science news again?

994
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,460
- Yeah.

995
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,720
(laughing)

996
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,520
- Why are you looking at this?

997
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,160
- I know this from the science book

998
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,520
from when I was in school,

999
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,400
but why are we looking at this?

1000
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,680
- Well, I saw a video on Twitter

1001
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,800
and it was showing different types of bacteria and viruses,

1002
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,240
like little pictures of them.

1003
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,080
And all of them look like big turds

1004
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,400
or just like clumps of shit.

1005
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
- So wait, sorry, what was your question?

1006
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,800
Now that I know what we're talking about,

1007
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,640
what was your question again?

1008
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,800
- Do you think they're like alien technology?

1009
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,320
- Do I think those are alien technology, bacteria?

1010
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,600
Bacteriophages, it's a specific type of virus. It looks like a little spider with like a

1011
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:24,380
Cylinder and then like a hexagon on its head. What what makes you think that it is alien technology?

1012
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,000
because

1013
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because it looks weird

1014
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
No, it looks normal. It looks like it looks like

1015
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,680
Yeah, it looks like you saw a guy

1016
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,540
But it looks like just like a tear phage outside on the street where you think like oh that's a normal-looking guy

1017
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,640
Yes

1018
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:50,380
That's not true. You're just lying. No, it looks like the type of thing that kills Gundam when they get a pimple in the death zone

1019
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,940
But I do think I mean

1020
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:59,480
Here my my hypothesis on alien technology is that if we saw alien technology, buddy

1021
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,480
We wouldn't even recognize it as such

1022
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,980
Because we can only think of technology that we can think of do you remember when you were a kid?

1023
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,680
You remember when you were a kid and your art teacher said draw a new

1024
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,420
animal that has no attributes of any other animal

1025
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,980
that has ever existed.

1026
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,460
- That never happened to me.

1027
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,300
- That happened to me.

1028
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,420
I had a very, very heady type of art teacher

1029
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,940
and all of us sat there and we said,

1030
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,620
well, God damn it, I can't draw anything

1031
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,500
that doesn't have a mouth.

1032
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,820
I only know a mouth.

1033
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,860
But hey, buddy, best you believe on other planets,

1034
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,860
there are creatures with no mouths, no eyes, and no hair.

1035
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,820
- No balls, no pussy.

1036
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,280
They feel really weird all the time,

1037
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,460
but they also have different attributes

1038
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,020
that we can never even imagine drawing.

1039
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,860
- Like what?

1040
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,680
- How do they--

1041
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,300
- That's what I'm saying, we don't know.

1042
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,140
They don't have eyes,

1043
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,060
but they might have some other thing.

1044
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,900
But we can't even imagine what--

1045
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,540
That's, you keep saying like what?

1046
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,480
I don't know, you fucking asshole.

1047
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,460
I don't know.

1048
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,980
That's what's so fucked up about this question

1049
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:08,780
that my art teacher asked me when I was in fourth grade.

1050
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,740
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

1051
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,740
And it's bothered me every day since.

1052
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,740
It's really hard.

1053
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:17,740
It's really heady to put on a video.

1054
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,740
It's very very heady. She ruined my life.

1055
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,740
She ruined my fucking life. Mrs. Lovejoy.

1056
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,740
I swear to god that was her name.

1057
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,740
My god.

1058
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,740
Lovejoy? Lovejoy.

1059
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,740
That's the Pokemon nurse.

1060
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,740
Nurse Lovejoy?

1061
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,740
No, that's Nurse Joy.

1062
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,740
Nurse Joy, yep.

1063
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,740
I was halfway there.

1064
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,020
- I think I wanted the words.

1065
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,300
- She did have a two word name

1066
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,100
and the Pokemon thing was one name, yeah.

1067
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,740
- Yeah.

1068
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,140
So anyways, what was this ranking,

1069
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,500
this shaving ranking that you had for Rex?

1070
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,460
- The whole point was that the joke here

1071
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,660
that I was trying to get at,

1072
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,700
don't, you know, spare me the home run sound y'all,

1073
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:58,940
I know it's one.

1074
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,660
- Yeah. - Was that Rex cares

1075
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,500
about my dick and balls and ass being shaved.

1076
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,060
- Okay, but here's the thing. - Completely clean.

1077
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,900
Hold on!

1078
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,820
(laughing)

1079
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,060
I'd like to say why, it's because he's gay.

1080
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,860
And then I care about my head being shaven

1081
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,900
so that I can attract women other than my wife.

1082
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,220
That was the whole point of what I was saying.

1083
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:26,180
- So first of all, let's break this down.

1084
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,020
- Yes.

1085
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,500
- Let's pretend for a moment,

1086
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,300
go outside of the realm of possibility,

1087
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,940
completely unnatural, weird fantasy.

1088
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,780
- You are gay.

1089
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,620
- That I have a-

1090
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,860
(laughing)

1091
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:48,460
- Okay, I think that covers it.

1092
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,900
I think that covers that topic.

1093
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,740
New topic.

1094
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,980
(laughing)

1095
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,540
- You put that down.

1096
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,540
Put down the soundboard.

1097
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,740
I don't have anything on my hands.

1098
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,740
Yeah, he's got nothing on his hands.

1099
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,740
Rex can't say the same.

1100
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,740
Okay, what I was going to say is that...

1101
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,740
You're trying to control me to pull my pants off?

1102
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,740
I'm not going to fall for your gay magic, you voodoo witch.

1103
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,740
No, it's not going to work on me.

1104
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:20,740
I'm taking you off.

1105
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:28,740
First of all, though, if I was a gay man, I would not care about the cleanliness of your balls.

1106
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,740
Can you do it? Wait, can I say it?

1107
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:35,860
I would say Rex I would say that makes you even gayer that you don't give a fuck either way

1108
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:42,580
Whether my balls are stinky or clean you just want to use them for your own nefarious gay purposes

1109
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:46,660
Yeah, and I certainly wouldn't care about the hair in your asshole

1110
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,340
Which I'm surprised you give even a second thought

1111
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:59,500
Let's go yeah, let's fucking go you're not interested in my asshole. I mean in this fake scenario

1112
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,700
we're talking about where we presuppose that I'm gay.

1113
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,200
Yeah.

1114
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,900
Completely outside the realm of possibility.

1115
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,100
Yep, it makes no sense.

1116
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,200
It's completely impossible.

1117
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,700
Yeah.

1118
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,000
But in this impossible scenario, why wouldn't I want you to stink?

1119
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Do you like when women stink?

1120
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,300
Yeah.

1121
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,300
Gay.

1122
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,400
A normal amount.

1123
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,200
That's gay.

1124
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,700
That's not gay.

1125
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,200
It is.

1126
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,200
Is this a brand new puffer or is this one of them that you found in the ground?

1127
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
What?

1128
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,200
This is a brand new puff bar?

1129
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Your vape.

1130
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Or this one that you found on the internet?

1131
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,200
Oh, this one?

1132
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,200
I did it.

1133
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,200
He did call it a puffer.

1134
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Like an old, old man.

1135
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
He said, "Is that a brand new puffer?"

1136
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:45,360
This is a frozen Creepsicle that I bought because the Uber that I took to Brooklyn could not

1137
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,080
go down a street that was closed and left me in front of a vape store.

1138
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,960
I know that vape store and I know that closed street.

1139
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Yep.

1140
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,960
So, yeah.

1141
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,960
I bought it new.

1142
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Okay?

1143
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,120
Okay? Are you taking more care of where you place these things or are you

1144
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:06,520
gonna be in that exact same scenario after a year? These are the two that I bought at that

1145
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,160
vape store. Okay. And they're both sitting right on my desk. Okay. Completely in view.

1146
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:19,080
I haven't lost it. There's a third one sitting on my bed. There's a fourth one I gave to my

1147
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,480
roommate because I didn't want to ask you for it anymore.

1148
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,440
Yeah.

1149
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,760
So think about that before you, you know,

1150
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,280
I don't think I don't think that's a good excuse.

1151
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,280
You, you literally live with trash on your desk.

1152
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,560
The only trash on my desk, you will get on the game.

1153
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,040
It will just be there.

1154
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,680
Here's what's on my desk.

1155
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,480
Here's what's on my desk.

1156
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:43,880
You ready?

1157
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,640
I'll give you a whole tour.

1158
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,080
I have a glass of water, which has a little bit of water in it.

1159
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,680
Okay. I have $24 in cash.

1160
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,600
Whoa.

1161
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,200
I have a screwdriver that I use to open my beer,

1162
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,120
a bottle cap and said beer.

1163
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,760
I have an AirPods container, a mouse,

1164
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,480
my cell phone, my wallet,

1165
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,680
two LFARs and a microphone.

1166
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,520
- That's pretty clean.

1167
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,340
- Speaking of.

1168
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,320
- It's probably cleaner than your desk, Juvio.

1169
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,100
I have-- - Speaking of.

1170
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,820
- On my desk, I have a capsule for pens.

1171
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:32,720
Four pairs of fake eyeballs.

1172
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,460
(Juvio laughing)

1173
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,400
A package of Zen 3, the Cool Mint,

1174
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,720
which took a long time because the new guy

1175
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,160
at my vape shop, speaks perfect English,

1176
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,240
but can't read a lick of it, y'all,

1177
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,840
which makes it pretty tough.

1178
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,760
Anytime I walk in, I say,

1179
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,960
"Can I have this flavor of Zin?"

1180
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,640
He says, "What color is it?"

1181
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,880
And if you know Zin,

1182
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,820
they make five flavors that are the same color.

1183
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,600
So I say blue, he gives me the wrong,

1184
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,040
brings one that says peppermint.

1185
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,040
I say, "Not that blue, buddy."

1186
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,560
Light blue, he brings me a different light blue one,

1187
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,960
and we have this whole thing back and forth.

1188
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,440
- Crazy that he doesn't do like the pointing thing,

1189
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,760
where he's like, "Huh?"

1190
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,400
It's because he's hiding them from police.

1191
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,280
So they are behind the entire thing.

1192
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,840
I can't see even a single one.

1193
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,000
- I will say, I did,

1194
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,080
there are two things sitting next to me on the ground.

1195
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,120
One, a utility bill for $1,500.

1196
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,200
- Oh my God.

1197
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,480
- And a coffee cup that was filled with sushi.

1198
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,440
- What?

1199
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,080
- Those are the two most interesting things.

1200
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,720
Those should be on your desk.

1201
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Those are, those are.

1202
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,560
- Well, the coffee cup is empty.

1203
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,080
- Why did the coffee cup have sushi in it, first of all?

1204
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,200
- Yeah, what's up with that?

1205
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,200
- And why was the utility bill $1,500?

1206
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,120
- Okay, so we'll answer your questions in order.

1207
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,560
The coffee cup had sushi in it

1208
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,640
because that is how they sell it.

1209
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,840
They sell mobile sushi rice bowls,

1210
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,560
so it was like rice, fish, and avocado in a coffee cup.

1211
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,360
- So it's like a poke.

1212
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,240
- Yeah, it's meant to be eaten while walking, I guess.

1213
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,280
It was good.

1214
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,400
And the utility bill is because their auto pay doesn't work.

1215
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,420
And once a year I check my mail and see that I haven't paid the bill in a

1216
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,260
year.

1217
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,620
Oh, well,

1218
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,140
uh, I found this out right before I moved.

1219
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,820
They were going to shut off our utilities on the day my last roommate moved out,

1220
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:31,940
but they called me from a number from Chile today,

1221
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:36,580
which I obviously didn't answer because there's no reason to answer a call from

1222
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,580
Chile ever. Yeah. Yeah.

1223
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,660
What the voicemail was like, Hey, we're from the long beach, you know,

1224
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,420
utilities, and we're going to shut off your utilities.

1225
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,820
And he said, I don't give a fuck. Cause I don't live there. Yeah.

1226
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,700
But I did pay it.

1227
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,100
Yeah. That sucks. It sucks that you have to pay stuff that you don't use. My,

1228
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,940
my old gym is coming after me right now because I didn't even know this.

1229
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,140
I thought that I, I like went in and canceled my membership.

1230
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:11,500
And I got an email from a law office a week ago that was like, "We are attorneys who do

1231
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:18,860
collections and you owe $86 to Blink Fitness Ridgewood.

1232
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,260
You can either pay this in full or we'll take you to court."

1233
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,340
And I was like, "I don't know if I'm even going to pay it.

1234
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,220
I don't even know if I'll ever respond to this email."

1235
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,220
$86?

1236
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,540
Yeah, there's no way they're taking you to court for $86.

1237
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,540
That's what I'm saying, dude.

1238
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,540
I kind of just couldn't believe it.

1239
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,660
That's fake.

1240
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,140
I have a strategy for Jubio, which is that I think that this

1241
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,660
I Show Speed thing is going to make him go even bigger.

1242
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:48,900
And I think that Jubio should recreate it one-to-one,

1243
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,780
should let his stuff hang out of his boxers.

1244
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,380
I've been wanting to see it for years.

1245
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,660
You're one of my few male friends who I've never even seen

1246
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,580
a glimpse of your penis.

1247
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,620
Can we just make this happen?

1248
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,540
No.

1249
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,740
Nope.

1250
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,140
- Do you think you could even show maybe a tenth

1251
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,780
of the emotion that I Show Speed does?

1252
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,620
- No.

1253
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,220
- I've seen you get scared, I've seen you yell,

1254
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,700
but I've never seen you show your black penis.

1255
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,540
- I don't want to.

1256
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,980
(laughing)

1257
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,500
I don't want to be the next I Show Speed.

1258
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,340
- Why?

1259
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,220
He's rich and his mom hates him.

1260
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,420
- He's cringe is what he is.

1261
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,460
- Who is the least cringe streamer

1262
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,380
that you want to be exactly like?

1263
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,380
- I don't think there's a streamer that isn't cringe.

1264
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,940
- Whoa.

1265
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,700
- Put that on Twitch.

1266
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,460
- Somebody's never watched Destiny's debates.

1267
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,700
(laughing)

1268
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,460
- Is that your top non-cringe streamer?

1269
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:53,180
- Dude, Destiny is so fucking awesome.

1270
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,580
- Yeah? - Are you kidding me?

1271
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,260
Yes, dude, the Omni liberal himself.

1272
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,900
- Yeah. - Yeah, he is dope.

1273
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,860
He basically destroys people on both sides of the aisle.

1274
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,440
The hysterical leftists and the racist as fuck rightoids.

1275
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,080
He's the kind of streamer I like.

1276
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,300
- I love watching debates.

1277
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,980
- There's something that I wanted to talk to you.

1278
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,940
Why do you say so much Twitch lingo?

1279
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:18,940
- What do I say?

1280
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,420
- You say easy clap,

1281
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,060
which is a combination of two Twitch emotes.

1282
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:23,900
- I don't think I've ever said easy clap.

1283
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,300
- I don't think he's literally ever said that.

1284
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,800
- I think I've-- - I can scroll

1285
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,760
for like a couple days-- - Scroll where?

1286
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,980
- On Peefers, and I've seen you type it.

1287
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,340
- Well, that's because I'm watching

1288
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,860
professional Valorant games,

1289
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,380
and this is the kind of thing that people say

1290
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,320
in the Twitch chat.

1291
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,180
But I've never said that out loud.

1292
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,460
- I think you've said it in one of your games.

1293
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,100
- I never have said it, Rex can attest.

1294
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,980
Okay. - I've never heard

1295
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,220
those words before. - And also,

1296
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,860
that's not a Twitch thing, that's a gaming thing.

1297
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,300
People have said that forever.

1298
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,240
- That's not a gaming, that's a Twitch thing.

1299
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,320
That's two emotes. - No, no, no.

1300
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,160
- Easy clap. - Where do you think

1301
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,460
the emotes come from?

1302
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,640
- From heaven.

1303
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,260
- Yeah, you're done for.

1304
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,640
You're done for.

1305
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,900
What else do I say?

1306
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,480
- I completely, I just,

1307
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,120
my landlord keeps calling me,

1308
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,560
so I have everything in my mind just completely blanked out.

1309
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,080
- So basically, I'm Destiny,

1310
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,000
and you are a hysterical leftist,

1311
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,880
and you just got destroyed.

1312
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,440
You had no points.

1313
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,000
You are Hasan Abi, I am destiny.

1314
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:30,840
- I'm not Hasan Abi.

1315
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,400
- You are Hasan Abi.

1316
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,680
- You have just been destroyed.

1317
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,360
It's over for you.

1318
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,160
Just like when destiny destroyed Hasan Abi,

1319
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,920
his career was fucking over.

1320
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,800
Who's heard of this guy since then?

1321
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,640
Nobody.

1322
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,140
- Did you see that video of where Hasan was like doing kicks,

1323
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,160
kickboxing on his driveway?

1324
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,360
And he's doing the weakest kicks of all time.

1325
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,880
- I thought it was funny that he was trying

1326
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:58,880
to shit on Elon for not fighting Mark Zuckerberg.

1327
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,380
- Is that what he's doing?

1328
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,220
- He did for a minute.

1329
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,920
- You watch Hasan Piker every single day on Twitch.

1330
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,320
- No, no, he was just posting it on Twitter.

1331
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,220
- I have no idea what he's been saying and posting.

1332
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,060
You follow him.

1333
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,560
- You know, he ducked that fight with Sam Hyde

1334
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,720
for like, well, years now.

1335
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,120
- I don't, listen, I don't know the guy personally.

1336
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,600
I do not blame anybody for not fighting Sam Hyde.

1337
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,520
- Yeah, he's a monster.

1338
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,020
I would never do you have to be fucking crazy to do that

1339
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:33,340
You'd have to actually be out of your mind the only people yes, I'm hide or homeless people retard strength

1340
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,520
racist strength

1341
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:41,320
Dad he could rip your arms up your strength. Yeah, he's an actual ape he would destroy him

1342
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:45,160
Yeah, I don't there's there's a

1343
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:51,500
Who do you guys think that I should set up my celebrity boxing with when I when I eventually get on the bear as a guest?

1344
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
role um

1345
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
I don't know, it has to be like a really...

1346
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Idubbbz.

1347
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Do you want to fight Idubbbz?

1348
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Yeah dude, I think you could take him.

1349
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
I would destroy Idubbbz.

1350
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
I know dude, that's what I'm saying.

1351
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
He weighs like 150 pounds.

1352
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,500
No, you need to be like the biggest YouTuber you can think of.

1353
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,500
You should do MrBeast.

1354
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,500
Jake Paul.

1355
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,500
I want to fight FouseyTube.

1356
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,500
MrBeast is like 6'3", I don't want to fight him.

1357
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,500
You should fight Google Foods.

1358
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
But he's a bitch.

1359
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,220
He's always like, "Oh, I was about to kill myself,

1360
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,900
and then Jake Paul stopped me."

1361
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:28,220
It's like, if Jake Paul can stop you from killing yourself,

1362
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,940
you didn't want to do it in the first place.

1363
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,780
- Okay.

1364
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,100
- I will make you kill yourself.

1365
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,620
- Imagine if you called the suicide hotline

1366
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,100
and Jake Paul picked up on the other end.

1367
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,420
- Tried to sell you a Happy Dad seltzer.

1368
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,980
I mean, sounds okay with me, honestly.

1369
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,700
- Yeah, he tells you to walk down to the corner-

1370
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,540
- Honestly, that's what they should do

1371
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,420
with the suicide hotline.

1372
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:50,540
They should make it directly to celebrity phones

1373
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,220
So that you're like, hello, I want to kill myself.

1374
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,620
And then Tom Hanks is like, yeah, yeah.

1375
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,660
You get Chumlee from Pawn Stars.

1376
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,580
You're like, oh my God, Chumlee from Pawn Stars.

1377
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,740
I have like 30 questions to ask you.

1378
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,580
That would stop almost anybody from killing themselves.

1379
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,140
If you called and Michael Jordan picked up.

1380
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,480
Yeah.

1381
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,980
That is such a brilliant idea.

1382
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:13,480
Yeah.

1383
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,300
It should just be a celebrity hotline.

1384
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:16,960
Yeah.

1385
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,580
It's like a reverse make a wish.

1386
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:26,660
Yeah, I guess it's hard to dissuade people from just calling it just because they want

1387
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,820
to talk to a celebrity.

1388
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,900
But that's why it's a random celebrity.

1389
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,900
You know, sometimes...

1390
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,700
I think ropes should have Bluetooth in them and you should only be able to call the celebrity

1391
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,700
hotline...

1392
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,700
If it's over 100 pounds of pressure.

1393
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,700
Right.

1394
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,780
If you're a kid trying to kill yourself, sorry.

1395
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,340
Well then it would call, you know, like...

1396
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,340
We call it YouTubers.

1397
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,340
Phineas and Ferb.

1398
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,340
Yes.

1399
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,340
We call it Phineas and Ferb.

1400
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:59,540
I'm 12 years old, my breasts have grown in, my life is horrible, all the girls are mean

1401
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:05,540
to me at school, and Sandy Cheeks picks up the phone.

1402
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,940
That might work.

1403
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
This is a good idea.

1404
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,940
I think so too.

1405
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,940
Let's get it working.

1406
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,940
Alright, I'm going to make another margarita.

1407
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,940
Alright, see you guys.

1408
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,940
Bye.

1409
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:14,940
See you.

1410
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,940
Bye.
