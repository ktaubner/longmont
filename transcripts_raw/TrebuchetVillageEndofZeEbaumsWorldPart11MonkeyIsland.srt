[Dramatic music]

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, our heroes continued their voyage through the seas in the body of the submarine Changeling Chuggie.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Deftly avoiding a Squidward and his ranted shark, the gang settled on an island of magical fun with no DM parental supervision.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Afterwards, they headed back down into the sea to play a shell game with a friendly croc-topus and his infant, gathering some very neat and very strong items.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
After a few more days of uneventful traveling through the perilous sea-bomb, the gang rests atop an island for their latest in a string of nappies.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is the first island in a while you guys have been doing the thing where Chuggie is

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,440
a submarine and you guys rest on top of him.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:05,880
For context for the listeners at home, we did, you might not be, we did about 8-ish minutes

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,500
and I've never imagined what would happen if we, if you lose, you can't like undo I guess

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,200
story stuff, but we didn't do any story stuff.

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,880
All we did was establish that they're on the island, that Chuggie had cast Leoman's Tiny

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,320
Hut so it just gives him a little hut to rest in. And it was not called Liam

13
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,160
and Stiney Hut it was called Chuggie's Big Ass Pad. Yes Chuggie's Big Ass Pad.

14
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,520
It's not that big though and also um... It's big for his changeling form who I

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,480
was which was Mr. Cutie Pop Star. Yes. Sounds like Robot Drake.

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,920
Robot Drake. But also he can change the voice if he's not feeling it.

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,640
Yeah right. Which I think we kind of established. I think that's fine. I'd also

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
So just to catch us up to speed one more thing,

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,680
we put up a picture of Patrick.

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,080
And the recorder stopped right when I started drawing him nude.

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,920
He's drawing basically under the picture.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,840
It was a good bit.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,120
And right before that too, we found buried under the sand,

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,040
we found millions and millions of gold pieces.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
We found millions of it.

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,080
You can't talk at the same time.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,440
12 million snippets of gold.

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
We found a golden snitch.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,920
Yeah, a snitch and several snippets.

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,320
And by several, I mean 12 million.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,880
You found a golden snitch, and he's telling on you,

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,880
when he's telling me that you guys are lying.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
- Who is? - You're a fucking snitch.

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
- Who told you? - No, I'm telling the golden snitch.

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
- The golden snitch can't talk, it flies.

37
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
- And the only noise the golden snitch makes is...

38
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
- A play on words.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,880
- Oh my god. I hate that sound.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
- And when Harry eats it. - Swallows it.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,880
- Yeah, and then his arm turns into jello.

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
- Yeah. - And then...

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
- That's in a different movie, but...

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
- He is a seeker.

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,880
- Chuggy and Evil and Dogen find 12 million golden snippets.

46
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,840
- Right before that though, it didn't happen.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
- Before that it didn't happen, right,

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
'cause it hadn't happened yet.

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
And then it happened.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,500
- And we will start the scene--

51
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,340
- So then afterward it had happened.

52
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,180
- And we will start the scene--

53
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,000
- Okay.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,800
- We will start the scene where we find 12 million

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
golden snippets and a golden snitch.

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,040
- And we can never--

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
- This can never happen again.

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960
- Snippets and a snitch.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,400
- We found it and we found a gubber.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
- Yeah.

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,060
- A gupper?

62
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,900
- A gubber.

63
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,740
- A gubber.

64
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,560
- A gubber.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
- Fucking gubber.

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
- I remember we found it.

67
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,060
- It's a gold gubber.

68
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,900
- A golden gubber.

69
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,780
- Underneath the snippets and snitch.

70
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,980
In a separate golden layer.

71
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,820
- Okay, ready?

72
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,880
Three, two, one.

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,020
Oh my god, we found a golden snippet.

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,380
- Oh my, wait, is that a golden snitch next to it?

75
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
- That's a golden snitch.

76
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,060
- I wonder what's on the layer beneath it.

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,540
- Wow, it might be a gubber.

78
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,380
I hear that those are common in this area.

79
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,620
- The gubber is under the snippets.

80
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,380
- Oh my god, I just moved the snippets and snitch

81
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,580
and the gubber's underneath.

82
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,420
- And look under the snippet.

83
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,620
- Okay, and so then, after all that.

84
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,460
- Okay.

85
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,380
- Okay, after you guys get weird,

86
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,380
So, you guys, you know, you fall asleep.

87
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,340
You take your little long rest.

88
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,720
And as you begin to rouse from your sleep,

89
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,620
you-- - Oh no, I just woke up

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,700
with big boobs.

91
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,820
(laughing)

92
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,780
- The fuck is, come on.

93
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,580
- I gotta play with these things.

94
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,800
- Well, as you get up to play with your huge tits,

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,980
you look through--

96
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,780
- I look like that woodshop teacher.

97
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,660
- You look through the small window of your tiny hut,

98
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,600
And you notice that it looks like, kind of like,

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,480
the sky is whipping past the trees

100
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,800
that are inside this wooded area.

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,680
And--

102
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
- We're not underneath the fucking thing anymore.

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,380
- No, we're on a giant turtle.

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,220
And...

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,400
- Maybe.

106
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
- We are.

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,060
- We are.

108
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,900
- We have to, we are.

109
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,740
- Fucking asshole.

110
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,440
(laughing)

111
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,040
- And as you walk outside--

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,720
- It's not an island, it's a fucking turtle shell.

113
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,360
- As you walk outside--

114
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
And the hut--

115
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
- That was underneath the cover I saw that turtle--

116
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,120
- There's turtle guts.

117
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
- And the hut dissipates.

118
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,080
You notice that you're surrounded by a few monkeys,

119
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
and one monkey king.

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,340
- That was my second guess.

121
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,480
Were they picking up the hut and moving it?

122
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,240
- No, 'cause when he steps outside the hut,

123
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,280
he's outside the area.

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
- Okay.

125
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,940
- Okay.

126
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
What is a monkey king?

127
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,040
Monkey is a big like, what if there's a monkey king?

128
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
There's a monkey and a monkey king.

129
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,320
And because for this session I'm focusing on us trying new things.

130
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Uh huh.

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
And- Whoa!

132
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Holy shit.

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
And because I left my stuff at home.

134
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,080
Don't tell me you have figurines.

135
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,520
Because I left my stuff at home.

136
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Holy fuck.

137
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
Okay, which one's me?

138
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
What the heff?

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Fire ass map, brother.

140
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,080
It's not a fire ass map, it's the worst thing I've ever done.

141
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
No, this is- we need a picture of this.

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
No, please don't take a picture.

143
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
No, we're taking-

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I had no time.

145
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Please I left my shit at home.

146
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm gonna hide it.

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I seriously won't take a picture.

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
You're gonna take a picture.

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
Why'd you make a...

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Who's the green one?

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
You guys are the green guys.

152
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,560
There's only one green guy.

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
That's me, I'm a goblin.

154
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
I can be green, I'm a goblin.

155
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
There's three that look similar to me and there's four that look different from those three.

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
You're saying you look this color?

157
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
No I...

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,040
We were actually colorblind?

159
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Yeah.

160
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I didn't know that.

161
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm so sorry.

162
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
It's fine.

163
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I mean it's not...

164
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm so sorry.

165
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
It's not the worst ever.

166
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
How the fuck are you...

167
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm surprised you're alive.

168
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
You haven't killed yourself.

169
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,040
I mean I've thought about it but that's for a different time I guess.

170
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Bro you just made it dark as fuck.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So yeah.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,680
I call green guy.

173
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
Yeah roll initiative.

174
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Green goblin.

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,520
Oh I'm so excited.

176
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,800
13 plus my initiative, but 14 so...

177
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I got a 37.

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,600
You got a crit one?

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I mean a 38.

180
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I can't believe that.

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Forgot to add my bonus.

182
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I can't believe that.

183
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
You can't believe that?

184
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
That is some horseshit.

185
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
I hate that number.

186
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
One.

187
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Patrick reacts.

188
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
That is, I can keep that number.

189
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
That is some horse shit.

190
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I hate that number.

191
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Patrick reacts to numbers.

192
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I hate that number.

193
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I hate that number.

194
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
I hate that number.

195
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I hate that number.

196
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I hate that number.

197
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I hate that number.

198
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I hate that number.

199
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Patrick reacts to numbers.

200
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
What did you get, Caleb?

201
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I got a 14.

202
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
And what did you get, Caleb?

203
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
38.

204
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
How many dice do you have?

205
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Come on, bro.

206
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
18.

207
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
You don't need a more than 8.

208
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You don't need to pick them as you need to be careful.

209
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah, but I like to have them.

210
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Don't worry about it.

211
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay, well, I don't, I mean, you have the whole, all of them.

212
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
And then Patrick.

213
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
I have all of them.

214
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Yeah, you got all of them.

215
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
That's a good check.

216
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
That's Mr. Kitty Pop Star, and then that over here is evil.

217
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Patrick reacts to colors.

218
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
And this is, unfortunately for you guys, a news item.

219
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
And then that over here is evil.

220
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Patrick reacts to colors.

221
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
And this is, unfortunately for you guys, a surprise round.

222
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
No.

223
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,600
So, if I had expected this and said, "Oh, we're definitely surrounded by monkeys and a monkey king,"

224
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,600
it would not have been a surprise round, right?

225
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
I don't know. I guess.

226
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I really determined that. So, yeah, if that happened, maybe it wouldn't have been a surprise round.

227
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Nice.

228
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
[LAUGHTER]

229
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
That's a nice thought.

230
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Is that what happened?

231
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Nice.

232
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah.

233
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
So, yeah.

234
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
The first thing that happens--

235
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
This entire code field was spilled on me earlier, and I caught it really quick.

236
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
He just keeps crying about this.

237
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Nobody saw--

238
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I saw it.

239
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
You saw how quick I caught it?

240
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, I don't think it was spilling on you, though.

241
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
No, it was just spilling towards Caleb.

242
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Also, it was almost completely--

243
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
What do you mean it was going towards me?

244
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I saw it.

245
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
The spout was towards me.

246
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
I saw it.

247
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
The liquid flew.

248
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Flew onto Caleb, in fact.

249
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I'm wet with it.

250
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
All right.

251
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,080
This is okay by the way, I'm like moving the mic around a lot. Oh my god

252
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,640
You are being

253
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,040
What

254
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Okay, I've had a busy few weeks and I wanted to do a lot of different stuff for this session

255
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I didn't have a lot of time to prep

256
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,880
But I have enough time to do

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I think pretty much everything

258
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
I can't even look at it

259
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
It's so shitty

260
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
It's the worst thing I've ever done

261
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
I'm so sorry

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I need to make you guys new character sheets, organize the cards

263
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,880
I need to make you guys new character sheets, organize the cards

264
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I need to make you guys new character sheets, organize the cards

265
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
I need to make you guys new character sheets, organize the cards

266
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,920
I wanted to have a battle today, and then I was like fuck I didn't make a map. All good. It's it so

267
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,520
It's going on Pat's be real right now, that's right

268
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, so let's do this shit. Alright, let's do this shit.

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,300
So the monkeys are gonna go first. You see the monkey king

270
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:42,280
Gesture and all of them you see jump into these holes

271
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
that they've dug up.

272
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Wait, what?

273
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Um, M-K-M-M, that's all the holes.

274
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Monkey, no, that's monkey, monkey, king, monkey.

275
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Oh, got it, got it.

276
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Monkey, monkey, king, monkey.

277
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Monkey, monkey, king, king, monkey.

278
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,960
And then the king is going to cast--

279
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Can you describe the king visually?

280
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Yeah, sorry.

281
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I should have done that.

282
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
No, no worries, I'm just very curious.

283
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I think I would.

284
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
So the king is, the king is kind of baboon-esque.

285
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,960
He has like the uh, the long face with those blue and white stripes all along his face.

286
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Uh, and he has a wreath made of uh, bamboo.

287
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
A wreath?

288
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Not like a, uh, like a crown.

289
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
A sheath?

290
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Around his head.

291
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Yeah.

292
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Um, what?

293
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
What is sheath?

294
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Sheath or a wreath?

295
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
A wreath.

296
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
I mean, does he have a red spurting anus?

297
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
He does have a red spurting anus.

298
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Aww, fucking...

299
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,960
When he casts this spell, you can see it faintly glowing behind him.

300
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Um...

301
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Weak spot.

302
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
If I know anything about video games, that's a weak spot.

303
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
An anus is everyone's weak spot.

304
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Mm-hmm.

305
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
That's not true.

306
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Video games taught me that.

307
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
It's a really good place to get shot.

308
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
In the asshole?

309
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Not the hole, but in the ass.

310
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
The anus, though, I say.

311
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
My asshole is a good place for a penis.

312
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
[laughs]

313
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
That's good, man.

314
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
What the fuck?

315
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Wait, what?

316
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
So...

317
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
And so, let's roll some dice.

318
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
What ones do you want?

319
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
D20, as always.

320
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Okay, and...

321
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Okay, and your AC...

322
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
My AC?

323
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Your AC, yeah.

324
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I got a...

325
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:28,960
It's 18.

326
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Okay, yeah, so you're gonna be able to dodge this.

327
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
I got a 19 on my roll.

328
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I mean, you didn't have to roll.

329
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,260
But I got to --

330
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,760
Well, that's great.

331
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
I mean, we can use that another time.

332
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,000
But he shoots -- he waves a staff around and he points it towards

333
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,140
you, and his red anus glows in the back.

334
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,740
And you see a bolt come out.

335
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,780
It's like lightning, and it's like black.

336
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,240
It looks like a black lightning.

337
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,040
And then like as it's approaching you,

338
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,740
it almost turns into a flame.

339
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,080
But you're able to pretty quickly get out of the way of

340
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,880
it coming towards you.

341
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,320
And then the ape is going to also then -- the baboon is going

342
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,080
sort of start to run towards you guys and then jump into that king hole.

343
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
And now we're at the top of the order.

344
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
The surprise round is over.

345
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay.

346
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And you're up, Dogen.

347
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Alright.

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm going to walk up.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can I walk to this king hole?

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You certainly can.

351
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,360
Okay, I'm going to walk right up to the edge of the king hole here.

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,080
And I'm going to use my big oar ability to just pump water in there.

353
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Cool.

354
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,240
There's a huge wave of water down into the hole.

355
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,680
I wish we had some kind of liquid metal ability and make one of those ant hill statues.

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Monkey Hill.

357
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
Yeah.

358
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Not your turn, Patrick.

359
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Yeah. Not your turn, Patrick.

360
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
So the big ore attack, if you look at your other page,

361
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
you'll see what it is.

362
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
It should be listed there.

363
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
It's not.

364
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
It's not, but it's right here.

365
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah. I mean, it's just a range attack.

366
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,680
So just roll a d20 and add your dex plus your proficiency.

367
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Okay.

368
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Which will be plus 3, I think, and then plus 2?

369
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Plus 1. So that's 11.

370
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,380
Okay. Go at 11. Yeah.

371
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,880
So you shoot that like wave of ore.

372
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
That ore.

373
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,380
You like whap it against the wall of the hole.

374
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,880
Yeah. I'm massaging the edge of this hole with my ore.

375
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
And as the --

376
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,380
And I'm filling it with liquid.

377
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,880
As you're filling it with water.

378
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,380
A wave.

379
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,880
It's spurting into the hole.

380
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,380
It's filling it.

381
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,880
A little bit's dribbling out.

382
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,480
Most of it just fills up on the hole, overflows, and then sort of spills out along the rest

383
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,300
of the ground and the sand and dirt kind of around you.

384
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,920
And then some of it squirts out of each of these monkey holes.

385
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,120
Dude, right in the eyes.

386
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,800
You just stuck the landing on.

387
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,760
hole. Some of it squirts out of each of the monkey holes. I squirted into the king hole

388
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,560
and all the other holes just cream pining out. And roll for damage, which should be

389
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:18,080
2d8 I believe. I think you guys, if Patrick was able to share his dice this would be a

390
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,240
That's going to be a lot easier.

391
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,040
Still pretty good.

392
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,840
Six.

393
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
Okay, cool.

394
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,120
So, yeah, you hear the faint groan of monkeys from elsewhere.

395
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,220
After you do that.

396
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,520
Groan?

397
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Faint groan.

398
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,020
Yeah, can you demonstrate?

399
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Right?

400
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,300
Something like that.

401
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,660
Okay, cool.

402
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,040
Also, though, on your turn, after you do that, though,

403
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,040
the monkeys jumps out of this hole and shoots the same thing as that other monkey, the king

404
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,040
monkey you shot at, and misses also.

405
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
That's right.

406
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
And goes back into the hole.

407
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
His legs are shaking too hard.

408
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
And goes back into the hole.

409
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
That's right.

410
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Oh my god, he can barely walk after squirting.

411
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Holy fuck.

413
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
And now, uh...

414
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
His mascara's running...

415
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
[LAUGHTER]

416
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,760
It's got long acrylic nails.

417
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,260
Yeah.

418
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,400
Is it my turn?

419
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,560
No, it's the monkey's turn, actually.

420
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,120
And so the king monkey pops out of this hole

421
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
and goes over to swing at you, Mr. Cutie Pop Star.

422
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,480
Oh, no.

423
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,240
You sounded like Cleveland.

424
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,320
That definitely hits you.

425
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
I sounded more like Cleveland.

426
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Hey guys, it's me, Drake.

427
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
He deals 8 damage to you.

428
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
8?

429
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Yeah.

430
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
As he sort of batters you with his...

431
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Motherfucker?

432
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
You just did an earnest motherfucker?

433
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I've never heard that from you.

434
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Motherfucker.

435
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Under your breath.

436
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
Motherfucker.

437
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Motherfucker.

438
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Motherfucker.

439
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
It's another Patrick reacts to numbers.

440
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
something crazy is happening

441
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
something is weird

442
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
the electrical field in this room

443
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
that's why the recorder turned off earlier

444
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
he's gonna hit you again

445
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
me?

446
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
yeah

447
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
for another 13 damage

448
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
he's just beating the shit out of you

449
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
god damn

450
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
holy shit you're getting fucked by these monkeys

451
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
you're getting rammed

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
now it's your turn

453
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
can I use my action?

454
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
I have one non-attack action, right?

455
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Uh, yeah, you can like... well, so it depends.

456
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Like, you can... you have like a free action to say something.

457
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Like, you can definitely do that. You can use an action, and then if you have a bonus action...

458
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Can I only say something?

459
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Uh, you can say something and then take...

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Can I do like a check or anything?

461
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Um, I'll let you do a check, yeah.

462
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Can I do... we're on an island, right?

463
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes.

464
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Can I do an investigation check really quickly?

465
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Investigation typically is like a... you can do like an insight check.

466
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Can I do an insight check? I just want to see if there...

467
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,600
there

468
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:21,000
okay

469
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,640
i'll i'll i'll tell you you have to do a check you know there is a banana

470
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Banana tree.

471
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Roll banana magnet.

472
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
You have that in your cards.

473
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Banana tree is over here.

474
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
I saw that earlier.

475
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
You have banana magnet in your cards.

476
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,560
Oh my god, a banana tree.

477
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
That must be why they're here.

478
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, you better use banana magnet.

479
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I don't have...

480
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm looking through my snow book.

481
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
I don't have banana magnet.

482
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
No, you definitely have.

483
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I remember when you learned about the magnet.

484
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Well, there it is.

485
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
There it is.

486
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Banana magnet.

487
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
The banana magnet tree.

488
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
The banana tree is over here.

489
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
It's a magnet tree.

490
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
The banana tree is over here.

491
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,520
And the tree is also made of magnets.

492
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Can I go up and hold my knife?

493
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Do I have a knife?

494
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
I can't hold my knife to it.

495
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
You should have a dagger.

496
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
If I didn't put it in there you should have one.

497
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,320
I'm going to hold my dagger to the banana tree's trunk like I'm holding a hostage.

498
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,440
Like I'm going to slit its throat.

499
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,120
If you do, the only thing is that you will provoke an attack from this guy.

500
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
He's gonna hit his fucking gun in the tree.

501
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
No, he'll hit you.

502
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
If you're leaving his...

503
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
I'll dodge it, asshole.

504
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Oh, okay.

505
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Yeah.

506
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Okay.

507
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
Use disengage.

508
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Use disengage.

509
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
So you can use, yeah.

510
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
You can use a disengage action.

511
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Thank you.

512
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Yeah.

513
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
I don't know why he didn't tell you you could use that.

514
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
He wants to see you fail.

515
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Well, the only thing is that...

516
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I mean, you're not gonna attack or anything, right?

517
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
You're just gonna threaten the tree?

518
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
I'm just gonna threaten the tree.

519
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Yeah, so you can use disengage.

520
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Don't take one single fucking step closer...

521
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,400
or else your banana tree will be cut.

522
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,600
I'll cut a hole in it.

523
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,220
- And I've seen this guy kill the child before.

524
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,520
(laughing)

525
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,760
- You can roll deception with advantage.

526
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,680
- I've definitely killed,

527
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,400
Evil Steve has definitely killed a child before.

528
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
- Roll again with advantage.

529
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
- I think we probably did kill a child like during this.

530
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
- You've definitely killed a child.

531
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,080
- Yeah, that's 25.

532
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,280
- Okay, cool.

533
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
So they definitely believe that,

534
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,760
so you see, as he says that,

535
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,000
You see two of the monkeys come out of this hole,

536
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
pop their heads out over here.

537
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,520
And one monkey can look its head out of this hole.

538
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,040
And as you say that,

539
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,720
you're like, "Let's go over to see what you're saying."

540
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,520
- That's right, I will cut a little,

541
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,700
I'm not sure that I can cut the whole tree in half right now,

542
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,560
but I will cut like a little line on it,

543
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,320
or I will carve my initials.

544
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
- Just like my eyebrow.

545
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,800
- I will carve my initials,

546
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,340
plus Cutie Pop Star's initials in a heart.

547
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,020
- Roll intimidation.

548
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,520
with probably advantage

549
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I got a 15 and a cure 1 so I'll take the 15

550
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
yeah you will take the 15

551
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
and then

552
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
let's just try this

553
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,520
yeah alright cool

554
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
you see the monkey king trying to gesture to the monkeys

555
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
like trying to calm them down

556
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,520
like pointing to his ass

557
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
like it's fine

558
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
you see the monkeys are actually kind of worried

559
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,400
You see the monkeys are actually kind of worried.

560
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:27,000
One of them kind of crawls out and goes up to you to try to get you to stop.

561
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,880
I tighten my grip on the banana tree.

562
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,920
Slow your roll there.

563
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,720
Banana, or no, monkey.

564
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
While this is going on, can I just look, I just remembered that...

565
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm mostly just trying to distract him for you guys.

566
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
We're going to kill these monkeys.

567
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,160
So one of them is out here.

568
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I had a move.

569
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,820
I have a man is a lure what you have managed to do is lure one of them out and it's pretty

570
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,360
distracted the other two are like the other two are still peeping out of the hole and

571
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,960
haven't like been fully like and what time of the year what pretty right there grape

572
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,500
bananas okay rape bananas they're grape bananas just a little bit of green at the top a couple

573
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:13,000
spots you know a few spots yeah ready to go banana bread territory yes no no no I just

574
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's have a quick, before the next action.

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Do we know what was going on when we saw the sky whizzing by?

576
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Have we figured out what that meant?

577
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Did you?

578
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, when we came outside, was it still...

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, we already did. We're on a turtle shell.

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Is it still going? Like, would we see...

581
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Here's what I can tell you. Yeah, so what you're seeing, you're still seeing the sky whizzing by.

582
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I would say that now that you've gotten out, and you can peer a little bit over the...

583
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Can you hear me still?

584
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah, but you should just still talk.

585
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Sorry.

586
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
As you can peer out over, like, a shallow, like, hill.

587
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,080
you're kind of like up a little bit on the island,

588
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
you peer over a shallow--

589
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,160
- Run up that lady's ass.

590
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,800
- You can see that the water is whipping by

591
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,680
at a speed that is like insane to you.

592
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,920
Like if you dipped your hand in it,

593
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,200
it would like come off kind of fast.

594
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
- We'll figure that out later.

595
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,200
I was just curious.

596
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
I just thought we would have been able to see that

597
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,880
and I wanted to know what was up.

598
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,280
- 'Cause I got these monkeys by the bananas

599
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,960
and I wanna see them squirm into there.

600
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I wanna see their holes squirt squirming kids.

601
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
That's right, we're gonna abuse those monkeys' holes.

602
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Oh, okay.

603
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Okay.

604
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Yeah, so uh...

605
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Whose turn is it? It is now your turn.

606
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I'm gonna use um, dissonant whispers.

607
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Oh, describe that to me.

608
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
So you whisper a discordant...

609
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Say that in drag, say "dissonant whispers."

610
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Dissonant whispers.

611
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear.

612
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Racking it with terrible pain.

613
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
This doesn't sound like you.

614
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,880
This doesn't sound like him, this is a bad image.

615
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,760
The target must make a wisdom saving throw on a failed save, blah blah blah.

616
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
How much damage will it take?

617
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
That's the important part.

618
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,760
It'll do 3d6 psychic damage.

619
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,480
It must immediately use a reaction if available to move as far as its speed allows away from

620
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
you.

621
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,360
The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous grounds such as fire or a pit.

622
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,800
a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away.

623
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,560
A deafened creature automatically succeeds in the save.

624
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,360
So here's what I would say to you.

625
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Well I was going to use that on the king.

626
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,480
Yep, because if it runs away from you, you get an attack of opportunity also.

627
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
So I was going to do that.

628
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Perfect.

629
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
So he's going to make a wisdom saving throw.

630
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Your spell DC, what is it?

631
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I think it's 15.

632
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,400
It should be on the other page if it's on this one.

633
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
On the top of the other page.

634
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh yeah, it's on the other page.

635
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Yep, okay.

636
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
I knew it.

637
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I want you to see it though.

638
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Okay, it's wisdom.

639
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Excuse me.

640
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Excuse me, it's not that good. So he does fail.

641
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Yeah. So roll for damage. 3d6. The Monkey King is not wise.

642
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,400
He is just a monkey. He's a king of a dinky little...

643
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,400
He's a king of a... He's not the real... He's not like a real monkey king.

644
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Two fives and a six? Wow, holy crap. That's 16 damage.

645
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,400
That makes 16. Woo! Okay.

646
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Motherfucker! So now, and we'll...

647
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
And now Dissonant Whispers, what level spell is that?

648
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,120
is, oh I'm going to use it in the second level.

649
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,920
Okay, so you're going to add another D6 to that.

650
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,420
Yeah.

651
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,400
That's four.

652
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,760
That's very good, that's still 20.

653
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,920
So, second level, then that means you take out a second level of your spell slots,

654
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,000
that's on the second page.

655
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,720
We won't worry too much about that, I can keep that, like, track of that, really, this session probably.

656
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,000
But we're going to start getting you used to tracking that.

657
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,760
I didn't get to go over that with you yet, so don't worry too much about it.

658
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,200
But I'll keep tracking it over here.

659
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
So, these two dots right here?

660
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
The two dots, so these, this is like first level spells.

661
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Sorry.

662
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Second level spells, third level spells.

663
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
So right now you should have...

664
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
This whole thing filled out?

665
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
No, no, no, you'll fill out one of these right now.

666
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
You'll fill these whole things?

667
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Yes.

668
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
There you go.

669
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
So, now.

670
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Now that you've done that, and the king is now afraid of you,

671
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,480
so he's going to try to run, which means you have an attack of opportunity.

672
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
Can I say what I told him?

673
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Oh, absolutely. What's the melody you whispered?

674
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
And what was it?

675
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
I know you don't wipe that ass.

676
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,480
You see the king get like really bashful and go, "No man, no man!"

677
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
He's like very upset.

678
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Wait, do the other monkey... Wait, can I address the other monkey real quick?

679
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
You address the one who's in front of you.

680
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,480
So do you... So, he's embarrassed. Does that mean that you are wiping your ass as a monkey?

681
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Why did I even try to do that?

682
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
of these monkeys like their asses

683
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,440
yeah i've been on the whole area and then they're

684
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,800
so yeah uh... and now do an attack role

685
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,920
so you have a rapier you can use what

686
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,680
sills that's really

687
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,400
uh... i've got a lot of that i'm not just a bit uh... it is going to give you a

688
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,320
different weapon after this

689
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,240
you've rolled into a d_n_a_ was i think we got started on sets in this campaign

690
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,160
nineteen

691
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,160
was

692
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:04,120
okay nice

693
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,960
the pre-k_c_a_c_ stabby as is running away holding its but you poke it right

694
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,960
the but

695
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:45,560
so

696
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:57,800
rate

697
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:15,400
just

698
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:38,880
and

699
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,400
monkey jumps out and claps its hands really loud and makes like a thundering clap.

700
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,320
I'm going to clap you monkey!

701
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,080
And he jumps back into the hole and disappears.

702
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,800
Now you can't do anything with it Pat.

703
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,680
Also no one can hear you so I sound crazy or unusual.

704
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,480
So you want to attack this guy or what?

705
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,640
Yeah I'm going to whack a mole on his head.

706
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
That is a...

707
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,400
Where's my attack stuff?

708
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:25,520
or

709
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
I mean you don't have a shield so.

710
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Okay, that is 5 damage.

711
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,520
And I'm just going to whack them all again.

712
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Yeah.

713
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Okay.

714
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
That's 9 damage.

715
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Nice.

716
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Okay, so you do another, you do a good hefty amount of damage to this guy.

717
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,520
This monkey is still alive.

718
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
He's 12, but he's not looking too good.

719
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
And now it is.

720
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
Does he have a looney tunes on his head?

721
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
Yeah, you know that.

722
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,920
know that. It looks like a dash roll but it's on his head. Yeah, two of them. And now, three,

723
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,440
two of them, ones. Two ones. Two ones on his head. That monkey is going to try to attack

724
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:09,440
you back though. I gave him two ones. Okay, he does hit you, but he just barely hits you.

725
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:17,360
Okay, he does nine damage to you. And then another monkey is going to jump out of this

726
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:35,000
This

727
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What's your HP right now?

728
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Seven.

729
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Uh oh.

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You're fine right now.

731
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Uh oh, does another five damage to you.

732
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You're not looking too good.

733
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh no, oh no, I need help, I need help so bad.

734
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh no, I'm dying, I'm dying, oh no, no.

735
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,160
And this other one's gonna jump out and go after you, and is gonna run for the tree right

736
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
now.

737
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
So he's not-

738
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I sliced the tree.

739
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
As a reaction?

740
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,200
You could use it as a reaction, I'll let you like, start to like dig your dagger into the

741
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
the tree.

742
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,200
Yeah, I, I, and a banana tree as far as I know is pretty fucking thin.

743
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Yes.

744
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,680
So I'm going to just, I'm going to slide it all the way through.

745
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
You're going to cut it down.

746
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Yeah, I'm chopping this down.

747
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Okay.

748
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
The monkey goes, "Whaaaaaat?"

749
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
George Washington.

750
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,560
As you cut, cut it down, and it gets distracted and runs away from you and towards the tree.

751
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah.

752
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,540
As it's falling down, so it doesn't attack you.

753
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:32,080
And the monkey king now is going to jump back into this hole and go away.

754
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,560
And now it's your turn, Evil.

755
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Okay.

756
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Um, I think that I...

757
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,840
So there's one monkey that is looking... that is near me.

758
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Yeah, he's looking towards his fallen tree.

759
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:54,040
He's sort of wailing like an old Italian woman at a funeral in Sicily.

760
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Okay.

761
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
That's interesting.

762
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
You know what that's like.

763
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm going to do...

764
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I'm going to do Vampiric Touch.

765
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Hell yeah. Tell us what that does.

766
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,040
The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds.

767
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach.

768
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:25,040
On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

769
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

770
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Hell yeah.

771
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Okay.

772
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
So, make that attack roll.

773
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,040
You see, it should be a kicker add plus 6 to it.

774
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Okay, so it's a 20 now.

775
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
It's a 20?

776
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Yeah.

777
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Alright, that does... so you go over to this monkey that was...

778
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
You go over to the monkey that was running away from you?

779
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
Mm-hmm.

780
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Or do you go over to the...

781
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
I get that fucking piece of shit.

782
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Yeah.

783
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,040
That's me right there?

784
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Yeah, that's you.

785
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Okay.

786
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Okay, I kill him.

787
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
You go over to that monkey and you use this attack on him.

788
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
So roll for damage on it.

789
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
So it should be on the top there.

790
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
I think I put it...

791
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
3d6 is what it is.

792
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Yeah.

793
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Mm-hmm.

794
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Let's do all ones. Yeah, why not? I'm in Rome.

795
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I got a 1, 3, and a 6. That's not bad. What if we turn the 6 upside down?

796
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,040
That's a 9. That's still pretty good. It's still a 10. Let's turn that 6 upside down.

797
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
And you also gain 7 HP back. I'm gonna turn the 3 upside down.

798
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
You haven't taken any damage. So nothing happens there. But you can now

799
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,040
continually use that as your attack, as it said. And now we're gonna go to

800
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Is it my turn? Your turn. Okay, so you said that I get

801
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,680
get as a bard I get one of these. Yes, bardic inspirations. Like a feat, yeah. I also may

802
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,680
also have. Does enthralling performance count as. So enthralling performance you would use.

803
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,120
That's a full move? No, it's no it's more like it's more like in a roleplay situation

804
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,000
you would do a performance and then like at the end of it people could maybe be charmed.

805
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,360
Okay, because I have an eye perfect. But that takes like a minute, it has to be like a minute

806
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:15,720
of

807
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
Oh my god.

808
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,360
You can change- He saw the bananas on the tree!

809
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,000
That's not how a changing works.

810
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Uh uh.

811
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
No, I got it wrong.

812
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
No no no no no.

813
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm changing into the form of a banana.

814
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
No!

815
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm changing into the form of a banana.

816
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That you met before.

817
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Oh you kid.

818
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
That I've met before.

819
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Peanut butter jelly time.

820
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Absolutely.

821
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Who sang one of the- You knew right away.

822
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Peanut butter jelly time?

823
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Who sang one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.

824
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:45,040
And I look at the monkeys and I say- I mean you're making it hard for me to say no to

825
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,040
And I do peanut butter jelly time.

826
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
You think so? You think I should?

827
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Yeah, have a little bit of self respect.

828
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Alright, well now it feels like the self respect I should have is to let him do it.

829
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
You think so?

830
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
No, that's...

831
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
I guess not.

832
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Yeah, no, I mean, I'll let you turn into a peanut butter jelly time banana, but that's not going to have any effect on anything.

833
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040
Well, except for his fucking yellow skin.

834
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
He'll look cool.

835
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
look cool.

836
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,120
Ok, Barton, I will still use enthralling performance.

837
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,400
No because that's going to take a minute of time.

838
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,840
So what you can do, you just have to pick something you can do.

839
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
So you have a few-

840
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
What do you mean I can't do that?

841
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,080
I wish I could fall asleep on command.

842
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,120
So you can do that, but it takes a minute of game time.

843
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Oh it takes a minute for me to prepare you?

844
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Yes.

845
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,520
I thought you meant it takes a minute for me to do the whole performance.

846
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Even then, the turn is six seconds.

847
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,520
I'll cover my body in banana and they'll jump on me ravenously for one full minute and you

848
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
can prepare.

849
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
No, no, I know what I'm doing.

850
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
You also have like spells.

851
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
I'm going to use bardic inspiration.

852
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Yes, you can do that as well.

853
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
That's like a good bonus action thing to do.

854
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,520
You can use mantle of inspiration.

855
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Look at your spell list and see.

856
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
I'm going to cast invisibility.

857
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Okay, I like that.

858
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Because I'm so low in health.

859
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
That's a good move.

860
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm casting invisibility, but...

861
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,020
Wow.

862
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,560
It's like the opposite of becoming a banana.

863
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,060
Yeah.

864
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,320
He became a banana and then turned invisible.

865
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,560
[LAUGHTER]

866
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,160
We're just like, OK.

867
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,560
All right.

868
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,040
That didn't make a lot of sense.

869
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,880
So then I'll use Bardic Inspiration

870
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
because they can hear me, right?

871
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
Yes, they'll be able to hear you.

872
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,160
OK, so invisible banana sings to you.

873
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,440
Like, we're all looking at him.

874
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,040
It's his turn.

875
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,540
[LAUGHTER]

876
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,800
He turns into a banana and then he's gone.

877
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
[LAUGHTER]

878
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,920
And then we only see him as a banana for like the equivalent of one frame.

879
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,120
It's like a subliminal message.

880
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Yeah, exactly.

881
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Tyler Durden.

882
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,120
Yeah, exactly.

883
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,640
As a banana.

884
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,880
So then I'm gonna...

885
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,280
Anybody within 60 feet of me, if they hear me, I can give them a die for an ability check

886
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,320
at that roller saving throw.

887
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,360
So you're up next in the rotation?

888
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
I think so.

889
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Yes.

890
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
On your next turn I'll give you...

891
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Give him a D8 for an attack roll.

892
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
What do you say?

893
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
You became a banana and you disappeared and then we hear your disembodied voice.

894
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
It's P!

895
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Yeah it is, yeah.

896
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
I knew it, that's all I said.

897
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,360
It's P!

898
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,360
It's P?

899
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Wait, what's P?

900
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Oh my god, the stuff coming out of the monkeys holes is P!

901
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
This work is P!

902
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Oh my fucking god.

903
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
But you are inspired by this, Dogen.

904
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:40,040
inspired by this dogan yeah I'm not only so now you know what to do pnm or monkeys

905
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:55,560
okay I know how to do a crazy attack yeah it's P that's how it's big so I mean

906
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,160
this is good because you can use it for an attack role it's squirt but also

907
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,160
also

908
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,160
it

909
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:20,160
it

910
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,160
like

911
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:47,160
of

912
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,200
This turn though, you'll be able to use that.

913
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,160
And I think that should break invisibility though if you do an attack.

914
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
But that'll be perfect because it'll gain your health back.

915
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,120
So we're back to the top of the order.

916
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Dogen.

917
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Okay.

918
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,200
I'll just whack a mole again because I have the bonus on my attack roll.

919
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Hell yeah.

920
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Whack a monkey, I should say.

921
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
You should say that.

922
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I should say that.

923
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
You're going to have to say that.

924
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm not going to, but I should say it.

925
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,280
What do I roll to give him the bonus?

926
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,080
Well now, okay, it's a good thing you gave me that bonus.

927
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,120
So I need a D8.

928
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,120
He gets to roll a D8.

929
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Not you.

930
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,120
Not you, Pat.

931
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
He's got it.

932
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,120
That was very useful and that does make sure that's a 15 total.

933
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Yeah, that hits now.

934
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
That's why Barak's version's great.

935
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
That's why it's great.

936
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Okay, that's 11 damage.

937
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
That's great. Two.

938
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Is he dead? That monkey is almost dead.

939
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Okay, I'll attack again then.

940
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
Do I get to add the D8 to... he talks?

941
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
He just said "please."

942
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
He just said "please."

943
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Please, please.

944
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
He just talked.

945
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:51,120
it

946
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,120
I mean, he's scared.

947
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Okay, I'll just hit him again.

948
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Yeah, go for it.

949
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Do I get to add the DA both times?

950
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,120
No, no, no.

951
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,120
Okay, yeah, that hits. I mean, he's dead.

952
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
How do you kill him?

953
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Can I whack him on the head so hard that he goes down?

954
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Yes.

955
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
Down into the hole and then he shoots up out of another hole and he fly up.

956
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,120
And there's squirt leaking out of his butt from earlier as he goes.

957
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
And it's like it's raining when he flies away.

958
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:45,120
So

959
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
to be top one feelings on your penis.

960
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
No.

961
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Is there anything else you want to do?

962
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Even better than fucking sex.

963
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,120
For me, it's the jizz.

964
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I think that's all my action. I guess I can move.

965
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
It's jizz!

966
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Come on, stop.

967
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Pat wants to hear the kids sing that.

968
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Oh, bonus actions.

969
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Yeah, I mean, I...

970
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Yeah, you're just gonna chill.

971
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,120
I'll walk over to the next bunkie.

972
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
No, I won't. I'll let him come to me.

973
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Okay. You are up now, monkeys.

974
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
That's right. Let him come on me.

975
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,120
The king monkey hops out.

976
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,120
Other way around. Other way around.

977
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
The king monkey hops.

978
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Let me come on him.

979
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Let me come.

980
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I'm not going to you. I'm letting me come on you.

981
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
What?

982
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,120
The king monkey hops out and starts to slam the ground like Donkey Kong.

983
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,120
And you guys feel the ground shift underneath you.

984
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Slam that monkey with my donkey cock.

985
00:40:42,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Monkey

986
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,000
crit 1. So he's going to swipe at you and then also like move at a range and then give you

987
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
an opportunity to attack with that 1. That was cool. Okay that's a 23. Yeah that hits.

988
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,600
That's an 11. Nice. Okay. That king monkey is not. Spank him. That king monkey is not

989
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,600
looking good. He's looking good to me. I'm going to put these up against him. Good enough

990
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
He's a banana.

991
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Good enough to...

992
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,760
That monkey you did vampiric touch to is gonna try to grab you back.

993
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,160
Bro, you look good enough to squirt on.

994
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
What's up?

995
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
You did fucking terribly.

996
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
You gotta try one more time.

997
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,560
You're terrible at grabbing.

998
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
Let me show you how a real monkey grabs.

999
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,600
Or no, I guess I'm not a monkey.

1000
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
Okay, I'll just...

1001
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Oh, God.

1002
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,400
And that's how I grab my penam up against a banana tree.

1003
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,560
I see that and I go...

1004
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,560
The other monkey is trying to throw a doo-doo at you, Cameron.

1005
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
I eat the doo-doo.

1006
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
God, he's missing.

1007
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
I catch the doo-doo in it.

1008
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
All the monkeys fucking just whiff.

1009
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
Can I catch the doo-doo in my mouth?

1010
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
No, it's your turn though.

1011
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Okay.

1012
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
Throw the doo-doo at my...

1013
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,560
[laughter]

1014
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Try to knock my teeth out with it like a carnival game.

1015
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Um...

1016
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,560
I mean, when it's my turn.

1017
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Okay.

1018
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,560
Well, for now, I guess I'll just fuck this monkey.

1019
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:34,040
Are you gonna try to fuck them? No, I'm gonna finger him with the chill touch. Mm-hmm

1020
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Like I remember what that does. Yeah, so it allows you to touch them chilly and you can roll

1021
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,400
Roll d20

1022
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,360
Okay, 1d8 necrotic damage, but I'll cast it at a higher

1023
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,200
Mm-hmm

1024
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
Where are you up casting it?

1025
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,240
20 as a crit. What do you up cast it to the third?

1026
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:05,040
level. So that's adding how many d8? Two more or three more? None. None more? Yeah it doesn't

1027
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,440
increase until you get to the fifth level. Oh no, so this is um... Okay you're stealing

1028
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,160
my cards now. No so once you reach the fifth level it does 2d8 damage because it's a cantrip.

1029
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,400
So you're just going to do 2d8 damage but spells do have crits until, I know D&D changed it

1030
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
but it does.

1031
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
That's not a D8.

1032
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
You're right.

1033
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,120
It's the, yeah, it's like two triangles.

1034
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
It's the one with eight sides.

1035
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Yeah.

1036
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,720
So you roll that four times now.

1037
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
Four?

1038
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,400
That's a three, that's a six, that's a two, and that's an eight.

1039
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,280
That monkey's dead.

1040
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,000
You just like grabbed that, you fingered that monkey to death.

1041
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
I fingered the monkey until he's fucking dead.

1042
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,080
It's like, as you're fingering it, and it's like looking at the fallen banana tree, and

1043
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,760
like eyes are just going wide with fear and sorrow.

1044
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,000
And it spurts jizz out.

1045
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then it calms.

1046
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,240
Like when a dead body shoots shit.

1047
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,600
Yeah, but except for this monkey, it's jizz.

1048
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,160
Yeah.

1049
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,920
Yeah.

1050
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,400
Bye-bye, jizz monkey.

1051
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,320
Jizz in my pants.

1052
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,720
Yeah.

1053
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,920
Yes!

1054
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,400
Still in the banana form.

1055
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,880
In the final--

1056
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,680
You're invisible.

1057
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,160
Yeah, but I'm still in banana form.

1058
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:19,880
The final monkey?

1059
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
The final monkey--

1060
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,200
The final monkey.

1061
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Is the King Monkey still alive?

1062
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Oh no, both of them are done. All their turns are done.

1063
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
Yeah, the King Monkey is still alive.

1064
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
It is your turn.

1065
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
I want to interrogate the King Monkey.

1066
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
I'm not going to give you that chance.

1067
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
You can use the bludder.

1068
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I want to see him sharing stone base against me while I'm interrogating him.

1069
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,200
So roll a d20 and add your dex.

1070
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,200
Plus proficiency.

1071
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
My dexterity is 13.

1072
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,200
So it's a plus 1 and then we're going to add your proficiency, plus 3, so it's a plus 4.

1073
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
You're all proficient with firearms.

1074
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,200
And who are you shooting by the way, the monkey or the king?

1075
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,200
I'm this far...

1076
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Probably that one right there.

1077
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Yeah, okay, you mean you hit him with a .14?

1078
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,200
Uh-huh.

1079
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
It's a now roll...

1080
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh shit, I don't have my stats.

1081
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,200
I wish I remembered what I wrote for the bludder, because I don't have it now because I left my computer at home.

1082
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Let's say it does like a million damage.

1083
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:34,040
does

1084
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:41,040
monkeys

1085
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,840
aids

1086
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:53,480
he can't remember the numbers he doesn't get to keep you said he was dead

1087
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,520
you say he's dead it doesn't matter

1088
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,960
you get eleven points of health back

1089
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,280
yeah we'll say that

1090
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,000
you know let's go with track

1091
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,280
moving on

1092
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,300
i mean i think you track it becomes an actual issue where you start to die

1093
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,520
all the sudden

1094
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,560
but uh...

1095
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,560
now i don't want to answer i i i'm stomp strutting myself on what i'm

1096
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,480
strutting up to the king monkey

1097
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,640
push 'em down the ground missionary

1098
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,840
hit 'em with my shovel

1099
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Right on the belly.

1100
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,840
Alright, roll, roll attack roll.

1101
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,840
That is a 17.

1102
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
That hits.

1103
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
That's 5 damage.

1104
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
Okay.

1105
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
He's still alive.

1106
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Alright, flip him over monkey style.

1107
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
Okay.

1108
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Sick.

1109
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,840
That's a 13.

1110
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
That does not hit.

1111
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Alright.

1112
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
That's fine.

1113
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
So you just flip him over.

1114
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,840
He's sitting on all fours, looking back at you.

1115
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,840
(laughter)

1116
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,840
(laughter)

1117
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,840
(laughter)

1118
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,840
(laughter)

1119
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
(laughter)

1120
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,840
(laughter)

1121
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,840
(laughter)

1122
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,840
(laughter)

1123
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
(laughter)

1124
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,840
(laughter)

1125
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,840
(laughter)

1126
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
(laughter)

1127
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
(laughter)

1128
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,840
(laughter)

1129
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,560
come on

1130
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,560
which is going to go attack who

1131
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,680
okay

1132
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,760
you know we've had those

1133
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,560
that's reasons in the that's right i have fixed that

1134
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,520
uh... many missus he missed not happen again

1135
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,720
uh... never touch machine every that's it's true i'm not

1136
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:47,720
and is your turn now

1137
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,400
I will just kick him.

1138
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
What's in a name?

1139
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Alright, yeah, you're going to kick him, you're going to do an unarmed attack.

1140
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
Do an unarmed attack, just to disrespect him.

1141
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Okay, so that's going to be just roll a d20 and add your strength, which is I think a -1, or a zero.

1142
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
I got a 3.

1143
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:28,400
to

1144
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,400
you find it

1145
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,240
uh... yeah that's it and then you're up now checking

1146
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,680
your visible by the way

1147
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,700
on visible now okay uh... so there's still been a

1148
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,840
no

1149
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,840
you turn back from a turns out

1150
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,800
you know what i do it is obviously to open it

1151
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,040
you quickly to

1152
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,680
and then because i don't know because it's a it's an eyelash in case the gum arabic

1153
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,440
in the eyelashes from people

1154
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,560
the original

1155
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,280
here

1156
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,400
arabic stuff

1157
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,400
on the news

1158
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,720
hello section

1159
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,240
mhm wailing word

1160
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,720
uh... you can use creature of my choice that you can see within range of gains

1161
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,200
hit points to equal... oh well I can't use that on myself.

1162
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,200
You can't use it on yourself.

1163
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:34,160
Let's kill this monkey king so we can move on and funderstand why the island is moving.

1164
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
We need to find the funderstand.

1165
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
I will use vicious mockery.

1166
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,680
Why don't we just offer this monkey king some snippets.

1167
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,920
You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can

1168
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
see within range.

1169
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,200
The target can hear you, though it need not understand you.

1170
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,060
must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 damage and have disadvantage on the next

1171
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,260
attack roll before it hits the next turn.

1172
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:04,100
So it did succeed on the wisdom saving throw, but what did you say?

1173
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,580
I see a little bit of poop on your butt.

1174
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,100
Yeah, that's probably why it failed.

1175
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,100
He didn't even know what it was.

1176
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
Yeah, he's sorry to shrugs.

1177
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,620
He's like, I'm a fucking ape.

1178
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,940
Okay, so with my bonus action.

1179
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:25,940
you

1180
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:32,940
inspiration

1181
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,940
is

1182
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,780
a_t_d_ i would say you're better off using just part of inspiration because

1183
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,160
mantle of inspiration to try the new york people

1184
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,500
yeah i think you're going on and you're if you're thinking of giving me some

1185
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,540
protection right now and i thank you

1186
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:51,020
i don't need protection like that but maybe like some spicy blue or something

1187
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,300
okay so if you say this little slow with tamarind

1188
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,420
and show more

1189
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,020
and that i mean and this description of the lube

1190
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,660
inspires you

1191
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,220
uh... so now you have a d_n_a_

1192
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,360
using its tackle which is

1193
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,520
maybe now ok

1194
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,620
it's your turn

1195
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,020
uh... you can get it at your advantage but if you're flanking

1196
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,300
okay uh...

1197
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,540
yelled as a uh... this polarizing ramon

1198
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,340

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,520
tonight i guess i would are quick was the first number of the truth

1202
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,400
yes if i wrote this could i get a critters that count as you know

1203
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,480
all right then you know both of them

1204
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,000
because was a plus like five plus five people in the midst of a year ago

1205
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,520
do it

1206
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,260
that's uh... six damage

1207
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,080
director will get the next attack of the

1208
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:59,080
with

1209
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,080
Okay, that's a 20. Not a natural 20.

1210
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,080
30-20.

1211
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
That's... yeah, so okay, that hits him, right?

1212
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,080
That hits. I'm gonna tell you you're gonna kill him.

1213
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Okay, that's 4 damage.

1214
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,080
That kills him.

1215
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,080
Can we Pukaki his corpse?

1216
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,080
Yeah.

1217
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Sure.

1218
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,080
Yeah, and I hit his... I was whacking his nuts too.

1219
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
I didn't want to say it while he was alive.

1220
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
Oh, mama!

1221
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
I put a banana in his tailpipe.

1222
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,080
Arrooga!

1223
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,080
He's dead.

1224
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
I'm just masturbating in the corner.

1225
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
You freak!

1226
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
Get in here! Yo, get in here!

1227
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:35,080
here

1228
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,680
You guys defeated the monkeys.

1229
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,480
I take his crown, I put it on.

1230
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,480
Okay, yeah, you put it on.

1231
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,880
Oh my god, you're the monkey king now.

1232
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,680
I take what I think is his crown, but it's his asshole.

1233
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,960
When you put that wreath on, you feel like you maybe have advantage against wisdom saving

1234
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
throws.

1235
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
Whoa.

1236
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
Holy crap.

1237
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,960
Add that to your inventory.

1238
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,960
That's right.

1239
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Oh my god, wait.

1240
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,320
This monkey's got a, he's got special stats on his stuff.

1241
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,880
I take his eyeballs out and put them in my mouth.

1242
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,720
You just have eyeballs in your mouth.

1243
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,720
I'm stronger!

1244
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,220
I cut his butt off and I tape it to my butt.

1245
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,720
The butt does seem magical, but

1246
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,720
right now it's just one...

1247
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,720
So the monkey crown has an advantage on wisdom?

1248
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,720
Is it acrylics?

1249
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
Wait, wait, what does he cast his spells with?

1250
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,720
His asshole.

1251
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,720
His staff was his spell casting focus.

1252
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Yeah, you can add the monkey staff to your inventory.

1253
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,720
It's just a spell casting focus.

1254
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,960
add um it adds plus one damage to any range spell attacks you use with the staff if you

1255
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
use it as a spellcaster.

1256
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,440
I'm gonna knock all his teeth out.

1257
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,880
But this is an advantage on wiz saves?

1258
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Yes.

1259
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
With their prowler but maybe I'll get a dollar from the two fairy.

1260
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,840
He can save himself from my wizzer.

1261
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,920
So yeah you guys uh after defeating the monkey.

1262
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,400
So just add the monkey staff and write plus one range and I'll remember what that is.

1263
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,520
I put the monkeys face in the water.

1264
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,880
You put the monkeys face?

1265
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,680
Yeah uh as you lower its head in the raging seas.

1266
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,920
Let's see just how fast this puppy's going.

1267
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,560
And you pull it up and you see the skeleton of the monkey.

1268
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,000
That's how you measure speed, is if you can touch a monkey to the ground and it turns

1269
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
into a skeleton.

1270
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,800
That means you're going really fast.

1271
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,080
That means it's going exactly 900 miles per hour.

1272
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:22,440
We are going at breakneck speeds right now.

1273
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,400
And just as you guys are starting to feel settled, playing with the corpses that you

1274
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,120
So oh before I

1275
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,160
Yeah, I take the monkey's leg

1276
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,280
Right, and then I I put it in like a bag

1277
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,800
Okay, and I try to sue V didn't knew you were gonna do sue V'd. He said a bag

1278
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,500
So what do you you're gonna? So yeah, we're trying to sue V. What's your sous vide set?

1279
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,360
I do you're gonna see me in the shooting fast water

1280
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,360
Where are you gonna sue V to you fuck in my head?

1281
00:54:54,360 --> 00:55:01,660
I think this works, but then all that happens is the plastic bag just like plastic. Where's the plastic plastic bag?

1282
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,660
I made a plastic

1283
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,200
made up plastic

1284
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,280
That's something I invented because I was bored

1285
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,740
And as you guys are fucking around with the monkeys body

1286
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,840
You hear a terrible roar

1287
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,280
Of something that has tracked you

1288
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,720
For so far for so long and with one of your party dead feels that much more

1289
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,800
Oh, I forgot about this fucking thing

1290
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,480
He came all the way here the yeth town roll initiative

1291
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,000
He came all the way here any flute and while the are the island was moving so fast you could get here

1292
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,900
How did he get on to the island yeth town can teleport?

1293
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,040
That's how we pour

1294
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:55,000
And I got one initiative this game sucks. Oh, I got a better initiative. We need to distract patches

1295
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,520
I got a 75 patches. What color are these?

1296
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:09,360
Dark green or gray this is green. These are black really yeah, I

1297
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,360
Got it

1298
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:19,400
Yeah, I'm mentally it's real. I don't remember what your initiative role was it was a 20

1299
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,680
Oh, okay, I guess you're going first. I got a new go 18. I guess you're going second

1300
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,720
I got a 19 Caleb actually got a one. Oh, thank you. You're cuz I want to go first

1301
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,820
You're like a little I go first. I want to go first. Just say you got 21

1302
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,720
Okay, I got a 75. I mean and Caleb got you got a stop. There's no way

1303
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,120
There's no way that can get to you. We should get one of those towers you do not get anything

1304
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,880
I was thinking about getting the dice tower if you guys want to get the dice tower

1305
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,080
What is that you like put it the dice in the tower it rolls down?

1306
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,120
We do

1307
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,840
We're like decisive rolls yeah

1308
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:06,080
I bought this guy on tick-tock who rolls a d20 every time that he makes a sandwich and he makes it sandwich based off

1309
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,320
My wife was telling me about that guy. Yeah, yeah, you made a really good sandwich

1310
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,440
Yeah, he's something about she was talking about somebody does that with drinks where they like roll different dice

1311
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:21,280
Drinks, which ended there's these two guys who bust myths on the Discovery Channel. Yeah

1312
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,440
I heard there's a guy who I heard this this t-shirt that says there's a ninja on this t-shirt, but the t-shirts blind

1313
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:33,240
You're up to good

1314
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,720
I just like to enjoy stuff sometimes, you know

1315
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,600
Okay, I run up to the F town. Am I gonna do am I in walk? Yes, you can

1316
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:49,640
Yes, you remind me. What does the F town look like? It's a this yet. Town is like a giant dog with a man face

1317
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,440
like an ugly furry man face

1318
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,200
If you well, you wouldn't remember him because you weren't there

1319
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,620
This is new to you. Yeah, this is new to me. Can you at least give me a

1320
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,300
Can you give us a celebrity touchstone that would be maybe what what what the face looks like the most you said ugly and hairy

1321
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:17,400
Like Nick Nolte. I knew you're gonna say either Nolte or Busey. Yeah, Busey. No Busey's like too comical

1322
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Like okay, he's a little more. He's hanged on

1323
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,100
Is the dog hanging dog can we see it

1324
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:32,380
Yeah, yeah ten inches but for him that's kind of small yeah

1325
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,380
That's weird.

1326
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,380
He's fucking huge, right?

1327
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,380
How tall is he?

1328
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,380
He's like, you know, 20 feet.

1329
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,380
10 inches.

1330
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,380
He's the second embarrassed enemy today.

1331
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,380
Is he neutered?

1332
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,380
Is the yeth hound neutered?

1333
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,380
What do you think?

1334
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,380
Yes.

1335
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,380
If it's got a 10-inch or not.

1336
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,380
Yes.

1337
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,380
Most certainly.

1338
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,380
Okay, well I'm trying to think about my dog knowledge as a dog owner.

1339
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,380
Maybe try the banana tree.

1340
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,380
Is there a bone tree?

1341
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:49,380
I don't know.

1342
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,380
I don't know.

1343
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,380
I don't know.

1344
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,380
I don't know.

1345
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,380
I don't know.

1346
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:54,380
I don't know.

1347
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,380
I don't know.

1348
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,380
I don't know.

1349
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,380
I don't know.

1350
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,380
I don't know.

1351
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,380
I don't know.

1352
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,380
I don't know.

1353
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,380
Is there a bone tree?

1354
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,380
No.

1355
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,380
Can I go pee real quick?

1356
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,380
Yeah.

1357
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,380
You can go ahead, it's my turn.

1358
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,380
He's taking his phone into the bathroom.

1359
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,380
But you have to take the bathroom pass.

1360
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,380
Take the bathroom pass. Take the hall pass.

1361
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,380
Thank you.

1362
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,380
Thank you.

1363
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,380
Alright.

1364
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,380
You have to return it.

1365
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,380
You have to return it.

1366
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:22,380
Okay.

1367
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,380
He took the girls pass!

1368
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,380
What did he say?

1369
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:52,380
a

1370
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:59,380
be crazy. And then I guess I will use my divine smite. Which I think I have 4 spell slots

1371
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:12,940
right? Yes. So I will use one of them to use this divine smite. So it should be adding 2

1372
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:35,740
the

1373
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:42,740
which is 11. Nice. And then I have another attack. Okay, cool. So it's 11 plus 6, that's

1374
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:48,900
17. No, it's just 11. I added everything. You added the 6? Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1375
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:55,900
I'll take the 17. No, don't you do that. Okay, so that's 7. Okay, yeah, that doesn't add.

1376
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:01,220
Yeah. But, okay, cool. So you slam your oar against the side of the Yath Hound and then

1377
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,060
Patrick didn't bring the bathroom pass back from the bathroom.

1378
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:14,800
This radiant light, sort of with water swirling around it, like from your water god, crashes

1379
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:21,540
into the side of the, once you make impact, and just like blasts it.

1380
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:26,880
It was a good hit, but he's still up and he's looking fine, ultimately.

1381
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:33,880
And it is now your turn, Chuggie, the singing submarine, aka Mr. Cutie Patootie.

1382
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,880
I'm Cutie right now, not Chuggie.

1383
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,880
I mean if you're Chuggie, you're just a giant submarine, you can't do anything.

1384
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,880
If he's 20 feet, oh right, because I'm on an island.

1385
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,880
I was going to say if he's 20 feet, Chuggie's 30 feet.

1386
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,880
Yeah, but Chuggie can't do nothing.

1387
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,880
I'm going to fucking sat on him.

1388
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,880
Well, I guess we did give you weird...

1389
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,880
I sat on him and buried him in my asshole.

1390
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,880
You could eat him. You could just open your mouth and swallow him whole.

1391
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,880
Exactly.

1392
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:02,880
your

1393
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,600
Why don't you attack with your blutter?

1394
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,440
Does the blutter cost anything to attack?

1395
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:18,720
He can do that blutter move three times a day.

1396
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,200
So you just roll an attack roll and add your decks.

1397
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:29,440
Oh, I forgot it's supposed to do dot.

1398
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,440
But that monkey would have died anyway.

1399
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:38,440
in

1400
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
Okay, so then with the bonus move...

1401
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,440
So you shoot the blutter and the bullet flies by

1402
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,440
and like a helix of blood sort of like trails behind it.

1403
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,440
We should just try to escape again.

1404
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
This guy's too fucking...

1405
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,440
He's too annoying.

1406
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,440
He's too much... we need a cat to defeat this thing.

1407
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,440
We can just dive underwater.

1408
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,440
Oh.

1409
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,440
We can't, Chuggy.

1410
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,440
You saw what happened to that monkey's face.

1411
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,440
Oh, fuck you.

1412
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
You make everything hard.

1413
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Then we'll fly up in the way.

1414
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:12,440
the

1415
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,660
last four minute uh... airplane

1416
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,960
no

1417
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,600
i think i got a very upset with my life you are getting i think i think we believe

1418
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,440
you know that it is that

1419
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,680
it is very funny

1420
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,040
okay well i guess we'll just

1421
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,920
or you can you can try to fight back

1422
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,920
It is the Yeth Hounds turn though and he is going to attack you, Dogen, so if you go for

1423
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,920
him.

1424
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
My abilities.

1425
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,920
Oh yeah, that's going to hit you.

1426
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,920
So he's going to do a couple of things.

1427
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,920
Okay.

1428
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:49,920
Yikes.

1429
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,920
Yikes.

1430
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,920
That does 15 damage.

1431
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:54,920
15?

1432
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:55,920
Yeah.

1433
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:56,920
Damn.

1434
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,000
And he has marked you.

1435
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
He marked me.

1436
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Which means he'll have a-

1437
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Bro, did he pee on me?

1438
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
-attacks against you.

1439
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
He's gonna attack you again.

1440
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I know what it means when a dog marks something.

1441
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,600
Yeah, but he misses even though he marked you.

1442
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,680
And you are now up, Steeble.

1443
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,880
You have a number of spells in your freaking arsenal.

1444
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,880
Yeah, I know.

1445
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
I'm looking at them, asshole.

1446
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,880
Okay.

1447
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
I'm gonna use Guiding Bolt.

1448
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
It's a great spell.

1449
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,440
Why is the water going so fast?

1450
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,440
We don't know.

1451
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,440
We don't know, but basically I know that we're on a fucking giant ass turtle.

1452
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,440
We're on some giant ass thing with all this...

1453
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,440
It's a fucking sea turtle.

1454
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,440
It's a yellow sea turtle.

1455
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,440
It's a turtle.

1456
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,440
It's a turtle.

1457
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,440
It's a turtle.

1458
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,440
If it's not a turtle, he changed it.

1459
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,440
Yeah, he did change it.

1460
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,440
He did not change it.

1461
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,880
Okay, so I'm going to use guiding bowl.

1462
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,440
Whatever it is, I didn't change it.

1463
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,920
I got a five.

1464
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:51,920
That's not going to...

1465
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,920
It's not very good, is it?

1466
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:53,920
No.

1467
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,920
It's not good at all.

1468
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,920
I'm going to take it easy.

1469
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,920
Right?

1470
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,920
Okay, so I pretty much just fucking sit there.

1471
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
Yo, yo, chill.

1472
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,040
We're going to go back to the top of the order and just wipe it out.

1473
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,320
I start burying my feet in the sand.

1474
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,320
Dogan, you are not.

1475
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,320
Okay, I'm just going to swing again.

1476
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,320
I'm just going to go through it.

1477
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,320
He's going for it.

1478
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,320
Yeah.

1479
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:17,320
It's the only thing I know how to do in this world is be strong for my friends.

1480
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,320
That's okay.

1481
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
That's a 19.

1482
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:20,320
Oh, a 19?

1483
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,320
Sorry.

1484
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,320
I thought I saw it.

1485
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,320
It's a 24.

1486
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,320
I'm sorry.

1487
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,320
I thought I saw it wrong.

1488
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,320
Bro, he said a 24 doesn't hit.

1489
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,320
It does hit.

1490
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,320
It does hit.

1491
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,320
You hit.

1492
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,320
Okay, I'm gonna do another Divine Smite.

1493
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Okay, that's 10 plus...

1494
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:47,320
10 plus 5 is 15, plus 6 is 21, plus 2 is 23 damage.

1495
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:55,320
And that's my first attack.

1496
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,320
you just like fucking slam your oar against his side of him

1497
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,320
you can feel the presence of your water god

1498
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,320
no side conversations guys

1499
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,320
presence of your water god burrowing down further into its flesh

1500
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,320
just ripping it asunder

1501
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,320
pretty good man

1502
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:17,320
sorry i was just saying my mom used to think lubega was a ja rule

1503
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,320
she used to think that was a ja rule song

1504
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,320
a little bit

1505
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,320
(laughter)

1506
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,960
Pretty kinda funny.

1507
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:28,960
You don't do apologize for that.

1508
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,960
I had to break the news to her one day.

1509
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,960
That's not Ja Rule, Ma.

1510
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,960
(laughter)

1511
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
That was a great attack, Cam.

1512
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,960
Yeah, you have another attack.

1513
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,320
Oh, that's a crit.

1514
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320
No shit, really?

1515
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Yeah.

1516
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
Bruh.

1517
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,320
Alright, roll, roll, uh, fuck.

1518
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,320
I'll smite it too.

1519
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,320
Yeah, roll the fuck.

1520
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,320
Do I get to double the smite?

1521
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:58,320
stupid shams. He said roll fuck. What the fuck does that mean? You fucking idiot. That means

1522
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:06,100
roll a d6 because 6 rhymes with sex. No I don't think, I'm pretty sure with smite crit it

1523
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:12,600
should just be you just add whatever the um. Put that smite crit on his white clit. Yeah

1524
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:19,600
it

1525
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:41,520
the

1526
01:07:41,520 --> 01:08:02,520
on

1527
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:10,640
the Smite, that's 3d8. So that's 6d8 for the Smite. I'll start rolling the 3 and then you

1528
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,040
tell me to start or stop.

1529
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,640
I might as well. I'm almost positive it's what it is. I really have a rarity with which I

1530
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,640
deal with critical hit Smites.

1531
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,520
So that's 15 plus 1 is 16 plus 6 is 22.

1532
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,040
Wow, that's crazy.

1533
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,200
Plus 1 is 23. Do I get to double the Smite? I do. Oh my god.

1534
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,200
Bro.

1535
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,160
Plus 6 is -- what was the last number I said? 23?

1536
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
23, yeah.

1537
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:39,160
Uh, 31, 35 plus 2, 37 damage.

1538
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:45,680
Bro, that "yes" sound is gone.

1539
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,000
And I already, and that was, so this turn that was 50, that was 60 damage.

1540
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Describe your kill.

1541
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Holy shit.

1542
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah!

1543
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I don't do, I just.

1544
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I didn't even have to hit it.

1545
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,160
Yeah, you just regularly just kind of hit the guy.

1546
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:07,960
I'm not even paying attention. I turned they went today. I heard I heard um Steve will say something about about medieval

1547
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,240
What a general

1548
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,440
Jaw ruler, and I turned to hear what he was saying and I turned in my

1549
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,240
My my war or just hit him. What if he just?

1550
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:23,160
Disappears he goes to a place where like no one's around so he'd die without anyone seeing yeah

1551
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,560
Yeah, and I follow him wherever he goes

1552
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:33,560
As he, uh, just this thing just like, fucking like it almost explodes in death, um, which

1553
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:44,320
is fucking nutty as hell, um, it's vile groans stink of pain and an implacable salivating

1554
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,320
envy.

1555
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:52,360
Um, it's master blessed it with the good sense to know wounded prey, but, you know, it's kind

1556
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,480
of, it's kind of, it's like.

1557
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:03,440
As it tries to stand over you, its shadow giving context to maybe a certain...

1558
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,440
This wasn't the idea that you guys didn't kill it, but you did.

1559
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,440
This is crazy.

1560
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,960
But either way, this is going to happen.

1561
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:13,520
A faint hissing sound rings in your ears.

1562
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,520
All of your ears.

1563
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:18,160
But the instant you can meet the sound with comprehension, its origin wraps around the

1564
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,920
neck of the yeth hound, but is slowly dying.

1565
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:27,920
It is a tentacle, not unlike the one you saw those weeks ago when your adventure began.

1566
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:28,920
Not you, Jack, but everyone else.

1567
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,920
What the hell is that thing?

1568
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,920
The hissing gives way to a rumble as a familiar white mist echoes the return of whatever this

1569
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:41,920
creature is.

1570
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,920
The F-hound, within that same moment of your appreciation, is yanked violently through the

1571
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,920
trees and the island.

1572
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,220
with the cracking

1573
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,220
here's bodies

1574
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:57,220
whapping up against

1575
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,160
is the apple

1576
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:07,160
that like something

1577
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:11,900
uh... is a bit of pop

1578
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,160
made of pulp

1579
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,160
Let him read it.

1580
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,160
No.

1581
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:19,320
It's a pulpy puppy.

1582
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:24,040
The mist rolls in further with a clear will.

1583
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,440
This thing, whatever it is, this thing that had to reach out to you that last time, it

1584
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,440
does live.

1585
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,440
You have no time to act.

1586
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,240
The thrust of the fog washes over you and lifts you along.

1587
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,080
It fills your body and is tasteless and oppressive.

1588
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,440
You live in like a new, it's like you're floating basically.

1589
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,840
You feel very weightless, but you're completely paralyzed in this fog.

1590
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
We're lost in a cloud.

1591
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,840
[laughter]

1592
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,840
As you're lost in a cloud.

1593
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,840
[laughter]

1594
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,840
The Yharb Sail.

1595
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:03,840
And you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond.

1596
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,840
The size of this thing can only be really seen now.

1597
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,600
With no boat to steer or crew to captain, a yeth hound long devoured, now before you,

1598
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,940
with the supernatural certainty that comes with seeing a thing, possessing a truly ancient

1599
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:23,080
bearing, you know that this is a kaiju manji.

1600
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,380
Long thought passed from this world, and while you can't make out its full form, you become

1601
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,160
aware of it regarding you.

1602
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,160
In floating amniotically through its haze, you're helpless.

1603
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,680
But then, once it's done regarding you, it slowly removes itself.

1604
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:43,000
The mist recedes over the island, and that low rumble follows in that hiss, and the tentacle

1605
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
whips back.

1606
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:52,400
And the island with the yellow sand holes suddenly comes to a stop, and you all kind of jerk

1607
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,400
forward.

1608
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,400
You all kind of jerk forward.

1609
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,840
You raise your heads and you look.

1610
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:02,840
You've made it to the outskirts of Post Port Loseberry, in a hidden cave along the shore.

1611
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,800
So the island just took you there.

1612
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,680
Then you hear one last cry as you deposit yourselves

1613
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:13,080
Yeah, I'm ready I'm ready

1614
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,560
As this yellow island rears its pretty eyelashes

1615
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:28,040
By the holes

1616
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:35,220
Can I and it goes back into the sea can I cast up of me

1617
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,220
What?

1618
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,220
What's up with me?

1619
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,220
Nothing much homie, what's up with you?

1620
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:41,220
Oh my god.

1621
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,220
And you guys have made it finally to Berry Berry.

1622
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,220
Wow.

1623
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,220
Bye.

1624
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:47,220
Spongebob.

1625
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,220
Spongebob

1626
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,800
(upbeat music)

1627
01:13:51,800 --> 01:14:01,800
[MUSIC]

1628
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:29,800
