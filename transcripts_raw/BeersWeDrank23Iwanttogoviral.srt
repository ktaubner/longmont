00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm trying to get that burp out.

Wait.

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,420
Hold on.

00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,240
Are we starting?

Yeah.

Are we starting?

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,900
Yeah.

23
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,400
Oh.

24
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,800
That was a sick one.

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,520
OK.

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,020

He says, are we starting?

29
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,760
Then he pulled out scissors.

30
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,760
- What are you doing? - You're gonna cut your hand off.

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,760
What the fuck is this? Oh, he's using a bottle opener?

32
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,060
I guess Rex has been in New York for such little time

33
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,060
that he can't even have a bottle opener in his entire apartment.

34
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
I thought we had one and we don't.

35
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,060
Okay, I was gonna break the bottle there.

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,060
- I'm gonna fuck up my own. - I kinda fucked up my own.

37
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,060
You almost got it, man.

38
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,060
You're really, really close to getting it.

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,060
- I don't think I will. - Don't use your fingers, bro.

40
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Before I finish this, I'll introduce my beer.

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
Go ahead.

42
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,780
Today I got a Brewdog, Brewed in Elon.

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,780
It's an Elvis juice.

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,780
Whoa.

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm paying respect to my favorite musician.

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,780
I don't know if you like him that much.

47
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
That looks pretty good.

48
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,360
That has to give me a taste.

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,580
It has the complete American flag on it.

50
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,700
It's not the complete thing.

51
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,180
I don't see all 50 stars.

52
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,180
Oh, it tastes like fucking shit.

53
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
It tastes like shit?

54
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,520
- Tastes like shit.

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,500
- This is a complete under five foot basketball player.

56
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,340
- Under five?

57
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,580
There's never been a basketball player under five feet tall.

58
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,540
This is a terrible, terrible review.

59
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,380
- Yeah.

60
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,580
- You clearly never played basketball in Mexico.

61
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,920
- Oh, true.

62
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
- Yeah, it's just like a--

63
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,080
- They're Michael Jordan.

64
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,500
- Like a WNBA star.

65
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,180
- Dude, oh my God, you got it off.

66
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,020
Okay.

67
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,840
(laughing)

68
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,820
- Grapefruit, if you use IDH, don't ever buy this.

69
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,660
If you're using--

70
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,880
- Well timed.

71
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,380
You're brown bagging it?

72
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,420
- Why are you brown bagging it?

73
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,820
- Because I get to do an epic reveal.

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,700
- Did you do a, you did a 40?

75
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,140
- No, I just did a 22.

76
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,180
I have a giant Heineken.

77
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,620
- Nice, dude.

78
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,020
Wow, you really are New York City vibes.

79
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,220
- I went to three different delis.

80
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,080
And yeah, this was, first of all,

81
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
I went to three delis and two of them

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,860
didn't have beer at all.

83
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,060
- What?

84
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,180
- I know.

85
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,140
One of them had a child working the register.

86
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,420
- A lot of them, oh yeah. - Just a straight up boy.

87
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,620
- Yeah, a lot of them. - Well, that makes sense

88
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,260
why that one wouldn't have beer, I guess.

89
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,540
- Were they full halal places?

90
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,980
- No, shitty delis.

91
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,060
And that one I went to-- - There's one in New Orleans

92
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,820
all halal, no beer at all.

93
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,660
- No.

94
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,540
So I went to another one and they had six packs of stuff.

95
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,540
They had a sour monkey, which I almost got.

96
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,740
They had the Sapporo Reserve, which you got the other time

97
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,460
and I made fun of you for it.

98
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,940
So I thought, what beer do they have

99
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,820
that we've never done before?

100
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,900
And there are two options.

101
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,540
Hard Arizona Iced Tea or Heineken.

102
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,380
You made the right choice.

103
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,340
I went for the Heineken.

104
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,180
Yeah.

105
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,420
All right, tell us how the Heineken tastes.

106
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,380
Give me a Heine review right now.

107
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
Out of the ground bag.

108
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,040
You fuck Heineken?

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
I like Heineken.

110
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,940
So, six five, dude.

111
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,220
Six foot five player.

112
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,060
Six foot five player.

113
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,880
Really?

114
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,320
- Yeah, all right, now get now out of 10.

115
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,680
- Like a solid 6.5.

116
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,840
- Whoa, 6.5 on both, that means a 10 for you

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
is a 10 foot tall player.

118
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
- No.

119
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
- That's what you mean.

120
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,840
- That's what I meant.

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
- 10 foot tall basketball player.

122
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,600
- A 10 is like a seven foot six player,

123
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,800
just like a Yao Ming with extensions.

124
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,560
- So you think that six five is the exact intersect,

125
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,760
where they both do the exact same point?

126
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,100
- Yeah, just an above average.

127
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,860
- I can see that, that makes sense.

128
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:22,020
I have the Flying Dog Deep Fake Non-Alcoholic IPA, y'all.

129
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:29,780
Deep Fake Non-Alcoholic IPA, y'all.

130
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,180
And here comes my review, y'all.

131
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,620
- Here comes my taste, y'all.

132
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,540
- Y'all, my taste is, this is a light

133
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,940
and refreshing little number.

134
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm gonna give this on the non-alcoholic review scale.

135
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,540
Guys, we're breaking eight.

136
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,860
We're gonna go with an 8.1,

137
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,340
aka a six foot 11 basketball player.

138
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,460
This is a great beer.

139
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,360
I recommend all of you sober gophers try one of these,

140
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,180
grab one of these off the shelf.

141
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,340
You won't be disappointed.

142
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,140
It has notes of citrus, less than 0.5% alcohol by volume.

143
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,740
Wouldn't say it really tastes anything like an IPA,

144
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,500
but it looks like a beer, it feels like a beer.

145
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,620
- Can I ask you a question about this,

146
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,100
about your brand new non-alcoholic meter?

147
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,420
- Yeah.

148
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,240
- Do any non-alcoholic beverages enter this category?

149
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,660
- Well, it's really funny that you should say that.

150
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,740
- Like, can you put water and soda in there?

151
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,100
- It's really, it's honestly so fucking funny

152
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,020
that you would say that.

153
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,940
- And milk?

154
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,140
- Because.

155
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,300
- Can you drink some milk?

156
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
because I do have another beverage here.

157
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,620
And it is non-alcoholic.

158
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,500
And I would like for you guys to guess what it is.

159
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
- Is it milk?

160
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,060
- It's not that crazy, but it's crazy

161
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,340
that you brought up other, I was gonna drink this after,

162
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,380
but I'm gonna review these back to back, okay?

163
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,220
- Okay.

164
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,820
- You each have one guess what this is.

165
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,140
- I guess milk.

166
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,620
- Milk. - Milk.

167
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,580
- Banana milk.

168
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,220
- Ugh, if I can get it open.

169
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,580
- You need some scissors.

170
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,880
- Oh my God, this is so hard, what the fuck?

171
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,680
You need to handle some scissors. Oh, what is what are Logan Paul and ksi doing with these lids? Oh

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,120
It's a complete it's an American prime it won't fucking open though. Holy shit. Oh

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,320
All right. All right. I got it open y'all

174
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,920
I got open the ice pop prime 20 calories 10% coconut water

175
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Let's give this thing a taste.

176
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Caleb had such a difficulty opening this that it completely crashed the entirety of the SinkGaster site.

177
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,040
I did. I dropped my phone or my microphone, which is my phone in a way.

178
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I dropped it onto my computer.

179
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
My apostrophe phone.

180
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah. And this, guys, this is, hmm.

181
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
That's good, man.

182
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
A lot of people say it's too sweet.

183
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I like it.

184
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Do you think all the primes are going to get sued and banned soon?

185
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:16,800
Yes, I have. And seeing that the FDA is doing an investigation into Prime has made me drop my intake of Prime down to maybe one every two weeks, where at one point I was drinking them at least every other day for quite some time.

186
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,520
I thought that you'd be a well, actually, I guess that'd be more like a Rex move, where if you heard rumblings of them, like banning something,

187
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,600
You would buy a bunch of them.

188
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,160
You would buy like a hundred boxes of them and just drink them over the next 10 years.

189
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,160
I really want to avoid getting any kind of cancer,

190
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,960
especially bone cancer.

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
That really scares me because it makes your bones spiky.

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,320
And brain cancer as well, because then I can never,

193
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,120
I feel like people will always think I'm a little stupider

194
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,340
after I successfully recover from brain cancer.

195
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,000
We did, I had an employee that was in an accident,

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,800
and he was in a motorcycle accident.

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
He had a brain injury and he was an actual,

198
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
he moved down from like a normal productive guy

199
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
to a literal like,

200
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,720
retarded guy.

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,400
(laughing)

202
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,720
- Is this a recent,

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,840
you've only had employees for like two years,

204
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,280
this can only be like 10 guys, man.

205
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
- Yeah, he is like one guy,

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
he worked for like three months.

207
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
He kind of looked like Bobby Moynihan.

208
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
He was like in his 40s.

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,920
- Okay.

210
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,760
The first time I ever talked to him,

211
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
we were like going over some stuff,

212
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,360
and just in the middle of like talking,

213
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,440
just pulls out a joint and starts smoking it,

214
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
like on camera.

215
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
- Whoa.

216
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,840
- And I was like, I'm fine with that,

217
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,720
but also, shouldn't you like say something?

218
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,620
- I would say that that is probably more damaging

219
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,160
to his brain than any 80 mile an hour

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,120
head on collision could possibly be.

221
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,400
- Also, wait, what do you want me to say?

222
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
You want to be like, sir, permission to talk, sir.

223
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,520
- Permission to do drugs right in front of you

224
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
right now.

225
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
Permission to join.

226
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,920
You want to do it?

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,500
Why?

228
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,160
Like, hey, is it cool if I smoke?

229
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,520
Would you care if you're

230
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,920
just that you're going to be

231
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,620
addicted? You're not smelling it.

232
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,640
Who gives a fuck?

233
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,580
Yeah, but I want to hit I want to

234
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,240
smoke and I have to be the good

235
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
smart guy.

236
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,340
You work in the most bullshit

237
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,840
field that exists.

238
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,320
You work in the most bullshit.

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,640
No, I don't.

240
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,320
Broadcasting has been around for

241
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,040
100 years before we started

242
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Chuck E. Cheese Monopoly money.

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,320
Fake job accusations and they end up splashing me.

244
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Let's go over the meat of today's episode.

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Guys, Rex has completely moved to New York.

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
He has.

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm sitting in my crevice.

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Is that crevice behind me?

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Is this your office?

250
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Well no, this is my bedroom. This is my door.

251
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
And this is where my closet is.

252
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
This is the full length of my closet.

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
I still haven't been over.

254
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Let's see the entire room.

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,320
It'll be really quick.

256
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,320
So here's the closet.

257
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,520
Okay, with the green there, a green cape, you're a superhero.

258
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Got my AC there.

259
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,120
Got my air mattress there with my single unclothed pillow.

260
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,320
Blackout curtains.

261
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,520
Yeah, I'm going to be in the closet.

262
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

263
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

264
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

265
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

266
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

267
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

268
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm going to be in the closet.

269
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
Blackout curtains.

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Blackout curtains.

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
And then we're going to the last wall.

272
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
Mm-hmm.

273
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
And that's it.

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,880
You're missing a wall, buddy.

275
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,280
There it is.

276
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,080
That's nice.

277
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,800
There's the door and the wall.

278
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,480
The whole room.

279
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,520
So that's everything.

280
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,640
That's the whole room.

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,360
That's a tiny room.

282
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,120
It is very small.

283
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,840
That's OK.

284
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,760
You're not a big guy.

285
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,560
You don't need a bunch of space.

286
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,640
You also don't make a whole mess.

287
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,040
You also don't live--

288
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,080
Yeah, the smaller your room is, the less messy it'll be,

289
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,720
'cause there's not enough room to put a bunch of bullshit.

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,640
But also, how excited are you to not be living

291
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,720
in a in-between space that is not really a bedroom,

292
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
that people just walk through all day?

293
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
That is very nice.

294
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,360
It's nice having a door.

295
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,560
And I can see it has a lock on it.

296
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,080
Yes, and I have a second bedroom that is mine,

297
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,840
which is where I'll put my desk and office stuff.

298
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,680
Whoa.

299
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,720
So I won't be in here the whole time.

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,520
This is just a sleeping room.

301
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,680
Right.

302
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,720
But because I don't have a desk, I am just, I just have a chair and a bed and a laptop.

303
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,640
And this is the bigger of the two rooms?

304
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,600
No, but this is the one with more natural light that I put blackout curtains in front of.

305
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,560
Speaking of natural light, can you tell the story that you told me the first day you got

306
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
to New York when you took your nap?

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,240
Yeah, I just was like waking up and staring at, making direct eye contact with

308
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,380
pedestrians because my room is like on the street.

309
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,140
And then, uh, when I was putting the curtains up, I got one of those like

310
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,900
tension rods that you like twist.

311
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,380
Yeah.

312
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,600
And I was kind of standing on like the sill of the window and like holding it up.

313
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,140
Like, you know, like this, my arms were behind me.

314
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,820
So my dick was like the furthest out point.

315
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,560
And as I was doing that, I hear like the sound of like talking and I look down

316
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,640
and there's a dad and his daughter directly in front of my crotch.

317
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,380
- Just with your dick and balls right between their faces.

318
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,860
- Yeah, basically, yes.

319
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,700
Just like against the window.

320
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,660
- Were they taking pictures with it,

321
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,740
like it was some kind of landmark?

322
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,580
- They were tourists.

323
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,420
- They were like up against the,

324
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,460
they were like, "Oh!"

325
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,460
Taking it with a selfie stick?

326
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,180
- I think I was,

327
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,820
dad like made eye contact with me,

328
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,720
and was like.

329
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,940
- He shook his head too?

330
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,340
- He was approving, "It's your room!"

331
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,180
- Yeah, bro.

332
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,100
- It's not your fault that you're completely naked

333
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,000
with your dick out and your balls out?

334
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,500
I wasn't naked, I was fully clothed, but it was just, you know.

335
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,100
- You're gonna have to get used to this, man.

336
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,980
New York City, you see naked people

337
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,560
through windows all the time, man.

338
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,400
- Yeah.

339
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,700
- The only thing is, you need to make sure

340
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,780
if you see a naked person, or if you're naked,

341
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,140
and you see somebody sees you naked,

342
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,300
it's fine as long as you never, ever see them on the street.

343
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,620
- Yeah, he lived in my building.

344
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,380
- The dad does?

345
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,300
- Yes.

346
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,580
- Oh, that was your first impression

347
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,220
with your new neighbor?

348
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,380
- Yeah.

349
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,300
- Is that you showed your dick to his daughter?

350
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,140
- Again, everything was covered.

351
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,060
- I don't think, wait.

352
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,300
- Covered in jizz and piss.

353
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,820
- I completely don't think this matters at all.

354
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,060
I don't think building neighbors are real neighbors.

355
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,900
- I agree.

356
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,480
There's a fat guy that lives across the street

357
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,860
that I, I think I've said this before.

358
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,060
I have, he doesn't have a blind on one of his windows

359
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,700
and it's the window that is directly in front of the fridge.

360
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,460
So I always just see him butt ass naked,

361
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,400
walk up to the fridge and eat food in the middle of the night.

362
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,640
Yeah, like drink out of a gallon of milk.

363
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,740
But I've never seen him.

364
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,480
I've never once seen him anywhere outside of his house.

365
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,240
And I walk around all day.

366
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,980
Do you think he's these pawns where you leave your apartment?

367
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,640
I think he kind of does.

368
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,380
I mean, it might be a it might be a screen.

369
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,580
It might not even be a window.

370
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,180
Somebody might have a TV up against one of these windows.

371
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,920
That'd be kind of funny.

372
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Yeah.

373
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
That's someone's face.

374
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
By helping you.

375
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
Yeah. I mean, that'd be that's about

376
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,960
the funniest thing you can put in a

377
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,040
fake window, probably.

378
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
I mean, it would only work for one.

379
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,220
My favorite memory of looking through

380
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,220
someone's window.

381
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,200
Well, I got two, I guess.

382
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,340
The second one is when I was walking

383
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,040
through Amsterdam, you can just like

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,200
look into people's houses and like

385
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,580
just look at their living rooms and

386
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,600
how they're living in their lives,

387
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
which I didn't really I don't really

388
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,860
know how Europeans live at that point.

389
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,680
So that was I learned a lot

390
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,260
from just looking into people's houses.

391
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,920
And my first, my top number one window peeping into memory

392
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,980
is when we're on that train stop

393
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,720
with that looks over into someone's bedroom

394
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,600
and he's always playing Overwatch.

395
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,080
- Yeah, that guy's always playing Overwatch.

396
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,920
- That guy is--

397
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,320
- What, damn, what stop is that?

398
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,160
- Is it Myrtle?

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,000
I forget what it is.

400
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
- No, no, it's the,

401
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Maybe it is the Myrtle Avenue M.

402
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah, it's a complete M stop.

403
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,800
There's a guy who's always playing Overwatch at his computer.

404
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,940
And he's always playing it every single night.

405
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,600
And we want to be friends with him, but I don't think there's any possible way

406
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,840
where we can link up with him, although I wish we could so far.

407
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,600
Have you watched the John Wilson episode where the guy

408
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,840
He's talking about like having the train in his backyard.

409
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,160
He just like opens the door and he's got the train there.

410
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,820
I don't think so.

411
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,000
I was wondering if that was the same guy.

412
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,320
I think it's the second episode of the new season.

413
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,120
No.

414
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,640
You think it's, you think it's like the Overwatch guy?

415
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
Yeah.

416
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,140
Cause he's like a young guy and it's like the correct angle to

417
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,200
be like looking up into the train.

418
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,760
Does he have a sick computer?

419
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,160
It doesn't really show it.

420
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,480
It shows like him talking in his room and then it pans to like

421
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,800
looking out the window and it zooms in on a guy standing at the train station.

422
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,840
It honestly could be.

423
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,480
It could be because John Wilson lives in this neighborhood.

424
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,280
A lot of that show is this neighborhood.

425
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,760
So maybe he was sitting there one day and he said, I'm

426
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
going to go talk to that guy.

427
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,320
That's what I was thinking.

428
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,560
Could be man.

429
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,320
He beat us to it.

430
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,840
We could have made a TV show out of that.

431
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah.

432
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,640
I mean, safe to say if I was.

433
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
I would not be talking to John Wilson.

434
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,440
If I was making that TV show, it would be, there'd be a lot,

435
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,640
but I mean, I'd probably get distracted by stuff pretty easily.

436
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,380
I probably wouldn't find anything interesting. It would probably just be,

437
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,280
it would be just like,

438
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,020
my mistake is that I'd start filming one time when I was like really hungry and I

439
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,960
would just film like into restaurant windows, people eating, people making food.

440
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,840
I want to do like puppy eyes. Yeah. Or I would do, I would just get,

441
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,120
I'm pretty obsessed with the idea of like a, like a Christmas, Christmas Eve.

442
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
and you look into everybody's windows

443
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,020
and everybody has, it's all kids opening presents

444
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,120
and then hugging their parents

445
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,960
and you get really like upset about it,

446
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,840
you know that thing?

447
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,960
- Yeah. - People doing movies?

448
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,480
- Yeah, like you're alone and you're cold

449
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,320
and you're walking around like this.

450
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,480
- You're the ghost of Christmas past?

451
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,340
- You could do a John Wilson thing

452
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,120
from the ghost of Christmas past perspective

453
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,360
pretty easily I think.

454
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,480
You have icicles forming on the end of your nose

455
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,600
'cause it's so cold.

456
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,600
They have a warm hearth in their house.

457
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,240
- Yeah.

458
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,880
- I think if you were ever to appear in John Wilson,

459
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,760
I think you would be just walking down the street

460
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,480
with your shorts that show your balls.

461
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,920
(laughing)

462
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,300
- Which shorts?

463
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,080
Because I, okay, so I have two pairs of pants right now.

464
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Well, I think I got rid of the shorts that show my balls.

465
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
I have two pairs of pants right now

466
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,400
that have big rips in the crotch

467
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
and they've only gotten bigger.

468
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,540
And then I have another pair of pants where the fly is broken

469
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,560
and it's just permanently down.

470
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,360
And I just keep trying to zip it up and it just comes down.

471
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,640
And the other day, I like,

472
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,320
somebody was borrowing something from the office

473
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
and he brought his girlfriend to the office.

474
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
And I was like, "Hey, nice to meet you,"

475
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,200
you know, introduce myself.

476
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,440
And she was like, "Just so you know, your fly is down."

477
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,520
And instead of saying like, "Oh, thank you."

478
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,000
I just like a psycho, I said, "I know."

479
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,840
(laughing)

480
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,680
I know.

481
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,120
Oh, I don't know.

482
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,520
And then you already know.

483
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,480
And then she left.

484
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,420
And I was like, yeah, it's weird.

485
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,560
Yeah, I know.

486
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Yeah, I walk around my fly down all the time.

487
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,460
Just kind of thing I do.

488
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,220
It's my style.

489
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,960
I think I'm bringing you back.

490
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Yeah.

491
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,620
No, you they're bringing it's called dance fashion.

492
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,920
They're going to take you down.

493
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah.

494
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Fly down shoes on the wrong feet.

495
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,080
Opposite feet, shoes.

496
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Yep, just a big potato sack.

497
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,580
Have you ever thought of just changing your entire wardrobe

498
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,080
into just wearing a bunch of wooden barrels?

499
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Yeah, it would fit, I think, with my whole apartment's kind of aesthetic.

500
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,580
Yeah.

501
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,080
Actually, I think completely, yeah.

502
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Yeah.

503
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,080
It's so aesthetic when you're wearing your wooden barrel.

504
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Barrels are expensive. They're like $300.

505
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,580
They are expensive because they're hard to make, man.

506
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,580
They're hard to make and they're durable.

507
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
You try to bend wood like that.

508
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,080
It's tough.

509
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,580
I can.

510
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Oh, it's very, very tough.

511
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,580
I wouldn't be able to.

512
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,580
So, day three of New York City.

513
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Day two.

514
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
Day two of New York City.

515
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
How are you feeling?

516
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,580
What are you thinking so far?

517
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,580
What are the things you find are different living here?

518
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
What's going on, man?

519
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,580
So, today I had a chill day.

520
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
I worked.

521
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,300
I ate some Indian food, tried an Indian place down the street.

522
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,060
It's really good.

523
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,780
Okay.

524
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,540
I passed out for two hours after eating the Indian food, because it was so heavy.

525
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,780
I woke up, I did some more work and now I'm podcasting.

526
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,900
So I've had a really short day, all things considered.

527
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,020
This is a classic New York City, New Yorker day.

528
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,340
You're working, you're eating takeout and you're falling asleep and then you're

529
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,820
podcasting at the end of the day.

530
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,620
Yeah.

531
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,820
I mean, this is just about...

532
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
Yeah, just about as New York as it gets.

533
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:28,180
Do you think that your sleeping schedule is better suited for the East Coast?

534
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Yes, because when I wake up at 1 in the afternoon, it's like if I woke up at 10 back in California.

535
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,180
So no one gets mad at me when I sleep in.

536
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,180
They're like, "Wow, you're up so early today."

537
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah, I do.

538
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Well, also...

539
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,180
Whenever I'm in New York, I feel like I'm ahead of everyone in the world.

540
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,180
It's a weird feeling.

541
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
It is.

542
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:57,240
Also, the fact that, again, your house or your bedroom is not a place where people have to

543
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,340
walk through all day means that less people will be mad at you for sleeping in.

544
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,340
Yes.

545
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,700
And just like no one is waking me up.

546
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,700
So it is nice.

547
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:16,740
Yesterday, we went to get those chicken katsus, and I looked up the best way to get home,

548
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
and it was like taking a bus.

549
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,740
So I walked to the bus station and I missed it by like one minute and the next bus didn't

550
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
come for like 20 minutes.

551
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,540
So I just walked the rest of the way home.

552
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,940
Had a nice walk, walked into a babe store just like on the way.

553
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,660
Just kind of like having a nice time seeing all the people.

554
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,100
Only like three guys stopped me and asked me for money.

555
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,020
And I said to each of them like, "Hey man, I'm not bullshitting.

556
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,740
I really did forget my wallet."

557
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,740
I'm like, "No, we take Apple Pay."

558
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,740
And I'm like, "I'm still uploading in class."

559
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
You know, like...

560
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,740
But this is a nice time.

561
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,740
It's like a nice hour, like 30-minute walk.

562
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Nice.

563
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
I'm happy for you.

564
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
I'm really happy for you, actually.

565
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Yeah, I've walked more in the last like three days

566
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,740
than I did probably in the last like two weeks when I was living here.

567
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
Yeah, you walk a lot, man.

568
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,740
You get a...

569
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,740
And it feels fine.

570
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:21,660
The first two weeks i first moved here i had my legs hurt so fucking bad all the time those just walking so much but you get used to it.

571
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah the shin splints in the.

572
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:36,280
The good the girl and nothing beats sitting in traffic for a for a whole hour just to go for like twenty kilometers or about about ten miles i guess.

573
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,020
Is that what you do?

574
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,460
It's awesome.

575
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,620
I know.

576
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,120
Well, guess who would never guess who would not know that feeling right now?

577
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,320
Boo.

578
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,420
This guy, my fucking ass, because my car,

579
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,720
since I last talked about this, my car had been booted, right?

580
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,320
My car got booted.

581
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,020
It has now been impounded by the city.

582
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,360
And I've had my they have taken the tags,

583
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,620
the license plate off of my car and destroyed it.

584
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,620
What? Because my registration was out

585
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,220
and I owed so much money that they destroyed my license plate.

586
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,060
Oh, I thought they destroyed the car.

587
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,480
No, they did not. They did not.

588
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,280
I wish I wish I fucking wish that they took my car

589
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,360
and turned it into those cubes.

590
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,620
I want that cube so bad.

591
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,060
It's worth so much more to me than this fucking Ford Focus.

592
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,860
They want me to pay $2,400 to get my car back.

593
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,480
Is the car even worth that much?

594
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,780
Yeah, dude, it has like it has like 98000 miles on it.

595
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,360
It's a 2009 Ford Focus.

596
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,620
I looked up like $3000.

597
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,360
I mean, it's probably worth $5000.

598
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,580
And I looked up I was but I had the same thought.

599
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,380
I was like, I wonder what I can get for like a similar price.

600
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,180
The only car that I could find that was like available for like cash

601
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:06,380
purchase was like a 2004 Toyota with 220,000 miles on it.

602
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,620
That's probably a nicer than your Ford.

603
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,520
Toyota's are still good.

604
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,820
Toyota's are go forever, probably.

605
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,680
Toyota's 100 should completely go forever.

606
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,820
I don't know. Ford Focus dies at 110.

607
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,080
All right.

608
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,120
Well, the problem is, guys, I already fucking paid the money, OK?

609
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,140
I have no money at all.

610
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,540
Me and my wife are broke.

611
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,340
We ate hot dogs for dinner because we're trying to not spend money on food.

612
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm so sorry, man.

613
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,320
This is the lowest point of my entire life.

614
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,960
My car is in God knows where in Flushing.

615
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,440
It's probably rats jumping all over it, homeless people touching it.

616
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,480
It's peeing inside of it, peeing into the engine.

617
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm going to pee all in every single part of my car.

618
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,920
There's going to be a rat's nest in it.

619
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,000
It's going to look like they took it out of the water.

620
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,920
Except the water was yellow.

621
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,640
And to top it all off,

622
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,280
When I finally pay this shit and I only paid like 75% of it,

623
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,320
I've got to pay the other 25 at some point.

624
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,940
But after I've everything paid tomorrow, I get the car towed.

625
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,380
I can't even get it towed to there.

626
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,880
They won't even let me just pick it up because it doesn't have a license plate on.

627
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,980
I have to get it towed to my friend's driveway

628
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,120
and then tell him that it's my house and then they'll let me take it somewhere

629
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,480
or they'll at least just leave it.

630
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,860
Once I get all this shit done, the fucking car still has a spare tire on it because I've had to replace the tire for a week.

631
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,820
So then I'm going to finish all this shit with the car and then still have to fix the fucking car.

632
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,360
Yeah, it is just I I'm at a loss for words.

633
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,540
I I need this prime so, so badly tonight.

634
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,500
Hmm. That's good.

635
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I'm taking a load off.

636
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
You know what we need?

637
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,600
We need several angel investors just to fund our lives.

638
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,500
I agree. I agree.

639
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,900
I will do anything I will do.

640
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,600
Again, anything I mean, I will do anything.

641
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,100
I just want money.

642
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,800
I don't have any money.

643
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
My life is over.

644
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
Everything's falling apart.

645
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,460
I just had to

646
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,960
I had to talk to a garbage man today for an hour and a half.

647
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,000
Oh, it's just been a bad week, y'all.

648
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm sorry to say. Yeah.

649
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,880
Well, that sounds really bad.

650
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
It's like a real bummer.

651
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,560
But I'm sorry to say, actually, that I've had actually a worse week

652
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,600
because two of my best friends just this week alone

653
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,680
when completely viral

654
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,100
and I have not even gone a little bit of barrel at all

655
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,240
this week.

656
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,560
That is tough.

657
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,040
I'm sorry, man.

658
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,940
Listen, I hate when my friends leave

659
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,440
me behind.

660
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
My friends,

661
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Rex, did

662
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,840
some sort of like

663
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,560
crime against the world.

664
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,320
Caleb died

665
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
and everyone's like talking about

666
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
him. But what about me?

667
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,860
I am the one that cares the most

668
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,200
about going viral and no one even

669
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,060
wants to talk about me and my

670
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,920
achievements.

671
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,780
OK, so maybe let's cook up a

672
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,640
viral fucking post for you,

673
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
bro.

674
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,800
OK, what's how does a post go viral?

675
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,960
You need.

676
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,160
OK, so let's break down what was Rex's viral post, these vapes.

677
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah. So, yeah, well, there was a picture.

678
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,880
So maybe I need a picture.

679
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,880
It definitely needs a picture.

680
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,520
You need pictures. You're not a good enough writer.

681
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,720
Only Caleb can go text viral.

682
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,160
You can't. Yeah, you can't do that.

683
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,320
You need you need a funny fucking photo.

684
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,920
OK, so you could do

685
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,180
maybe you could get attacked like mauled by a like it's some kind of animal and

686
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,180
and then take a selfie and be like.

687
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,620
- There's already a viral post like that right now.

688
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,460
- Oh fuck.

689
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
- Really?

690
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,220
- Yeah, there's a hawk that dropped a snake on a woman

691
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,720
and then they both attacked her.

692
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,940
(laughing)

693
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,780
- What?

694
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,600
I haven't heard this story.

695
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,420
(laughing)

696
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,860
I thought I had a bad fucking week.

697
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,300
- That's how Mexico started.

698
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,260
That's how Mexico was funded.

699
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,100
- That is true.

700
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,460
(laughing)

701
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,820
- It's completely true.

702
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,380
She, her arm is completely destroyed.

703
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,700
They destroyed her arm?

704
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,420
They teamed up on the same body part even?

705
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,260
- Yeah.

706
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,540
- Okay, how about this? - It's horrible.

707
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,780
- Wait, how about this?

708
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,940
How about I crash my car and I take a picture of it

709
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,120
and I post it and I caption it,

710
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,220
no more driving much?

711
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,060
Ah, fuck.

712
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,980
Yeah, maybe some grocery stuff.

713
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,500
Grocery stuff always goes viral.

714
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,600
- Grocery stuff would be good.

715
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,600
If you could find a thing inside of a thing

716
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,800
where it's not supposed to be,

717
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,040
if you could get a box of Lucky Charms and find something,

718
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,520
if you could find a rat in a tin of Heinz beans,

719
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,760
that could go mega, super duper viral.

720
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,560
I mean, yeah, we're kind of running out of options here.

721
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,960
If you're not willing to get really badly hurt,

722
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,460
I just don't know what we can do for you, I guess.

723
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,580
- Well, do you guys think I have it in me?

724
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
- To go viral?

725
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,080
- I think you can do it.

726
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,060
- Do you think I could go viral?

727
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,020
- I think that, I don't know, you might,

728
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,060
I mean, I feel like if it was gonna happen,

729
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,700
it would have happened by now.

730
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,600
- Yeah.

731
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,260
You might need to screenshot something.

732
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,100
- You could screenshot a text from me.

733
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,940
- You're like, I'm always thinking about this.

734
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,500
- A Tinder message.

735
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,140
- A Tinder message is so, so, so funny to me.

736
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,060
- A Tinder message and it's a girl being like--

737
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,380
- A Reddit post.

738
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,180
- True.

739
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,100
- We could make a fake Reddit post

740
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,140
and then you could screenshot it.

741
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,300
- Yes. - This is what we have to do.

742
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,020
We manufacture this. - Yeah.

743
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,300
- Okay. - Because they're all fake anyway.

744
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,260
So what's the subreddit? - So it should be,

745
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,380
I completely got this.

746
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,620
It's am I the asshole?

747
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,020
It's always am I the asshole?

748
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,340
- Am I the asshole?

749
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,160
There we go.

750
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,140
So what we need to do is we need to do

751
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,140
the ultimate asshole post, okay?

752
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,420
- So it would start with,

753
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,980
I'm, am I, what the fuck?

754
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,780
Am I the asshole?

755
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,620
- I'm the asshole?

756
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,780
- For being a Karen.

757
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,100
- Yeah, am I the asshole?

758
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,100
And then my age is 19 and I'm a girl, 19F.

759
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,900
- Oh, here's what you could say.

760
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,860
Am I the asshole?

761
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,760
I'm 20, my girlfriend is 13.

762
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,700
Am I being an asshole?

763
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,780
- Okay.

764
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,820
- Her parents think I'm a total asshole.

765
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,820
Uh-huh.

766
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Me, male 24, girlfriend F12, on her parents' couch.

767
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
And they're mad at me.

768
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Am I the asshole?

769
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
Okay.

770
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
This is great.

771
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,820
This is going to go mega viral.

772
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,820
People are going to believe this 100%.

773
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Of course they will.

774
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,820
The most important part about going viral is that everyone does not know that.

775
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,660
Of course they will.

776
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,940
The most important part about going viral is that everyone does not think at all about

777
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
what they read on Twitter, so you need to lie.

778
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,620
You need to come up with a funny lie.

779
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Okay, so here's my follow-up question in Virality Online, say.

780
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,180
So at what point should I sell ads on my replies?

781
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Immediately.

782
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,180
One line.

783
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Immediately.

784
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,500
Because that's how you get the most views.

785
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,640
You get the rose for men, the sucker rose, the thing that sucks on you.

786
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
The clit sucker.

787
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I think...

788
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,640
The turbo, gawk gawk, pussy.

789
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,880
You also have to write an update as well because people love the updates on the Reddit post.

790
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,680
I saw people believe truly anything that is posted there.

791
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,280
I saw one a couple days ago that was like, it was like an updated one where it was like

792
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:07,760
me and my wife are in an argument about this and this and this. I went to my parents' house

793
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,160
and took our kid. Am I the asshole? It was one of those. And then the update was like,

794
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,280
"Guys, my..." And there was a lot of drama involved in it that was already kind of not

795
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280
believable.

796
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Yeah.

797
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,820
Then the update was like, "Guys, I hate to say this. My wife was so distraught that she

798
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,840
drove the car into a tree and died shortly after I made this post." I was like, "Is that

799
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,320
Really what you think guys whose wives die are doing

800
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,040
is immediately updating their Reddit post to keep people--

801
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,040
- So yes, that is not a typical human reaction,

802
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:47,240
but a Redditor, a Redditor with a wife,

803
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,360
they're not human, they don't have human instincts.

804
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
- Yeah, I think it's completely human to be like,

805
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,120
being like some drama, like something happened in your life

806
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,440
and you're first, or you're like,

807
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,520
one of the first things of yours to be like,

808
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,920
I need to make a, I need to know

809
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,680
whether I'm the asshole or not on Reddit.

810
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,120
Like that is, I don't think there's a single person

811
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,400
who thinks that way in the world.

812
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,680
- Yeah, I don't believe any of those posts.

813
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,960
I don't believe any, am I the asshole?

814
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,160
I don't believe any, today I fucked up.

815
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,680
Those are always like the craziest thing ever.

816
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,920
Those are always like, today I fucked up.

817
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:30,640
I was doing the dishes and I slipped on dish soap

818
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,040
and my cock went into my sister's mouth.

819
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,520
I fucked up so bad, y'all.

820
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,120
But isn't this some funny shit?

821
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,840
- I like the ones where it's like a,

822
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,360
it's like this like some family drama

823
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,200
and it has like a,

824
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
like it's like a really positive ending

825
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,280
and it's like just like a bad movie.

826
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,880
- That's always my, if you're gonna make it up,

827
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,000
why are you making up a good ending?

828
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
- Yeah.

829
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,720
- Those might be the only ones I believe, I guess.

830
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,360
Update I kill myself.

831
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,200
- Yeah, that is not, that one's always fake.

832
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,400
If anyone dies, nobody dies at the end of most stories.

833
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,480
- Yeah.

834
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,300
- Especially nobody's lucky enough

835
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,960
to have the ending be a death

836
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,200
after they've already had an interesting enough story

837
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,880
that they posted it on Reddit.

838
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

839
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,200
- Nobody's dying at the end of these, man.

840
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,720
This is all, it's all fake.

841
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,600
- I feel like if you took a Seinfeld episode

842
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,840
and turn it into an "Am I the Asshole" post.

843
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,920
- Yeah, top of the line. - You could go viral.

844
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,680
- I'm the asshole, I live with my parents,

845
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,520
and I sold my-- - I sold my dad's clothes.

846
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,320
- My dad's clothes. - I lied and said he was dead,

847
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,280
I sold his clothes, and then my friend

848
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,960
wore the clothes from the thrift store

849
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,920
to my parents' house, and they got in a fight.

850
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,800
- I think that would hit on Reddit.

851
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,640
- That would definitely, that is believable.

852
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,300
- That is believable on Reddit.

853
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,800
- Well, it's funny you say that no one believes in it.

854
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,840
Nothing is true on Twitter anymore.

855
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,840
That post that someone made with Rex's picture

856
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,340
made it all the way to Mexico.

857
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,420
And like, some of my girlfriend's friends

858
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,060
were like discussing it in their private DM.

859
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
- What was the post?

860
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,500
- No way. - I didn't see it.

861
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,140
- So I posted a picture of like all the vapes

862
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,060
I found in my room.

863
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,900
- Yeah.

864
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,980
And there was, you know, like 10 pounds of them in a plastic bag.

865
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:34,420
And someone took it and said, like, "My friend is a school teacher, an elementary school

866
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:40,140
teacher in Southern California, and this is what they've confiscated this month from elementary

867
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
schoolers."

868
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,580
People were like legitimately like tagging senators.

869
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,780
Yeah, this definitely made it to some representative's desk for certain.

870
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Yeah.

871
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:54,820
People in Mexico were discussing about it like, "No way!"

872
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,260
First of all, it's August.

873
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,540
School has not been in for a month.

874
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,820
No one knows when school starts.

875
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Yeah.

876
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,660
I don't even know it was August.

877
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Wow.

878
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,660
Yeah.

879
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
And then believing that elementary schoolers vape.

880
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,820
Like, but there's more than one elementary schooler that fakes.

881
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,260
Yeah, elementary school is kind of stretching it, I guess.

882
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,260
Right, middle school, believable.

883
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Elementary school, fiction, obviously.

884
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,260
I feel like the whole post was very obviously fake.

885
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,980
I was getting so many posts that were like, "Yo, most evil man, this dude is using your

886
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
posts for misinformation."

887
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,980
And I was like, "It's not his fault that you're all retarded."

888
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,420
I think my favorite part about that post was when someone came into your replies being

889
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,140
like, "At least you should dispose of them correctly."

890
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,420
And you were so petty enough to do a funny reply to them.

891
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,980
And then even out, like way, so many hours after that, you went ahead and you did the

892
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,700
funny reply in real life.

893
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,940
So what happened was this person was like being like, "Oh, you should dispose of them

894
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
correctly.

895
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,900
The batteries are going to be a disaster for the environment."

896
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,020
which is like, "I'm just gonna throw him in the ocean." And she was like, "No, you shouldn't do

897
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:16,580
that." Whatever. I would do the right thing. And then hours passed. I think it was literally the

898
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,140
next day. He posted a picture like, "All right, I'm gonna throw him in the ocean."

899
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,820
Yeah, I walked down to the beach. I went to right where the water meets the sand,

900
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,500
and I just put the bag down. Took a nice beautiful photo.

901
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:34,180
You should have made a video of you actually dumping them in. It's worth it. I mean,

902
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,580
It's not that big of an environmental impact for that.

903
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,460
It's more funny than it is bad for the environment.

904
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,460
In Long Beach, bro?

905
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,060
I was, but there was people everywhere on the beach.

906
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,180
They're there to do the same thing.

907
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,340
It's fucking Long Beach.

908
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,380
No, they were kids.

909
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,380
I felt horrible.

910
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,980
I was like, I can't dump 200 vapes next to an eight-year-old.

911
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,580
You should have offered them some vapes.

912
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,220
That would have been a funnier video

913
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,060
if you walked around handing them out to the little kid.

914
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,980
- Or like, yeah, put 'em in a candy bowl

915
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,100
and be like, "I'm all set for Halloween."

916
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,940
- Yeah.

917
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,780
(laughing)

918
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,900
That, see, that's the mind of a viral poster.

919
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,740
- Exactly.

920
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,340
- The only question left for me, I guess,

921
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,460
is actually a question from some Mexican representatives

922
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,900
who wanted to know, did you actually finish all those vapes?

923
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,420
Or did you only hit 'em like once and forget about 'em?

924
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,020
- What do you think?

925
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,700
- Did you-- - I think it's a mix.

926
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,300
due diligence and go through every single one to see if they were good.

927
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,780
Every single one.

928
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,860
Yeah.

929
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,900
Every single one.

930
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,900
I found two. You sat there with two piles.

931
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,100
Two of them were still good.

932
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,700
Yeah. Those are the ones that you had yesterday.

933
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,540
Yeah.

934
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,140
Yep.

935
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,860
Yep. There's one right there.

936
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,340
And where did you find that one? Do you remember?

937
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,220
This was in a backpack.

938
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,900
OK. See, that makes sense.

939
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,700
What was the worst?

940
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,940
What was the most surprising place you found a vape in your cleanup duties?

941
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,200
One was beneath the sheets of my bed.

942
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,900
I believe that.

943
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,560
Like between the mattress and the sheet?

944
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,620
Yes.

945
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
I completely believe that.

946
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,420
There was one that was tucked inside underwear where I had done laundry.

947
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,420
It was in a drawer.

948
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,340
There was two behind my computer.

949
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,900
The tower itself?

950
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,540
Yes, the tower in between the wall and the tower.

951
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,380
I completely believe all these locations.

952
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,780
Let's see.

953
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,820
There was a bag that I found in a drawer that I had like clearly

954
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,300
started to collect the dead ones in.

955
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:44,100
So there was like 10 in there and I like kept doing that and I would find

956
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,020
bags with like three to five each.

957
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,060
Like I've got like five different bags where I've been like, I shouldn't, you

958
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,940
know, like keep these all together.

959
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,220
It's like, God, everywhere.

960
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:58,140
Um, There was like, I cleaned off both of my nightstands and

961
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
found seven.

962
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,420
Would you put yourself in the

963
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,620
top one percent most prolific

964
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,300
vapors in the United States?

965
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
A hundred percent.

966
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
Yeah.

967
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,100
I think it's literally

968
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
everywhere.

969
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,140
Yeah. There is no place I will not

970
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,340
vape. A plane.

971
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,180
A bar.

972
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,100
Inside anywhere.

973
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,460
I never stop.

974
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,160
I miss vaping on a plane.

975
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,740
That was always so fun because it's

976
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,500
just so obvious that the people next

977
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
you hit you so fucking much.

978
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,740
Yeah.

979
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,940
I waited till the person that was next to me on the plane to fall asleep before I

980
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,780
went.

981
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,060
Hmm.

982
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,700
They had a cherry limeade dream.

983
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,340
Into their mouth completely.

984
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,620
So they also.

985
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,020
The smoke's got to go somewhere.

986
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,820
Yeah.

987
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,100
They got to get off an alarm.

988
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,860
Well, the thing is, is on a plane, you take a little tiny hit, you hold it till

989
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,060
it becomes invisible.

990
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,220
And then you slowly exhale through your nose.

991
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,620
Because getting caught on a plane is a $200 fine.

992
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,340
-Really? -Oh.

993
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,500
-Yes. It's a very big deal. -I didn't know that.

994
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,740
They fucking care.

995
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,580
I was about to say, "What are they going to do? Kick you out?"

996
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,860
Literally, yes.

997
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,700
-They will ban the flying ones. -I think they did.

998
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,500
I think they banned Wardell from JetBlue or some shit

999
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,500
because he posted a video or a picture of him vaping in a bathroom.

1000
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:24,540
I think I think that JetBlue just like banned him for a year or some shit.

1001
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,420
Yeah, they take it really seriously.

1002
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,300
No, I have a city out faking

1003
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,660
vaping on a plane bathroom and produce Photoshop

1004
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,840
like a Lufthansa or something like airline they're never going to take in your life.

1005
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,100
Yeah, so you get a lot of that and it goes completely viral.

1006
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,300
This is actually a pretty good idea.

1007
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1008
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,900
I also think that to make you viral,

1009
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,980
We we need to broaden our horizons here a little bit,

1010
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,440
broaden our view.

1011
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,900
It can it doesn't just need to be on Twitter.

1012
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,200
We can think of a Facebook post.

1013
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,040
We could think of a tick tock Instagram YouTube short.

1014
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,660
I think Facebook is bullshit.

1015
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,700
I think tick tock is where I'm going to go viral.

1016
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,660
OK, what's your idea for tick tock?

1017
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,960
Because that has to be a video or a selection of photos. Right.

1018
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,340
I don't know.

1019
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,500
I can't think in video.

1020
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,200
You could, but also here's the thing with that is that it's tough is that it has to be PG.

1021
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,100
You can't have cussing and stuff in those, right?

1022
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,600
Yeah.

1023
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,300
Yeah, you can.

1024
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
What are you talking about?

1025
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,800
You can cuss in TikToks?

1026
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Yeah.

1027
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,300
I've seen so much bad shit on TikTok.

1028
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:38,800
It's crazy.

1029
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,100
I thought that they like are super heavy moderating it or something.

1030
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,200
Like if you cuss in one, then it won't show up on people's pages.

1031
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,660
Nope, not at all.

1032
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,400
- Man. - You have to use euphemisms

1033
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,920
in text.

1034
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,320
Say like-- - Oh, right, yeah.

1035
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
When you use text on the video,

1036
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,360
you can't just be typing like,

1037
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,960
I'm fucking a pussy with my cock.

1038
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

1039
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,560
- You gotta be like, I'm fucking a--

1040
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,960
- Which is very crass, by the way.

1041
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,840
- PU55Y for my COCCO. - What's the whole thing

1042
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,360
where they, you can't say killed or suicide,

1043
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,080
you have to say unalived? - Yeah.

1044
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,200
- That is so fucking

1045
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
freaky to me. - I think that's TikTok.

1046
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,000
I think it's really stupid when people assume that any social media is like that.

1047
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,900
And they're like typing in like lead language to be like kill yourself.

1048
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,400
It's like just type it normal.

1049
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, just be a man.

1050
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,100
Yeah, don't be a pussy.

1051
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,700
Just be a man and type it normal.

1052
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,400
But I get it man.

1053
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,600
I used to try to say every word under the sun and get it through the RuneScape sensors.

1054
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,600
But those Gowers brothers know what they're doing man.

1055
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,300
They would pretty much catch it every time.

1056
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,640
Well if someone knows anything about this, this is Mr. Blank over here.

1057
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,480
Fanned 17 times on Twitter.

1058
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,000
Official world record.

1059
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,500
That is a lot of times.

1060
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,440
It's a lot of times. It's definitely not a world record.

1061
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,880
It's definitely not.

1062
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,320
I also made that up. I don't know how many times you've been fanned.

1063
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,760
It's like 14.

1064
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Oh, that's close.

1065
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,660
I'm on gear 3, dude. I'm a good boy now.

1066
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,160
You fixed it.

1067
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,160
The key is to just never post anything.

1068
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,660
Yeah.

1069
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,660
Well, the key is not to reply.

1070
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,160
Yeah.

1071
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,660
Replying is the best.

1072
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Because a lot of the times that I would get banned was like,

1073
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,660
you'd see someone say some stupid shit

1074
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,660
and then have that need,

1075
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,660
that deep need to tell them they're being stupid.

1076
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,160
Yeah.

1077
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,660
You gotta,

1078
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,660
[laughs]

1079
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,660
you gotta fact check them on Twitter.

1080
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,660
Yeah, I need you to literally die for what you just said.

1081
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,760
I think the only time I ever got a temp ban on Twitter,

1082
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,400
I got a 24-hour ban because I told Patrick, I said, like, shut up, idiot.

1083
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,040
I did like I did like a kindergarten

1084
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,940
like reply.

1085
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,740
I think the first time I ever got banned, I said I was going to karate chop

1086
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:02,180
random guy like I just told karate.

1087
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,480
Well, that that means that they consider you're going to be the weapons, man.

1088
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,120
Yeah. Wait, can we see?

1089
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,040
Can we see one of the chops?

1090
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Show us a chop.

1091
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,040
Show us your chops.

1092
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,040
It's too lethal.

1093
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,040
I'll show you a chop.

1094
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,040
Hi-yah!

1095
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Oh, get that thing away from me!

1096
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,160
Don't point that at me!

1097
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,200
You just broke my screen!

1098
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
You spiderwebbed it.

1099
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,200
I'm sorry, man.

1100
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,200
I didn't mean to.

1101
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,200
I can't hold back.

1102
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,200
It's too powerful.

1103
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
You know what we could do, man?

1104
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,920
You know what I think is coming back?

1105
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
What?

1106
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,120
I think that in the next two years,

1107
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,580
and you guys, this is Caleb's Lock of the Week.

1108
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,120
In the next two years,

1109
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,260
we're going to see a big resurgence

1110
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,480
of a little game that I used to play in the bathroom

1111
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,520
called Bloody Mary.

1112
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,200
Kids don't remember Bloody Mary.

1113
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,360
So if you, you don't know about Bloody Mary?

1114
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,640
I'm from a different country, I don't know what that means.

1115
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't know what that is.

1116
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,920
- Hey, dude.

1117
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Okay, when we're done recording,

1118
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,400
I want you to take a video of yourself.

1119
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,320
- Okay.

1120
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,720
- Go into the bathroom,

1121
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,920
turn off the lights in your bathroom.

1122
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,880
- Oh, okay.

1123
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,480
- And say, "Bloody Mary, bloody Mary, bloody Mary."

1124
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,580
Say it three times, she'll appear in the mirror

1125
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,920
and she will kill you.

1126
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,280
- I don't think she's gonna do that.

1127
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,000
- You never know till you try.

1128
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,160
My mom, I told my mom about it when I was a kid

1129
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,800
and she did it in our bathroom

1130
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,720
And then she locked herself in there

1131
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,480
to prove to me that it was fake.

1132
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,760
But then she pranked me and said,

1133
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,240
"Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary."

1134
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,880
Turned off the lights and then said nothing.

1135
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,480
And I banged on the door

1136
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
'cause I thought that my mom was dead.

1137
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,400
And then she came out laughing.

1138
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,000
And me and her, not that great of a relationship these days.

1139
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,840
Don't talk all that much.

1140
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,680
- Why did that start?

1141
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,840
Was it like a movie thing?

1142
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,480
- Well, it started when Bloody Mary

1143
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,800
attacked somebody in the bathroom

1144
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,480
after they said her name three times.

1145
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,880
- I don't think that's true.

1146
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,140
as far as I know.

1147
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,480
- If they are gonna play it now,

1148
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,040
they would say Five Night Freddy.

1149
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,200
- Five Night Freddy, Five Night Freddy, Five Night Freddy.

1150
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,600
- That's his fucking name.

1151
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,120
- Freddy Fazbear, Freddy Fazbear.

1152
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,240
I think kids are even too young

1153
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,840
for Five Nights at Freddy's now.

1154
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,820
That's like a 10 year old game.

1155
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,400
- Yeah, that's cringe now.

1156
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,480
Yeah, but that's cringe now.

1157
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,200
- Now they say Baldi's Basics, Baldi's Basics,

1158
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,040
Baldi's Basics.

1159
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,240
- Not even that, nope.

1160
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Now they say Skibbity Toilet.

1161
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Skibbity toilet. I think that's fake. I've decided that no it's fake. It's a skibbity toilet.

1162
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,200
It's got 10 million, every fucking thing he does has 10 million views.

1163
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,640
That's not that much. In like two days 10 million views? What are you talking about? He looks like

1164
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,720
Mr. Beast numbers bro. Gangnam style fucking had a billion views okay. That was the biggest video

1165
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,560
in the world. Yeah. Skibbity toilet. Oh look I've looked up, here's the two things I've looked up

1166
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:06,120
on my YouTube, Skibbity Toilet and Skibbity Toilet Lore. Skibbity Toilet, season one, all

1167
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:14,000
episodes, 89 million views. That's a lot of views. I wish I could see a graph because I

1168
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,920
would like to know how much of that is people our age being like, "What's the deal with

1169
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:26,120
these kids?" 19 hours ago, Skibbity Toilet upload 5.4 million views. Yesterday, Skibbity

1170
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,120
toilet upload 21 million views in one day for skibbity toilet 56.

1171
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,940
Ok I guess kids are fucking into skibbity toilets.

1172
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,740
You went vile one day and now you think you can move over skibbity toilet?

1173
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,660
I don't think I'm bigger than skibbity toilet.

1174
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,000
Move over skibbity toilet here comes the vape guy.

1175
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,640
The vape guy, I'm going to keep posting these with one extra vape every day.

1176
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,200
He's going to get more views every single time.

1177
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,200
I did get another date.

1178
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,320
We need to be doing more Skibbity Toilet content.

1179
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
Reacting to it, talking about it.

1180
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
We need the Skibbity Toilet podcast.

1181
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,900
Discussing it, yeah.

1182
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,960
We can make a Skibbity Toilet, yeah, Skibbity Toilet kind of lore podcast.

1183
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,360
The Skibbity Toycast, yeah.

1184
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,240
Every time a Skibbity Toilet episode comes out, we do an hour long kind of like talking

1185
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,800
dead episode about it.

1186
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,000
We have celebrities on, we have Chris Pratt on.

1187
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,200
I think people actually do that.

1188
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
People do that?

1189
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,740
- Skibbity Toilet recaps?

1190
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,680
- Yeah, they like talk about lore and like--

1191
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,440
- Well yeah, the lore, trust me, I've seen the lore video.

1192
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
He says that basically-- - Why are you looking up lore?

1193
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,240
- The Skibbity Toilets have infested the city

1194
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,320
and the cameramen are basically fighting

1195
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,240
the Skibbity Toilets.

1196
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,280
- That's the entire lore? - That's fucking good.

1197
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,360
- Yeah, it's not that, I think the guy who made it,

1198
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,480
when he first made it, he was like,

1199
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,320
"Oh, it'd be funny if there was a head inside of a toilet."

1200
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,560
And then all these people started making videos like,

1201
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,900
"What does it mean, what does Skibbity Toilet mean?"

1202
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,980
and then he decided to make it a whole series.

1203
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,860
- I think the thing I hate the most about that

1204
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,120
is that I really hate that song.

1205
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,940
The "Skibbity Toilet" song.

1206
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,060
I don't fuck with it.

1207
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,900
- You don't like,

1208
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,980
♪ If you see us in the club ♪

1209
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,980
♪ You'll be acting real nice ♪

1210
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,340
It's a good song.

1211
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,780
- Well, that part is like okay,

1212
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,420
but then it goes into the funny TikTok remix

1213
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,540
and it's really bad.

1214
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,860
- Yeah, I don't, whatever language that is,

1215
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,020
I do not care.

1216
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,700
I don't think it's a real language.

1217
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:29,520
Well, he's just he's just saying, I think it's Turkish.

1218
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,960
It's definitely not Turkish.

1219
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,020
I think it's literally racist.

1220
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,020
No, it's I.

1221
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,920
Well, I first heard that song in a Turkish tick tock.

1222
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,660
It's like the Turkish guy with a big belly who like

1223
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:47,160
he gets invited to restaurants and he just like starts shaking his belly

1224
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,700
because he likes he likes the food so much.

1225
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,700
That's not what I'm talking about.

1226
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,700
Wait, y'all.

1227
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,700
So I completely think this is Turkish.

1228
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,700
Sorry, I'm watching Skibbity Toilet 56.

1229
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:00,920
Basically the Skibbity toilets are dropping what looks to be nuclear bombs on the city

1230
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:07,700
and they have a giant Skibbity toilet that has just, well, it obliterated the cameraman.

1231
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,100
So this is going to be a really hard fought battle.

1232
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,380
A lot of casualties on both sides.

1233
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:19,300
And at this point, you know, it's one of those things where you always think the winners write

1234
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,980
history right so we don't know who the good guys are right now in this in this

1235
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:28,300
battle because for all we know in a year from now we'll be saying those skibbity

1236
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,900
toilets they those were the good guys the whole time yeah yeah they're the

1237
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,340
noble cause you know what I was thinking what they should make Oppenheimer a

1238
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:45,860
playable character in Call of Duty I think he was like a hundred pounds yeah

1239
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:47,860
I think he would get rolled over.

1240
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,860
I don't think he was a soldier.

1241
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,860
He wasn't.

1242
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,860
I don't think he's a killer.

1243
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,860
He could spend the whole fucking thing doing calculations.

1244
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,860
Do you think?

1245
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,860
He could spend the whole game in the back

1246
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,860
and then maybe if he calculates...

1247
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,860
And then you get 25 kills and then he drops

1248
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,860
the atomic bomb.

1249
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,860
But you already can get a nuke

1250
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,860
from playing the fucking...

1251
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,860
No, wait, wait, I kinda get this now.

1252
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,860
It would be funny if you bought his skin

1253
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:17,840
like Warzone and he went to do like the special animation on his like backstab

1254
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,940
and he's just like he's just making a calculations and he's just like

1255
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:27,540
eventually builds a bomb and drops it on the guy who he backstabbed. I think that's a good idea.

1256
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,660
I don't think that this is a very good idea y'all. I think that's a good idea.

1257
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,060
I haven't played Warzone in a long time. Me and Rex have been playing Warzone every day for the past two months.

1258
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,860
You have not been playing Warzone. Ask me how many Warzone games I've won.

1259
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,620
How many victory royales have you had in the last two months on Warzone?

1260
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,620
Probably 20.

1261
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:48,580
That's not, you don't even know what the map is on Warzone anymore.

1262
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
It's...

1263
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
Oh, good press.

1264
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Boards, map.

1265
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,580
Boards.

1266
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:57,060
I do wish that I could go back to enjoying that game.

1267
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,420
When that game first came out, I loved that game.

1268
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,700
I was so terrible at it, but we played it so fucking much.

1269
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,700
It was very fun.

1270
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
That's the reason we're here now.

1271
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,660
We owe it all to Warzone.

1272
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:12,500
Warzone is what created this three-headed beast.

1273
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
Yeah.

1274
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
That's very true.

1275
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,180
What a beautiful three-headed beast it is.

1276
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,540
It used to be fun, man.

1277
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,380
We used to just drink wine and play Warzone every single night.

1278
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,380
Now I'm drinking-

1279
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,740
Just the worst period of our lives.

1280
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,860
Now I'm drinking Bomb Pop Primes.

1281
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,140
My car is somewhere, is in some kind of prison.

1282
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,340
My car is in Rikers Island all locked up.

1283
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,060
I mean, things have taken a turn for the worst.

1284
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:45,460
I think we should all get into Baldur's Gate 3. I think that that game looks

1285
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:55,260
too hard. How so? It looks too much too hard too much hard. Looks a little too

1286
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,880
hard for me. I like easy games where you do the same thing every single time.

1287
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,940
There's too many options. I was talking to Cam about this yesterday. Games where you

1288
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:12,580
get in and they don't tell you exactly what to do I hate that shit right

1289
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:21,740
tell me what to do I want to I like it to be on rails I like roller are you

1290
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:28,660
curious at all about the world about the real world yeah I'm not curious about a

1291
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:38,500
pretend world. Okay. I want to be in and out 20 hours. If you want to tell me something about the world, then just tell me. Don't make me find it out on my own.

1292
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,820
Exactly. Exactly how I feel. I played that game The Outer Wilds. I liked it for

1293
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:50,540
about three hours until it was like, "There's no dialogue. You have to piece

1294
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:56,420
the story together." I'm not Columbo, buddy. I'm not gonna walk around. If I'm doing

1295
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,500
detective work I'm getting paid for it okay I already do enough of that in my

1296
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,620
real fucking life I think it'd be funny to like put you like lock you in a room

1297
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:10,580
and make you like stream like one of those like weird like puzzle games like

1298
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:18,420
the overden where it's just like it's like super you like that game yeah the

1299
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:24,380
overden no is that is that not do you have to like look up a solution well

1300
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,740
There's a mystery.

1301
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,580
There's enough of it.

1302
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,420
It's interesting.

1303
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,240
Yeah, it at least keeps me,

1304
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,480
something like even Skyrim.

1305
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,900
Once you, if I'm far enough away

1306
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,700
from the main quest line in Skyrim

1307
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,860
that it's gonna take me 15 minutes to walk back to it,

1308
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,360
I'm turning the game off.

1309
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,660
Okay.

1310
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,500
I don't wanna do that.

1311
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,100
I do not want random encounters.

1312
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,100
I do not want to have people run up to me and say,

1313
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,220
"Halt, hero.

1314
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,600
"I need you to find my watch."

1315
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,580
I'll go, "Suck my dick, dude.

1316
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,260
"Get the fuck out of my face."

1317
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,540
I want Halo 3.

1318
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,620
Halo 3 is a good game.

1319
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,660
Any of the RPGs are so fucking stupid, man.

1320
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:15,540
These side quests, I never wanna see,

1321
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,100
games need to, when games are like,

1322
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,260
like with Baldur's Gate, they're like,

1323
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,560
There's 180 hours of cinematics.

1324
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,980
There's there's you can spend a thousand hours just on the side quest.

1325
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,480
I don't want to do that shit, dude.

1326
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,900
I want to get to the end.

1327
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,240
I want there to be a big red boss.

1328
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,400
I want to beat the boss or give up on it because it's too hard

1329
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
and never play the game again.

1330
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,500
Can I can I erase you a counterpoint? Yeah.

1331
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:44,000
There's completely nakedly women in the game.

1350
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,420
Yeah, I did. I actually just saw that today.

1351
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,320
That is so fucking funny.

1352
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,940
The Tia just had a naked Chun-Li

1353
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,440
mod installed and they like start the game and the guy start the guy

1354
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,120
the announcer dude, the match starts and the players know that something's wrong

1355
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,400
so they just start walking into each other and the announcer goes like,

1356
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,400
"Very interesting, we get the Kimberly pick on the other side."

1357
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,700
He's still trying to do announcing for the fucking match.

1358
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,240
Just trying to ignore it.

1359
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,160
Yeah, and it takes a full 20 seconds before he's like,

1360
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:40,320
"Oh wait, hold on." And then the screen goes black.

1361
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,120
Hold the phone!

1362
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,420
(laughing)

1363
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,780
- It's a really good video.

1364
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,780
- I think that's so crazy to be just playing,

1365
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,300
fighting, I said this on stream, I was like,

1366
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,820
I don't understand at all the appeal of just fucking,

1367
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,580
like sucking at a street fighter,

1368
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,260
but just like while looking at a naked woman.

1369
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,100
- Yeah.

1370
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,420
- I'd be so pissed.

1371
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,620
I would turn gay.

1372
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,600
- Do you know that guy Jason Unruh?

1373
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,900
He's like a, he's like a leftist YouTube guy.

1374
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,180
It's got like a Mohawk.

1375
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,300
Yeah.

1376
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,340
Yeah.

1377
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:17,280
So there's a video of him.

1378
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,980
He was playing fallout on like stream talking about whatever, you know, lame

1379
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,380
politics shit he's on about.

1380
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:29,500
And, uh, he like walks up to one of the NPCs and it just immediately starts to go

1381
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,740
to like suck his dick.

1382
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:35,780
He's like, Oh, Oh, no.

1383
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,460
and it just like cuts out.

1384
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,700
(laughing)

1385
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,520
- This is a great Steam community post

1386
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,980
by somebody under Baldur's Gate 3.

1387
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,300
Sex scenes not explicit enough.

1388
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,220
Can we get a mod or something?

1389
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,020
(laughing)

1390
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,060
- Yeah, let me see some fucking pussy.

1391
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,500
- Yeah, well that's the thing.

1392
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,540
It used to be, years ago,

1393
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,540
it was shunned to show sex and pussy and tits.

1394
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,900
And now it's the biggest game of the world.

1395
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,340
And everyone is appreciating, is there a crying mouse?

1396
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,140
- No, that's a dog with a chew toy.

1397
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,060
- Oh, I see.

1398
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,620
- He's moving away from the door

1399
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,500
so you can continue with your point.

1400
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,060
- I forgot what I was saying.

1401
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,220
- You were saying it used to be a--

1402
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,060
- Years ago.

1403
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:23,420
- Yeah, 10 years ago, we used to have--

1404
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,300
(laughing)

1405
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,980
- Yeah, there was no tits, no ass, and no balls.

1406
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,820
- Yeah.

1407
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,820
- Now we have Steve ass, John tits, and Fred balls.

1408
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,780
- A viral post.

1409
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,780
That's a good way.

1410
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,540
Okay, yeah, wait.

1411
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,660
Wait.

1412
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,460
That's, we nailed it.

1413
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,840
Post that right now.

1414
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,820
10 years ago, we used to have no tits,

1415
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,460
no ass, and no balls.

1416
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,740
Now we have Steve ass, Joe dick,

1417
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:54,660
and two hairy balls.

1418
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,500
Yeah.

1419
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,320
You know?

1420
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,340
Post that right now.

1421
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,180
Okay, I'm gonna post it right now.

1422
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,780
You have to post this.

1423
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,620
Okay.

1424
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,300
This is such an easy, this is a layup, dude.

1425
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,820
- Yeah, slam dunk. - See, one hour,

1426
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,860
and that's the kind of thing we can come up with.

1427
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:09,700
- How did this start?

1428
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,740
10 years ago, we used to have--

1429
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,580
- 10 years ago, you used to have no tits,

1430
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,660
no ass, and no balls.

1431
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,880
Now we have Steve Tits,

1432
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,020
Joe Dick,

1433
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,260
(laughing)

1434
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,940
- And Harold Balls.

1435
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:23,780
(laughing)

1436
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,700
- Steve Tits,

1437
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,140
Joe Dick,

1438
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,820
- And Harold Balls.

1439
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,060
(laughing)

1440
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,300
(laughing)

1441
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:38,420
- Okay, this is going, I'm retweeting this shit right now.

1442
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,920
This is going so mega viral, you won't even believe this.

1443
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:46,780
- I really wanna be the first post on X to go viral.

1444
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,360
- This is going viral as fuck.

1445
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,820
This is going to be, this is going to be a...

1446
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,660
- Yup.

1447
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,660
- This is going to be amazing.

1448
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,420
- Your phone's gonna go crazy.

1449
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,960
- Yeah, get ready to turn your notifications off.

1450
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,980
- Ah, I'm putting it in silent mode, I can't deal with it.

1451
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,100
- You can't be bothered with this shit, man.

1452
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,420
- I'm gonna be honest.

1453
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,560
- What? - I hate the fame.

1454
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,380
I hate being the center of attention.

1455
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,460
- You just said you want to be addicted to my posts

1456
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,620
more than anything. - But I didn't know

1457
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,640
what I had when I had it, you know?

1458
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,100
I had all this peace in my life.

1459
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,940
I had peace and quiet. - It's been destructive.

1460
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,340
- My only notifications were my friends texting me,

1461
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:30,900
I love you and I appreciate you all every day.

1462
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,420
And now all I get is fucking--

1463
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,760
- Like good morning, I appreciate you doing this.

1464
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,860
- Oh, Felix Peterman, which is your tweet.

1465
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,380
Text you see, send you a DM and call you gay.

1466
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,260
Like I don't care about any of this anymore.

1467
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,900
- It would be really funny if I started texting you like

1468
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,740
XQC.

1469
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,580
Like your house is on my wrist.

1470
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,900
Well, he's like, he was messaging that guy,

1471
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,100
Ethan Klein from like Page 3 shit.

1472
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,500
And he's like, your house is on my wrist.

1473
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,980
And I think it would be really funny to text Juvio, like your,

1474
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,140
your house is on my wrist, but just like an Apple watch.

1475
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:11,500
Well, my, yeah, my rent is just like 300, 300, I think.

1476
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
So it wouldn't take much.

1477
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,900
Yeah, that's not, that's a, you know, it's basically a beginner watch.

1478
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,820
I wear your year's rent every day.

1479
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,700
It's a T-shirt.

1480
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,980
That would be so fucked up.

1481
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,740
Rex for the longest time just thought I'd live in like a mud hut.

1482
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,260
And whenever he saw me, he's like--

1483
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,100
- That's not true.

1484
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:27,920
- I thought you did too, honestly.

1485
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,760
- That is not true.

1486
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,460
- And whenever I saw him, he would be like,

1487
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:31,820
he would just feel so bad about me.

1488
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,420
He's like, man, I'm just, I'm so sorry about your situation.

1489
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,260
I'm like, what are you talking about?

1490
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:40,260
- I thought you lived in an upper class teepee for years.

1491
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,180
- I didn't think you lived in a mud hut.

1492
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,260
I thought you made 11 cents an hour doing slave labor.

1493
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,300
- He kinda did.

1494
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,140
- I kinda did.

1495
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,060
- And that's why I was like,

1496
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,100
I'm so sorry about your situation.

1497
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,700
- You used to work a full-time job

1498
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,200
- And make like 500 bucks a month.

1499
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,100
- Yeah. - Yeah, basically, yeah.

1500
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,540
- Which is pretty fail.

1501
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,500
- And now I'm the richest guy in Mexico.

1502
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,700
- Yep, and now you have generational wealth.

1503
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,580
- Yeah, I'm gonna buy a car.

1504
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:10,140
- I'm sorry for feeling empathy for my friend.

1505
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,900
I actually don't give a fuck about your situation.

1506
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,640
- You don't even wear watches.

1507
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,780
That would be such a stupid flex for me.

1508
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,020
- It bothers me. - You don't wear watches.

1509
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,660
Show me your wrists.

1510
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,100
- They bother, I hate wearing stuff on my hands.

1511
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,980
- Do your watches bother you?

1512
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,840
- Yeah, it's uncomfortable.

1513
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,800
It bothers me.

1514
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,800
- That's an interesting kind of autistic OCD thing to have.

1515
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,640
- Yeah.

1516
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:34,460
(laughing)

1517
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,920
It is, I mean, that's definitely what it is,

1518
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,760
but it does bother me.

1519
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,680
- Do you guys wanna be Apple Watch, Apple Fitness buddies?

1520
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,880
- I have a really old Apple Watch

1521
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,560
that I got from Cameron's fiance.

1522
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,600
She sold it to me for $20,

1523
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,840
but it doesn't really work very well.

1524
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,040
It's like the first one they have.

1525
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
It basically just tracks your heart rate.

1526
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,000
I don't think I can add friends on it.

1527
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,320
- Well, that's so sad.

1528
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,640
- Yeah.

1529
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,680
I'm not rich like you, Jubio.

1530
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,600
Where you can buy an Apple Watch every day.

1531
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,880
- I don't buy an Apple Watch every day.

1532
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,000
- And now you have one of the most viral posts in the world

1533
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,400
and you're already getting ad revenue for it.

1534
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,600
- Oh my God.

1535
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:15,200
- I mean, this already has 35 likes and six reposts, man.

1536
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,560
- I don't even.

1537
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:19,480
- I love that they renamed it to reposts, by the way.

1538
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,320
- I love reposts.

1539
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,160
What even is a tweet?

1540
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,160
They should call it a Musk.

1541
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,160
So true.

1542
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,400
Call it a Musk right now.

1543
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Yeah.

1544
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,400
I think-

1545
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:35,400
It has six Musks, six Elans, 36 Elans, and 42 Teslas.

1546
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
You know?

1547
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Three stoplights.

1548
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Dude, I see Teslas all the time down here.

1549
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
You see Teslas down there?

1550
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,520
Yeah, I think Elon Musk is on the come up.

1551
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,100
My gym is right near a whole lot of Rivians.

1552
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,100
You know those cars?

1553
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,100
Mmm, yeah.

1554
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,140
And they, uh, I don't think they've sold a single one.

1555
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,020
It's full every single fucking day.

1556
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,500
Well, I think they're expensive as fuck.

1557
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Yeah.

1558
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,580
There's a secret behind that.

1559
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:08,100
They're really expensive, but if you buy one, you get like $36,000 from the government.

1560
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,100
Really?

1561
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,100
Yes.

1562
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,100
So they're like an electric car.

1563
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,100
So you make money just ripping them off.

1564
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,580
Yeah, they're like, any electric car.

1565
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:19,260
So they're like $70,000, but then you get like $36,000

1566
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,100
back on your taxes.

1567
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,600
- That's interesting, 'cause there's a Hyundai, I think,

1568
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,160
that is one of the cheaper electric cars

1569
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,840
that is like, I think only 50K.

1570
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,380
- Yeah.

1571
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,220
Yeah, there's like a bunch of like--

1572
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:33,980
- Yeah, the Ioniq.

1573
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:37,620
- Different tiers of like tax rebates you can get.

1574
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:38,460
- Uh-huh.

1575
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,460
- I think you should-- - It's like--

1576
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,980
- Rex's complete word for this,

1577
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,340
I think you should completely look it up.

1578
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:46,420
- 2023 Ioniq 6 sedan, $52,000.

1579
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:50,660
I'm gonna buy it if I'm gonna get a $36,000 rebate.

1580
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,500
- Yeah.

1581
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,580
- Why don't we just get like a--

1582
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,420
Why don't we just get like a--

1583
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,940
- They want you to get an electric car?

1584
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,860
- Let's get like a team, like a van for a gang, for a team.

1585
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,160
- I want one of those new Amazon vans.

1586
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,740
Those look cool as fuck.

1587
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:06,860
- Those would look kinda cool.

1588
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,620
- They look fucking cool, man.

1589
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,460
- I watched a review of it for some reason

1590
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:13,740
And I was like, I'm never gonna be in one of these

1591
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,520
or even gonna see them.

1592
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,060
We don't get any of this shit down in Mexico,

1593
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,780
but it look fucking, it look pretty sick.

1594
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,220
- It's fucking badass.

1595
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:24,180
- One of those Waymo Chrysler minivans.

1596
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:28,020
And I wanna sit in the back seat for 20 hours a day

1597
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,380
and just get driven around to different places.

1598
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,940
- Yeah, so people can touch you.

1599
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,540
Yeah. - Yes.

1600
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:36,260
Yeah. - Oh yeah.

1601
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,340
- Get paid $20 an hour to watch the car,

1602
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,640
Make sure nothing happens.

1603
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,800
My whole time my hands

1604
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,980
are aren't on the wheel.

1605
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,680
It's getting into accidents.

1606
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,880
Yes, I remember when my car was total.

1607
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,580
They did.

1608
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,320
Waymo was like in my area.

1609
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,420
They just started to like

1610
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,580
Waymo trial and I took it like

1611
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,980
everywhere 'cause it was cheaper

1612
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:58,760
than like an Uber 'cause it was like

1613
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,760
trial and it was so funny 'cause

1614
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,020
it would get like stuck trying to make

1615
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,500
like a U-turn or like turn on a red light.

1616
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,560
It would be like the.

1617
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,900
It'd be like really tented.

1618
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,540
Wait, you actually rode in that shit?

1619
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:16,380
Yeah, I rode it because my car was total and I had to like go to like physical

1620
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,180
therapy and shit and like all these different places.

1621
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,860
Whoa.

1622
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:20,180
Damn.

1623
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:26,660
So they operated in the city I was in and it was like $9 versus like $15.

1624
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:32,660
So you get in, there's like a guy that's sitting there that's like, "Hey, what's up?"

1625
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:37,100
And then you close the door and it just starts and it shows you like-

1626
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,700
They still have to have a guy in it?

1627
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:44,540
Yeah, because they can't have a guy that doesn't like, there has to be a guy in the driver's

1628
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,060
seat pretending to drive.

1629
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:52,340
He's got his hands on the wheel, his feet are on the pedal, he's got to be ready to

1630
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:57,940
like slam on the gas or turn in case it goes haywire.

1631
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:03,700
I think it's really funny that the thing that Americans have been tackling for the past

1632
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,700
like five or six years is how to make like fully like automated driving a thing.

1633
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:12,220
Well, the problem is, so this is when I was living in Arizona,

1634
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:16,540
so I was living in Chandler, but Tempe, which is one city above Uber,

1635
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:21,540
self driving was going on at the same time and it's straight up like mowed down

1636
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,620
a pedestrian. Like someone like,

1637
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:29,940
it was like an old woman at 4am jaywalking and it just fucking just cringed her.

1638
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,260
And so they were like, "Okay, no more."

1639
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:37,300
Well, don't get nasty with it.

1640
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,460
But it turned her into a red goo.

1641
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:43,940
You said that an elderly woman, 90-year-old woman,

1642
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,460
you're saying that she got creamed by a car and you're...

1643
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,860
Oh, come on, man.

1644
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,060
This is fucking...

1645
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,060
This is an awful story.

1646
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,940
Anyway, it completely murdered her.

1647
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,540
I said, "Free fast-free into the mirror at 3 a.m.

1648
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,940
and I got creamed."

1649
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,940
That's disgusting.

1650
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,940
So they stopped allowing all the self-driving car trials down there?

1651
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,940
Yeah, I think that's probably a good idea.

1652
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,940
I have to go pee, so we're going to end.

1653
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,940
Okay, goodbye.

1654
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,940
Bye.
