- Waves. - The radio is waves.

- Oh, I'm not doing too hot.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,080
- Me neither.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,660
I had a really bad week.

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,920
- Yeah, I had a, you know,

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,960
there's a lot of ups and downs in my weekend.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,920
- Yeah, I had a crazy day yesterday.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,400
- Yeah, I broke my toe.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,240
- Yeah.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,200
- I broke my toe.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,560
I wasn't even doing anything cool.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,200
- Yeah, well, how'd you break it?

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,520
- I slipped.

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,720
- On what?

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,240
- It was just like a patch of ground

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,640
that I think might have been wet,

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,260
and then my skateboard, I was trying to just turn around

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,440
so I could go do this trick.

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,120
- Oh, but you were at least on a skateboard, though.

28
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,960
- Yeah, but I did--

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
- So it's cool. - Yeah, it was a trick.

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,040
- It wasn't cool, it ruined the whole sesh.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,720
- Not the sesh.

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,360
- That's awful. - The sesh was ruined for me.

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
- Sounds like you had a bad fucking week.

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,940
- You had a bad sesh yesterday?

35
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,640
- Bad sesh is bad vibes. - That's horrible.

36
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
I don't even wanna say what was,

37
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,040
my week was bad now.

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,160

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,280

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,040

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,760
i didn't even heard it just started to i didn't do anything he didn't do anything

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,720
caleb didn't do a thing for myself

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,680
i'm sorry i thought you know you should have had your toe hurt to okay it hurts

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,380
right now then and then I got in a city bike dispute. Oh no dispute. I had to

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,640
just because I put it into the dock and the dock was broken. I was imagining you

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,020
got in a fight with someone you're calling it a dispute. No I had to I put

49
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,040
it in the dock and I mean thankfully I'm still in my 15-day free trial of

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:17,880
lift pink uh-huh but I I put the city bike in the dock it locked but the dock

51
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,040
is broken and it wasn't registering that my city bike was returned. Oh no. So I

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
technically went on an 18-hour city bike ride yesterday. Damn that sucks. I was

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,960
charged, I wasn't charged, I had to call and take photos of the thing in the dock

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:41,000
but it said that it was uh it would have been around $150. That's worth it. That's

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,560
one of the troubles with technology nowadays. Might as well just buy your own city bike at that point.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,960
that i i want to get a bike yeah you want to get a bike take the one that he was

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,160
going to give to me

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,040
yeah you can have it

59
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,720
you should take for a small price you'll use it more than me i can pay for it

60
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,760
twenty dollars

61
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
uh... that's too high

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,280
then you can't okay i'll take it for twenty dollars

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,360
yeah i had a pretty bad week too, not as bad as yours but i was uh...

64
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,600
i was actually in a gangland shootout

65
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,440
that sounds a way less bad the idea that i was on the test fund maybe not have a

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,200
video i got hit four or five times by different calibers of bullets and i

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,440
actually had to use might ideas might uh... trico in the gangland should

68
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,400
actually kill a couple kids to

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,440
yeah that sounds like it could be a video game type uh...

70
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,480
that now it is in real life

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,880
yeah i had a bad uh... i'll

72
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,080
all my limbs lost feeling and i died

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm just joking. I didn't die.

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
That's a completely made up story.

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
I said, just kidding. It's not made up. It's a joke.

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
If you said kidding.

77
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
How is that? That is not true.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm literally telling you, me and Pat both had really bad

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
real weeks.

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
I did too. I don't want to say it because

81
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
we're recording it for millions of

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
people to hear. Maybe I don't want to say the horrible things

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
that happened to me so I make a joke to lighten the mood.

84
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
He's making light.

85
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
That's how you cook.

86
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
He's making light of some real shit.

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,560
He's making light of some real shit that happened to us and he doesn't even care that even after I broke my toe skating

88
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
I still went to a party. I do care. That's why my toe hurts so bad is because you I I would try

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,920
I was ready and I walked my toes on my toes because I was trying I was

90
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,440
share the pain

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,480
I was trying to take some of the burden off of him

92
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,840
I was trying to take the pain into my body put it on me and put it on me

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,920
He's like, oh, oh, yeah, actually I lost all feeling in my limbs

94
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,360
He doesn't care that I had a broken toe and I went to a place with an open bar.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
Do you guys even care that I played too many video games and lost all feeling in my arms?

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
That's not funny.

97
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
That's not funny.

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,960
Do you guys even care that I made a face so long that I got stuck that way?

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
He does.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
I bet he doesn't.

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
I care.

102
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,800
Look, I'm making a face right now because I feel so bad.

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Well, I would say that's it.

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm trying to take it.

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
I really like that.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I want to carry your pain for you.

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,880
I really like this face, but don't hold it for too long because it will actually get stuck

108
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
like that.

109
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,200
face be stuck than yours that's not gonna help my face you get unstuck because

110
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:21,480
you're making this face you just look ugly you look fucking disgusting you

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,600
look you straight out you look like a spider right now stop it's stuck it's

112
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:39,120
Oh great, I guess now he does share our pain. Okay, but have you been have you

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,960
been riddled by bullets? Yeah. Did you break your toe and still have to go to a

114
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,960
party? And have to go to a party? Mm-hmm. I didn't even get to go to a party.

115
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,560
My toe hurt and I didn't even get to go to a party. Did you say three boobs? I got

116
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,320
three boobs. He went to the party from Total Recall.

117
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
at like Mars.

118
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Open boobs.

119
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Yeah.

120
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Bring your own boobs.

121
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
And I also got free stickers too.

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Well, that was the problem and that happened in Total Recall too.

123
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,600
But instead of open bar, they had open air lock.

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
See, he doesn't even care.

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
He's talking about Total Recall.

126
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
He doesn't care that I had a broken toe and I got free stickers.

127
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,200
I have Total Recall of your broken toe situation is what I have.

128
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Do you think that instead of, in the future, instead of drugs and alcohol, like we won't

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,500
like physically drink or consume them, we'll just like download like a chip or a feeling?

130
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,200
If we're robots, maybe.

131
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,640
don't think that we're gonna have some kind of new gland.

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,640
I don't think it'll be a gland, I bet it'll be like a helmet that you wear.

133
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Yeah.

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,800
Like make an electrical attack on you.

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,760
Yeah and it makes you feel a little weird.

136
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,360
It's like the thing, it's like this thing that you put on your head.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Oh yeah.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,360
That's a more addictive drug than anything.

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,520
That makes you shiver.

140
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,800
That is honestly, I could easily no hands fucking come without one of those.

141
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,540
when I was home of my my mom's house. My mom has one of those and I snuck up by

142
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,220
my girlfriend. She didn't even know that we like had one or that it existed and I

143
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,560
did a turn and that was probably the most scared I've ever seen her in my

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,360
life. Dude, that feeling is so fucked up. It's it was so she was like

145
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,240
it's not a massage. It's not anything. I don't like that people pretend that

146
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,720
they're not only for pranks. Nobody's sitting there doing that to themselves

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,560
like oh yeah, my eyes would massage you. I do that you do that. It feels nice. I

148
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
hate that feeling.

149
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
That's because you're bald.

150
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
You don't have hair to cushion it.

151
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
It probably scratches you.

152
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,020
I haven't even, for your information, I've never used one while I was bald.

153
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Okay, asshole.

154
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
You should try it again.

155
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Maybe you'll like it.

156
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Maybe I will.

157
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
You know what feels good?

158
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
What?

159
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,860
If you got like popcorn ceiling, like with the little specks.

160
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
Yeah.

161
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,460
And when you're in like the third grade and you have triple bunk beds and you rub your

162
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,460
feet on the ceiling.

163
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
Ugh.

164
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
That feels good.

165
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,860
You know what I always thought would feel good is if you, you know, is like after you

166
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,020
you have sex with a woman and you could just leave it in there and just go pee.

167
00:07:51,020 --> 00:08:00,580
If the girl could just like absorb the P, I always thought that would feel

168
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,800
really good. Yeah, yeah, you just don't have to leave. That's how you make a

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,820
special kind of baby. You stay in the in the girl, a different kind of baby is

170
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,600
made that way. You just pee all of your pee into her. Yeah, that's how the X-Men

171
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,620
And then she could tell you if you're dehydrated or not.

172
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
(laughter)

173
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
Hey, you can't see.

174
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
In the pores.

175
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Yeah.

176
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,620
She can just feel it.

177
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,620
The pee comes out of the pores and if it's like,

178
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,620
it looks like yellow Gatorade.

179
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
It fills up the white of her eyes.

180
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,620
The more yellow it gets,

181
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,620
the more you need to drink some water.

182
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Yeah.

183
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
What else would feel really good?

184
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Like a back massage.

185
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:49,620
something that you've never felt. A back massage from an expert. I bet honestly...

186
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:59,460
Can you imagine... Oh, that'd probably... No, that'd feel too good. What if a rhino or a

187
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,540
hippo or an elephant had... You know when someone steps on your back, right? What if one of

188
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,780
them did that just the perfect amount with those big circular fucking legs? Wouldn't

189
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,260
That feels so good.

190
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,900
- You know what would feel good is if my toe was fine.

191
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,460
- Your toe is fine.

192
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,300
- Really?

193
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,000
- You painted it for attention.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
- Did you see it?

195
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,660
Did I show you it?

196
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,500
- Yeah, you painted it purple.

197
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,340
- Yeah, it's completely purple.

198
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,180
- For complete attention.

199
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,500
- My shit's completely purple

200
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,020
and it was such a non-accident.

201
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,860
Like it looked, it should have, I should have been fine.

202
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,340
- You were involved so it was a nonce accident.

203
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,180
- Nope.

204
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,020
- Damn.

205
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,840
- Shoes.

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,900
- It's those shoes I bought.

207
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,340
I bought those, you guys are size 11s, right?

208
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,180
- Yeah.

209
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,620
Does anyone have any better skate shoes I could trade?

210
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,460
- Me?

211
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,380
- Me, personally, not a fan of the Adidas Tyshawn Lowe's.

212
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,460
- Dude, those are the ugliest, stupidest shoes

213
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,300
you've ever owned.

214
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
- What, the black ones?

215
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,060
- Yeah.

216
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,880
- The Tyshawn's?

217
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
- Yeah.

218
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,020
I don't know why you have those.

219
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,020
- It's 'cause they were the only things they had at the shop.

220
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,620
- And they didn't work?

221
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,420
- They're, I think they're just a size too small, yeah.

222
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,980
Or like an inch too small.

223
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,340
- Do you wanna use my clogs?

224
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,620
- I don't know.

225
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,380
If anyone, if you, listen, if you're in the New York area

226
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,380
and you have new or equal to or greater skate shoes,

227
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,660
size 11, 11 and a half, if you wanna trade,

228
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,700
if you wanna trade somebody with greater,

229
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,420
it's called psychic driving.

230
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,700
- How's a psychic driving?

231
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,540
- That's not psychic driving at all.

232
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,100
- It's called, and you're gonna give me your shoes

233
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,260
and you're gonna give me your shoes

234
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,380
and you're gonna give me your shoes

235
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,560
and you're gonna give me your shoes

236
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
and you're gonna give me your shoes.

237
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,300
- This is kind of working.

238
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,140
- Yeah.

239
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,380
- Have you guys ever pulled up one of those

240
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,500
sissy hypno videos, see if it works on you?

241
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,700
I watched a bunch of those ones that were like,

242
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
you can find them on YouTube.

243
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,540
- Makes you cry.

244
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,740
(laughing)

245
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,940
Cameron's watched a bunch of those.

246
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,420
- No, that are like the ones that are like hypnosis to,

247
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,460
it'll be like hypnosis to make you the joker

248
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,060
or like hypnosis to make you handle spicy foods.

249
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,420
And then it's like a spiral and it's like,

250
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,620
and they say like, I love spicy foods.

251
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,140
Spicy foods are not that spicy to me.

252
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,980
(laughing)

253
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,420
And it's like plays a bunch of those.

254
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,100
- I do think that I might be the most susceptible

255
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,620
to hypnosis of any person in the world? I'm not. I can't shut up. I can't. The thing

256
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,660
that you need in your brain to shut off and become hypnotized. Intelligence. Oh my God,

257
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:25,300
pound it out. Damn. The thing, I can't stay on one thought. I think I have a genetic advantage

258
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,500
to hypnosis. So people have tried to hypnotize you multiple times and it hasn't worked? Is

259
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,700
that what you're telling me? Yes. Name one time you were attempted to be fucking hypnotized

260
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,580
asshole because I will dude I will right now I'll pay a thousand dollars to get an

261
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,580
expert hypnotist in here right now to prove you wrong. All right then let's do

262
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,240
it. We're gonna get me hypnotized. I will fuck we will we will rent do you rent?

263
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,860
You rent a hypnotist. You can hire one for like an event we could throw like a party.

264
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,700
Three man party. Yeah. With the hypnotist. We'll see if somebody can hypnotize Patrick.

265
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,700
I think half of hypnosis in events like that like it's like oh we're gonna get

266
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
get everyone on the stage.

267
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
- I will say.

268
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,180
- That is like, if I was on the stage

269
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,960
and the guy is like, I'm going to hypnotize this guy

270
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,380
right now and it wasn't working,

271
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,740
I would still do the things 'cause I don't want

272
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,300
that guy to feel like an asshole.

273
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,980
- You think hypnotism's fake?

274
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
- Yes.

275
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,820
- Whoa.

276
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,580
- But I think if you're on the stage

277
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,860
and the hypnotist has to do that shit.

278
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,860
- I think hypnotism is pretty provably real.

279
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,700
- No.

280
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,520
- Yeah.

281
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,720
they've been doing it for since the caveman. Yeah, you're on stage.

282
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,040
You're on the back. Yo back when they started doing hypnotism, yo, they didn't

283
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,560
have they didn't have stages back then. Yeah, so it's not it wasn't a party. I

284
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:49,360
will say I think that I would never have what's happening. I would never have a

285
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,040
hypnotist or a magician do their act for anything less than ten people because I

286
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
feel like you're in danger because like there's not enough people to like yeah

287
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,000
yeah he's got like exactly fucking powers like he's if he's a hypnotist if there's

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
a hypnotist and there's just us three in here with him he could hypnotize all

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,920
three of us so it's like when you it's like we'd be like exactly you have to

290
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,360
think yeah then nobody's gonna stop us we don't have an extra you need a guy

291
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,360
who's wearing those Eclipse glasses so he's immune to yeah or like cotton in

292
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
his ears or something or yeah he has he's caught in his ears but he doesn't you

293
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,040
need someone to just the hypnotist can't see it can't can't tell and the hypnotist

294
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,000
tries to hypnotize the three guys to fuck each other that guy starts to go along

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,280
with it and then he's like psych and he punches the hip maybe trying to

296
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,960
hypnotize me but for my own production I've brought somebody who's completely

297
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:43,160
deaf and blind to just sit here so there's a like they had a hypnotist show

298
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,200
at my high school they like brought in a hypnotist for like a fundraiser and I

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I just remember thinking like everyone here is just doing this for attention.

300
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,420
This is not real.

301
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,420
You were jealous.

302
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
I was jealous.

303
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
You were jealous of the hypnotist.

304
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
I think.

305
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Hypnotist.

306
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,420
One of the.

307
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Maybe.

308
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420
Maybe I was.

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
I don't know.

310
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,560
I was probably jealous that they got to experience magic.

311
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
One of the.

312
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,100
You were jealous that they were controlling a room of high schoolers.

313
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,680
One of the funniest things I read or ever read was like one time my, we got like a Christmas

314
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,760
card like like newsletter type thing from one of my younger siblings, like high

315
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,680
school friends who had like a super rich family, like insanely rich, and it was

316
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,400
like this, like long, like letter of everything that they did that year, and

317
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,240
it was like it was like during cove it they went to like some like tropical

318
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
islands to like where they're like writing about how much a great time they

319
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
had and they're like and they're like and we had like a fantastic birthday

320
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,080
party and we even hired a mentalist.

321
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,280
In 2021, hiring a mentalist.

322
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,280
What is it?

323
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,380
I don't even know what a mentalist is.

324
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,180
Is a British magician.

325
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,680
Okay.

326
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Yeah, it's mental.

327
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,980
Yeah.

328
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
Look at this, it's mental.

329
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm a mentalist.

330
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,680
Look at this, it's fucking mental.

331
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,780
Yeah, my fingers have formed a chain.

332
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,280
There goes my thumb and it's back.

333
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
I've got your nose.

334
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,820
- Oh, I've got your nose in it.

335
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,740
- Yeah.

336
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,980
Mentalism is a performing art in which

337
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,140
its practitioners, known as mentalists,

338
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,700

- Let me take that.

409
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,980
- I don't think you're doing--

410
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,100
you're immune to mentalism. You must be. I think that I might Google how to do

418
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,460

419
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,660
is magician plus pickup artist. Yeah yeah definitely. Hypnosis. And there's that

420
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,260
show the mentalist okay that did a lot they talk about that show at the first

421
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:01,140
okay the first thing here mental list yeah Wow holy fuck now before we get

422
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,620
into these mind-reading tricks I want to note they're just tricks so just keep

423
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,060
that in mind all right they're just tricks okay here's the first trick so

424
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,540
maybe I'll read it out and then one of us can practice it yeah right yeah okay

425
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,540
gray elephants from Denmark this is a simple trick that you can do with any

426
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,420
any audience even just a single friend that's perfect okay. We plug my ears up

427
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,140
now okay good idea now ask that audience to think of a number between one and ten

428
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,620
and multiply it by nine then ask them to add the digits together and subtract

429
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,140
five now here's the crazy part that only you know no matter what the original

430
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,020
number was keep it keep them in their vinyl answer will be for it's just a

431
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,060
funny quirk of math cool right next ask the audience to assign each letter of

432
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,340
the alphabet a number a is one b is to see is three etc tell them to stop when

433
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,580
they reach their number. What you already know is four, so the letter D. Now ask

434
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,100
them to think of a country that begins with their letter, and because there

435
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,360
aren't many countries that start with D, most people will choose Denmark. And then

436
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,660
when you ask them to choose an animal with the next letter of the

437
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,740
alphabet, which for everyone will be E, most people will come up with elephant.

438
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,700
Ask them to think of the color of the animal. Finally, guess out loud that

439
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,100
they're thinking of grey elephants from Denmark. Amazing and simple, right? But

440
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,940
how does it work? Well, I won't say how it works yet. Okay, so try it on. Try it on.

441
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,540
I have to try it? I can't remember all that. Me neither. You have it in front of

442
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,220
you know I'll read it Patrick think of a number between one and two gray

443
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:33,860
elephants from Denver what I read read so many instructions so long so boring

444
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:40,460
funny and you so fucking ruined it completely what you look through your

445
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,300
fingers at boobs when your mom tells you not to huh when you watch movies what

446
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,140
- What just happened?

447
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,260
- You put the hands on your thighs

448
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,300
and then you look through your fingers.

449
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,700
You're a piece of shit.

450
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,660
- That was a mentalism trick.

451
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
- That was not mentalism.

452
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,340
- Here's a mentalism trick.

453
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,160
- That was a mentalism trick.

454
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
- Caleb, Caleb.

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,840
- I knew I would make Caleb angry.

456
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,660
- Caleb.

457
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,500
- Mentalism.

458
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
- Mentalism is not just you do something.

459
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,340
- Yes it is.

460
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,300
- That's kind of what it is.

461
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,140
- Oh yeah.

462
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,100
- That's what most things are.

463
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,940
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

464
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,780
- Oh wait, I wanna do a mentalism on camera.

465
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,600
- No, let me do it.

466
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,440
- I wanna do a mentalism on camera.

467
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,280
- No, I don't want you to do one.

468
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I want to do one from here. I didn't get to do a single one yet. I get to do a

469
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,320
single one. You hold you his soul out of his head. That's not a lism that

470
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,040
sorcery and we found do it on me, whatever I'll be a fucking victim like I

471
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,280
am every okay. We'll just be quiet now. So the trick can work. Think of a shape

472
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,240
like a square, but not a square

473
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,480
okay.

474
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,240
You got you got it now. Think of another shape around the first shape,

475
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,620
okay, and it says amaze them by telling the shapes they were thinking of the

476
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,220
triangle inside the circle.

477
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,340
Nope

478
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:52,400
like a square, but not I just did rectangle. Why would I do triangle? It

479
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,700
makes no sense.

480
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:00,260
This is it says, while you here's a pro tip with this trick, while you ask the

481
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,180
person to think of shit, oh, I forgot to I'm going to start it over. Okay, this

482
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,260
is the I realized I miss part of the instruction. This will this one. I'll do

483
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,480
I'm going to Patrick this time, because you're a yeah okay Patrick think of a

484
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,240
shape that's like a square, but not a square

485
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,060
way circle that's part of it. That's what it says you're not supposed to say

486
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,680
it and then think of a shape around that shape triangle and then it's a circle on

487
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,160
a triangle. This is called subliminal programming part of the thing was that

488
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,520
you draw the shape. That's what it is. Well, you ask the person to think of

489
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,280
shapes discreetly trace the shapes in the air with your hands, subconsciously

490
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,600
planting the image in their mind. It's called subliminal program. Okay, wait,

491
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,920
wait, think of a shape. That's not a square.

492
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,520
Okay,

493
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,820
now think of a shape around that shape.

494
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,920
I

495
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,120
just swastika

496
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,840
- What the hell?

497
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,040
You drew it!

498
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,540
I didn't draw that!

499
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,200
I didn't draw that!

500
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,380
I drew a rhombus and a trapezoid!

501
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,560
- Yeah, that wasn't right.

502
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,120
That was a complete swastika.

503
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,960
- Okay, I have a new mentalistic trick.

504
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,040
- That was a rhombus and a trapezoid, you dumbass!

505
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,280
- What are you talking about?

506
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
You did this and then this.

507
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,280
- No.

508
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,100
- Yes, you did.

509
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,920
- That's a rhombus and then that's a trapezoid.

510
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,880
- You did, what do you mean that and that?

511
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,820
- This.

512
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,280
- Look at, he did it again!

513
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,480
- I didn't draw a swastika in the air.

514
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,320
- You did.

515
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,280
- No, I drew a rhombus and a trapezoid.

516
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,840
- That's fucking, you understand how--

517
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,160
- Your mind is going, look,

518
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,440
but this mentalism trick does not work.

519
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,120
We've disputed, it's caused too much, it's caused--

520
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
- Here's the new mental, I just came up

521
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,480
with a mentalism trick.

522
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,120
- Okay, then go ahead and promise me

523
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
that you won't do it to me. - Okay, think of a guy

524
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,760
in the room that's not me or you,

525
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,160
that's in the room right now.

526
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
- Guy?

527
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,440
- Think of-- - I can't think of one.

528
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
- Oh my God. - Jesus Christ.

529
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
- Whoa. - Our Lord and Savior.

530
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,680
- What's up? - That's it.

531
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,720
- Pound that, pound that out, what's up?

532
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,320
Nope get it get it. No okay, okay all right and okay yeah and then think of

533
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,240
what he's sitting in.

534
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,040
Were you thinking of Patrick in a chair? I actually fucking was him that's

535
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,320
fucked up, but that's that was a trick. I've turned around. I think that that

536
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,400
mentalism trick works. Think of your favorite color. Okay, now tell me what

537
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,080
your favorite color is red. So now think of your favorite color thinking of it is

538
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,360
it red. Yeah, yeah, holy shit man. Wow think of your favorite food spaghetti.

539
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,360
Do you want to eat that? No. I just ate it before. Does it make you hungry, thinking

540
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:43,360
about it? No. Have you eaten it before? No. No? My favorite food is Gobstoppers.

541
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,720
Have you eaten Gobstopper? No. Not the one I'm thinking of. Mine's the chocolate cake

542
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,120
from Matilda. Huh? Oh, the chocolate cake from Matilda? That is a deep, dark

543
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,580
chocolate cake and I never ate it before that cake was so deliciously black I

544
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,160
wanted to that's what I was kind of a mentalist she forced him to eat the

545
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,960
whole cake Oh boo-hoo I have to eat a whole cake plus I'm the fat kid of the

546
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,960
movie yeah who cares I know you got to eat the best

547
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,880
cake of all time yeah I don't know what he was like a short

548
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,960
character right now here's Torta sorry what Schwartz Schwartz relative the

549
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,240
Kirsch Torta the fuck is that Schwartz read the Kirsch Torta what is that will

550
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
tell me instead of just saying it?

551
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Schwarzfeld, you're stupid.

552
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Is this a mentalist trick to me?

553
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Where you mentally fucking annoy me?

554
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Look at that cake.

555
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Is this the cake from Matilda?

556
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
The cake from Matilda.

557
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Yeah, it looks super good.

558
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
It looks so delicious. Look at that.

559
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Oh, and that kid ate poop.

560
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
Oh my god, that's probably the best looking cake in the world.

561
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Is it kind of insinuated

562
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
that there's poop in that cake?

563
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
I feel like that's a fair assumption.

564
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,740
assumption a little bit. I don't think there's supposed to be poop in the

565
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,640
Bruce cake. The Bruce cake? That's his name. The cake's named after him? Well, I

566
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,380
guess the kid's name is Bruce. Well, it's probably because it's Trunchbull's

567
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,680
personal cake, and he steals a slice. Yeah. Oh, true. So, it's whatever is in

568
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,240
there, she likes to eat too. So, she's, I mean, and she's a naughty bitch. Yeah.

569
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,760
She's probably got some poop in it. Absolutely. And with a name like

570
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,500
Miss Trunchbull. Yeah. Oh, it says at one point Miss Trunchbull even mentions that

571
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,000
the cook's sweat and blood went into this cake. That's oh yeah, that's what I

572
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,400
remember as a kid is that it really grossed me out that she says that. Yeah.

573
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,100
Even though there's nothing inherently scary about it besides the blatant child

574
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,800
abuse.

575
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, hey, if eating a chocolate cake is child abuse, abuse me. Yeah, abuse the

576
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,800
fuck out of me, mom. Come on, fucking abuse me.

577
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,200
I do wish that I'd gotten more abuse as a kid. I'd probably be so good at

578
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,040
something. Yeah, that's what I mean. Like all of the best people at anything got

579
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,640
fucking owned. I'd probably be so good at piano or something. Also a lot of the homeless people also got abused as kids.

580
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,680
There's two ways to go. They got abused as adults. Maybe you have a

581
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,320
sweet spot. They got abused by society. Like whatever the Michael Jackson spot is, that's

582
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,520
that's going to make you a fucking brilliant musician and artist.

583
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Yeah.

584
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:19,880
I mean, I remember I watched, there's like a biopic about the Jacksons as a kid and I

585
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,120
remember seeing that on VH1 and there's just a scene where it's like Joe Jackson makes

586
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,440
them go outside and get the stick to, they have to pick out the stick to beat people

587
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
up.

588
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Oh yeah, that's a common, classic thing.

589
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,360
I remember seeing that and being like, damn.

590
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,320
Do kids ever get abused and then grow up to become like brilliant

591
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,280
mathematicians or scientists or is it all artists?

592
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
All artists.

593
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
Albert Einstein.

594
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
He wasn't abused, he was an abuser.

595
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,200
That's true, he abused the world when he created the E=mc2.

596
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,720
Can you imagine being the Jackson's like neighbor growing up and just hearing

597
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,760
just like beautiful singing and kids getting the shit beat out of them all

598
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
day long?

599
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Yeah.

600
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,760
It's like hey, I like the singing but the screaming, the screaming I hate.

601
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,600
- I hate it. - What do you do

602
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,280
without all the screaming, dude?

603
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm real, listen.

604
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,240
- And where am I, you're completely destroying my tree.

605
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
- Yeah. (laughing)

606
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,960
- There's no sticks in the backyard anymore.

607
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,600
- I can't even, I have no kindling,

608
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,920
'cause you're making your kids go out there

609
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,760
and get all my sticks. - And I'm not sure

610
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
it's worth it, okay?

611
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,960
Can I borrow a cup of milk?

612
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
Your kids have beautiful voices,

613
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,320
and stop burning them with the stove, please.

614
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,200
- Rockin' Robin, I love that.

615
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
- I bet-- - Now Dad Stop It,

616
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,680
I don't wanna hear that. - I bet even their cries

617
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,720
screams for help were actually beautiful. Oh yeah yeah I mean how do you think he

618
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,480
got that beautiful falsetto voice? Yep yeah that's where he developed the

619
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,440
the leaning technique he's leaning out of the way. Yeah he's leaning forward.

620
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,440
He's leaning yeah to avoid the spanking. Yeah yeah maybe if he's going in the

621
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,120
perfect spanking position. No because he was escaping it. All right yeah. How many

622
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,880
Jackson kids are there? There's like a hundred. I think there might be five now

623
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:10,200
that I think about it. No, no, because there's a,

624
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,560
because there's Latoya and Janet. So I think there's probably like seven or eight.

625
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,680
Was Janet not in the Jackson five? No, no, no, no. The Jackson five was all boys.

626
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,960
I don't know. Yeah. What do you mean? It's, it's, it's five girls.

627
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,600
No, it's Tito. Have you not heard the songs? It's five girls. Tito Jackson,

628
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:37,120
Michael, Jermaine, Charizard, and Bulpy.

629
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
Yeah, Bulpy Jackson, yeah.

630
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,720
Bulpy Jackson, he's saying all the low notes.

631
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,640
Janet is that slut from the Super Bowl, right?

632
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:46,880
Yeah.

633
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
Ruined Justin Timberlake's career.

634
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
Ruined Justin Timberlake's career.

635
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,960
Tried to destroy a good man who wears a suit and tie.

636
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
He wears, he loves his suit and tie.

637
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,140
(laughing)

638
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
- He's a gentleman.

639
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,020
- That's such a funny fucking song.

640
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,860
- Yeah.

641
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,680
- Yeah.

642
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,760
- Suit and tie.

643
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,960
- Dude, so fucking--

644
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,800
- What a boss, dude.

645
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,620
- Yeah.

646
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,460
- Yeah.

647
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
- Especially making that when it,

648
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,040
like in like 2013 or whatever.

649
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,880
- Yeah.

650
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,300
- So like that, if he did come out with that song

651
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,100
in like 2004, I feel like that would have been way better

652
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,320
because like the guys at the time who were like,

653
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
like guys who would wear like vests to clubs and shit.

654
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,040
- Yeah.

655
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,860
- That makes sense.

656
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,760
- He, it kind of started that thing.

657
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,960
of like yeah fedora vest guy fedora vest like flare jeans yeah and like he's a

666
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,620
my earliest memories I think that's my remember I remember it too I think

Kevin standing up and going that's a fucking pity dude that was a that was a

669
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,540
That's a great day. I remember I think my great grandpa died the day after the day

670
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,060
before

671
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:36,720
and that's the only reason I remember. That's a great day to use. Yeah. I saw my

672
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,420
first boob in my grandpa. Dude, my great grandpa sucked. Everyone hated him, bro.

673
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:48,740
So it was like one, two great things happening, boobs on TV, looking. Grandpa

674
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,320
does. Remember, there's like kids upstairs. They probably just heard me

675
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,300
scream that's a fucking titty yeah. This is going to be their first memory

676
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,700
a monster in the basement yeah, that's scary guy in the basement.

677
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,700
I wonder what they feel spider webs on I'm like a monster

678
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,120
the spider monster in the

679
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,700
two weeks ago. He was yelling about eight legged bug.

680
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,920
You're an actual fucking spider monster.

681
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,840
I think subliminally I accidentally made myself get a spider tattoo when I wrote that beautiful

682
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
song.

683
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,960
I think you might be some kind of spider man.

684
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,120
No, that doesn't sound right.

685
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Man spider.

686
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
What's that, there's that Cure song?

687
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,720
Is that song by the Cure where he says like, "The spider man is having me for dinner"?

688
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
What?

689
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Yeah.

690
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
It's like having you over?

691
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,560
- Yeah, Peter Parker's having you over?

692
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
- Yeah, that's my fucking dream play date.

693
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,600
- Well, that song came out after Spider-Man

694
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,000
had been in the public conscious for years.

695
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,800
- The public conscious?

696
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
- The public conscious. - The public conscience.

697
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,680
- I feel like now more than ever,

698
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,400
I feel like there's a grace period in the past

699
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,480
where you could say Spider-Man

700
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,640
and there's a benefit of the doubt

701
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,660
that you mean a Spider-Man monster,

702
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,360
like a half-Spider, half-Man.

703
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,280
I don't think maybe superheroes were as popular.

704
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,120
- Sounds like a lullaby. - I think they were nerds.

705
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,740
Yeah, right when I realized with fright that the spider-man is having me for dinner tonight

706
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:32,140
That is such a scary line. That is too scary on candy-stripe legs the spider-man comes. Oh, then yeah

707
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,500
Yeah, I love the cure so much. I don't even know what the cure is. It's a band

708
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,480
I don't know where they act out there a band that dress up like Edward Scissorhands

709
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,440
like girls but they sing about boy problems. Yeah it's oddly weird. Yeah that

710
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,600
was that's so funny like when I when I was growing up I thought that The Cure

711
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,480
was like that band Christian Death. Like I feel like in my head like I was like

712
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,720
like the way that my parents and shit talked about it was like yeah only like

713
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,520
emos who like dark stuff listen to them and then I listen to The Cure. Yeah

714
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,680
it's like exactly you think they're like they're like MCR or something. Yeah exactly.

715
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,840
You think like I actually swag as fuck like have you like like what's that fucking uh

716
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,560
like that was that Christian death song where he's like in a sea of incest like I thought

717
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,440
it was like shit like that like I thought they were gonna sing about weird crazy shit

718
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,160
but actually said it's legal to have a band called Christian death yep I bet you if that

719
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,200
guess what if that band was called Muslim or atheist death I bet they'd be banned in

720
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,880
every fucking country in the world. They'd be banned everywhere. Yep. And guess what?

721
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,080
Guess what else they say in there? What? First line of the song Romeo's Distress. No, I don't

722
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,440
want to hear it. Well, I can't say what they say. Why? It's the worst swear of all. They

723
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,160
say the worst cuss possible? They say the worst cuss possible and it's about a, it's

724
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,360
on someone's lawn. No way. They say the F word? They pull a... Nope. Marilyn Manson did

725
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,760
that to say yeah shit that is funny to do somebody starts being like saying the

726
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,360
n-word you say like can we just not cuss and you didn't leave the cussing you're

727
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,280
saying the ultimate swear can you just not fucking do a super cuss yeah there

728
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,960
is cusses and then they're super cusses got GD is a super cuss yeah yeah all

729
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,240
right GD is just it's worse dude it's taking the fucking Lord's name in vain

730
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,120
guys I need to get to the list oh yeah we need to stop listen we need us to know

731
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,320
No, we didn't. That would barely count as a list. Okay, don't try and cheat the

732
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,720
listeners. All right. Here, because I don't know about you, but I don't think

733
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,920
a mentalism trick is going to hold up much longer. Yeah. I think that maybe we

734
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,320
should kind of stop doing this kind of, you know, childish mentalism, pseudoscience

735
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,120
kind of bullshit. I'm honestly fucking over juvenile shit. Yeah, and I might want

736
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,120
to get a little more mature. That's why I was talking about music. I just want to be

737
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,220
immature and kind of

738
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:03,720
mature. I'm less interested in potty mouth. I won't even say be a say I'll say

739
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,760
gobbledygook. Do people actually think that PP poopoo shit fart asshole fucking

740
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,200
come piss balls tits nipples mouth tits ass and shit piss on my ass and shit on

741
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,480
my face is actually interesting to listen to. I sincerely I'm not I hate that

742
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm not laughing, but it's actually disgusting. That's why I've brought a

743
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,200
more kind of mature and educated type of list today. Top 10 weirdest facts.

744
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,800
Because I've been into facts lately. I don't know about you guys. You are a bit of a factoid.

745
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,960
Yeah, well no factoid is actually, what would you call someone

746
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,200
who's into facts? I'm more of a scholar. I would refer to myself as such.

747
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,880
I'm more of a schooler because I love to go to school. I love school too.

748
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,760
yeah school I won't hey I won't say it's it's bussin because that's you know

749
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,200
that's a bit childish to say. I would say it's excellent. You know in women these days I would say

750
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,240
I'd say yo my sandwich excellent excellent mm-hmm I would say that our

751
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,440
past behaviors were quite elementary absolutely and sophomoric yeah to say to

752
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,560
say the least. Completely prehistoric. To say the least on the matter yeah oh my god medieval yeah

753
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,000
downright medieval. To say the least. To say the least. Our past behavior definitely very

754
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:27,840
very childish. To say the least. Yeah preschool-ish. Preschool-esque. Yeah to say the least.

755
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,240
To say the very least. To say the very least. So give me a fact. Okay number one

756
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,560
number one weirdest fact. More than nine hundred and fifty Beatles can live in a

757
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,160
sloth's fur at one time. Wow and and that is not the musicians. That's far more than

758
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
than I anticipated.

759
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,880
- Yeah, I thought at the very least--

760
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,600
- My estimations would be greatly lesser.

761
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
- Greatly lesser.

762
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,000
- Greatly lesser, to say the least.

763
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
- I would have had lesser expectations,

764
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
but actually it more to my expectations.

765
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,720
- Well, speaking of lesser and greater comparisons,

766
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,280
we have a comment here from a fellow fact scholar

767
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,360
that says, "That's still less than the amount

768
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,400
"of beetles in my bed."

769
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,480
- Oh, they're having a laugh.

770
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,640
- This person needs, I mean, we have to take it

771
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,720
at face value, Patrick.

772
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,320
not everybody's as juvenile and goofy as we used to be.

773
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,160
- That's true.

774
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,720
- You know, maybe they're actually telling the truth

775
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,160
and they're in dire need of--

776
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,280
- They could live in an impoverished country.

777
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
- An exterminator.

778
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,400
- Yeah.

779
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,120
- Gosh, that bed must be mighty uncomfortable.

780
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,940
- Absolutely.

781
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,160
- Uncomfortable.

782
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,660
- I can hardly imagine laying my head down at night

783
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,400
to find it is hitting over 900 beetles.

784
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,800
- Over 900?

785
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,040
Over 900, yeah.

786
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,800
yes, greater than nine hundred lesser than nine thousand. Yep, here's another

787
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,440
comment from venomous killing machine. I have a scary yet advanced username.

788
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,240
That is why slots are slow, so an animal scientist here. I guess I like since

789
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,200
they're weighed down by all the beetles. Yeah, lots of beetles wait. At that

790
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,740
point, aren't they like it's like a jellyfish like they're just a bunch of

791
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,840
shit moving as one. They're just a beetle. They're only beetles. Yeah, at

792
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
a jellyfish.

793
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Like a jellyfish?

794
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,640
You know a jellyfish is a bunch of little organisms together.

795
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,760
It's not just one thing.

796
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
That's not true.

797
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Yeah it is.

798
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
What are you talking about?

799
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Jellyfish is a bunch of stuff.

800
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Everything's a bunch of stuff.

801
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,520
You don't have to say that about anybody.

802
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,240
No but jellyfish is a bunch of little things.

803
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
I'm a bunch of stuff.

804
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
He's about to lose his scholarly card.

805
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,760
I have my feet, my knees, my balls and penis.

806
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Look it up.

807
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,120
At Google are jellyfish a bunch of things?

808
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,080
Of course everything's a bunch of things.

809
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,720
That's simply an elemental fact of the universe.

810
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Nope.

811
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
I'm going to prove you wrong.

812
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,960
Okay, it seems we're having a bit of spirited debate.

813
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,960
We're having a fact-off.

814
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,720
A fact-off is most fascinating to my sensibilities.

815
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,600
Well, what doth...

816
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,280
What doth thou say?

817
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:04,200
What doth thy handheld device...

818
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,480
says it's not a fish yeah yeah it's an invertebrate it's an invertebrates I

819
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,660
think you're a fool he called me an invertebrate what a childish insult he's

820
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,920
he's dragging himself down into the mud with these kind of schoolyard insults

821
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,160
that I'm far above and I will not be retaliating in color I know a sea slug

822
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,480
maybe I'm not a scholar it can a derm or anything of the maybe I'm not a scholar

823
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
dollar, but a writer and an artist.

824
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
Interesting.

825
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
An artist.

826
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,040
Hard to get much more childish than that.

827
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Nuh-uh.

828
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
And I'm past fist bumps now.

829
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
We do it.

830
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
You're past handshakes.

831
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
We're doing handshakes instead of fist bumps now.

832
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,880
Okay, well I'm actually throwing up different kinds of gang signs with one hand at one time.

833
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Look at that.

834
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
How barbaric.

835
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,880
It's not.

836
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
You think gangs are barbaric?

837
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,040
Wow, hold on.

838
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,360
You think it's actually barbaric to be in an awesome gang like me?

839
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,680
I think it's barbaric to move your hand in any way other than on a calculator.

840
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,280
Also, I'm the writer and the singer of the gang and you still think it's fucking barbaric

841
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
that I'm making music?

842
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,120
You're a music-- I'm an engineer.

843
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,520
Your music is more like dissonant noises.

844
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,840
You're about to get dissonant noises.

845
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,280
I just made a train.

846
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,760
You didn't make a train, dude.

847
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm an engineer.

848
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
You're just being a faker.

849
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
He built an elevator.

850
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
You're just a faker, okay?

851
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,860
He's not-- Whoa, whoa.

852
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,520
You are out of control with the insults.

853
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,320
It's-- Listen, I know we're doing a thing-- No, I'm not, idiot.

854
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,220
But this is this is beyond. This is beyond the pale

855
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:37,160
You're beyond the pale. You're just damn white. Oh my god. Oh wait. I'm an engineer. You're not an engineer

856
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,840
He's an engineer stop saying he's not an okay to prove it do make anything

857
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,400
We couldn't even get through one fact without going back to being childish. I made that I think I've changed my ways

858
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,600
He didn't make that I

859
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,680
Made that you didn't

860
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,960
I put the lens on the camera.

861
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,240
- That's not making anything.

862
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,320
- I made the lens bigger.

863
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,760
- What's the next fact?

864
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Are we done?

865
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,000
- Speaking of, if you are the tenant of the--

866
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,240
- I've grown out of my childish artistic phase.

867
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,420
- If you are the tenant of my old apartment,

868
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,080
I know you stole my camera lens.

869
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,220
I got it delivered to your house

870
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,100
and I asked if I could have it back

871
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,560
and you said, "I saw it in the hallway,

872
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,220
but it was definitely opened and it wasn't.

873
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,800
And I have not contacted the eBay seller.

874
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,760
So this is a message to the tenant of my old apartment.

875
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,100
I have declared war on you.

876
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,460
- Now talk about barbaric.

877
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,780
- I'm declaring war on you right now.

878
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,060
That was a $30 lens that I bought for a camera

879
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,900
and I'm declaring war.

880
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,980
and we can end the episode here.

881
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,480
Continue camera.

882
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,980
What's the next fact number two is the Eiffel Tower gets repainted every seven

883
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,780
years. That's not true. It's not true. Okay. We would see the paint. Yeah.

884
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,680
Yep. Well, it says it says here's a comment from a fellow scholar very

885
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,380
effort pushing indeed. I was thinking the same thing that is very very

886
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,500
insanely effort-pushing of them yeah it's normal to repaint this tower if

887
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,120
people wouldn't repaint it this tower will lose its color Eiffel Tower is

888
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,860
useless to be honest many people from Paris hate it what color is the Eiffel

889
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:36,040
Tower gray no with a certain scene it's iron color right it's like brown it's

890
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,060
made out of copper right and that's why it's green because when they bring it to

891
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,680
America when they brought it to green the Eiffel Tower the Eiffel Tower used to

892
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,280
be copper thing of the Statue of Liberty. No, no statue of Liberty was made out of

893
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,320
green play-doh. No the green the Eiffel Tower they didn't bring the Eiffel Tower

894
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:58,160
to America it's in Paris. That's not oh it's the color of the Eiffel Tower is a

895
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,000
color called Eiffel Tower Brown. I knew it was brown I'm a genius. It's called

896
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,440
Eiffel Tower Brown. It says since 1968 the choice has been a fairly neutral

897
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,440
color made up of three shades of brown called Eiffel Tower Brown. Oh they do

898
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
they change the color of it over the years.

899
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Wow, look at this.

900
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,000
In the 1800s it was red and then it turned yellow.

901
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And now it's...

902
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Look at...

903
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Why'd they turn it brown?

904
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
What the fuck?

905
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,160
It was yellow?

906
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
The red and yellow look so much better than the brown.

907
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
What the fuck?

908
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,120
Is there any pictures of that?

909
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,520
Here's a painting of it as red.

910
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,880
Yeah, it's called...

911
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,320
They painted the Eiffel Toilet...

912
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
It was...

913
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Eiffel Toilet.

914
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Eiffel Toilet.

915
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:46,560
toilet yeah they painted the Eiffel Tower yellow and brown because no don't even

916
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,960
don't even don't go say that take it down we're done with that kind of come up

917
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,000
with some other reason why because you have to finish your sentence because

918
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:02,080
those are the bronze medals that's sophisticated say something about gold

919
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,560
and bronze don't I see your eyes I stop thinking about a toilet you don't say

920
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:17,240
anything about why did they do it yellow because you burn come on come on you got

921
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,280
this is when someone becomes an Eiffel tap no no I'm not gonna say because when

922
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,240
someone becomes an Eiffel Tower you put the thing that makes yellow in their

923
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,280
brown I'm not gonna say that good don't say as long as you don't say that then

924
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,440
we're fine that would be and plus it's not even that well thought out yeah who

925
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,020
knows what because it's a full tower me when when someone becomes doing the

926
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,200
Eiffel Tower that's what you're doing the Eiffel Tower as a as a sex position does

927
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,140
not really mean a sex either but it can it can definitely but it doesn't see

928
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:59,760
that's why it's not that's why it's juvenile yeah you could let it fly but

929
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,760
The fact that there's so many caveats that you can't really do it.

930
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I hate caveats.

931
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Me too.

932
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
I fucking hate caveats.

933
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,760
Yeah.

934
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Yeah.

935
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,240
The fact that there's so many caveats is just, I mean, I just, you know, I want to apologize.

936
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
Thank you.

937
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
That's very adult of you.

938
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,840
But I don't apologize to the people I'm declaring war on.

939
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,240
Number three, is there are about three pounds, 1.4 kilograms, kilograms, I apologize, of

940
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,720
bacteria living in your stomach.

941
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,000
I have way more than that, I think.

942
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,320
I have 60 or 70 pounds of bacteria.

943
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,360
Yeah, I'm all bacteria. Yeah, I'm a bunch of stuff isn't aren't you supposed to have bacteria in your stomach?

944
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:40,340
And yeah, he's taking care all this cheeseburger gut flora. Mm-hmm. Isn't that a cool name? Yep, and you have

945
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,320
Biome, yeah, you have a whole biome in there and if you drink

946
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:50,680
Really nasty thick yogurt. I love it. I love that stuff so much me too. Oh my god

947
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:57,960
I mean, it's basically just fucking damn fear. Yeah, so good for I always said key for somebody told me it's not pronounced

948
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,460
way it's pronounced kaffir never in my life am I gonna call it I know I that

949
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:05,340
was the first time I ever said it and I feel I feels wrong it is wrong I have so

950
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,960
much they call me kaffir Sutherland that was actually pretty airtight that was

951
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:17,320
honestly the wordplay that you just exhibited I'm like Mo Rocca yes and PR

952
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,480
humorous - Mo Rocca mm-hmm okay here's a comment from somebody we've seen before

953
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,160
still less than the number of bacteria on my bed.

954
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,840
This person has quite a disgusting bed. I mean you have to take it at the face

955
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,120
value. Their bed is the disgust quotient must be off the chart. Damn near

956
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,560
unsleepable this bed. Believe me. Absolutely.

957
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,280
Number four mullets are illegal in Iran.

958
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,880
Now this

959
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,360
now this just makes no sense. They've lost me okay.

960
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,200
Iran has officially gone too far. Iran you have gone too far. Well I have good

961
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,680
news. And I have

962
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,640
we're declaring a war. I'm going to invade you and I'm going to kill every single person in your country.

963
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,080
Guys before we decide on this it says they were illegal thirty years ago I'm from

964
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,200
Iran and I have a mullet. Oh okay.

965
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,280
Alright well that's fine Iran. Okay I take back the war. We're gonna, I'm not gonna

966
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:20,040
invade you and kill everyone. I take back all the wars I've started. Here's a comment. So Elvis couldn't have flushed himself

967
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:28,320
to Iran now that's just funny so Elvis tried to flush away I died on the toilet

968
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,360
yes okay so this is he got his butt got sucked out like in that story but yeah

969
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,880
yeah like guts yeah it was this is this is a perfect example of a non sequitur

970
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,840
which is just something that's just so weird it has to make you laugh yeah

971
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,400
that's basically non sequitur is probably my favorite kind of humor say

972
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,060
Okay, speaking egg, speaking of non sequitur

973
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:52,740
hello.

974
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,500
Hello, my name is an egg. My name is egg and two eggs. I'm three eggs old.

975
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,980
I'm hungry for four eggs,

976
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,660
scrambled

977
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,960
scrambled eggs. What's this next one here? It's me a speaking of non

978
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,780
sequitur odontophobia is the fear of teeth.

979
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,580
Okay, that's suitably random for the midpoint on this list. I mean like the

980
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:23,900
sequence t fear of teeth in what way I'm afraid of teeth of teeth being shot into

981
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,700
me by some kind of tooth gun. I would be afraid of all my teeth having a disease

982
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:33,920
that killed me to my that might scare me. You're just showing me a picture of

983
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,980
Mo Rocca non sequitur the master of non sequitur non sequitur Patrick actually is

984
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,540
the master of non-sequitur. No, no, no, no, no. Mo Rocca is. I would say that you are. Yeah, you

985
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,220
definitely are. Yeah. Check this out. You spent two minutes of the episode talking

986
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:54,420
about a package that you didn't get delivered to your house. It got delivered

987
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,780
to my old house and they... Master of non-sequitur. It's not non-sequitur, that's

988
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,620
an anecdote. It's a non-sequitur. It's a non-sequitur anecdote. Because it has no

989
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,260
sequitur to my life. I think we could maybe have some interesting discussion on number six

990
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:17,060
perhaps. Number six fact is a Korean man married a pillow. Why does what is the

991
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:21,280
his what is his nationality matter to me? Well that's what someone says here.

992
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,220
Why does it have to say Korean? It's just weird for anybody to marry a

993
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,540
pillow. But that's what I call desperate. They must have had some very soft pillow

994
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,300
babies with heads. It's just making dolls. I think I've seen a picture of this guy

995
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:37,580
and he looked pretty happy. I'm not too upset about this fact basically. Yeah

996
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:43,900
either it's definitely it's certainly a fact no questionally effect what are you

997
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:50,180
doing I'm sorry I'm really busy right now you are just useless do they do the

998
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:56,140
blowjob with that open space in the pillows cover you this is just I don't

999
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:01,020
like this yeah it's you you have to chill no this is the worst is my

1000
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,660
You're ruining it. You're ruining it. You're showing pictures on a podcast.

1001
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:10,060
You're so stupid. I hate sleeping, so I hate pillows. That's probably the bed

1002
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,460
person. Oh yeah. Yeah, they probably... I have one thousand pillows in my bed.

1003
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:19,020
Yeah. Now yeah, here's a comment that I think gets the wrong idea from this

1004
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,120
fact. Ew, Korean is weird. Yeah, that's the... That's not the weird part of the

1005
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:30,020
fact. Yeah, they stopped... A Korean man. Whoa, what a crazy fact. What a strange

1006
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,700
That's Korean men, oh my god.

1007
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,460
Number seven, a girl ate nothing but chicken nuggets for 15 years.

1008
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,260
Have you guys seen that guy who he, the video--

1009
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,260
The big mac guy?

1010
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,460
No, the video that YouTube tries to make everyone watch that's like, if you, this guy eats mac

1011
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,740
and cheese every meal and has for 20 years or whatever.

1012
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,740
No, I have not.

1013
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,740
I haven't seen that.

1014
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
I just--

1015
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
I watched that video and I got--

1016
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,740
I think it's so made up.

1017
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,500
just literally just like made that up so that Vice would make a video about him.

1018
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,100
That guy I mean I did see as soon as I saw the guy I did I watched that video

1019
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:11,620
and as soon as I saw the guy I got so angry I shut it off just just by how he

1020
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,540
was talking. Yeah. I could tell that he talks with the mac and cheese in his

1021
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,140
mouth and I was hearing the noise in my head of somebody talking with like

1022
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,060
Kraft mac and cheese in their mouth like like you know. He does Velveeta he

1023
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:29,820
he may he doesn't do craft yes I was like really cheesy yeah gooey and thick oh I

1024
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:38,420
I do I I'm not gonna say what he's about to vomit he's about to puke yeah I mean

1025
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:43,260
I mean we don't talk about puke many of them sucking your balls with mac and

1026
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:50,140
cheese in his mouth okay I'm imagining that yeah so coming wouldn't that be

1027
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,700
be awesome. Same texture, let me so awesome to come.

1028
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,860
Here's a comment that sounds like my friend. I'm a five grader and I have a

1029
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,140
friend in Raphael and he brings lunch from home every day and he always has

1030
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:03,660
dino nuggies. That's the only thing he's eating for a quarter and a half. The

1031
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,900
only thing other than dino chicken nuggets is that he has eight in this

1032
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,060
school year is probably a turkey sandwich. Once I wouldn't be surprised

1033
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:15,180
if he broke the record, I ate dino nuggies last night. I actually did too

1034
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,340
Really?

1035
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,340
Yeah.

1036
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,340
Whoa.

1037
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:23,740
My mom gave me a big giant bag of them and I haven't touched them and I didn't feel like

1038
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:24,940
going out to buy food.

1039
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,060
Yeah, I was in a very similar situation.

1040
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,220
I'm not sure if I've ever eaten dino chicken nuggets in my life.

1041
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,220
Really?

1042
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,220
Yeah.

1043
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,220
They're not so good.

1044
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,220
I don't believe you.

1045
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,220
I truly don't believe you.

1046
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,220
I've eaten chicken nuggets a bunch.

1047
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,340
I don't think I ever got, my parents never got the...

1048
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,340
Purdue dino chicken nuggets?

1049
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,540
No, I've never got the dino chicken nuggets.

1050
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,100
Oh, I've never eaten a sandwich.

1051
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,100
I never got...

1052
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,100
You haven't?

1053
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,100
That's very strange.

1054
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,880
even like a brand or type of that's like a very large swath of food. That's a fucking

1055
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,380
crazy thing to say. I don't know why you would say you haven't eaten a sandwich. I've seen

1056
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,380
you eat a sandwich. Yeah, you ate a sandwich right before you recorded it. He's saying

1057
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,380
he didn't eat chicken nuggets that are dinosaur shaped. That's exactly what I said. Yeah, but

1058
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:59,580
then you said that you haven't eaten a sandwich. Which is way crazier. Which is way fucking

1059
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,340
crazier. Yeah, because we saw you eat one. I've never eaten blue cheese. That's what

1060
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,540
you sound like. Okay. What? I don't know what you're trying to do. You've never eaten blue

1061
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:15,060
cheese either? Or a sandwich? I saw you eat blue cheese with the cheese crew. Shh. I don't

1062
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,700
I mean well you weren't part of the cheese crew yeah yeah nobody knows the

1063
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,780
members of our things because I obviously that nobody knows you wasn't eating

1064
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,260
cheese with the cheese crew you were eating cheese of the cheese crew no but

1065
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,300
no you were eating no listen you were eating cheese with the cheese the cheese

1066
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,700
crew is there who is not any of us yeah we were with them which we are not some

1067
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,260
kind of secret cheese crew who rolls around the reason we were eat all the

1068
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,060
cheese and the reason that we were eating with the cheese with the cheese

1069
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,140
crews you're trying to fight them off you're trying to eat the cheese before

1070
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,960
they could eat it that's right the most noble thing you do when the cheese

1071
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,840
crews coming around and we're just yeah that's that and that's it the cheese

1072
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,440
crews coming around and me and my two friends we're just gonna really quickly

1073
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,140
eat all the cheese so that they don't get to have it okay we're kind of an

1074
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,900
anti cheese crew all right you have to give us all the cheese

1075
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,940
right now the cheese is not safe okay the cheese crew they're like locusts the

1076
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,380
cheese is gonna eat the table cheese okay so we don't know I don't see it as

1077
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:15,980
us three who are not the cheese crew okay but we did form because we have similar

1078
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:22,260
heights and builds to the cheese crew and we can fight them these are our anti

1079
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,860
cheese crew costumes that we wear yep and there's no and and the pockets on my

1080
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,700
pants are not lined with plastic bags so that I can fit more cheese into them

1081
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,780
that's right have cheese on the go yep yep I'm just in the army and one of the

1082
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:44,020
The cheese crew members who doesn't look anything like me have maybe does not

1083
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,060
definitely does not have a giant butterfly net that they used to capture

1084
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:54,660
the cheese. That's right and there's not a car that has big parmesan wheels.

1085
00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:01,300
Mm-hmm yeah and it's not and it's not if there is where is we drive it is not the

1086
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,340
cheese crew we drive if you see us driving that car it's because we stole it

1087
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,180
from the cheese crew.

1088
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,020
- Yep.

1089
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:07,840
- To try and stop them from getting around.

1090
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,260
- And when we eat the cheese,

1091
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,500
which we're not the cheese crew,

1092
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,240
but when we eat the cheese to keep it from the cheese crew,

1093
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,140
it doesn't make the sound of a wood chipper

1094
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,200
and have cheese filings fly everywhere

1095
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,060
as we eat it with our big buck teeth.

1096
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,420
- Exactly, and we don't eat the cheese filings afterwards.

1097
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,660
- And there's no mouse.

1098
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,500
- There's no mouse.

1099
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,140
And also a way to stop us is not to put a giant piece

1100
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,900
of cheese on a big mouse trap that could fit three friends.

1101
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,740
- Yep.

1102
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,500
and listen if after we don't live in a hole in a wall, if after we eat the

1103
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,140
cheese to keep away the cheese crew, our body is shaped like a giant wedge of

1104
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,520
cheese. That's normal. That's what happens when you eat. It doesn't

1105
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,780
necessarily mean that we are the cheese crew. No, the cheese that might also

1106
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,020
happen in the cheese crew, but it happens to anyone who eats a lot of

1107
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,860
cheese. Yeah, the cheese crew.

1108
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:59,300
We don't even know. Yeah, I don't even know we're talking about right now

1109
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,520
- Cheese.

1110
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,600
- From a wedding.

1111
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1112
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,000
- A lot.

1113
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,640
- A lot of cheese.

1114
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,600
- From a wedding.

1115
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,880
- From a wedding. - A lot.

1116
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,920
- I'm thinking of being--

1117
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,560
- Oh, we don't know each other.

1118
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,080
No, we just happen to walk up all,

1119
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,520
and all snapping our fingers together, right?

1120
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,080
- We just happen to perfectly surround this cheese table.

1121
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,280
- Oh, nice to meet you.

1122
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,160
I see you snap your fingers too.

1123
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,600
- Oh, yes, oh, you snap your fingers

1124
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,640
while you approach the cheese table?

1125
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,760
- Oh, do you like cheese?

1126
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,600
- You could say that.

1127
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,720
- I kind of like cheese.

1128
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,680
- Are you also snapping your fingers?

1129
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,780
well, i think i remember we drove to the wedding together, but we don't know each other

1130
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
no, not that i remember

1131
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,780

1132
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,780
that was on the big yellow shuttle

1133
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,980
yeah, we were in the same car

1134
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,280
which was not yellow, it's not called the cheddar bus

1135
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,440
oh, i remember, we rappelled into this wedding together

1136
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
oh, from the ceiling

1137
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,600
from the giant yellow helicopter

1138
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,920
yeah, i remember now, that's where i recognize you from

1139
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,920
do you want to eat this cheese with me?

1140
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,920

1143
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:05,820
caution. It's a different shade of yellow yeah and it has holes in it, then

1144

1146
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,740
episodes later and it's not she's only there for one episode like the venus de

1147
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,560
high low and then the fans demanded that she be cancelled out of the show yeah

00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,540
eight mile in the cheese screw the Romans used crushed mouse brains as

1151
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,340
toothpaste really yeah that's probably the most horrific thing. Why don't you

1152
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:50,960

1156
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,880

1157
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:19,480

1158
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:24,640
though no cheese cheese off the menu well I did see a video yeah he doesn't eat

1159
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:29,960
cheese but he eats fruits and vegetables still he eats yeah yeah cuz yeah I just

1160
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,880
come on no city if he's going carnivore boy said he eats six bananas a day that

1161
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:42,480
really eat those and then not eat cheese six bananas this yellow yeah yeah if you

1162
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,880
can eat fruits and veggies you can eat cheese this guy's eating six bananas a

1163
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,480
day it seems like he's more on the monkey diet yeah that's a good point

1164
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,840
what's so the mindset behind his diet is that like he can only eat like raw food

1165
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:01,120
or eats like it's supposed to be like what what people would have eaten 10

1166
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,540
- Before, oh, so like before.

1167
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,560
- Before agriculture. - He should be eating like,

1168
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,280
yeah. - Elephants.

1169
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,680
- Does he eat elephant meat?

1170
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,560
- He's eating like, I mean, liver is mostly

1171
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,800
like the big thing that he advocates for.

1172
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,480
- Does he eat elephant meat, though?

1173
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,320
- No, he does not eat elephant meat.

1174
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,240
- Okay, so, I mean, that's the number one thing

1175
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,760
that cavemen were eating, probably.

1176
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,360
- Elephants? - Mammoths, yeah.

1177
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,400
- Oh, mammoths, yeah. - No.

1178
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,360
- They literally, that's all you see a picture of cavemen

1179
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,600
they're eating, are woolly mammoths.

1180
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:37,600
I saw a giant have mammoth cheese. I saw that. What? Say that sentence again?

1181
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:47,920
There's a giant and if you go up to him they are hostile but they do have

1182
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:57,480
mammoth cheese. What the fuck are you talking about? Is this from a skyrim?

1183
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:03,640
This is from Skyrim. I saw a giant eat mammoth cheese and if you want to be

1184
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,640
strong like a giant, I feel like you still have to eat mammoth cheese. Yo, those giants hit you and they ragdoll into the air.

1185
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,560
Funny as fuck. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's all I did in Skyrim.

1186
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,560
I started to run into the giants and go flying. That's how we have to, in the episode, is Patrick saying a giant ate mammoth cheese.

1187
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,280
I know, you know how I'm gonna end this episode? That's how he did it. I'm gonna turn

1188
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:27,240
180 degrees this way. I'm gonna go on my computer and I'm gonna play Skyrim.

1189
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,460
I'm gonna give you I'm gonna grade your your episode today. Yeah, I'm giving you it

1191
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,180
You're talking about mammoth cheese. It was a more showing just a

1192
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:46,040
Dd me you just say it was a family you complained about there's a family that you're trying it was a family

1193
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:50,480
Yeah, actually, I'm gonna give you a d-plus because you scared the people I don't know that I would go

Definitely a C. Definitely see performance. That's I'm not this is not a passing one. This is a bit

1195
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,800
This is a this is like a fair enough like next episode. It's like extra credit

1196
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,920
zone. That's what you're in okay, because you might semester is coming to an end

1197
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,320
right and I'm the hot teacher. My legs are about to uncross on the desk. Okay,

1198
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,080
so that's going to be fucking awesome, but don't think about that and I don't

1199
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,400
like that. You made a smelling noise right as I said that I was not good.

1200
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,920
You can't

1201
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,120
smell my thing

1202
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:26,600
drops like the chalk on the ground and like bends over to pick it up and his

1203
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,720
twenty kids just like

1204
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:37,960
that's an a minus from

1205
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:44,640
let me see you got a ninety five. Okay, a little bit of credit here right.

1206
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,560
This is like a like a bonus question.

1207
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,720

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,140
buy your tickets to Portland and Seattle.

1209
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,040
We're gonna be playing at the Crocodile in Seattle.

1210
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,600
- Hereafter at the Crocodile.

1211
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,120

1213
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,120
it's at Mississippi Studios.

1214
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,880
- Don't get confused, it's not in Mississippi.

1215
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,720
- It's not in Mississippi. - It's in Portland.

1216
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,400
- It's actually in Portland. - It's weird

1217
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,640
because in Portland, most of the neighborhoods,

1218
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,960
is a fact I learned. - Are weird.

1219
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,280
- They're very weird. - Yep.

1220
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,880
- It's weird, a lot of the neighborhoods there

1221
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,680
are named after other states.

1222
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,680
Yeah, hey and if you look at the map of the states, you notice all the states are

1223
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,560
different colors. Yeah, that's people's hair is like in Portland. Yep.

1224
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:30,040
And in Portland, Mississippi Studios has no river next to it. Yeah, so if

1225
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:35,720

01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,640
It's gonna be the most triggering thing that's ever happened in Seattle since the Chaz.

1241
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,280
It's going to be like probably millions will be triggered and will probably kill themselves.

1242
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
Yeah.

1243
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,280
