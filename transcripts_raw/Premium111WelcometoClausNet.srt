18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
*Badass music*

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
*Badass music*

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,880
second and I'm gonna let you know it's not gonna happen. You do have some Grinch

29
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,200
in you I think. My spirit is low! Yeah you have a little Grinch penis in you.

30
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
Yeah do you want a little bit of one? Yeah do you want some more of one? Yeah.

31
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,800
Hey you have a little bit of my penis in your face. Do you want more of it?

32
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,240
Would you like a little bit more? Not a lot. Do you want my second one? Do you

33
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,880
want my other? Do you mean the balls Cameron? Can I blow my nose in you?

34
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,840
blow my nose in between your butt. Can I blow my nose in your meaty tissue? You look like

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,240
you have a little bit of my finger in your belly button. Merry Christmas. I'll say Merry

36
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,480
Christmas after that. Merry Christmas. Yeah, why would you say Merry Christmas after that?

37
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,560
Can I sneeze in you? Merry Christmas. Are you guys excited for Christmas? It diffuses

38
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,920
the situation. If they're really grossed out when you ask, then you immediately say Merry

39
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Christmas. They just get excited for Christmas. You can say Merry Christmas in any situation.

40
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,420
I would say Merry Christmas is like one of the best things

41
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,000
you can say if you're getting mugged.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Yeah.

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,720
You know, 'cause most people who commit crimes

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,680
are really are like stupid, right?

45
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,440
Like you're pretty low IQ to commit a crime.

46
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,840
So if you say like, "Hey, Merry Christmas,"

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
maybe they'll get confused and then out of the,

48
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,560
kind of, you know, reason for the season style,

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,720
they just, they stop mugging you.

50
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,800
Yeah.

51
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,880
I feel like that's not a bad strategy.

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,920
I mean it works better if you have a gift for them I guess.

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah, I would let most people mug me if they said Merry Christmas before it.

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,760
You could also say Merry Christmas as you-

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,400
If they said it was going for a toy for tots.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,400
You could say Merry Christmas, I got you my phone and then you don't have to tell your

57
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
wife that you got mugged when you get home.

58
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah, well you could also say Merry Christmas, I got you this phone but you can't have it

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
till Christmas morning.

60
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040

Yes. If so, I've seen one before.

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,060
Lizard. Frog.

113
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,760
Chameleon, half of the time. Keep guessing, keep guessing.

114
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,440
Sick dog. Green bird.

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
A parrot. Parrots are green, right?

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,600
Sometimes. Keep guessing though.

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,960
Keep guessing green animals. Grass, grass.

118
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,200
Grass is an animal. A green snail.

119
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,920
I'll tell you it does eat grass.

120
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
A cow.

124
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I would love to have a cow.

125
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Don't have a cow.

126
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay.

127
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Yo!

Don't have a cow, we'll get you your cow.

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
We got it so good.

130
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,520
Is this on Christmas Eve you're doing this to me?

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Yep, that's true.

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
It's Christmas Eve.

133
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,520
In the anniversary of our marriage.

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,480
It's the third anniversary of the podcast.

135
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,720
It's not Patrick's third anniversary.

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
We'll have to calculate what that is and have a different.

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,460
third anniversary

138
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,460
tori's pat would call it basically

139
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,700
i think that the jokes are good

140
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,040
yet

141
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,460

142
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,620

143
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,620
uh... yeah i don't know about all the other ones but i stand by that one

144
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,140
that was a good one

145
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:11,140
The only reason I don't get mad at them is because I don't want to ruin your fun.

146
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,580
You ruined a lot of other people's fun.

147
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Yeah.

148
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,200
They'll never have fun again.

149
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,100
All the people I gave COVID to.

150
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Yeah.

151
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, you have been walking around flailing your arms like an inflatable outside of a

152
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
used car dealership.

153
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,220
I've gone to the movies every day since finding this out.

154
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
Why wouldn't you?

155
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,980
Yeah, he was accidentally pretending it's too dark and sitting on people's laps and going,

156
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,980
"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, it's so dark in here."

157
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,180
"Yeah, I couldn't see you.

158
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
I couldn't see you."

159
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
"WHOA!

160
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
I couldn't see you."

161
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,180
Yeah.

162
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
Yeah.

163
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,100
You also have been putting your mouth around the popcorn butter machine like a weird kid

164
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
at a water fountain.

165
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,860
Walking up and down the aisle playing a tuba, like spitting into a...

166
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,860
Any brass instruments.

167
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,740
A bassoon.

168
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm playing Kenny G, uh, fuckin'

169
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Songburn, Songburn, de, Songburn

171
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,740
Kenny G has to be one of the masters of sex, right?

172
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Oh, yeah

173
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
That guy's gotta be so fuckin' good at sex

174
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,740
Dude, he's made so many NPR guys have sex in their life

175
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,740

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Like, he's made, like, so many NPR women horny

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,360
It'd be funny if Kenny G like smoked DMT and he saw the machine elves and they were just like you have to stop playing the saxophone

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,660
the ship.

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,780
And he tries to blow up the sun.

You like, "It's like Star Trek Generations with Malcolm McDowell!"

202
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,340
I think you know for a fact that neither of us would know what was going on with that.

203
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,460
I thought you would at least, Cameron.

204
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
No.

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,700

227
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,940

228
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,280
festivus sweater and has a picture of the festivus pole I love the cartoon on

229
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,100
the back that's like it's an it's supposed to be about Easter but it shows

230
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,740
Jesus as a zombie and it's like Jesus came back to life and he's like eating

231
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,540
people and there's like it's like really cool. I have a I have a Festivus sweater

232
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,680
that's just like it's a sweater that's just the entirety of the Kramer Laugh

233
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,140
Factory. Pat says it all man. Happy Holidays, fucking happy zombie Jesus day.

234
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,740
That would actually be such a sick sweater. It's like one of those you know those like

235
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,140
embroidered sweaters I have like of the like the dog. That you have? Yeah you know

236
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,940
like the one that I have that's like the dog catching the the ducks like the

237
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,780
dog going after the ducks I was just well it's like an embroidered sweater like

238
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,300
that but it's just like Kramer on stage at the laugh factory and it's like the

239
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,540
knit of the sweater is supposed to look like the stage but then it's like a fully embroidered Kramer.

240
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,380
Why did you need to describe the sweater you own for that example you could say a sweater with Kramer on it.

241
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,620
You say, "You know the sweater that I own that has the picture of the dogs on it?"

242
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,820
Yeah, I wanted you to think about that specific one.

243
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
I don't want to think about your clothes.

244
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,320
The sweater itself looks like...

245
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,320
The only thing that looks like a thing is the embroidered shirt.

246
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
It looks like a shirt. It looks like a tuxedo, but it's a shirt.

247
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
You know how I have shirts?

248
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,820
You know how I have that one shirt with the Nirvana logo on it?

249
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
It's like that, but it's a tuxedo.

250
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh man, I'm literally at my worst right now.

251
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
You're at your worst?

252
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,320
Yeah.

253
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
We can go lower.

254
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,720

260
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,200
that they won't be mad is if we cover this beautiful Christmas website that I

261
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
discovered that I'm so excited to share with everybody. Yeah, covering what?

262
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:21,520
Hmm? Yep. What? Yeah, covering what? MyJelly? Okay. This is a beautiful website called

263
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,320
ClawsNet.com. That's right. Today we're looking at the beautiful forum on ClawsNet,

264
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,840
the Santa Claus Network. This is a forum for Santa Clauses. And it wasn't easy to get in here,

265
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,800
by the way. No, it was so hard. Okay, so I yeah, I discovered this website because I was trying

266
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,220
to find a Santa Claus for him because I thought that might be funny. I found this literally

267
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,560
the most beautiful homepage I've ever seen. It has all the different sections of the forums.

268
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,960
I go to click on and it's like, oh, you need an account to view the forums. I'm like, okay,

269
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,340
fine. I make my account Santa Toprak pretty beautiful name convincing, right? I seem like

270
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,800
a Santa and they said I have to get my account manually approved. It took like two days before

271
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,760
they let me look at the forums but I'm in now and I'm ready to infiltrate and mock

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,280
the the beautiful tradition of portraying Santa Claus. I'm not ready. These people

273
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,480
disgust me. I actually, now that you've told me about this I'm backing out of

274
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,560
the episode I don't think I want to make fun of Santa. That's because you are

275
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,240
clearly a future Santa Claus at a mall. Yep. Yeah. So this website could, oh that's

276
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,740
going to be I want to read here that I talk to Santa himself the about section

to the true believers of Santa Claus,

289
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,980
the child inside of us.

290
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,260
- Well, that could have been our in.

291
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,020
We didn't have to pretend to be a Santa.

292
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,840
- What?

293
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
- There are a couple guys on here--

294
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,500
- Reindeer breeders?

295
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,120
- Who do not seem like they're trying to be Santa at all.

296
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
- No. - Yeah, dude, we could have

297
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,340
just gone in-- - There are a few elves

298
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,740
on here that I've run into.

299
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,700
there are people who have elves. We could have pretended to be elves, we could have pretended

300
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:38,100
to be reindeer breeders. Or reindeer. True. So the thing about this website, almost every

301
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,080
single user of this website has the word Santa in their username. They're all named like

302
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,180
Santa Jim, Santa Jeff, Big Man Santa, stuff like that. Their profile pictures are all

303
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:56,740
Santa Claus. It's really incredible. They have on the homepage, they show kind of a cross

304
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,100
section of some of these accounts. We have on the homepage, we have Santa Brad, Tyler

305
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,780
Santa. I'm looking at a Santa here named Santa Ray J. That's pretty good. Here's Santa Castor.

306
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:18,200
And it's not the guy from the video. Santa Edmonton. Richard Ganey. Sinter Noel. Papa

307
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:26,800
Christmas 59 Santa Jared Kevin vast Tampa Santa Santa Mario Raylor Santa

308
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Robbie big Adam on bass Felix Estridge Black Hills Santa Santa Steve KL seen a

309
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:46,760
lot of this guy is like the shittiest he's a bald guy he has the shittiest

310
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,760
beard I've ever seen and his name is Santa Bob Ford. Santa Bob of Tulsa. His beard is

311
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,760
like a white but it's the length of Pat's. That's very funny. Timothy Allen Adams. He's

312
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:09,400
not a Santa, he's a supporter. Niceville Santa. Do we want to go over the beautiful welcome

313
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,520
that you got on this website, Cam? Yeah. So that's the other thing. So the other, even

314
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,600
Even once they manually approved my account, I still couldn't view the forums.

315
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,360
And I was like, "What's up with this?

316
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,400
It turns out you have to make a welcome post and have people welcome you before you're

317
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
allowed in."

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,340
So they have a very elaborate permission to view the forums here on ClauseNet.

319
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,800
But so I posted, "Hello, my name is Toprak, and I'm very excited to be part of your forum.

320
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,520
Thank you for accepting me, and I love Santa very much, and I hope to portray him faithfully

321
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,720
and bring joy to Christmas."

322
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
I mean, that's beautiful.

323
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,640
You have a real Santa's mind.

324
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Thank you.

325
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,560
Yeah, I had to kind of wear the skin of a Santa here to get into character.

326
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,600
You couldn't just put on the suit?

327
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
No, the skin isn't very important.

328
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I guess it's true.

329
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,160
The first person who welcomed me here is Santa Timothy SC who said welcome to Claws Net and

330
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,920
posted a beautiful gif of Santa waving.

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
We just got scared of the Thunder.

384
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,160
We always had a heads up.

385
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,300
If I was under my bed, then I'd realize, "Oh, there's probably Thunder."

386
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,640
And that's why I got under here.

387
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,800
How did you know if enemy troops were afoot?

388
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,720
Oh, that, well, I mean, with the internet, I think the internet kind of destroyed the

389
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
Town Crier business.

390
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720

393
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,400

394
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
I think it's bad to put a specific date on the...

395
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,720
Yeah, it's dangerous.

396
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,220
Yeah.

408
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,400
next week but I was wondering if you all know any malls in or near Atlanta or

409
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,200
southeast Alabama that might need a big backup black Santa.

410

Big backup black Santa. That's a Christmas... And I'm looking at his photo. His backup is big.

412
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm looking at his photo on here and he looks very white to me.

413
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,920

414
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,960

421
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,240

424
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,800
the only response here is from Santa Craig Maxwell who says "Thanks for keeping up with

425
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,040
this stuff and reporting your research to us. This is disturbing, but we need to be informed.

426
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,500
Hopefully by being informed and ready with our responses, we won't get blindsided in

427
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,520
compromising situations. Keep it coming.

428
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Woah, dude.

429
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,240
There's a funny bit to a bot too, it's so funny.

430
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,160
That's sick. He's a Santa and a fucking culture war operator.

431
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah.

432
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,680
"Interest Christmas caroling with the guitar and all things Claus."

433
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:09,440
Hmm I found a I found a post here very ominous title in the post just says well

434
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,900
I finally convinced her dot dot dot but then the post just says yep I finally

435
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,520
convinced my wife to dress as mrs. Claus and a couple of events this year and it's

436
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,280
just all other Santa's talking about convincing their wives to be mrs. Claus

437
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,120
I don't think I've ever seen a Mrs. Claus.

438
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,000
There's Santa Mike E from North Carolina, Caleb.

439
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,340
Well, shout out, raise your shirt up.

440
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,840
You might know him.

441
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,680
Do you?

442
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,880
Hold on, hold on, 'cause I think your interests align.

443
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
Okay.

444
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,360
Public speaking.

445
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
Gardening.

446
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,400
Oh, yeah.

447
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
Ham radio.

448
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,940
Love ham radio.

449
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,500
And Christmas.

450
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,040
That honestly, yeah, no, that lines up perfectly.

451
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,880
Yeah.

452
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,560
Does it say what part of North Carolina he's from?

453
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,740
Let me look at his website here, mrsclausplussanta.com.

454
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,280
- Is he from the 910?

455
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Dromington, Kilmington?

456
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,240
- Triangle Park.

457
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,820
- Oh, he's a triangle kid.

458
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,620
- Well, hold on, hold on.

459
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,080
Sorry, I read it wrong.

460
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,200
He's available for hire in Cary, Raleigh,

461
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,960
Holly Springs, Apex, Morrisville,

462
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,120
Fuck, what does that say?

463
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
Fuckway, Varina, Garner, what?

464
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,540
- Fuquay, Varina?

465
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
What?

466
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
What is that?

467
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Fuquay Farina?

468
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
What?

469
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,540
It sounds like someone with a speech impediment saying "Fuck my vagina."

470
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:40,540
There's also a place in North Carolina called Bolivia.

471
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Really?

472
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
Yeah.

473
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
That's cool.

474
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
It's beautiful.

475
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,340
Oh, and then he says, "Pittsburgh and Research Triangle Park."

476
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,340
What the fuck?

477
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Hold on.

478
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,100
Why are these North Carolina places named?

479
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
This isn't about

480
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,460
This isn't about North Carolina. This is about Santa and

481
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,260
And he says yeah, sorry. Let me just read this thing that Mikey said

482
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,580
I'm afraid that my wife will resist stepping into the role of mrs. Claus for quite a while

483
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,900
She's 10 years younger than me and I'm five to seven years from retirement

484
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:16,260
Hopefully someday let me get a couple more years of Santa under my belt and I'll be in a better position to persuade her

485
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,740
Also, it'd be kind of I will say be a little bit compromising

486
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,160
To Santa's image if like, you know, the mall Santa's all get their wives to do it and then you go see Santa and there's like a

487
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,920
22 year old mrs. Claus, right? Yeah, throw me off a little bit. Yeah, that would be that would be

488
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,660
Confusing to me. I wouldn't understand what was going on. Yeah. Yeah. Is this an elf?

489
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,420
Yeah, this is this daughter

490
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,940
Santa's daughter Brittany, Brittany

491
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,300
Hey there Mrs. Clogs. I want to read another Elf Hermie thing here.

492
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,820
This news bot. So this is something that I found. This news bot usually

493
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,340
posts stuff like, "New article, what are the best electric cars for ten-year-olds

494
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,340
to drive?" Stuff like, "Mall Santa spotted giving to a homeless

495
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,580
person" or something, you know? Stuff like that. And then here's one

496
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,700
Here's one news post that it made on January 15th 2008

497
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,260
An enraged water buffalo went on an hour-long rampage in northern Vietnam

498
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:26,000
Going for people and destroying food stalls before being shot to death by police officials said Tuesday

499
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,720
That's pretty cool. That's the whole post. Yeah, it's awesome. I wonder what it what makes it choose certain headlines. I don't know

500
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,340
Maybe there's something article where like the person just said like also I love Christmas

501
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,600
(laughter)

502
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,840
- The water buffalo destroyed my Christmas tree

503
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,680
which was still up in January,

504
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
which was very disappointing to me.

505
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,460
- If I was an editor of like a big magazine,

506
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,760
I'd put I love Christmas at the end of every article.

507
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
Just so it ends up on here.

508
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,920
- That's what I'd give that on notes

509
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,620
for novels that people submit.

510
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,220
It doesn't say you love Christmas in the acknowledgements.

511
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,740
Do you did be so funny if the like like what like storm front or something or

512
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,780
like like info wars puts I love Christmas at the end of every article so it gets

513
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,340
sent to this website so they can get army of Santas those people these I will say

514
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,220
a lot of these Santas would really like that yeah from what I've seen well if

515
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:34,180
you're listening um yeah I mean I can't even I can read one here for I would

516
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:42,220
love to hear this this is a this is a post called Santa security by Texas Santa

517
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,060
whose interests are Christ family military families and special needs

518
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,660
children I was reading through the forums and happened across a couple of posts

519
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,660
regarding security of Santa it reminded me of a time when I went to an event

520
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,660
that was deep in the hood there were many warnings for this event did not

521
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,020
happen mainly from the gang leaders sure enough the day of the event rolls around

522
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Santa in the hood?

523
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Santa in the hood?

524
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,740
the neighborhood. While my team was setting up, even more police arrived. At the event

525
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,700
start time, we all entered the site and prepared for the worst. No problems, no concerns, just

526
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,460
hundreds of children that were relieved that Santa had kept his word. We hurriedly packed

527
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,060
and moved off to a secure location to properly put everything away, when even more police

528
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,780
showed up. Word came to me later that the gangs had all declared their hatred for each

529
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,820
other and were ready to have a bit of a tussle, but they could not be sure Santa and his elves

530
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,900
would not be hurt. They feared the judgment of their children if something happened. Sadly,

531
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,020
We have never been able to go back to that neighborhood.

532
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,500
I believe it would be wrong for Santa to carry a firearm.

533
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,920
Yes, I am constantly busy traveling to homes and sites that are an hour away from any type

534
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,920
of law enforcement support, but I still rely on my common sense and my capabilities to

535
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,500
not be seen on TV news as a stereotyped bad Santa.

536
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,240
I believe that if you are in an area that is a soft target and you fear for your safety,

537
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,460
you should not be there.

538
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,260
The primary insurance provider for the Mahler site would probably also have issues with an

539
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,540
armed Santa as well as most of the parents.

540
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,540
In my opinion, on-site weapons are a liability that runs afoul of Santa.

541
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Wow.

542
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Yes, sir.

543
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Talk that talk.

544
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Santa Marty replies.

545
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
There's some really good replies here.

546
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:16,260
Santa Marty replies, "It would just seem to me that we, as Santa, in a static location

547
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,940
like a mall, would be a very soft target.

548
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,020
Some social, religious, or economic fanatic could sure make an impactful statement in

549
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
a hurry."

550
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,220
God damn, dude.

551
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:32,180
I just love that Texas Santa, like everyone else on here is like, "Look at Santa Marty

552
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:39,180
be

553
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:45,060
was like no I have to let everyone know everything like like my interests

554
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,660
helping the special needs I'm the best Santa on this fucking site whoa I'm

555
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,780
better than all these other Santa's all these Santas think about themselves I'm

556
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,580
the only Santa thinking about the other the real world yeah okay thinking about

557
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:03,580
fire there's still more replies here - that are very good yeah this is from

558
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Santa Caris.

559
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Oh, let me read his interests real quick.

560
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Yeah, go ahead.

561
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
I really love this.

562
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,500
"Interests, beekeeping, motorcycles, camping, traveling, grandchildren!

563
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,740
Last but not least, my Mrs. Claus."

564
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,300
While I've never been armed as Santa at any event ever, I find it hard to trust my safety

565
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,380
to mall security.

566
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:27,380
I am disappointed as Santa that this even has to be considered, but I'm not the one

567
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,620
that started jihadist terrorist attacks.

568
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,580
I'm sure the mall administration would have a problem with an armed SC, Santa Claus, but

569
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,220
just not sure that other than my family, many tears would be shed at my demise by that same

570
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,220
administration.

571
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:47,540
I am 99% sure that I will not be armed as Santa, but you can be 100% I will be vigilante.

572
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:55,620
You know, I'm fuckin, I'm pretty upset with the kid that wished for jihadist attacks on

573
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,620
mall Santas.

574
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,060
it sucks that the kid was good and they had to give him the present I know yeah

575
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:07,660
well he was you know now he did it shores he went to bed on time

576
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:15,180
destroyed wished it was Texas Santa Texas Santa was like please please please

577
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,340
Santa give me give me one jihadist terrorist attack so I can use my firearm

578
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:32,700
in the mall. I have this guy Big Adam on bass okay his only interest is Freemasonry.

579
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:40,740
He's the Santa that's recruiting all the other Santas into the Illuminati.

580
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:48,260
Which is an interesting mix I would say as Santa Claus but I he made a post asked to

581
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,860
play Bad Santa.

582
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,780
While I have mixed emotions on this, I thought I should turn to you all.

583
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,380
I have turned down this event but want to know what is your thought on playing a Bad Santa

584
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,660
for an adult party.

585
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,860
I feel that if the word got out to the wrong people, that's it.

586
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,020
Your time as Santa is done.

587
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,620
And then Santa TJS replies, "Pictures taken by adults on cell phones will haunt you for

588
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,260
the rest of your days."

589
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:23,420
And then people just are telling him, "Yeah, it's a bad idea to play a bad Santa."

590
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,900
It seems like the real Santas are very opposed to it.

591
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
You made the right decision.

592
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,320
They don't want a quality Santa, but a raw comic in a cheap Santa costume.

593
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,400
It's not worth it.

594
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,060
How does this fit into your idea of Christmas and the image of Santa Claus?

595
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,180
They're very, very concerned with the image of Santa Claus.

596
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,420
I found another post that I didn't save it, but there was a guy who was saying he never

597
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,540
drinks any liquid like he doesn't even drink water when he's a Santa costume

598
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,420
because one time somebody took a picture of him in the Santa costume drinking

599
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,300
water and said Santa drinking vodka and he thought that was disrespectful.

600
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,260
That is disrespectful. Yeah. I like it's kind of heartwarming that there's so

601
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,700
many old weird men who are so invested in the image of Santa Claus. In the

602
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,900
section of how to portray Santa they have like a guide yeah they have

603
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,300
something called the five-second rule which is when you enter the presence of

604
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,020
your audience you have five seconds to make people believe you are the real

605
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,980
Santa it's kind of a they kind of take it very seriously yeah they have you

606
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:34,020
know they do oh well we I was I just said you said old old men are very

607
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,380
concerned with the image of Santa Claus and speaking of old men and images I

608
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:44,120
I have a topic here by Santa Craig called pregnant belly photos

609
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,420
Pray tell

610
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,380
That'll transition good into this next one that I found but go on yeah

611
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:59,700
This is I was surfing on Facebook just now came across a friend's link to some studio sessions featuring women who have had high-end

612
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,900
Photos done with their husbands or by themselves with their pregnant bellies exposed

613
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,140
Well, this is certainly not my cup of tea. Some people feel the need for these fad pictures

614
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,960
I honestly do not see how or why anyone would want these photos hanging on the wall, but I digress

615
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,460
And there are a lot of replies here

616
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,220
and

617
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,900
There's oh there was one. I was I was trying to find one second. I have to contrary it is from Santa Dawn

618
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,220
whose interests

619
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,380
interests are

620
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:32,660
bachelors and master's degree in Santa Claus from the iusc special advanced training and special events in portrait video and portrait studio and

621
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:38,020
and Santa Dawn says, "I think pregnant women are the most beautiful thing God ever placed on this earth.

622
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,020
When my wife was pregnant with our three kids, I just loved to look at her.

623
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,520
There's nothing like the way a tummy full of baby feels, and I must admit,

624
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,020
I usually ask if I can touch the tummy of pregnant girls I teach with.

625
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,020
Now having said all that, I would not be comfortable touching pregnant tummies of Santa,

626
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,020
let alone taking photos. Kinda just feels wrong."

627
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,580
Why does he... he asks the women he works with if he can touch their bellies but he can't

628
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,580
touch it.

629
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,540
It's like in Santa it's like no that's a different guy.

630
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,140
Yeah if you're Santa that's a cross that's over the line.

631
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
If you ask in plainclothes that's fine.

632
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,300
Santa doesn't have a pregnant woman fetish.

633
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,700
Yeah but Stelter does.

634
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Don?

635
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,240
Yes sir.

636
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,980
This is a storytelling Santa.

637
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,500
Oh, hold on, I got a, I got one here. I said I was gonna read. Oh yeah, go for it.

638
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,960
Attack of the Flirt by Charlie Claus. Reoccurring experience, I was wondering if

639
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,960
how everyone else handled it. Single mothers tend to want to flirt with Santa.

640
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,360
I've tried to ignore them in the past but tonight something was different. That

641
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,020
something different was that my wife was present. I agreed to be Santa at my

642
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:55,480
daughter's Christmas banquet at the Votek. She's in culinary arts program. My entire

643
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,320
family was in attendance and everything was going well. I was making my way

644
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,560
around the cafeteria visiting each table and spending a few extra minutes at with

645
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,280
any table that had children. When this mother in her mid to late 30s began

646
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,200
flirting with Santa, at first it was rather subtle but it quickly escalated to

647
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,240
her getting up and rubbing against me as she squeezed past me in the closed

648
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,440
quarters at this point I made my exit I had already visited with all the kids

649
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,480
there and I was getting very uncomfortable the argument with the

650
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,840
missus afterwards well I can get through that I was wondering how you guys have

651
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,840
dealt with or stopped these kinds of advances is there some sort of repellent

652
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,120
I mean I get it I'm a short fat bald guy with a beard what's not to love

653
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,880
somebody help I mean did Santa's Santa's pole did yeah are you kidding me put your

654
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,760
girl in a room with Santa, she don't fold.

655
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Dude, girls treat you different when you're in the Santa costume.

656
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Bro, plus you pull back the lapel on your fucking, on your Santa coat, burberry.

657
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Damn, dude, Santa's got it like that?

658
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
I guess he's giving himself gifts.

659
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Damn, look at you, Santa.

660
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Santa with the Gucci belt? Okay.

661
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Santa with the red bottoms? What?

662
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Dude, yeah.

663
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
I just want to read a post title really quick.

664
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Yeah, go ahead.

665
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,640
the prayer request section which is a prayer request for our brothers and

666
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,400
sisters in red and all others in need and I just want to read this title this is

667
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,940
very short this is by SC Santa who's the the retired soccer coach down to eight

668
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,940
fingers but the show must go on.

669
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,940
Damn.

670
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,940
No, dude.

671
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
Wow.

672
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Does he say what happened?

673
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Fireworks accident.

674
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
He says,

675
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,940
"An accident at work back in 1996

676
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,940
left me missing an index finger and part of

677
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,940
my thumb on my right hand. Last Saturday

678
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,940
night I lost a fight with a jagged piece

679
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,940
of steel hardware on the middle finger of my right

680
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
hand and despite my hope that it was just a

681
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
deep laceration, removing the bandage Sunday

682
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,940
morning proved otherwise and I had to go to the ER."

683
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,940
So he's missing two and a half fingers.

684
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Wait, he's fucking shit, dude.

685
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:17,940
Imagine losing a finger in 1996 and then 2019 being like, just the dread of like, "Oh, I made it work with nine for so long."

686
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
"Now I gotta readjust again."

687
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Also, how fucked up would that be to be a kid sitting on Santa's lap? He's missing fingers.

688
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,940
In the meantime, I have a major musical that opens on Friday, and I still have all the artistic painting, the lights, and the sound to finish.

689
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Damn.

690
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Um, this is from Storytelling Santa. This says, "You won't believe this request."

691
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Okay. Posted November 17, 2011.

692
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,940
"This is a legitimate request that came through Gig Salad today. I'm gonna pass. I cannot believe they would expect Santa to soil his good name."

693
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:58,280
Here's the request having a nice size meet-and-greet for about 200 plus couples in the swinging lifestyle. It is a public club

694
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,760
We'll be holding this event in so just a meet-and-greet is all

695
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,180
Looking for a Santa for some of the nice naughty ladies so that they can get their Christmas wish

696
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,100
And a lot everybody's just dogging this dude

697
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,480
people say

698
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,100
That will accept this guy this guy says sounds like a great way for some Santa to get one of the many gifts that keep on

699
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,400
giving

700
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,600
Whoa and this guy this guy's cake wrinkle this fellow's disgusted by it

701
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,560
He says to each their own, but I would pass on this

702
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,760
Actually, it kind of turns my stomach to think that Santa would do this

703
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,820
These people hate say I have another

704
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,880
Santa in a sexual Santa

705
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:48,260
Thread here dude sexual Santa. He should never be these people. Yeah, there's they're very anti-sexual Santa, which I think Santa

706
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,580
Should get it no I agree

707
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,040
Why I think you should be blowing backs out and getting his foot back no now

708
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,160
I think you should be I think you should be lying on his back jiggling like jelly while some elf gives it to him

709
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,980
Wait wait so Santa gets fucked by an elf I know he should be taking it

710
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,940
I think he should be taking it and giving it to everybody he can

711
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,500
Also, this guy's got you know those back shots my like peppermint

712
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,500
*laughter*

713
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,500
This guy says, "In the words of Bart Simpson, I carumba.

714
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,500
We live in a day and age of cooties, and now I want to risk my life over some fetish?

715
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Where's a lump of coal when you need one?

716
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,500
When I played Santa for my cousin or friends last year,

717
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,500
at least one of the ladies commented on me being a handsome Santa

718
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
and snuggled up a little close for the picture while holding my hand."

719
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
In the words, in the famous words, the immortal words of Bart Simpson.

720
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Ay caramba.

721
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Absolutely.

722
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,500
I'm still reading the attack of the flirt comments here.

723
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Here's a comment from Santa Cori B.

724
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,500
It just says, "Yeah, if it gets rough, you can mention something about an elf hit squad that she has watching you."

725
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,180
so woman flirting with the interest that i have a bunch of else you have sniper

726
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,700
rifles pointed at you right now

727
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,740
you back the fuck up

728
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,120
uh...

729
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,580
yeah i have another sexual center post here

730
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,740
uh...

731
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,380
christmas and porn

732
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,340
by noro

733
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,360
you

734
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,880
when tracy interests writer coach in courage ur

735
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,840
why do people watch holiday themed porn

736
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,660
maybe this thread will

737
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,880
no i won't

738
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,380
uh...

739
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,780
I just blocked a Christmas person, maybe a Santa, on Facebook, because he is posting

740
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,060
a site to visit where you create titles with porn movie names as a takeoff of hit movies.

741
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,860
Even if you are into porn, someone who claims to represent Christmas or a Santa should not

742
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,540
be posting it or being associated with it.

743
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,800
Santas have enough trouble with not being accused of sexual harassment without putting

744
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,300
it out there on Facebook where 30% of internet users are on.

745
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,780
He doesn't use his photo just to cartoon, nor does he use his name.

746
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,500
This is very upsetting and disappointing.

747
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,620
I have seen this in Michigan with clowning, where a perverted clown gave all clowns a

748
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,620
bad name.

749
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,960
No, it is not funny or cute as one said it was.

750
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,320
This is one very upset Mrs. Claus.

751
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,220
I don't think clowns have as pristine of an image as Santa Claus.

752
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,380
The phrase "a perverted clown gave all clowns a bad name" is so funny.

753
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,900
It's true though.

754
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,860
Santa Danny says, "Nora, I have deleted two Santas in the last few days from Facebook for

755
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,420
posting inappropriate content."

756
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I agree.

757
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,460
to deal with this Santa without having Santas posting soft porn on Facebook.

758
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:44,540
I too have deleted a couple, this is from Santa Spice, who also is interested in Freemasonry.

759
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,500
Christmas, Alaska, and Freemasonry.

760
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,780
I too have deleted a couple in the last week.

761
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,100
For the reasons Nora listed, I also deleted one Mrs. Claus because I looked at her groups

762
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,500
and she had several on S&M, Bondage, etc.

763
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,260
Which if she likes it, I am fine with it, but not with a picture of Santa related items.

764
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,260
So she got the boot too.

765
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,600
It is like us not smoking or drinking in public.

766
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
We must be careful.

767
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,860
I hope I am not a prude, but some things just don't go together.

768
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,780
Dude, there's a, um, sorry, this is...

769
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,340
If you just look like Santa...

770
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:20,220
Well, yeah, there's plenty of guys who look like Santa who are like addicted to...

771
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,220
Like smoke and drink.

772
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,140
Yeah, if you're addicted to porn, you just look like Santa.

773
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,140
Your name's Santa Tim.

774
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,980
Yeah, it's not your fault.

775
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,260
That shouldn't come down on you.

776
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,260
We're red everywhere.

777
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,260
Yeah.

778
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,480
You're not bringing a giving Santa bad. It's your parents fault really right for naming

779
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,700
You know what you look like he's like yes, I know Santa Claus and yeah, my name is Santa. Yeah

780
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:49,720
But I don't I'm not Santa though, and I love poor. Yeah, and yeah, I'm addicted to porn. Yeah and junk food

781
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,220
This is a smoke in public and I rub up on women

782
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,120
This is from Michael Riley. This is a this is an important. This is important. This is

783
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:08,640
Grinches on the rise. Oh, yes. This is a good one. How many of you have noticed an increase in Grinch performers?

784
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,140
So it seems like this is a problem

785
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,420
It's a big problem

786
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,540
And this guy says seen a few of them

787
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,640
They inevitably make their way to me and I try to play it off and not make a big deal of it

788
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,780
I've got another issue. I had a jack wagon show up in a horrible Santa costume trying to make a splash

789
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,280
Some fake Santa's showing up.

790
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,660
But the Grinch is, I guess a Grinch, like that's a surefire way to ruin them all, Santa.

791
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,340
Yeah, the Santas here hate, hate the Grinches.

792
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,020
I mean, who, who likes the Grinch?

793
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,540
Besides that fucking bitch Cindy Lou Who.

794
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
That's true.

795
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,140
She likes him a little too much.

796
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,860
Listen, toots, he's never gonna change.

797
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:50,140
Here's a comment from Felix Estridge on that post that says, "Yes, and have you seen the

798
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,100
videos of them scaring the bee Jesus out of the children intentionally?

799
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,900
Here's one from Santa Joe. I guess this don't real- I guess they don't realize this is a

800
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,420
copyright infringement.

801
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,900
Last year the Grinch was a co-feature during one of my Santa bookings. Only on one occasion.

802
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,260
Whilst he played the part very well, I didn't much like it. Took away a little bit of the

803
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:17,700
magic. I think they have a similar session this season and I shall Grinch and bear it.

804
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,700
LOL.

805
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:26,380
Good. Here's Santa Hill. Santa Hill interests Christmas, Santa, movie makeup, and flight simulation.

806
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:33,180
Actually, they started cracking down on freelance Grinches in my area. None of the princess party

807
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,620
business are allowed to have one. I think an attorney from Universal sent out cease and

808
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,980
desist letters and it made the news. Good on them. Good on Universal.

809
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,500
This is a...

810
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,340
Universal fighting the good fight. Keeping the Grinch in their prison.

811
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:51,660
Yeah, the Grinch Prison. This is that last post I read about the Grinch and Barret guy,

812
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:57,900
Santa Rob Thompson, his interests here. The Great Outdoors, charity fundraiser,

813
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,860
trombone my grandson otherwise known as boy.

814
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,740
My grandson otherwise known as boy.

815
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,140
The way that it's written.

816
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,660
Yeah, oh my interest, I'm into boy.

817
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,260
Trombone my grandson.

818
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,260
I miss my grandson.

819
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,860
If you don't know him, he's my grandson.

820
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,740
This guy says, "The Grinch became a jackass tonight at first intermission.

821
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,940
I departed to another part of the ice arena and went on my way."

822
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,060
Santa Fred, New York says, "I work with the Grinch in my event.

823
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,660
Dave the Grinch is a wonderful actor who I've known for many years working at the Haunt

824
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,660
Attraction."

825
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,660
Dave the Grinch!

826
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,660
Dave the Grinch.

827
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,660
That guy's born to play the role.

828
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,660
Yeah.

829
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,660
Yeah.

830
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,820
I have had guys try to crash my gigs at public events. The poor dopes. They have no

831
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,780
idea who they're dealing with. I make sure the police immediately escort any

832
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,140
Santa imposter off the premises. That's right. That's right. That's right. Get the

833
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,820
cops involved. Yeah. Honestly just shoot the Grinch in the head. If you show up dressed up like the

834
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:09,380
Grinch or you show up in some shitty like dollar store, Party City, Santa

835
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:15,860
outfit and you try to sit on Santa's lap, Santa is allowed to fire a bullet in your head.

836
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,860
Absolutely.

837
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,860
Here's the thing, I open up the news and it says "Cops shoot unarmed men" and I go "Oh

838
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,860
dear God."

839
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,500
But then I see that he was a Grinch.

840
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,540
It's like, how many lives have these police officers saved today?

841
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,020
Here's a short one.

842
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,340
This is a topic by Michael Riley.

843
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,660
How do you answer this question?

844
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,860
Where are your reindeer?

845
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,340
So this is a this is in a section where you you they talk about how to answer

846
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,620
questions that the children ask them when they're sitting on their laps. So most

847
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,180
people are giving answers like oh I tell the kids like the reindeer how they're

848
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,500
at the North Pole they have to rest up for their big trip but you know like

849
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,460
stuff like that but then Santa Joel has a different tactic here that he details

850
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,080
he says I don't know if this is a good answer or not but the one time I had

851
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,500
kids ask me I told them that since it was hunting season I had to keep them

852
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,420
hidden so they wouldn't get shot. Probably not the best answer, but it seemed to make

853
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,420
sense to them.

854
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:14,180
Dude, I would. I would love to eat a... Is it a reindeer or just a caribou?

855
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,180
I think so.

856
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,700
I would love to eat a caribou.

857
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,540
Oh, it'd be delicious.

858
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,580
Let's see. We got... Here's another prayer request.

859
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,680
Prayers for Santa Tim by Big Man.

860
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,100
As you all have heard, Santa Tim is in a new movie. I am putting in a request that the

861
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,540
movie does really well and that Santa Tim gets lots of recognition from this.

862
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,540
What's the movie?

863
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,540
They don't say.

864
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,540
Wait, he's in a movie?

865
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,540
What?

866
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,140
But Felix Esdrich responds and says, "I know that Tim is one of the last people who portray

867
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,940
Santa that do it for recognition.

868
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,500
He keeps his ego in check.

869
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,080
Let's pray that this is a very successful venture, of course, but not that Tim is lauded

870
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,500
or his ego boosted.

871
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,700
Ego is the last thing that Saint Nicholas was about."

872
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Mm-hmm.

873
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
Facts.

874
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,780
What are you- what- that's bullshit, dude.

875
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,900
Santa's a fu- Santa's like the biggest fucking attention whore in the world.

876
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,900
He is.

877
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,860
Are you kidding me? This guy demands that you fucking, that you write him a letter every year?

878
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,060
Why can't- he's magic.

879
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,500
Well how else is he gonna know?

880
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,300
He's fucking friends with God! He can read your mind.

881
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
He's not friends with him, he's his brother.

882
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,260
He's not God's brother.

883
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,200
What?

884
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,460
It's not like-

885
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,020
What church did you go to growing up, idiot?

886
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,220
It's not like Greek, like, titans. It's not like God and Santa.

887
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,300
No, it is.

888
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,860
No, he's just a, he's a, he's a German guy, right?

889
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,700
Mm.

890
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,540
No.

891
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,500
They're brothers.

892
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,780
They're not, he's not brothers with, so what,

893
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,140
Jesus is Santa's nephew?

894
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,620
And he spends, and he celebrates his birthday by working?

895
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,460
Yes.

896
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,900
Yeah, this makes no, you have the most,

897
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,420
you always do this, you always ruin Christmas.

898
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,100
You are trying to ruin Christmas really hard.

899
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,900
I'm not trying to ruin Christmas,

900
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:55,940
I'm just telling you what I was taught.

901
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,300
You are trying extremely hard.

902
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
Here's someone else who tried to ruin Christmas.

903
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,300
Mall Santa gets 15 to 30 years for molesting young girl.

904
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,300
Oh.

905
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:11,300
Well that's really, what do people, are they pro him or against him?

906
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,300
Well here's a comment from Santa Marty, Honolulu, Hawaii.

907
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,300
Frankly, I don't see the fact that this criminal was also a mall Santa to be newsworthy.

908
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,300
The crimes that were perpetrated were not committed while he was a Santa actor.

909
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,060
Adding that this criminal was a Santa to the news story points out to me that the reporter,

910
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:30,580
editor, or manager of the media outlet has an underlying agenda.

911
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,580
[laughter]

912
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,580
They have an agenda against Santa.

913
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,980
It's an anti-Santa media agenda.

914
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,820
I mean, maybe the guy said he was Santa. I mean, he looks like Santa all the time.

915
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,820
Yeah.

916
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,780
He could have played it off like he was plain-clothed Santa when he did disgusting things.

917
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Yeah. That's true.

918
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,020
Santa's should be on duty all the time you know like yeah well that's kind of I

919
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,380
would say that's a big part of what these people are campaigning for right it's

920
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,020
like if you look if you are looking at all like Santa don't do anything bad

921
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,940
because you might fuck it up for though I mean it's really a gang do they else

922
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:15,700
really is they should have a violent gang on every plane yeah is there a Santa on

923
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,700
the plane just this young boy has a wish yeah in case something like that or like

924
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,340
you know terrorist attack like they're trying to bring the plane down you know

925
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,780
what shows up this young child is having a savior lay under the plane oh yeah

926
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,800
he some kid wished for a big magnet for Christmas this year he puts a magnet

927
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,300
under or I mean I'll also just put put fucking 16 reindeer in the cargo hold

928
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:46,060
right yeah the engines start going yeah drop them absolutely you know yeah this

929
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:51,140
one I definitely want to hit this one before we finish up the Pat you you found

930
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,980
this one too this is what is the last thing you ate yeah this is a really good

931
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,620
this is a really good one this is a thread that's been going on for years

932
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:07,500
since July 15th 2007 is when I started yeah let me send you I mean I guess if

933
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,900
there is anybody in if there's any group of people that ate a lot yeah so that's

934
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,620
why it's very fun right so Michael Riley starts off okay this will be fun post

935
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:22,260
what was your last meal snack or drink? I'll start. Salami and cheese on potato bread sandwich,

936
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:29,060
ice green tea, smiley face. We got Sean Riley, I assume related to Michael Riley.

937
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,420
They gotta be, right?

938
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,260
Pretzlies and rice crackers.

939
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:40,100
This guy, wait, this guy Allison says, "Marmalade on whole meal with a cup of tea."

940
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:46,180
And then the next day, posting this thread again, "More whole meal toast with marmalade and tea."

941
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,180
I'm starting to see a pattern here.

942
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:57,180
So Sean Reilly also posted again, but on the same day, didn't even wait, Doritos X 13D.

943
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,180
Wait, and then he said the next day, "Hot dog on a bun."

944
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,180
And also, yeah, Michael Reilly posted the next day, "Coke Zero."

945
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,180
And then the next day he says, "Cheeseburger and hot dog."

946
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:22,500
I'm looking at Santa Bill Claus right now. He had an all meat Subway sandwich.

947
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:28,100
Dude, Sean Reilly is dominating this thread. A month later he says, "A hermit."

948
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,860
A hermit? He ate a hermit crab?

949
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,780
And then two months after that he says, "Buffalo chicken salad."

950
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,540
Santa Oliver had barbecue chicken and fried potatoes. Yummy.

951
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,780
I'm still on Sean Reilly two days later.

952
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,780
A slice of pepperoni pizza.

953
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,140
And the same day, cheesecake.

954
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,420
Oh, oh, I know.

955
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,420
The Godfather.

956
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,700
Oh, he's replying to something.

957
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,020
Santa Bill Claus here.

958
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:58,300
This is written in size 24 font.

959
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,660
Vegetarian casserole.

960
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:07,260
Ginny Claus had homemade turkey soup on October 9th, 2007.

961
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,500
Um, yeah, I mean this is, this is just...

962
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,900
- This, how long is this thread still active? - There's so many people just come back here

963
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,980
over and over again to say what they ate.

964
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,100
- Kona... - Santa Bill Claws had a salad last night with a Thousand Island dressing.

965
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:21,780
On April 30th, Kona says "Orange."

966
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,900
Guest Claws with a Claws says "Cheese."

967
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,900
Santa, Santa Buchan had Pop-Tart.

968
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,300
Santa Marty had Trail Mix.

969
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,780
Michael Reilly, "Hot Dog."

970
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,660
- Hot Dog seemed to be a... - Santa Buchan...

971
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,980
Santa Buccia in the same day after Pop-Tart says, "My lunch, a ham roll and crisps."

972
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,740
I mean, I, I, I, you know what I gotta say?

973
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,860
Severe lack of milk and cookies on this list.

974
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,180
Oh, and Santa had cookies.

975
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,100
Kona, this is one of my favorite signatures on the list.

976
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,100
Kona's really good.

977
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,100
Kona just says, "Rice."

978
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:06,060
Kona's interest, motorcycles and anything that goes fast, photography and all things

979
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,600
Christmas, and then here's his signature.

980
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,700
Kona, the Klan Klaus Society, founder and chairman, chieftain of Klan Kennedy, knight of St. Nicholas,

981
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,280
the sovereign military order of the Temple of Jerusalem Knights Templar, KlausNet member

982
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,480
of the month, May 2008.

983
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Damn.

984
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,780
Uh, let's see.

985
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,900
A Santa-sized plate of spaghetti and homemade red sauce.

986
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,660

Another Santa Marta Santa Marty as it approached Christmas in 2013 on December 15th. He wrote a little Christmas poem here for his meal

1035
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:12,380
No, no quiet no, I just introduced it chill

1036
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:20,420
You are a Grinch you are stealing from other you're Grinching mute yourself Rob Thomas had a hobnob

1037
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:33,860
This is the Santa Marty's rhyming couplet on December 15th 2013 pork and rice posted via a mobile device

1038
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,780
Wow oh my god

1039
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:46,080
That is so beautiful. What a beautiful Christmas poem. Yeah, and something I forgot about this that I wanted to cover that

1040
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,220
I just want to throw in here before we we finish

1041
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,260
Is that they do on this website have a Santa Claus oath?

1042
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:58,500
That you can take you can sign and take by proxy and I wanted to read it here

1043
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:01,740
But the creator of the of the Santa Claus oath

1044
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,180
Michael Riley

1045
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:11,780
It's very specifically states that there that it is copyrighted and you cannot read it or post it anywhere

1046
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,480
Well, and I do not want to get in trouble with them. So but just imagine a really fun Santa Claus oath

1047
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:23,340
Yeah, I also I have one I think this should be the last one we read because this is

1048
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:27,760
This I'm gonna link this to you guys. We're gonna we're gonna take this one at a time

1049
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:33,460

1055
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,100
long time ago

1056
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,740
before you were

1057
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:04,740
able to remember a

1058
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,780
child born in

1059
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:10,180
Bethlehem town to save mankind

1060
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:13,100
took his cross

1061
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,640
Saved our sins died for us

1062
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,300
Rose for us walks on water

1063
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,180
And he wondered at their disbelief

1064
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:31,700
He healed many

1065
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,700
By his stripes, we are saved.

1066
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:39,700
We are saved?

1067
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,700
We'll come again, not soon enough.

1068
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
On eagles' wings?

1069
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:48,700
Above the clouds, trumpets will sound.

1070
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,700
Angels will sing.

1071
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,700
Rain drops begin falling.

1072
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,700
On my head, sits a crown of many thorns.

1073
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,700
At his feet, which did bleed.

1074
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:08,020
bleed by his blood we are saved clean as snow pure as gold wise men did kneel

1078
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:32,700
Thrill of hope I think we have lost the storyline. I think we can end there

1079
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:39,880
Isn't that a beautiful Christmas story that was the most amazing thing I've ever heard except for Santa DBC fucking everything

01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,620
