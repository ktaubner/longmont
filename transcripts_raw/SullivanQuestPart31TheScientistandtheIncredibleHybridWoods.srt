1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
"Uh, last time on Sullivan Quest..."

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That first chapter felt real good.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I turn into some lobby.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I realize it's new Webster Hall.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's fucking Caleb.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
"You got... isn't it... it's... it... uh..."

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I press record.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
"What are we gonna do for fun this evening?"

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
"Well, Thomas, I thought we'd keep reading the Podcasters Play Video Games book."

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Why do they keep bringing up... patches?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's not important.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sullivan Quest?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sure.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Anyway, Mr. Sullivan, have you ever heard of Sullivan de Grandouille?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So the old French Sullivan explored the planet a long time ago, saw that it was good.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The bad people didn't like that, so they made the planet bad, killed French Sullivan and his frog friends.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When de Grandouille sealed the pond, he also sealed one of the seven amber shards of Anura in here as well.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,240
well. Within each shard is a fossilized fly that contains the power to restore the planet.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,940
The shards, however, are unbreakable to everything except for the Fly Eater.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,540
The key to finding the shards is in Sullivan's quest, which, as we know, was stolen by the

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,760
Board. That is, until your cousin John Carlo stole it back. Myself and the Council of Señor

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,720
Our frogs had been scrying the ephemeral pool, searching for the fly eater.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,960
We saw it could be this, so live on the frog.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,200
That's my name.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,120
The French frog wrote a book, and in that book he reveals the location of amber shards

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,160
that hold magic flies, but he secretly erased the book to hide the shards from the bad guys

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,760
because when the fly eater comes, he eats the fly, which restores the planet, which the

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,400
bad guys hate, and it also restores the book, which reveals the location of the next shard.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,640
That way, only the fly eater can truly know where the next shard is, restore the planet,

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,440
the world. That's the grave cave. The ore veins in there were supposed to be the richest in

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,800
the world, until it dried up a few centuries ago. It was a mining tycoon, Twiggy Hancock.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,800
He was the culprit. He disappeared along with the ore, and all of his goblin workers. Meanwhile,

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,800
back in Gun City. Well, no Sullivan. Hm. That's his first ever absence. That's right. Sullivan

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,820
is never absent. Something seems fishy. Sorry stepdad, those Louis C.K. burgers will have

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:26,820
to wait. I have to find my friend, even if it means leaving the city. So, Sullivan was

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:33,040
kidnapped. Can't exact my revenge if he's dead. Bullfrog. I'll get you Belinda, and once you

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:40,040
lead me to Sullivan, I'll get you both. Bullfrog the toad. My name is the nightmare assassin.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,040
If you want to exact your revenge, you can be of some assistance.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm Johnny Tetch.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I'd like to have three health potions.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Okay, yeah, that's 150 tokens, please.

42
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Can you guys make up already?

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Well, I didn't do anything except to take a call from my wife, Juna.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
I know that wasn't Juna, okay? That was Price.

45
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040
So you think I'd just start some solo career and not tell you guys?

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Well, they, uh, talk it out, you know.

47
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Well, this is it. The end of the cave.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Twiggy Hancock.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,040
The one and the same. Goblins, attack!

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,040
I am God!

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
No you're not. You're just a failed businessman who's in way over his head.

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Melinda! What are you doing here?

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,040
What do you think? I'm saving your behind.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
No!

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
We did it!

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Sullivan, look! The cave!

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Wow! It's restored!

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Why don't I join you?

59
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Really?

60
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,760
You really mean that?

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,320
Yeah, why not? Is there anything better than going on an adventure?

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,440
Well, according to Sullivan's quest, next we're headed to...

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
Follow them, and be sure to move quietly.

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Obviously. Who the fuck do you think I am?

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm Bullyfrog the Bad Guy.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm glad we resolved the underlying issue between you two,

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
and won't have to deal with anything like that again.

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,320
Before I could even do that, my phone started ringing again.

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
It was Caleb.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Hey buddy, how's it going?

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Hope you and the family are doing alright.

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm, um, I'm gonna be in town for the next week or so.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
And I was thinking we should get dinner.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Tomorrow night work for you?

75
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,320
Writing Solomon Quest was starting to get to me.

76
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I mean, don't get me wrong, it still felt better than a boxy blowjob to crank that shit out, but...

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,320
To write it at the level that satisfied me, you know, an artist,

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
demands a significant amount of time and energy,

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,320
more than I'd spent on anything in years.

80
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
With only a week to get this done, I was panicking.

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,320
I didn't pick up when Caleb called, but I listened to his voicemail after.

82
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
I was shocked by the invitation.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,320
"We have this great restaurant in Midtown that doesn't even require a badge or chip to get in after hours.

84
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Real relaxed place, pre-G holdover. I'll drop a pin."

85
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I'll drop a pin.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
I swore I'd never talk to these guys again.

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I swore they were dead to me.

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,320
That their betrayal was too vast and varied and painful.

89
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:25,320
For me to even consider the idea of perhaps, even the possibility of perhaps maybe, and very very unlikely at that potential, even think about the conceptuality of perhaps talking with them maybe.

90
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,320
But instead I got out my phone and ordered a Palantir armored pallet lift and headed

91
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
to Midtown.

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
Still, the matter at hand was finishing Solving Quest.

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
So in the car on the way there, I gave Price a call.

94
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Hey man.

95
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Hey, come on, stop.

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
I don't...

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
My Mandarin's not that good.

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
No, mine's not that good either, but you really should brush up on it, because you can swear

99
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
at Chinese waitresses.

100
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Right?

101
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I told you.

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Yeah, no, it sounds like a lot of fun, Price.

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
You can swear at Chinese waitresses, right?

104
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
I told you.

105
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,320
What's up?

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Oh, of course. Yeah, obviously, yeah.

108
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Yeah.

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Okay.

110
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,680
Um, so just a little more time.

111
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,920
Another week on top of this one.

112
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
Another week?

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Mm-hmm.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
Okay.

115
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,720
Well, so you know what, Patgy?

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,160
You called me before the deadline this time, right?

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Instead of after.

118
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,640
And, uh, as much as I'd love to see your growth and to hear that you're making progress, um,

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
I think you should just finish it.

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,640
And I'm, I don't think I'm gonna, I don't think I'm gonna be able to swing it for more time,

122
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
right?

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,760
that's in the cards this time.

124
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,400
- Come on, Bryce, that's bullshit.

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
- Yeah?

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
That's bullshit?

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,300
- Okay, fine.

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,720
- Okay, so there you go, right?

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,560
That was easy.

130
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,920
And just again, just anything that is even a little bit,

131
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,280
oh, hi, hello!

132
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,560
Sorry, all my friends came and I'm going to be doing cocaine

133
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
with all of them, my friends.

134
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Okay. - Yeah.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,880
- So yeah, just turn in anything

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,040
And, uh, just between you and me, it doesn't even have to be good.

137
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Uh, it definitely doesn't have to be a masterpiece, right?

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Just any file that I can open on my fucking laptop is gonna be just perfect, right?

139
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,080
Yep, I got it.

140
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,680
Okay, I'm waiting on that email.

141
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
Alright, alright.

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
See you, take it easy, folks.

143
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,480
Why don't you come by around 7, we can catch up.

144
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,880
No need to call back if you don't want to.

145
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
I know things ended kinda weird for us.

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I got out the car and walked across the street to the spot Caleb wanted me to go.

147
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
My mind started racing.

148
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,880
You know, Caleb and I were pretty close towards the end.

149
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,880
We were the first to get married and settle down, so...

150
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,880
We had that in common, that, um...

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Domesticity.

152
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
That shared, uh...

153
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Perspective on life, in some ways.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,880
None of that meant shit, I guess, in the end.

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,880
He was a road comic through and through, after all.

156
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,880
No ties to nobody.

157
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Just jokey, jokey jokes.

158
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,880
It's always just jokes.

159
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
Look, I love this place personally, so I'll be there regardless.

160
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,880
I walked into the Benihana and the waiter told me that Kayla was in the back.

161
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,880
I made my way past the hibachi counters avoiding airborne slop

162
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,880
and looked for the shiny bald dome of my former friend,

163
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,880
reflecting bog inflorescence amongst gaudy decor.

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
You show up, great.

165
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,880
If you don't, hey, that's life.

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
Miss you, man.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
Hope to see you soon.

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I found him.

169
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
No shit.

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Caleb?

171
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
I didn't think you'd show.

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
Me neither.

173
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Well it's good to see you man. Come sit down.

174
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,880
I'll stand.

175
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Okay.

176
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Well, you look good.

177
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
No I don't.

178
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
How'd you know I was in New York?

179
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Wild guess.

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Also, I saw you at my show.

181
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
You did?

182
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Well yeah, you started screaming and convulsing on the floor about betrayal.

183
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
And someone named Tina and Price and then security came and you ran out.

184
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
That's not how I remember it.

185
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
And maybe that's the issue here.

186
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,080
The way we remember things, you know?

187
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
I don't follow.

188
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,880
How's the wife?

189
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Good. Fine.

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
And the kids?

191
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,180
Good, yeah.

192
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,880
That's great to hear, buddy.

193
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,380
You know, childcare in this province...

194
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,480
And here, look at the menu.

195
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,180
I recommend steak if you're getting hibachi, which you gotta get it.

196
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
But yeah, childcare.

197
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,380
It's tricky because you send these kids to the daycare, right?

198
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,060
Providence provides it, great, sure.

199
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,380
But then they come back and they speak Mandarin, which...

200
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,260
Also good, but then I don't speak it.

201
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,300
You?

202
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,260
Not really.

203
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,100
Exactly.

204
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,060
I'm trying to learn it over the next couple months.

205
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,760
Hoping it helps me with a new special.

206
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,260
Why did you invite me here?

207
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:58,640
Let's order first, okay?

208
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
How are you doing today?

209
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,820
My name is Lu Shi Xin and I'll be your server for this evening.

210
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,240
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

211
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,160
Is that your real name?

212
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,440
Blue Shi Shen?

213
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
Why yes sir it is!

214
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Crazy, see?

215
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,680
Just crazy.

216
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,360
No offense, it's a lovely name.

217
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,000
We're pre-Xi so we're just not used to it.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,960
Of course sir.

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,880
I think we're ready to order though.

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,840
Right Patches?

221
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah.

222
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,440
Great!

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,480
What will you be having?

224
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,040
I'll have the Yakisoba to start,

225
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
then the Hibachi Steak,

226
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,480
and a Bud Light.

227
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,560
I'll take a bowl of rice and a Mike's Heart.

228
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,520
Alright.

229
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,120
Would you like to take a seat as well sir?

230
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
Nope.

231
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Okay, great. The chef will be right over for your hibachi.

232
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Watching your figure? Pretty much anything outside nutrition supplements fucks up my stomach.

233
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
So you're just full of supplements now?

234
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
It's easier.

235
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Do you remember when we were in Tokyo and Pat ordered...

236
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Pat ordered a... what looked like a live squid?

237
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
And he started crying?

238
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Yeah. Yeah.

239
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,720
and now we can even go to tokyo middle open up it's just until the men and men

240
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,340
are dealt with

241
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,900
yet they have enough actual military guys now you know

242
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,800
i don't know when it'll end

243
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,900
the fuck anyway it's useless fight

244
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,340
hi my name is matthew and i'll be a chef for this evening hell yeah now we're talking

245
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:27,340
watch when he does a volcano thing okay

246
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,340
(music playing)

247
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
Look, can you just tell me what this is about?

248
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I got a lot of stuff going on and this is...

249
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Ugh, it's like whatever.

250
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,340
Alright, fine.

251
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,340
But you have to promise you don't do whatever it is you did at New Webster, okay?

252
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
I don't even know what I did there, so I guess I can't promise anything.

253
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
And what do I owe you?

254
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Exactly. What promise do I owe you?

255
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
Man, see, I don't know what you're talking about.

256
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
The betrayal!

257
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Come on, man.

258
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:02,400
The betrayal you guys fucked me. No we didn't nobody fucking coordinated effort to

259
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:08,760
That's no that's not what happened is this the Steve Harvey thing more than that you know it patches patches

260
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,860
Please just calm don't you tell me to calm down look look look okay, okay?

261
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,140
Let's just

262
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,060
Do you want to talk about?

263
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,060
the betrayal

264
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,780
Don't know

265
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay, well let me just say what I was gonna say and then if you're feeling it we can talk about it, okay?

266
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,800
Okay

267
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,080
Fine

268
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,620
Good

269
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,920
so

270
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,100
How do you feel about Vegas? Neutral

271
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,540
right

272
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,540
How about the four of us?

273
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,980
performing in Vegas

274
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,740
How about the first ever podcast residency in Vegas?

275
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
You're kidding. No, I'm not.

276
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Caesars Palace Presents Podcast About This.

277
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,420
The first ever podcast residency.

278
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,420
I think I can make it happen for us.

279
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,420
I was just gonna ask Cam and Pat, but seeing you drool and curse on the floor of a theater

280
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
reminded me that you were also in the group.

281
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I think it could be really fun, man.

282
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
We could do it as long as it makes us money.

283
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,420
I don't know, my family is...

284
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
They can come, or they can stay here. We can figure that out.

285
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,420
I'm in the middle of working on something too, so...

286
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,420
The audio novel? Price told me.

287
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,420
You can finish that up and then do the residency.

288
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,420
I'm not going to be able to put everything together right away, and you can work on that from anywhere.

289
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
Sure.

290
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Look man, I know this is a good opportunity for you. I'm not stupid.

291
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
So what do you say?

292
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:49,420
I can't do it.

293
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
You don't mean that.

294
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
I won't do it.

295
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,920
Exactly.

296
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,420
Fuck you.

297
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Man, what is your problem?

298
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,420
I mean, like, if you don't want to do it because of this or that, but like, I don't even know what you're mad about.

299
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Nobody can figure it out.

300
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
It's because nobody understands it!

301
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Yes, nobody understands it. I'm giving you an opportunity, and you're acting like a freak.

302
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,420
I don't need your opportunity.

303
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,420
Yes, you do. All this shit is painfully obvious. You're a fucking disaster.

304
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,420
Fuck you, fuck the podcast, and fuck this restaurant. I'm out.

305
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,420
You have my number if you change your mind, asshole.

306
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,420
And June is fine, thanks for asking.

307
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
What are you looking at?

308
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Keep flippin' the meat around.

309
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:41,420
I got a pal and left home as fast as I could.

310
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,420
I should've known he'd lure me into something like that.

311
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,420
No apology, no recognition, no nothing.

312
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,380
Just wants to talk about it like an asshole

313
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,020
Like an asshole who doesn't know what he did

314
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,580
They all did what they did

315
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:01,600
The thing they did the thing that they that they did that thing

316
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,860
I pressed record

317
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,700
Good evening young Tannis

318
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,300
Sorry, Uncle Jake. I don't mean to make all these

319
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,700
disgusting noises around you.

320
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,060
My illness...

321
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,940
Your illness is no reflection on you, Thomas. Whether you fight to defeat this disease,

322
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,500
well, that is the measure of a man.

323
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,340
But I'm just a little boy, Uncle Jake.

324
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,880
A boy is merely the first stage of becoming a man. You must

325
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:49,740
of yourself beyond your own life. For sure. Well you for sure right my little Timmy Tommy.

326
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,780
Now where were we in Podcasters Play Vigi Games?

327
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,660
Hey Pete, where's Caleb?

328
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
He's out with Price.

329
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,140
He'll be here later.

330
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,740
Oh, alright.

331
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,700
I brought Sullivan Quest.

332
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,100
You can start this time if you want.

333
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
Obviously I do.

334
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Alright, get it going.

335
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,060
I'm uh, gonna get a fizzy drink.

336
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
You want one?

337
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
I'll have a fizzy drink.

338
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:32,060
[MUSIC]

339
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:48,220
Come on, Sully, what does Sullivan Quest say?

340
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,860
Where do we go next?

341
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
Well it says...

342
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,860
I see on the horizon a lush and magnificent forest.

343
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,860
I wonder what kinds of wildlife grows there.

344
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,860
I wonder what miracles will await me further on this wonderful, glorious planet deep under.

345
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,860
I must follow the grazing patterns of the magnificent animals to find my way there.

346
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,860
It will be a long journey, but worth it, I'm sure.

347
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,860
Well there aren't any animals around here.

348
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,360
They're pretty much all either dead or penned up.

349
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,540
Hmm, well is there a forest nearby?

350
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,340
Don't you ever pay any attention in school, Sullivan?

351
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,940
Not really, but I try really, really hard.

352
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,140
Well nearby is the No-No Woods.

353
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,820
According to what we learned in school, it's always been barren.

354
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,940
But I'm thinking based on how amazing the Crave Cave is and was, that's another lie from

355
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Gun City.

356
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,340
Well let's head on over there.

357
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,020
There's a town nearby too.

358
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,300
No no Hamlet, I'm sure we could go there while we search for the amber in the forest.

359
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,780
Let's hop on my little hacker's Vespa and get going.

360
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,500
Whoa, you have a Vespa?

361
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Of course!

362
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,900
What, you think I'd walk over here?

363
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,160
There's dozens of dangerous monsters.

364
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,380
What dope would walk through all of this?

365
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
Definitely not me.

366
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Let's go!

367
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Alright, I'll just select Vespa in the inventory now that I'm on the world map.

368
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,260
Alright!

369
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,180
Vespa controls are up to accelerate, back to brake, and then turn left and right with the

370
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,100
shoulder buttons. While on the vehicle you won't encounter any random battles.

371
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,420
Wow, neat!

372
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,740
Now let's get driving! The Gun City Super Highway is just a bit east of here. Let's take it to

373
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:41,740
to Nono Hamlet.

374
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,580
It'll be a lot easier to get to Nono this way.

375
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,140
Definitely better than staying in the world map.

376
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,700
With all those monsters.

377
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Uh oh, we got commuters headed to Gun City for work.

378
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,540
(car honks)

379
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,240
- Boy, you have butt too dry

380
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,700
'cause you're farting all over the road.

381
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,380
- Sorry!

382
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,780
- Piece of cake.

383
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,880
Uh-oh, here comes some more.

384
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,700
- I got fizzy drinks.

385
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,500
- Wait, Pete, did you know this game has multiplayer?

386
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,420
- It does?

387
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,000
- Yeah, the instruction manual says

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,020
it can be up to four players for battles.

389
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,100
- Whoa, instruction manual?

390
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,420
- Dude, this is sick.

391
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,580
Okay, plug in a controller.

392
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,340
You can control Belinda.

393
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
No way, no.

394
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,740
No, I have to beat Sullivan, I'm not a girl.

395
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,200
Okay, but if I'm controlling out of combat it's going to default to me controlling Sullivan

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,580
and any new party member not assigned to another player.

397
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,740
Just hand me the controller when the battle starts then.

398
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Done.

399
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,740
Okay, fine.

400
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,060
Belinda's probably too complicated for you anyway.

401
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,220
She has a lot of utility moves through her Lil Hacker's augments.

402
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm not a girl.

403
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,580
There's too many commuters!

404
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,580
What do we do?

405
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,380
Wait, Sullivan! Didn't you unlock a new frog art when you swallowed the fly in the Crave Cave?

406
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,580
Why don't you try using it on those commuters?

407
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,080
Oh yeah! Good idea!

408
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,580
Sonic Blast!

409
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Whoa, it's working! The commuters are parting!

410
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,080
Way to go, Sully!

411
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,880
You can use that frog art out of combat when it gets real congested.

412
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,580
Cool!

413
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,080
Wait...

414
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,580
Who is that?

415
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,080
Is that...

416
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

417
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Sullivan the Clawed and Belinda the...

418
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
The...

419
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Belinda the fucking stupid.

420
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
What do you want, Bullyfrog?

421
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,780
What any well-adjusted amphibian wants.

422
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,080
REVENGE!

423
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:49,280
Good luck while fighting on the road.

424
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Vroom!

425
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,080
Bleh!

426
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,680
Ugh!

427
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,880
I don't remember Bullyfrog having that attack.

428
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,580
Guess he learned some new tricks since we last ran into him.

429
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,620
Thanks to the Nightmare Assassin, I'm really strong!

430
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,140
And that's how I'll kill you!

431
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,660
The Nightmare Assassin?

432
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,460
That's the guy you told me about who works for the board!

433
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
Exactly, the very one!

434
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,740
Well let's not mess around then.

435
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,620
Agreed.

436
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,140
Pete, you're up.

437
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm just gonna use the frog art.

438
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,460
No, don't waste frog power!

439
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,060
When it's my round I can scan him and then we can see if physical attacks or arts are best.

440
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,820
Come on, just let me try it!

441
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,580
Fine, do whatever you want.

442
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,660
I am Sullivan.

443
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm not bringing plans!

444
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
AHH! What the hell was that?

445
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Told you!

446
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Frog art magic guys!

447
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
AHH!

448
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Oh man! How did you guys figure out how to do such cool stuff?

449
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,660
You're not gonna stop us Bully Frog!

450
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,660
What is that?

451
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Bully Frog what did you do?

452
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
I didn't do anything!

453
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Woah woah woah!

454
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,660
M-m-m-m-monster on the road!

455
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
What the heck is that?

456
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Some kind of lion, fox, pelican, turtle, bear, tiger?

457
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
I can't make sense of it!

458
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
Looks incredible!

459
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Phew! It's gone.

460
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,660
Now, back to our fight!

461
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Retreat for now, Bloody Frog. I have the information I need.

462
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,460
But... what? But I almost got them!

463
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Enough, Trader! Fade back!

464
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
You'll fight them another day!

465
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Ugh... fine.

466
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,460
Well, it seems I have more important things to do than waste my time with you losers.

467
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,460
Have fun on your little road trip.

468
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,460
It'll be your last.

469
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Man, that was close.

470
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
Look! The town is just up ahead!

471
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,100
Thank goodness, now I can use some rest.

472
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,420
So this is No No Hamlet.

473
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,540
Yep, it was a lumber town back when the Gun City civilization was just settling on the planet.

474
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,340
Of course, with the mass production of synthetic wood, there's no need for whatever scant lumber

475
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,260
remains. Cool! Now it's an industrial lower middle class cyber slum. Some people have cell phones and

476
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:21,660
cars but do they have heat? Only 47% according to my little hackers demographic enumerator.

477
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,740
There's a frog folk population of roughly 1.2%. The rest are humans or human adjacent. No non

478
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:34,660
folk races. Okay. And the famous no no woods completely dead looms nearby. A sorry sight.

479
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,180
Also I downloaded a map for us to use with my little hackers map downloading program.

480
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Let's head to the interrest. All right. Let's go. Oh, I also have my little hackers sand

481
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,460
and my little hacker's USB charger,

482
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,540
my little hacker's glasses,

483
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,900
my little hacker's flashlight,

484
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,740
my little hacker's shoes,

485
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,820
- Pat, pick up your phone, come on.

486
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,260
- Okay, okay, okay.

487
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,380
- I mean Pete.

488
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,460
- My little hacker's gun.

489
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,980
- Yeah.

490
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,820
Hey.

491
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,900
Yeah, yeah.

492
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,020
Yeah, yeah.

493
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,220
Hey.

494
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,700
Yeah.

495
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,820
Yeah, we're at cams.

496
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,660
Yeah, okay.

497
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,100
So what are you wearing?

498
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
That was Caleb.

499
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,620
He said keep playing without him, he'll be over here in a bit.

500
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,620
Big news apparently.

501
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
Great.

502
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,620
Pardon me, I didn't see you there, little frog.

503
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,220
Oh, that's alright.

504
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,500
Have a nice life.

505
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,220
Wait, wait, wait, please allow me to introduce myself.

506
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,660
My name is Light and Red.

507
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
I'm Sullivan.

508
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Nice to meet you.

509
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,160
And you are a frog, no?

510
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Yeah, frog folk.

511
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,900
This is most excellent.

512
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,500
You see, sort of an Irish scientist who specializes in helping animals like yourself.

513
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,220
Well, I'm not exactly an animal.

514
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,580
As semantics, you're unique.

515
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,260
You have an important quality.

516
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,780
Ah, and who is this?

517
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Another froggy.

518
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Mm-hmm.

519
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,900
Well, I see I've taken up too much of your time.

520
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,400
But if you ever wish to talk with me about...

521
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,860
science...

522
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,860
You'll find me in my laboratory.

523
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,620
Congrad students!

524
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Toodaloo, froggy!

525
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,380
Goodbye! Goodbye, grad students!

526
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,540
Wow, first person we met here and he seemed real nice.

527
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,560
Not so sure about that, Sully. In any case, let's head to the inn.

528
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,540
Wait, this town seems cool. Go talk to some people.

529
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,740
No, we should rest up at the inn. No reason to talk to NPCs here, probably.

530
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,140
Maybe there is. I don't know, I'm just saying.

531
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:58,540
Hi there, welcome to the No-No Hamlet Hotel. Would you like a room?

532
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,640
Two rooms, please.

533
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,340
Wonderful. That's one room with two beds and no bathrooms.

534
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,240
Did you want a treasure chest in your room?

535
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,040
Uh, s-sure, I guess.

536
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Great, let me just put that in there, the system.

537
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Can we please have a bathroom?

538
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Hey, trust me pal, you don't even want a bathroom.

539
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
All kinds of strange noises have been coming out of the plumbing lately.

540
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
What do you mean?

541
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Look, speculation is above my pay grade, man.

542
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Aren't you the innkeeper?

543
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Innkeeper?

544
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Man, it's a hotel, I just work the desk.

545
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Okay, and you're all set.

546
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
That'll be five tokens.

547
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Have a great stay.

548
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Alright.

549
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,640
Should we head to the No No Woods then?

550
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Sounds like a plan.

551
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,120
Oh look!

552
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,440
Some kind of leader of the town is giving a speech.

553
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,160
Now as the mayor, which is a kind of leader of the town, it is my job to understand what

554
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,600
is going on in No-No Hamlet.

555
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,400
And from this here vantage point I can very well see that times are tough.

556
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,280
And things haven't been going so well, and there are no jobs, no future, and it's one

557
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,600
of the worst possible times to be alive and sentient in our town's history.

558
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
I hate being sentient!

559
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,040
Oh, this town has already damned that boy!

560
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,480
Oh, that sounds weird!

561
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,280
I gotta make that commute to Gun City one more time.

562
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,280
I am gonna utilize some kind of weapon on just about everyone.

563
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,580
Hey now, cut that out or we'll have the Gun City secret police here.

564
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,280
Now I understand your pain.

565
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,780
Like I said, as the mayor it is my job to understand how bad everything is.

566
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,780
But it is also my job as mayor if you'd let me finish to make things better.

567
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,980
[Groans]

568
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,380
And things will be better soon, thanks to a recent addition to No-No Hamlet.

569
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,980
Our esteemed guest resident, famed scientist coming all the way from Gun City,

570
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,980
Dr. Leiden Dredd and his wonderful research team.

571
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,980
That's a pathetic, quiet student, uh, servants.

572
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,480
Not wonderful research team.

573
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,980
It's that guy we bumped into.

574
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:29,680
Dr. Dredd and his servants have been here for the past few weeks analyzing our wounds,

575
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,020
And they have come to the conclusion that we are a prime candidate for a massive injection of capital,

576
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,720
courtesy of the board.

577
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,060
The board!

578
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,820
And this capital, along with Dr. Dredd's ingenious experiments,

579
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,360
will be used to revitalize No-No Woods back to its semi-adequate glory of yesteryear.

580
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,160
But I'll let Dr. Dredd speak for himself.

581
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,080
Thank you, Mayor Sherman.

582
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,580
And, uh, guten tag, No-No Hamlet.

583
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:04,140
I've been on scientists for over 30 years specializing in the field of biological phenomenology and eugenics in air quotes

584
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,980
My work has done wonders for the millions who live in gun city

585
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:16,580
And I am quite thrilled to provide the same benefits to your lovely hand by experimenting on the bizarre

586
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,820
brilliant energies

587
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,820
emanating from your nano volts.

588
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,820
What experiments are you doing?

589
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,820
I'm glad you asked

590
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,640
Let me show you just a fraction of my work. You see our analysts picked up some

591
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,940
Fascinating energy coming from your vultures and we've set to work on replicating it

592
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:43,100
Here grad student bring out the Venus milk truck

593
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,940
Hey, that's a plant with boobs

594
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Others to be perfectly pedantic and a venus fly trap for the immortal.

595
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:03,160
You see there is a massive potential to create all manner of creatures with just a little bit of ingenuity and a smidgen of radical reappraisal of what constitutes life.

596
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,160
See here, a coochie coochie coo, a coochie coochie coo.

597
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
There's milk in the boil!

598
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Here, try some of this milk.

599
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,160
That's good!

600
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Hey, I don't give an ass!

601
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:25,160
The foods will soon be full of these hybrid creatures, never before seen on Ebor.

602
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:33,160
And you, Nuno Hamlet, will supply the city, Gond City, with delicacies.

603
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,160
And they will supply you with ooters and ooters of tokens.

604
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:47,960
I shall restore this land and wrest industry, progress, and tourism from its ancient loins

605
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,760
and rightly grant these benefits to your esteemed population.

606
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:59,640
While here, my team and I have created enough Venus Milk Trucks for everyone on the house

607
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,040
courtesy of the Board.

608
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,480
Isn't that wonderful?

609
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Now you all see that with Dr. Dredd's help, No-No Hamlet will be a burgeoning locale.

610
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Dr. Dredd, I would like to preemptively give you a medal for the contributions you'll most certainly be making to No-No Hamlet,

611
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,480
as a show of good faith and fulfillment of a contractual agreement with the board.

612
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Hmm. Well, he's talking about restoring the land, making the town a better place. Maybe he's not so bad.

613
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,480
I don't know. Something still feels off, Sully.

614
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Remember, this is the board we're talking about.

615
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,980
I suppose so.

616
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,480
Now let me just find this medal to put around your neck.

617
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,980
Well, it seems I've misplaced it.

618
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,480
No, you haven't!

619
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,980
Oh, it's the mayor's kid.

620
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,480
Yes, it is I, Indio Parsley.

621
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,480
I've stolen your medal, a symbol of corporate greed and obsequiousness.

622
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,800
Then, in a further symbolic gesture, I use the ribbon from the metal to tie myself to

623
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,400
this tree, which you will never chop down.

624
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,680
Plus, I have released all the animals from captivity, including the injured ones.

625
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:22,520
And I won't stop doing any of these things until our town is free from this corporate

626
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
stew.

627
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,720
I told you, no one is chopping down that tree.

628
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
The wounded animals-

629
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,000
I will not answer to that name, father! It's bad vibes!

630
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,720
Doctor, just know that you and your team, your servants, have been awarded a medal and that I'll have a replacement made soon.

631
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,520
And this town does appreciate your efforts and the wealth you can bring it.

632
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,960
And I do apologize for the interruption of my foolish but well-intentioned son.

633
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,640
Of course, of course, I understand the rebelliousness of you.

634
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:00,120
I remember those days of mine own, trying new experiments that nobody would try.

635
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:10,600
Being laughed out of lecture halls by small minded cretins who didn't understand my ideas.

636
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,520
I hope your son and I can find common ground one day.

637
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,520
After all, we seem to share a love of the planet and what it can provide.

638
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,720
You know nothing of decency and mindful compassion.

639
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,080
You are the snake charmer coaxing dark juju from E-Bomb's soul with your crude experiments.

640
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,480
The planet rides in pain at your every touch.

641
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,640
You are a man cut from the spirit of sin.

642
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,080
You are a fuck, but I still call you brother.

643
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,880
Okay, thank you all who attended.

644
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,000
Please carry on your day.

645
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,840
Remember, no no says yes yes to prosperity.

646
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,480
One day dad, you will understand that this injustice cannot continue and all of you here,

647
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,040
we must stand together or we hold no hope against the avarice of gun city.

648
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,800
Oh hey, no, wait, hey, hey, hold on everybody.

649
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,760
Wait, oh man, could somebody cut me down?

650
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Shit!

651
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,560
Come on, let's help that guy get down from the tree he tied himself to.

652
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,820
Alright, I'll use my little hacker's, uh, I thought I downloaded the little hacker's

653
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,260
There's a lot of rescue pack.

654
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,740
Never mind, I'll just hop up there and help him.

655
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,740
This guy looks weird.

656
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,460
He's like a purple-y guy like his dad.

657
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,620
Just the kind of guy they have in this world.

658
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,060
He's like Dr. Manhattan with blonde dreads.

659
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,340
I'm getting another drink.

660
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,260
You want more fizzy?

661
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,380
Grape, please.

662
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,340
Okay, just keep playing so we can get past this cut scene.

663
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,420
Okay.

664
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,260
Okay.

665
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,100
Okay.

666
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,920
Okay.

667
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,760
All right.

668
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,580
Okay.

669
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,220
One fizzy drink coming up, buddy.

670
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,060
Open wide.

671
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,860
- Phew, this sure is a tall tree.

672
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,300
Hey, can I help you down?

673
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,060
- Oh, yes, thank you.

674
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,180
Bless you, brother.

675
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,860
- Are you all right?

676
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,980
- I'm good, man, all vibes.

677
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,620
Now, who are you guys?

678
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,460
- I'm Sullivan, and this is Belinda.

679
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,140
We're travelers.

680
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,100
- Adventurers.

681
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,140
- Yeah, and we're trying to restore life to the planet.

682
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Oh, that is so fucked.

683
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Oh, okay, that's...

684
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
Okay, you're getting close to me.

685
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,140
That is exactly what I want to do.

686
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Oh, phew, okay.

687
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:32,140
My given name is Rex Sherman III, but my chosen name is Indio Parsley.

688
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,140
I am a warrior and an agent of socio-ecological empathy.

689
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,140
My dad is the mayor, and the richest guy in town.

690
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
He hates my music.

691
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
Let me join your radical crew.

692
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,640
I promise to help you restore E-Bomb to her natural glory.

693
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Yes! Join us!

694
00:35:51,640 --> 00:36:05,140
Now that we are a unit, please let us hold hands.

695
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Okay...

696
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,640
Then repeat after me.

697
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,140
We are siblings in the conflict of the universe.

698
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
We are siblings in the conflict of the universe.

699
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,240
Radical inclusion and decommodification strengthen us against our would-be oppressors and forge

700
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,040
us a blade of decency.

701
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,240
And the will of the righteous soul that flows through us like Zephyr, our eternal western

702
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,320
wind spirit of the material plane.

703
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,320
For we don't need effects of those corrupted by the inherent greed intertwined with modern

704
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,040
structures of capital.

705
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,840
Radical inclusion and decommodification

706
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,340
strengthen us against our would-be oppressors

707
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,540
and forge us a blade of decency

708
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,540
in the law of the righteous...

709
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,540
So, I wield a walking staff carved from ancient wood

710
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,540
and with my dashiki I can sometimes deflect ranged attacks.

711
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,040
I also can use my forage ability to scrounge up a random herb

712
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,540
with healing or poisoning properties

713
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,540
and a chakra beam to do elemental damage on multiple targets.

714
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,040
Wow, neat!

715
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,320
Welcome to the team, Rex...uh, Indio.

716
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,960
We're trying to head into the Nona Woods to find a lost artifact to help restore the planet.

717
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,840
You think you can help us navigate the woods?

718
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,320
Of course!

719
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,840
My band and I are always practicing music in the woods, trying to heal E-Bomb with song.

720
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Do you want to know more about my band?

721
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Pete!

722
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,980
What if his band is cool?

723
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,720
You know his band isn't cool.

724
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Fine.

725
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Yes!

726
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Sorry.

727
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
I'm a fan.

728
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:51,440
a drink. Oh! Nice! We're called Mystic Melon Wonderful. Not Wonderful, Wonderfall. See?

729
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,900
It's like a psychedelic improvisational sort of jazz-ophonic. So Tyler, Lee, and Gumby

730
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,800
all play the same drum. And this one track we laid down, Pilot Magistrate Windsong, is

731
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,760
like bow bow and then like monkey comes in with the bass like chika bow chika bow

732
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,120
chika bow and then I come in on the digital sack

733
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,760
raise shots of Parliament best of us come bring me down jaw then we all chant

734
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,080
women of the world for the last 10 minutes even though my dad paid for the

735
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:31,040
studio space he said the music is obviously bad what a jerk right yes

736
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,240
Anyway, if you ever want to talk about my band, just click the interact button when you're

737
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
next to me.

738
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,480
I'll be following behind you and Belinda.

739
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,960
Will do Indio.

740
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
Let's head towards the woods and find that amber shard.

741
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,720
No one's allowed in.

742
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,360
Hey, no one's allowed in.

743
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,880
Hey, don't you...

744
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Stop that.

745
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
That's just some corporate jamoke that works for my dad.

746
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Allow me.

747
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Hey, brother.

748
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Hello, Rex.

749
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
Indio.

750
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Of course, Indio.

751
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
What can I do for you?

752
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,880
My compadres and I are invested in entering the woods and absorbing the energies therein.

753
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
May we pass?

754
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Parsley. We're under strict orders from your father to allow no one in the woods while Dr. Dredd is performing his work.

755
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Hmm, if you say so. Thank you, brother.

756
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,880
What do we do? Should we sneak in?

757
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
One guard can't stop us.

758
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
Alright, let's try to go around.

759
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Dude, you're walking by all these guards.

760
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,880
What? You want me to talk to them?

761
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
I don't know, yeah.

762
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
We're literally trying to sneak around them.

763
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Sometimes they're actually really friendly or they have an item on them or they're different.

764
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Usually they at least have a different coloring in that case.

765
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,880
In that case, let's just try to find an entrance into the woods.

766
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Oh no! There's an invisible cyber barrier, like the one outside of Goon City, and it's keeping us out of the woods.

767
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,880
We need to go to Dr. Dredd's lab. I bet we can get some answers there.

768
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Where is it?

769
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,880
It should be underneath City Hall, where my dad works.

770
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
I happen to know a way in through the emergency exit through the sewers.

771
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,880
But first, we'll have to get the key on the other side of town so that you can see the whole town.

772
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Otherwise, you won't see the whole town the devs designed for you.

773
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
Okay, okay. Let's do it!

774
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Interesting. Seems Sullivan has a new friend.

775
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,880
A weird dirty purple guy.

776
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,880
I better go warn the scientist about what's going on.

777
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Oh, I love my little Venus Melt Drug.

778
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
That milk is so good.

779
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I thought we could sell this.

780
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,880
These people don't understand. Hybrid creatures aren't even new.

781
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,880
What do you mean? I don't see anything about hybrid creatures in my little hacker's bestiary.

782
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,880
That's because the board doesn't want you to know, man.

783
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,880
They've been controlling Gun City forever.

784
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,880
An oligarchical corporate kleptocracy designed to maximize profits for themselves

785
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
and destroy the will of its citizens.

786
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,880
My dad was a corporate operative for Asus for a long time.

787
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
I wonder if he knew about any of this.

788
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I don't know. Dads are evil.

789
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Oh, look! Here!

790
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,880
The key is behind that bush.

791
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,880
Okay, I'll get it.

792
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,880
It's one of those plants!

793
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
Wow!

794
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:53,880
It's running away and hiding behind different objects in town!

795
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,280
My little hackers and Vestagoggles can help!

796
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,240
Press Y to enter sleuth mode!

797
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Nice!

798
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,080
And hit A to interact when you think you're next to the plant!

799
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,560
Can you handle this?

800
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,000
I drank way too much fizzy drink.

801
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,880
I have to go pee!

802
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Yeah, yeah, sure.

803
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Oh yeah, I should get gear.

804
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Ugh, fine.

805
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,880
So I went home, now it's going by the old run down logging factory.

806
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,880
Man, this town is fucking sad.

807
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:53,880
This town, what a dump.

808
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,880
If only things were like they once were.

809
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Sometimes I just like to take my little brother here to play.

810
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,880
It's better to be out of the house when my mom starts drinking.

811
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,880
Is that why you're here too?

812
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Damn.

813
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
Wow.

814
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,880
The mayor really did try to reopen the logging factory,

815
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,880
but the woods haven't been able to grow nothing good in decades.

816
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:26,880
My father, his father, his father's father, and his father's father's father worked right here in No-No Hamlet.

817
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Now I commute to Gun City every day to sell...

818
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,880
VR ad space to board-approved brands.

819
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,720
I got paid about half as much as my dad did working right here.

820
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,240
What a world, huh?

821
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,960
Pete, what are you doing?

822
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Just go get the plant!

823
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Hold on, man.

824
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,960
All these guys have little stories.

825
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Yeah, sure.

826
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,640
Give me the controller.

827
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,880
You know, Patches would love to chat up NPCs.

828
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,760
Yeah, well, I don't.

829
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,880
And Pete just starts bawling right there like, "Oh Patches!

830
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh Patches!"

831
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,600
Does this not move you, Thomas?

832
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,200
Yeah, yeah, it does.

833
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,120
It seems like a weird way to behave.

834
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:26,080
When a comrade falls, there's nothing strange nor feminine in expressing your emotions, young

835
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
Thomas.

836
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,080
I understand.

837
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:36,640
I can see him!

838
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
He's behind that wall!

839
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,920
Then it's time for my sonic blast!

840
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Found you!

841
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Wow!

842
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,080
He coughed up the key!

843
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Nice!

844
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,440
Now we can open the sewers!

845
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,440
Let's go!

846
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Okay, the sewers are just this way.

847
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:15,440
Oh, this is really gross.

848
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,440
No, you need to re-frame your thinking Belinda.

849
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,440
This is the people's waste.

850
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,440
The waste of our brothers and our sisters.

851
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,440
We should embrace it, bask in the stench.

852
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
Let's just try to get out of here and get to Dredd's lab.

853
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,440
Maybe if we confront him he'll answer some questions.

854
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:44,440
So monsters, these look like rats with bug wings and they have a flower growing out of their head.

855
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Another hybrid creature.

856
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
Probably scared out of its wits by its own freakish existence.

857
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Death will be mercy.

858
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Whoa, so I can kill the new guy?

859
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,440
No.

860
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Well, I'm first player when we battle, so it should default to me anyway.

861
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Yeah, so you're gonna give it back when it goes to him until Caleb shows up.

862
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,440
That's so annoying.

863
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
You did the exact same thing to me, pretty much.

864
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
No, I didn't.

865
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Hold on, we should really stretch before fighting.

866
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Allows for energy to flow.

867
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,440
They're actually making me skip his turn so he can stretch?

868
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,600
They're actually making me skip his turn so he can stretch.

869
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,840
Keep doing that! It seems to work on these guys.

870
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:36,800
You should pick Chakra Beam. Are you gonna pick Chakra Beam?

871
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:45,680
Nice. I love Chakra Beam.

872
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,340
(phone ringing)

873
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,980
- Level up.

874
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,040
- Yeah!

875
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,160
- We're at a fizzy drink.

876
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,000
I'm gonna go get some.

877
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,520
Just hold up until I get back.

878
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,480
It's still my turn. - Oh, come on.

879
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,640
- Just go on your phone, man.

880
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,360
I'll be back in like five minutes.

881
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,200
- Fine.

882
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,840
Remember to get grape, okay?

883
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,960
- No promises.

884
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,600
- And a promise is a promise.

885
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,640
Repeat that.

886
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,840
A promise is a promise.

887
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,600
And committing to that is key, young Thomas.

888
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:27,120
It is how you will elevate not only yourself, but the collective as well.

889
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,840
It is the integrity of such...

890
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
Oh...

891
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Oh...

892
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Oh...

893
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Oh...

894
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:40,240
Well, the integrity of my bowels seems to have been called into question.

895
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,280
I'll be right back.

896
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,480
Now don't you go reading ahead, young Thomas.

897
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,480
I won't.

898
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
Okay.

899
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Now...

900
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,480
Let's see here.

901
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,480
Great work team! Let's keep going!

902
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,480
Indio, earlier you were saying that hybrid creatures are new.

903
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,480
What did you mean?

904
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,480
With my friends and I jam out in the woods,

905
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Sometimes we see like birds with little antennae and stuff.

906
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
Or a vine covered in fur.

907
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,480
No scientist necessary.

908
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Usually we're on some extremely intense psychedelics though,

909
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,480
so nobody really believes me or my friends.

910
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,480
We saw a real massive hybrid on our way here.

911
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
You saw Roger?

912
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
Roger?

913
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
That's Roger!

914
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,480
The biggest hybrid in the woods!

915
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:41,480
Monkey once swore he saw him while he was tripping and even we told him to fuck off.

916
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,480
That's insane man. Monkey's gonna be stoked.

917
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,480
Did you guys see these creatures before dread came a few weeks ago?

918
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Definitely. And the few we saw were always really peaceful, if a bit skittish.

919
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,480
That Venus milk truck and those rat things have really bad vibes.

920
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,480
The parts mashed together is like, like forcing a collab, you know?

921
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Don't I know it.

922
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:11,480
There's so many extra lines in here. Where did these come from?

923
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:21,480
Yo, Sullivan. Hey, bro to bro, Belinda is super hot. Nice work.

924
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,480
Oh, uh, no. We're just friends.

925
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,480
No, dude, seriously. The best intimate coupling of my life was with this girl Sky C.

926
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,320
We stared into each other's eyes for like a week, but then she had to go back to work

927
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,440
doing UX design for a defense contractor.

928
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,840
I'm getting very similar vibes from Belinda.

929
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,800
Great, thank you.

930
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,280
Kiki, kiki, kiki.

931
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,840
Who's it from?

932
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,480
Ah, it's Sullivan McCloud himself and his new best friend, Purple Guy.

933
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,040
Easy brother, we are all children of the universe.

934
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,040
We travel the same ley lines as our forebears, and sup from the same mother's mill.

935
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,040
What the fuck are you talking about?

936
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,040
Why are you working for the Nightmare Assassin anyway, Bullyfrog?

937
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,040
How could you stoop so low?

938
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,040
Maybe I am that low.

939
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:21,040
Maybe I'm the lowest, stinkiest, creepiest, twerp of all time.

940
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,040
You ever think of that?

941
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
No! I just thought you had a bad homework!

942
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,880
We need to get to Dredd's lab, Bullyfrog.

943
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
We have to restore the woods.

944
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Restore the woods?

945
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
Ha ha ha!

946
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Don't make me laugh.

947
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,920
You two have always been such goody goodies.

948
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:43,560
The world is a harsh place with fathers who hurt you, who call you lame, and make fun of

949
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
your creative endeavors.

950
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
You two.

951
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Shut up!

952
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Well, it looks like the ultimate sewer hybrid is here.

953
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
The ultimate sewer hybrid?

954
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:01,640
After I told the scientist what you doers were up to, he made sure to send the ultimate

955
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,520
sewer hybrid your way.

956
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Looks like I stalled for just enough time.

957
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
Good luck losers!

958
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,520
Oh boy, here we go!

959
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,520
Oh shit, no no, oh fuck, I don't know if I saved.

960
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,920
Did Uncle Jake s-skip some parts?

961
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
That Mike's heart was starting to get to me.

962
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
I knew I needed to take a break.

963
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Maybe just take a couple supplements.

964
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Just lie down for a bit.

965
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,920
Try not to think about Caleb or the guys.

966
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,920
Just try to remember what I like about my life.

967
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,920
Oh.

968
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I decided to call that part 3.1.

969
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
The next would be 3.2.

970
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,920
My first double chapter. The first in the medium too.

971
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,920
I thought.

972
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,920
I don't know, I didn't really look into it. Fuck you.

973
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,920
Hello! All my friends are here!

974
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,920
I'm doing cocaine with all my friends!

975
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Oh...

976
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,920
Sorry, um... I'm doing cocaine with all my fri-

977
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
with all my friends.

978
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
[laughter]

979
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:14,920
[laughter]

980
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,160
(laughing)
