1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Last time on Gun City, a broad city, the Uncle's Falcon. The boys leveled up. Grinch hunter,

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,240
Blotoss Pist, tapped into the mystic powers of the Lorax and learned how to create an impeccable

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,040
disguise. Force user, Patrick Yoda, chose the path of the Jedi Counselor and learned how he

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,100
he can bring peace in a moment during combat.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,640
Abomination Ray William Johnson chose the dark path of the Bazinga, gaining incredible strength

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,920
but at the cost of growing a little boy's haircut and becoming allergic to the sun.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,260
Once they all met with Ray William Johnson's doctor, these hotshot detectives tried to sell

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,200
their friend Patrick Yoda into slavery to see if they could make 10 million dollars

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
off his strong Yoda body.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:14,760
They murdered an innocent, which caused Sullivan the frog to freak the fuck out and bring them

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,600
to his cousin John Carlos, a greasy lowlife who was always looking for some of that techno

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,260
slime.

13
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,300
And after some tense negotiations, Giancarlo agreed to help the gang meet with the Mad

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,580
Suckler, who can help them get into Da Matrix too.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,980
In exchange, they gave him some Primo Technoslime materials.

16
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,380
To what end will he use those?

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
Who knows?

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,740
He told the fellas to meet him back at the apartment at 10pm.

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Afterwards, these Sherlocks tried once more to sell Patrick Yeo to the human traffickers.

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,380
an operation made up of three Ken bones and that woman from Matz's Inc.

21
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,620
They defeated the human traffickers, humiliating one of them to death, if I recall, and killed

22
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:02,140
enough time to head back to John Carlo's place and begin their trek to the mad sucklet himself.

23
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,140
That was it.

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
That's what happened.

25
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
That's what we call a filler episode.

26
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,020
Yeah, it was great.

27
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,220
Definitely a filler.

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,460
Wait, so okay, right off the bat, I want to I'm gonna want to talk to to I'm going to turn

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:24,180
to my companions and be like, "Hey guys, while I was going back and listening to my diary

30
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,260
in order to add sound effects and edit it of our adventure, kind of like two segments

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:38,980
of our adventure ago, I realized that maybe we should be a little suspicious of this Mommy

32
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,940
Goodlegs character, you know?

33
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,620
I was kind of thinking about it when I was listening to my diary.

34
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Why?

35
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,460
Well, see, Sean McAlee, right?

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,820
His whole thing was he was trying to turn all the clubs into the Matrix 2 virtual clubs,

37
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
right?

38
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,580
And that would put Mommy Good Legs right out of a job.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,480
So I just wanted to throw that into the mix because I completely forgot about it until

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,280
I was listening to my diary and adding fighting sound effects and music to the beginning and

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
end of it.

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Me too.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Also, what room are we in right now?

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Don't know what you're talking about.

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Okay.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Okay, so a couple of things.

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,180
First, reminders, 'cause I try to do reminders now.

48
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,580
Ray William Johnson,

49
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,580
you have two Techno Slime addiction points

50
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,380
because you failed,

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,380
'cause I was also listening to Blow Toss Piss' Diary

52
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,980
and I realized that you did fail once in that session

53
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,380
and that's why you went on a weird sort of odyssey

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
on the highway.

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,380
And then you also drank raw Techno Slime,

56
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,620
which counted as an auto failure.

57
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,340
So if you fail one more time,

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,440
you're gonna start hallucinating every time

59
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,940
you take techno slime.

60
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,060
- That sounds really fun.

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,260
- And being paranoid and attacking everyone.

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,300
It will be fun.

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,100
Blowtoss Piss, you have a monkey.

64
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,780
I have that in there to remind you of your session.

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,860
- I remember the monkey.

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,700
- Okay.

67
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,420
Otherwise, yeah, Patrick Yoda,

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,460
I think you've taken, I think, the most damage.

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,460
What's the other thing?

70
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,700
Is it you've taken the most damage?

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,820
I think you and Blowtoss-- - Congrats, buddy.

72
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,460
So just to be on the lookout for that.

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,700
Um, I'm doing great.

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,580
I think you're actually lying about that.

75
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,860
Okay.

76
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,980
Don't, no, please.

77
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,540
I've scored the, I've scored the most high score points.

78
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,980
So no, I, I got a slam dunk.

79
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,780
It's true.

80
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,860
Ray William Johnson got a slam dunk last session.

81
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,940
I don't know if you guys noticed.

82
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,860
Yeah.

83
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,700
Recap.

84
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,380
I got a slam dunk.

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,740
And Ray William Johnson, of course, got a slam dunk.

86
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,220
There we go.

87
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,620
You could just put that.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
It's a clean take.

89
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,620
- Put that in wherever you want to, yeah.

90
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,900
Just overlapping over something else.

91
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,220
And yeah, so where you guys are, which is a good call.

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,860
I would say that you are right now

93
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,620
in the human traffickers office

94
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,020
after murdering all of them.

95
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,660
And you guys, it's 10 p.m., so you can go back to--

96
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,540
- So we just hung out there for a few hours

97
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,900
after we killed them.

98
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
- Oh wait, yeah, it's 10 o'clock, we have to meet up.

99
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,300
- Yeah. - With Giancarlo, right?

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,180
- Mm-hmm. - Brad and him.

101
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:19,660
the

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,660
the

103
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,660
the

104
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,860
So yeah, you guys walk outside and go back across the street, head back to John Carlos

105
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,720
apartment building.

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,860
That addict woman who was smoking outside of it is dead now and you walk upstairs to

107
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
his apartment.

108
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
I spit on her.

109
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
Okay, cool.

110
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Yeah.

111
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
And you look awesome.

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,780
I guess he, you know what, I sort of began the wanton cruelty and you just sort of added

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
the layer.

114
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,180
So it's not, I can't really blame you.

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,460
you walk up the stairs to his apartment and uh... the four of you including

116
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,260
solvent knock on the door

117
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,200
uh... solvent says john carlo we're back

118
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,320
and john carlos is good took you long enough

119
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,280
uh...

120
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,660
newton uh... so what do you feel is one of the local fucked up to get to a

121
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,900
scrape so i saw it

122
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,260
i'm fine

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,780
uh... are you guys trying to lie about that

124
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,180
we we've got a lot of uh... uh... chair

125
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,660
I guess all of you rolled deception, whatever.

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Like...

127
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
That's an 18.

128
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
Yeah, okay.

129
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Hold on.

130
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Pat got a 5.

131
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
How?

132
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
I love it.

133
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
Okay, so, um, wait, what did you... you said no.

134
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
So he believes you didn't get into a fight.

135
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
What did you say, Patrick Yoda?

136
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
I don't remember.

137
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
He said, "I'm okay."

138
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
I think he said, "I'm okay."

139
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Okay, so he's for sure... he knows you're not okay.

140
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I don't remember.

141
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
I don't remember.

142
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
I don't remember.

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I don't remember.

144
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
I don't remember.

145
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
I don't remember.

146
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
I don't remember.

147
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
I don't remember.

148
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
I don't remember.

149
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
I don't remember.

150
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,660
I don't remember.

151
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:03,100
for sure he knows you're not okay. Caleb he thinks you might have fallen off a

152
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,860
chair. He's not entirely sure if he believes you there. He's like okay yeah

153
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,660
that's like the result of that. Okay yeah anyway I could take you guys to the

154
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,460
Mad Sockler. You should be expecting my arrival around the next half hour so I

155
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,660
told him I have an interesting crew I'm bringing in. He seems intrigued. Now I

156
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,200
I know my cousin over here can be a real square,

157
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,820
and so I need to know that you detectives won't act like fucking knocks in there.

158
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,140
Especially after I incinerated that body for you. No questions asked.

159
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,860
What do we have to do

160
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,380
for you or to you?

161
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,820
Please do nothing to me. I will do anything.

162
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,220
And I mean anything.

163
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,260
Is this

164
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,820
anything?

165
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,660
Anything.

166
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,420
(laughs)

167
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,820
- All right, well, and he sort of,

168
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,940
you'd get a ping on your PSP and it's his number.

169
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,460
And he's like, "Well, anyway, so let's just go."

170
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,220
(laughs)

171
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,220
- Yeah, so you guys walk down the block

172
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,020
through the slums of Gun City or Guns Titty.

173
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,580
And you see all manner of low-lifing scumbags on the way.

174
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,660
Hardworking folks just trying to get by, not here.

175
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,900
this is the part of the slums where people deserve to be poor

176
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,100
as you walk through the dark winding neon alleys you come across a featureless

177
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,580

okay i think i'm going to be really peak out

192
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,420
- All right, do a sleight of hand check on that.

193
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,940
- All right. - Yeah.

194
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,340
- 12.

195
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,140
- Okay, let me see if he notices.

196
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,300
'Cause that's gonna be contested for sure.

197
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,740
Oof, yeah, he notices.

198
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,980
Hey, hey, put that guy away.

199
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,300
Patrick, you see Patrick in the mirror.

200
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,140
(imitates monkey)

201
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,380
- The monkey's, he's blind.

202
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,620
(laughing)

203
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,540
I can vouch for that, he is blind.

204
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,500
- Roll deception.

205
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,740
Okay, roll the straight,

206
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,020
I was gonna say with disadvantage,

207
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,220
but he's sort of helping you out.

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,700
So just roll straight deception.

209
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,020
- I, he's blind. - 19.

210
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,220
- Oh great, I got a crit. - Oh no, that's a crit.

211
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,060
- You got a crit.

212
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,020
(laughing)

213
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,940
- Yeah, you see, John Carl was like,

214
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,500
"Oh my God, I'm so sorry, I had no idea."

215
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,060
(laughing)

216
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,860
That your monkey was blind.

217
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,020
- That's okay.

218
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,080
It's a really big issue in today's society.

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,140
People just assume that monkeys can see,

220
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,560
and you know, it's something that I've been trying

221
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,180
to raise awareness of, so I'm glad you're so receptive.

222
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,660
- No, if you have any organization

223
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,260
or anything you want me to donate to,

224
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,780
I will do it right now.

225
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Yeah, if you give me like 50 bucks, I can go bring it to the Blind Monkey Foundation.

226
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
25.

227
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
30.

228
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,780
Okay, he hands you $30.

229
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,780
That's your inventory.

230
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
Yes.

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:38,300
I look him directly in the eyes and I say, "I am also blind."

232
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:50,780
is

233
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:59,840
also turn around or do you try to also peek? I can't use Yoda's mind

234
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,340
just to hear the password to the door. Turn around!

235
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,820
Okay, you can do whatever you want. That's fine. Yeah, okay, and Sullivan puts his hands over

236
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:23,260
his eyes. And so, the door, you hear some strange noises, it's like the door is

237
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,740
unfurling. It almost sounds like, doesn't sound like a mechanical thing at all.

238
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,900
It doesn't even sound like a cyber thing. It sounds sort of like something writhing.

239
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:43,420
and then at that he says okay you guys can open your eyes and blow toss you

240
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:53,100
look at your monkey and he is just white as a ghost did you fuck the door no no

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,580
is that the secret code and here I'll try and then I try to fuck the door

242
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
Uh, nothing happens. Nothing happens.

243
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Well, I'm havin- I am-

244
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
It feels nice.

245
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,280
Well actually, wait. How do you try- How do you try to fuck the door?

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I try to fuck the- the

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,580
space between the bottom of the door and the ground.

248
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Okay, nothing happens.

249
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Oh, well, I cum.

250
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Your cum's just on the ground.

251
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
Well, boys.

252
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,580
You walk into this place,

253
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
and you're just not in it.

254
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Yeah.

255
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Where's- Yeah, I did.

256
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Yeah.

257
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:41,580
the

258
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,380
because I don't know how to speak monkey. You do. You read the mind of the monkey.

259
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,180
Mm-hmm. So the mind would translate automatically? Just because that happened

260
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,940
in the first gun city so now it's like I guess that I have to allow. Oh I okay I

261
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,100
read the monkeys mind? You read the monkeys mind in the first gun city and

262
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,860
translate it for the monkey. Yeah first of right. Mm-hmm. That's right. So the monkey's

263
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,260
willing so you could just read his mind and the monkey the monkey. Should I do that? If you

264
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,780
want to guys I feel like we're pretty worried about this door right now I just

265
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:20,400
I just read the monkey's mind oh my god yeah the monkey uh you hear the monkey's

266
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:31,300
mind and he's trying to describe what he saw he's like he's like a vagina vagina

267
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,300
on the door.

268
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Oh my god.

269
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm seeing the door again.

270
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,460
Okay, yeah, how do you do it?

271
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,340
I do this time the top of the door frame instead of the bottom.

272
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,840
Is that all the money says?

273
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,460
Have you tried the keyhole?

274
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,340
Have you tried the keyhole?

275
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,340
That's a great idea.

276
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,500
I fucked the keyhole.

277
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
So there's no keyhole.

278
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,760
This door is just like a solid block.

279
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
So you just have to...

280
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Isn't it already open?

281
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,760
and

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,720
i've come to a slurs is one of the side of the monkey can describe the process

283
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,240
later if you guys need to know okay i did that

284
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
but uh...

285
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,480
uh... i had the money has an on deck he's white as a ghost from what he saw

286
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,660
uh... this

287
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,920
so uh... yeah

288
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,920
once you guys walk in uh...

289
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,860
at first all you see is pitch blackness

290
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,440
in the eyes begin to adjust in a faint red light begins to grow

291
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,940
and see the outline of a techno industrial fortress

292
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,760
high ceilings and drop downs chandeliers shaped like guns and have strange lights

293
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,660
glowing in and out of them

294
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,560
and massive screens all along the walls playing looping surveillance footage

295
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,920
everywhere in gun city

296
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,580
with the occasional pornographic images flashing as well

297
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,320
drone music creepily thumps in the background you hear the idle chatter

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,020
between unseen women

299
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,000
are they laughing at you

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,420
are they laughing at your peepee

301
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,420
They are!

302
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,420
[laughter]

303
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,920
You're in the Suckler's Den.

304
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
You've heard stories about this place,

305
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
about the debauchery that takes place here,

306
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
the riches within, the politicians, businessmen, and celebrities

307
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,420
who've come through here to have an audience with the underworld kingpin.

308
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,420
You notice that even trying to use minor techno-slime abilities is impossible in here.

309
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
The whole area is totally nerfed.

310
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Whoa.

311
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,420
All you guys roll a perception check.

312
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Oh.

313
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Now where's that?

314
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
10.

315
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,420
21 dude, let's go.

316
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Nice, yeah.

317
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,420
So, uh, yeah, Way William Johnson, with your post-nut clarity, you have heightened...

318
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Double post-nut clarity.

319
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Yeah, you have heightened awareness.

320
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:55,420
And you notice that around you there are like large worms, like slithering and suckling on things and burrowing into holes.

321
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,360
Like just like so you're walking through and it's like pitch black you see the flashes of red light sort of reveal

322
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,840
But to this to your left in your right there are like these like worms that aren't going into the pathway, but are just like

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,800
Like whatever the fuck like just slithering around

324
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,980
And they seem to be avoiding your path so you notice that

325
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,240
I am scared as you walk

326
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,380
The flickering lights on the chandeliers begin to illuminate a throne

327
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:32,740
And in front of the man of the hour sits the mad suckler himself thanked by beautiful big bitches

328
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,380
huge bitches and

329
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:42,820
His twin killers two massive cyborgs with terrifying metallic skeleton heads Mary Kate and Ashley Cabrera

330
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:54,180
Sucklers long muscular butt worm like body is even more slimy in person and his rockabilly haircut

331
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
even more gravity-defying

332
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,740
You can't quite make out his eyes. It's like they're two pitch-black holes

333
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,340
large inside his skull

334
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:11,220
But you'd know that terrifying jagged tooth smile from anywhere as it's often plastered along the slums to remind people to watch out

335
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,460
Or the suckler will get you

336
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,500
So the suckler says

337
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,540
So what's up, John Carlo?

338
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,420
These are the ones you spoke of to me

339
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,220
Yeah, yeah, these are them

340
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,540
detectives

341
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,700
Interesting maybe

342
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,580
Maybe I'm a snake

343
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,940
What I really I am really really scared sir. What are you?

344
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:50,620
Sure, I'm the mad suckler that's all you need to know about me. Why do you sound like Harvey Fierstein?

345
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,620
He's the scariest man I could think of.

346
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,620
Man, I'm just glad there's only one giant worm in here. If there was a bunch of little ones, I would freak out.

347
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,620
He doesn't say anything. He wants to be polite.

348
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,620
What do these detectives need from me?

349
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,620

But...

376
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,640
And he holds up a long finger.

377
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,920
It's way too long.

378
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,320
There's one thing I need you to do for me.

379
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,520
Cool finger.

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,320
[laughter]

381
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,960
I have his finger in my mouth right now.

382
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
(laughter)

383
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
It extended all the way out.

384
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
(gagging)

385
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Please don't put a zinger in my mouth!

387
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm sorry about that.

388
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
Does that happen a lot?

389
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
It happens so often.

390
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
That tastes like turkey dust.

391
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
(laughter)

392
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Here, let me try it.

393
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Put it in my mouth.

394
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Okay, sure.

395
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
I think I sucked it all off.

396
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Yeah, you did.

397
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Okay.

398
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Now all you'll taste is my slime.

399
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Yeah.

400
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
It's pretty good.

401
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
[Laughter]

402
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Okay.

403
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
[Laughter]

404
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Cool.

405
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
[Laughter]

406
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
What do you need us to do for you besides suck your finger?

407
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
What do you need us to do for you besides suck your finger?

408
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,760
side suck your finger.

409
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
What I need from you all.

410
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,520
Are you all familiar with Jeff Tiedrich?

411
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
No.

412
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
No.

413
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
I'm familiar.

414
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,720
Ah, that's my old nemesis from around the way.

415
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,960
Yes, well, Jeff Tiedrich, if he's your old nemesis.

416
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Is it Tiedrich?

417
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
Because I looked up the pronunciation before.

418
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Whoa, Diedrich, okay, yeah, I do know that guy.

419
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I looked at the pronunciation before recording to double check, 'cause I also thought...

420
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I think it's pronounced "The Third Reich."

421
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,960
[laughter]

422
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
That's what we've been calling him.

423
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Yeah.

424
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Well, Jeff, the Third Reich is an associate of mine.

425
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Whoa, what?

426
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Wait, are we entering into a business deal with a Nazi right now?

427
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960

of the biggest players in Dimitri X - he funds a lot of the V tech that lives

432
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:09,960
there but he's also indebted to me. See I supply the cash, I supply the content, he

433
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,840
builds his virtual world but he's been acting up lately. See I have runners I

434
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,240
send through, I sell techno slime myself at discounted rates that Papi Chuko

435
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,440
doesn't want me to be selling but who cares? And he seems to have forgotten his

00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:02,420

441
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,600
he's a bit more than that my runners I sent through there we starting to stop

442
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,360
them in them their tracks he's starting to prop them up as captures he's made in

443
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:19,200
glorious ways of fighting corruption but meanwhile I made him who he is so I need

444
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:27,460
you if you wish to go into the matrix - I need you to teach him a lesson and send

445
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,020
evidence of that to me I have no problem with that sounds good to me yeah I would

446
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,520

447
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,580
honest I would like to be his I'd like to beat him half the death please tell me

448
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,500
I want to know now Patrick Yoda your past with him. I know your name. What was

449
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,000
My past with him

450
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,060
well

451
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
I'll just say it. He's a prick

452
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:04,060
You guys were in that band together. Yeah, we had a band together. We were in that band cream, too

453
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,220
Say what you will about Jeff the Third Reich amazing guitarist. Oh, absolutely

454
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,740
We like Clapton reborn he does really look like I loved cream - oh

455
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:23,140
Wait, is that lady? He pulls up an LP and it's just you with like long hair and

456
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,900
I'm playing it up right base right electric bass and like a handlebar mustache. Oh

457
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,280
Middle school was insane for me

458
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,180
Well, I'm I'm a huge fan as I was 18

459
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,900
It's a Yotus middle school year.

460
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,020
Sounds like a spin-off to me.

461
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,420
If you-- hey, hey, who knows?

462
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:54,660
If you guys do this for me, you rough him up.

463
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,780
We're all square.

464
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,700
You can do whatever you want in the Matrix 2.

465
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,340
You can come here any time you like and jack in.

466
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:07,340
But if you don't do this, I'll hunt you down till you're dead.

467
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,820
I'm scared.

468
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,500
Well, you won't need to worry about that.

469
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,540
Yeah, we'll do it.

470
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,540
Yeah. What's his address?

471
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,740
Can you read out the street address in town and zip code

472
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,440
and everything?

473
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,940
Well, no, no, I wish I had that in my notes now, but you

474
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,040
can't miss it.

475
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,640
Jeff Tiedrich or the Third Reich or whatever lives in a

476
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,040
massive Japanese Pagoda in this in the Matrix 2 on top of

477
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,140
Mount Pole.

478
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
if we can and we have a sound

479
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
do we get to keep his house so we can all live in it?

480
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
I don't want you to kill him

481
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I want you to teach him a lesson

482
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
what happens if we kill him?

483
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
what if the lesson is how to die?

484
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
well you don't need to

485
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
you could teach him how to die but then

486
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
you know be like ok what do you do

487
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm just saying it's not

488
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
what if we kill him then bring him back to life

489
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
that's fine that might be pretty scary actually

490
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
do we have the ability to do that?

491
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
can I teach him how to tie a knot with a cherry snot?

492
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,800
him out of tie a knot with a cherry stem I can tell him about Lee Ferrickson okay

493
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,960
I need you to I need you to beat the shit out of him is that oh but not kill him

494
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,160
you know you're very subtle for a man who put his fingers in my mouth yeah I was

495
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:34,360
being insanely subtle just now well now that that's settled so uh hey I have got

496
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:54,080
a

497
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,720
I have a worm? Yes, you can have one. Oh, if he's getting one, can I have one? Do you have a favorite?

498
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:06,000
No. All right, then I'm taking this one. I'm going for the same brood, okay. And there's nothing you can do about it.

499
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,160
I mean, okay, I said you could have one, so. I'm gonna put them in my pocket now. All right.

500
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,480
And you're, are you seriously not mad? I'm not mad, bro. This one isn't your favorite? It's totally chill.

501
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Which one is your favorite?

502
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
He doesn't have one, he already said that.

503
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
I don't have a favorite worm.

504
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
I have a favorite worm.

505
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Well, which one would you hate to see go?

506
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Now that's a good question.

507
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Alright, I have a worm.

508
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Probably that one, and he points to one and it just gets lost in the mass of worms.

509
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Oh my God.

510
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,120
You can't like tell which one it is.

511
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
No, I have one worm.

512
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Well, that's fine. I guess I guess I have one add a huge worm to your inventory. Okay, I put him in my backpack

513
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Okay. Yeah, and so he says please right this way and you see it takes his long finger

514
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,740
and moves it towards a another door and

515
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,600
You can't see what he's doing to the door, but the door opens

516
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,240
and

517
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,160
You see like sort of a light a floodlight coming in from that door just like a like a light and he says right this way

518
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:35,480
a

519
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,640
- Come on, come with us.

520
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
- He's my cousin. - Drop him, you son of a bitch.

521
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,640
- Don't touch him.

522
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,240
- Oh my God, he's my cousin.

523
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,080
I'm just trying to tell him to be careful.

524
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,400
- I know what you texted to Ray William Johnson.

525
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,160
- Haven't you ever loved a cousin?

526
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,500
- Of course.

527
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,960
- I've always loved my cousin.

528
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,440

602
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,740
He winks directly at the DM.

603
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,740
And I wink back at him.

604
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,740
And then what do you do with him?

605
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
And then I give him a little kiss.

606
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Yes. And so yeah, you guys

607
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
look at the camera and say

608
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
"seems like this guy's too hog to handle."

609
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
And then I trip and I fall

610
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
into the crib and hit my head and pass out.

611
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,380
out. Yeah okay you're knocked out in the crib. You all do you guys climb into your

612
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,020
cribbies? Yeah. Okay yeah you all climb into your cribs and you guys hear a

613
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:31,540
little lullaby play as you guys crawl into your cribs. Play some classic rock I hate this shit.

614
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:39,060
Yeah you guys hear Margaritaville as you climb into the crib. I actually find it

615
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,620
quite stimulating to fall asleep to Pulse Demon by Merseval. Yeah you hear

616
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,380
or whatever the fuck, you know, cool, cool ass taste Cameron has.

620
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,220
- It was a joke.

621
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,740
- I don't, man, I don't know shit.

622
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:58,240
You crawl up to the crib and you guys all get strapped down

623
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,200
by some like metal fucking things.

624
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,940
Some straps kind of come around you.

625
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,260
And a robotic arm comes out from underneath the crib

626
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,020
and it has a binky on it and it puts the binky

627
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,580
and it shoves it in your guys' mouths, collective mouths.

628
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580

649
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580

650
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
*unintelligible*

651
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
*unintelligible*

652
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
You gotta suck on the binkies to get in there

653
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
*unintelligible*

654
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
*unintelligible*

655
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
*unintelligible*

656
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
I start sucking on it

657
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
I've been sucking on it

658
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Me too but in between each I'm telling the pig to suck my dick

659
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Yeah okay

660
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
*unintelligible*

661
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
You do the sucklers

662
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
You do the sucklers move

663
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:44,120
and you suckle on your binkies and suddenly oh and you feel when you bring

664
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,460
the subtext down into the open yeah I love the pain sometimes really well

665
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:56,400
developed sometimes it's the only way and you guys start to dissolve into the

666
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,020
matrix - you sort of feel your body's start to I guess you don't really feel

667
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,760
this but you just sort of fall away and all of a sudden everything around you

668
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,000
turns into like sort of a weird, sort of like a cyberspace tube, like you're traveling through

669
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,120
like a crazy tube, and it's like blue and white lights just sort of shooting around you.

670
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,600
Oh, excuse me.

671
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:26,880
And you guys are all sort of like, like, going around that together and floating through

672
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,440
and all of a sudden you see a giant floating Cortana.

673
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,120
And she greets you all.

674
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,280

teacher the third reich

726
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,580

727
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,220
i turn the court on a

728
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,340
to box a core

729
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,020
uh...

730
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,100
sending you to to park shakur

731
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,420
all my

732
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,500
bargain got a new it

733
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,280
and uh... yeah you guys uh... you see that the the sort of swirling tunnel

734
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,780
that is uh...

735
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
in front of you

736
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,940
starts to like, you can see that there is like a light at the end of it and it's like fading

737
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:25,380
white and your vision completely fades to white and suddenly you each materialize.

738
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:34,020
And Cameron you are, or sorry, Blotas, you are a baby and you have a little top hat on

739
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:43,740
that says "Happy New Year" and you have above your head it says "Caleb Pitts, 13 years old"

740
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,620
And also the last song you listened to on Spotify,

741
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,020
which is the only music streaming service,

742
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,900
and only way to listen to music in gun city.

743
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,300
What was that?

744
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,220
- "Wait and Bleed" by Slipknot.

745
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,460
- Amazing, yeah.

746
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,180
And so you're this baby, everybody in here, by the way,

747
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,960
it looks like PS2 graphics.

748
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,260
Caleb or AKA Ray William Johnson,

749
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,740
you zoom in, you materialize,

750
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,900
you're Jack Black is your name.

751
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,900
you look exactly like jack black in school for a

752
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,500
uh... julian do we do we do we have a little bit of a little bit to get to

753
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,780
change our voices now

754
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,180
uh... it's

755
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,540
we change our voices to our avatars voices or

756
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,980
uh... no i mean like you're still yourself so it's sort of like in second

757
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,060
life where when you talk to you got it yeah they know we're doing a second life

758
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,420
thing

759
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,100
but now i know

760
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,900
and uh... yet it also says the last time you listen to on yours

761
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,680
spotify age also it's like

762
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,960
how was in school for forty

763
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,020

764
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,460

765
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,340

769
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,760

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,580
uh...

771
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,300
who uh... is like sort of some sort of lost person from

00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,180
long long time ago

773
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,340
uh... lost

774
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,420
yeah like land a lot of shocker from what it is a cost here that's a big thing

775
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,880
caleb looks like a really difficult to cover the middle of the past

776
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,020
that's right you look good

777
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,900

778
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,140
yet beautiful

and to the voice again

787
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,340
i think you're

788
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,720
you think that's what i would sound like as a yoda

789
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,080

790
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,580

00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,820
no

793
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,060

794
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,500
and i think i have to go

795
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,700

796
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,660
i don't want to make you know the matrix render a voice for him

797
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,220

798
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,540

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:25,100
he's alive that takes that box for me

800
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,620
the judge of the joke box has been ticked

801
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,380
there's no other jokes necessary

802
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,880
uh... me

803
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,000
But yeah, no, you end up and you end up, you know, you teleport to the player that is,

804
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,120
um, name is Tupac Shakur.

805
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,680
And so you see the avatar of Tupac Shakur, um, with PS2 graphics.

806
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,360
Um, except they like have a good jet pack for some reason.

807
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,920
And an eye patch.

808
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,240
Um, and, and they're saying, um, Hey, what's going on?

809
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,320
That's what's up.

810
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
What's up, Pac?

811
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,280
and uh... you look around and you see that you are indeed into matrix to at

812
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,360
last

813
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,200
uh... it's has this sort of uh...

814
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,920
blue sheen around it right so looks like looks like classical cyber space right

815
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,160
let me uh... you know i mean

816
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,960
have some stuff for a new year you know i mean

817
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,280
the matrix to was filled with floating buildings annoying vaporwave aesthetics

818
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,720
everyone looks like the p_s_ two characters everyone's hands have fingers

819
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,480
stuck together and stuff. There are people speeding by with cyber bikes and people

820
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,520
walk up to empty lots and swipe through left and right to generate a setting or

821
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,680
even a video or an event. People walk through their favorite movies, even

822
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,800
YouTube poops and games. It's an entirely chaotic virtual experience where one

823
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,840
thing distracts from the next, making sure that for not for one second you're

824
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,800
ever bored. It all has a shimmery haunting sort of cyber quality to it that

825
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,280
It crowds the sky and the ground.

826
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,120
And it's basically an entire planet shaped like a 20-sided die.

827
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,740
When you look up into the sky, you see posts exploding into vision and disintegrating back

828
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,800
into the ether.

829
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,640
Everyone's feed exists in their every frame of vision.

830
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,280
So as you look around, you see your own feed, you see other posts.

831
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,200
But in the sky, you see where trending topics exist, the big posts, the most popular posters.

832
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,640
And as you look up, you see the mad cycle of posting, very unfair.

833
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,820
techno-slam prices are too high i will sell at major discount to drive demand

834
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,200
economics

835
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,040
ten million phase five million reposts

836
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,440
t-jerk or the third reich replying

837
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,340
you're a stinking fuck stick and everyone knows it

838
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,400
in one day your mommy will know it too

839
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,880
and then you'll cry like a stinking fuck ass because you're a big baby

840
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,440
you

841
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,680
four million phase two million reposts

842
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,040
what was the beat

843
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,160
it was the n_ word or

844
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,960
you see that you see a defensive to call a worm that

845
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,600
uh... i think it's pretty offensive to call anybody

846
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,280
the inward

847
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,040
bloat are there enough

848
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,480
i'm still learning but you know

849
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,480
the all our thirty years old and i never promised to be perfect this is an

850
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,760
anti-racist d_n_d_ campaign

851
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,400
uh... so to put a chicago her

852
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
you look at the sky

853
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,640
you see chrissy teigen got canceled for the third time this week for sub

854
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,260
tweeting her slaves

855
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,360
and i appreciate the church of medics went viral once again for saying girls

856
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,820
are gross

857
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,520
you also see quite a bit of posts saying hashtag abolish tax

858
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,860

859
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,840

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:20,060
Let me ping her location to your PSPs.

872
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,220
And she pings you on your PSPs, the location.

873
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,760
You could see that she is north of Soy Lake.

874
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,220
So that's somewhere in sort of on one of the sides

875
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,940
of the 20-sided die, but you have sort of a GPS

876
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,120
so you can walk in that direction.

877
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,780
She says, "I have to go now,

878
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,500
"but if you have any questions, let me know."

879
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:48,700
Um, good luck and she hangs up and then you all get another buzz on your PSP

880
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:55,100
and it's from an unidentified number. Whoa. And it just says he knows.

881
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:02,300
Oh my goodness. Oh no, I think my dad knows we're in the matrix too.

882
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,620
He's gonna be so pissed.

883
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:16,700
Yeah, but uh, what do you guys want to do? You're here. You're into matrix 2 you could do anything you want your own avatars you can

Three people

939

Wasn't a racist

940
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,800
I think maybe, hey, we could have done that.

941
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:24,800
However...

942
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,800
Good point.

943
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,800
All right, let's go to Jeff.

944
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,800
At this point...

945
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,800
Okay.

946
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah, for sure.

947
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,800
Let's go to the white one.

948
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,480
All right, so we start walking over in the direction of Jeff's Pagoda.

949
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Yeah, absolutely.

950
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,760
So you guys walk in the direction of Mount Paul, where Jeff's Pagoda is.

951
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,440
You see all different things as you're walking there.

952
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,280
People, like lots of noises, lots of different music phasing in and out.

953
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,360
You see people just changing their shapes and changing their avatars constantly, comparing

954
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,160
things, having a good old time in the Matrix 2, posting in cyberspace.

955
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,640
You reach Mount Pohl and it just looks exactly like Mount Fuji.

956
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,040
Which is just, that's it.

957
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,040
And you see at the very top is that pagoda.

958
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,280
And you see sitting at the front is a young man with a bow tie.

959
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,280
says, "Hi, are you here to see Jeff?"

960
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,280
Yes.

961
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Yeah.

967
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
No, we have to huddle up.

968
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
Don't tell the guard that!

969
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280

We don't know this guy.

976
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,280
We don't know this Yoda guy.

977
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:47,080
Well, look, if you're here to see Jeff, you just have to put your name on the list here

978
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,520
and he sort of a ways is hand up minority report style

979
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,640
and uh... you see that they're sort of a

980
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,220
elicit sat too long and you can actually put it on there

981
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:02,000

be absurd

991
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,720

00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:20,900

1038
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,900

1066
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,040
Then if you don't want to learn math

1081
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:44,480
Okay, and when I'm as soon as I'm outside the doors out of sight I use my

1082
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,700
disguise

1083
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:54,220
Ability and I disguise myself as the the boy from the from the bottom who who had the phone. Okay. Yeah

1084
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:57,380
As a young man, okay. Yeah. All right, and

1085
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,940
And I just fucking rush at him cuz I hate him

1086
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,620
(laughing)

1087
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,500
- Okay, shit, all right.

1088
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,220
So yeah, you come back, you're looking like the boy.

1089
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,380
- Oh, I haven't come back yet.

1090
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,860
I'm peaking, I'm waiting. - Oh, you haven't?

1091
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,700
- I'm gonna wait.

1092
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,060
If Patrick's rushing at him, I'm not gonna come back.

1093
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:15,540
- Okay, cool, so I'm gonna remove you from this.

1094
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,420
So you're ready, are you rushing at him?

1095
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,260
- Yeah.

1096
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,100
- We doing this?

1097
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,420
- I'll put myself right here next to this guy

1098
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,140
'cause I assume I'm gonna have to fight

1099
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:23,980
one of the henchmen.

1100
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,100
- Oh yeah, we're rolling initiative in that case.

1101
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:26,940
Let's do this.

1102
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,060
- Right after I started my cool plan, Patrick, really?

1103
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:34,060
I can turn around. You're also...

1104
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,060
Patrick, Pat, he's not worth it.

1105
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,060
I run all the way up and then I turn around.

1106
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:46,060
Because while I was running up I noticed there's a fun-sized snicker.

1107
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,060
No, that's my worm.

1108
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,060
Behind this little thing here. So I go looking for a fun-sized snicker that I thought I found.

1109
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,060
What game are you playing at? What was that?

1110
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:04,680

again.

1126
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Okay, I shoot him in the hand.

1127
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Woah.

1128
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh.

1129
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Cool.

1130
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,360
Okay, do an attack roll with advantage.

1131
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,720
Alright.

1132
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,280
With the gun.

1133
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,320
Oh, yeah, 24.

1134
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,440
That first one hits for sure, do damage.

1135
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,760
10.

1136
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah.

1137
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,640
Let's go.

1138
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,880
You shoot it right through his fucking hand.

1139
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,360
He's like, "AHHHHHH!"

1140
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:18,720
Like he starts to, like, makes a horrible noise, and, uh, "You fuckstick, you fuckburger, AHHHHHH!"

1141
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:25,120
and there will never be a cream three and that's for changing the intro to

1142
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,440
sunshine of your love to to be on guitar

1143
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,240
guitar you fucking it sounds like shit yeah he's on the ground now he's

1144
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,480
bleeding I use my matrix beam on him oh shit you guys are gonna fuck him up okay

1145
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,920
oh wait don't kill ya don't kill him I just didn't kill him all right yeah well

1146
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,800
here's the thing here's what we can do no you can revive powers yeah so if you

1147
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,760
kill him if you kill him quote-unquote if you knock him down to zero you can

1148
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:01,120
revive him so that is something you can do and then also you'll just need to

1149
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,720
like do a medicine check and also I can't Caleb you have healing abilities

1150
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:10,640
so true you would be able to do that as well but uh yeah if you want to if you

1151
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,800
want to do that though if you want to like the next attack we're gonna like

1152
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:20,000
Roll initiative because the guys in there are gonna be like hearing their yeah. All right, you know, I'll hold off

1153
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,160
We got a I just kick him in the head

1154
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,040
And yeah, I mean you hear the guys sort of coming in as they're hearing this commotion

1155
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,040
so what do you guys want to do like I

1156
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,880
Walk it out. I walk back in to the

1157
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,640
To the building and I say to the guys. Hey, have you guys seen?

1158
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,120
My worm anywhere. I think I left my worm in here

1159
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:48,080
Okay, they're just trying to run right past you no, no, seriously, there's a very cool worm in this room

1160
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:54,680
You could definitely also like do a surprise attack on them for sure. So like I'm just gonna stop chasing. Okay

1161
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:01,760
Mass demon I could I could disguise I could disguise myself again as Jeff teacher

1162
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,600
Yeah, you could throw your grenade - those are no disguise do disguise

1163
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,880
Okay, guys, yeah, let me see I'll use up all my techno slot. So, okay. Yeah, so here's here's though

1164
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,960
The order of events then just to make sure if you guys want to do this, right?

1165
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:25,000
Obviously you have another Jeff Tiedrich that you'll need to sort of apprehend. Yeah to have only one

1166
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,760
So I'm gonna give you guys like each of you guys can do like kind of one thing to see how you're gonna resolve this

1167
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,500
So, what are you thinking to both? Have you disguise which is one thing you're doing?

1168
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:43,060
And then what are you two thinking of doing to sort of like quiet this this Jeff teacher and like hide the body or I?

1169
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,340
Sit on his face. Well, I got an idea not gonna

1170
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:55,660
Get ready could also try and pretend that he's the he's the imposter. I just rolled 22 on animal handling

1171
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,940
He is an animal. Yeah

1172
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,980
He's part Muppet.

1173
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,980
What the hell are you doing man?

1174
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,980
I'm sorry!

1175
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,980
Yeah, that's not going to do anything.

1176
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,980
So do you guys have a plan?

1177
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,980
You guys don't have to have a plan.

1178
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,980
I'm giving you a chance.

1179
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,980
Oh, oh.

1180
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,980
What if I put them in my hoverboard house?

1181
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:21,980
So if they do come out...

1182
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,980
Your hoverboard house?

1183
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
Wait, I don't have that because I'm in the Matrix 2, right?

1184
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,980
Or do I still have that?

1185
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:29,980
My hoverboard turns into a little pod that I sleep in.

1186
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:35,040
I was trying to sleep in yes. Yeah, I would say that you still have that ability so to do that though

1187
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,700
And like to do that quickly

1188
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,100
That's gonna be just a straight Dex check

1189
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,880
And your thing that you do by the way

1190
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:50,180
Blowtorch not blowtorch. Sorry, um, Ray William Johnson can be like assisting him with that so that he has advantage

1191
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:55,440
Yeah, or or you could do something else too, but I help him out with the house. Yeah, okay

1192
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,060
I lock him in my little hoverboard house

1193
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:03,960
Okay, he's like what are you doing now? Now your stupid house. I hate your house. What what I just

1194
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:10,020
Rattled it. He's silent. He's silent in there. He's like yelling about it being art deco and how that's

1195
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:16,400
Trash it's fine. All right, so both you so roll decks twice patch a go though

1196
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,400
Try to like stuff them in there as quickly as you can

1197
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,980
And sort of surprise him

1198
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,380
Oof, okay

1199
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Oh no.

1200
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,700
I guess it's a contest.

1201
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,940
I guess I'm contesting Dex, which maybe this could have been strength, but I think Dex

1202
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:32,940
is fine.

1203
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,940
Let's see how he does.

1204
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,260
Why don't we add it up so it's a 20.

1205
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,260
Yeah, sure.

1206
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,620
Why don't we just say it's a 20?

1207
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:42,180
Yeah, why don't we say I got a natural 20?

1208
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,180
No, yeah, I mean you can...

1209
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,740
Nobody can see the rolls, I mean.

1210
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,740
Right.

1211
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,740
All they can do is hear them.

1212
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:47,740
It's all 20s.

1213
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:48,740
Yeah, so you beat him though.

1214
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,780
You got four 20s in a row.

1215
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,780
Don't worry about it.

1216
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,780
Every time we've rolled a die, we're just making up a number.

1217
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:00,500
Yeah, I mean kind of these stories are airtight. Okay, everything is planned that you're exactly

1218
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,240
No, but you did beat him. So it beat his like Dex check

1219
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,220
So he tried to get out of the way and you like sort of grabbed him and like shoved him in

1220
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,180
He was sort of already like kind of fucked up because you shot him in the hand

1221
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:15,980
And so you got him in there. And so now the his like men come out of there

1222
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:23,060
Sort of already in formation and they see this other Jeff Tiedrich with you two

1223
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,420
blowtoss missing and a hoverboard house and

1224
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:30,940
They're like they're like sir. What happened? We heard you scream. I

1225
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:38,540
Went down to the front gate and I saw the mad suckler there and

1226
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:44,140
he started yelling at me and I told him I was gonna I was gonna bring him down once and for all and

1227
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,740
And he went to the mall to start to try to enact a plot against us.

1228
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:51,380
And I need you guys to go to the mall.

1229
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:54,820
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and find him and kill him.

1230
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,100
Because this is crazy.

1231
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:01,460
But like I said, you have deception with advantage because your disguises are so good.

1232
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,700
But it's sort of dipping into this is getting, they're like trying to assess what's going on.

1233
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:09,380
They trust Jeff, but they're not, they just want to know what's going on.

1234
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:10,500
So go for it.

1235
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,540
With advantage, you said?

1236
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:16,340
All right, so yeah, one of them is a two.

1237
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:21,220
All right, let me see. Yeah, okay. They're like, "Okay, which mall should we go to, sir?"

1238
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,340
The farthest mall.

1239
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:32,020
Of course, the Mall of America. And they start running.

1240
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:40,580
They start running to the Mall of America, which is on earth. So they're like not going to be there

1241
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:43,300
for they're gonna go there to travel to the years

1242
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,300
uh...

1243
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,420
and they start going

1244
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,740
uh... yeah

1245
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,300
so you guys have jeff you've apprehended him you bring back inside or like to

1246
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:56,300
interrogate well so i could really could just bring him to the mad suckler

1247
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,060
i bet i a lot of we did that we have to get out of the middle of my little

1248
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,100
there's like a little like slidy window thing and i pull it open to see what

1249
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:09,140
he's doing to my house and he is just he has issues on my new carpet

1250
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,260
he's a dentist

1251
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,760
"This Japanese thing is fake, I love wearing shoes indoors!"

1252
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,760
*laughter*

1253
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,260
"You better knock that off right now!"

1254
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,260
"Nooo!"

1255
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,260
"And I'm gonna post about it too!"

1256
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,260
He takes pictures of his kicks.

1257
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:23,760
"Get his phone, get his phone!"

1258
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,760
"Get his- ah!"

1259
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,260
"I force pull his phone."

1260
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,260
"Alright, you see?"

1261
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,260
"Would I have to roll a 20 for that?"

1262
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:35,760
"Uh, no, no, uh, roll, roll, shit, I guess you're doing 'use da force'?"

1263
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,260
"Yeah."

1264
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:40,260
So use Deforce, which is going to take some Technoslime points. Let me get your...

1265
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,260
Yeah, let me open that thing.

1266
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,260
Yeah, which is going to give you the ability to...

1267
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,260
Oh, where is that? Oh, here we go.

1268
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,260
Yeah, so if you use Deforce, it costs 5 Technoslime points,

1269
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:56,260
and you're going to be able to... it's a tiny object,

1270
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,260
so you're automatically going to be able to yank the phone from him.

1271
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,260
Whether I grab it...

1272
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,260
Well, I would say it's a contested Strength check,

1273
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:09,500
but um just because like he's sort of fighting back so um but i'm gonna give you advantage

1274
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:14,620
because i don't think he's going to be expecting it so just roll um just uh actually you know what

1275
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:20,540
sorry what i should do yeah okay it's gonna be a contested strength check so just roll with

1276
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:25,180
advantage um i'll have that force be sort of linked to that actually sorry you should roll wisdom

1277
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,820
because that's your force okay which is gonna be better for you there we go i mean either one of

1278
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:35,940

1279
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:42,580

1280
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:53,380
going to be the caption. And he didn't finish writing it. He's like, "Grrr, you!" And yeah,

1281
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:58,700

1368
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:45,420
[Laughter]

1369
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,420
You see the trending topics have changed immediately.

1370
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,420
[Laughter]

1371
01:16:50,420 --> 01:17:00,420

1372
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:05,000
Jeff Tiedrich sentimental emotional coming out. He posted a picture of him and his partner

1373
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:15,020
His partner is Sean King his partner is his partner is Patrick Yoda's penis. Yeah, my penis just looks like a guy

I've really you guys just really what I would say

1376
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,940
To be helpful. All you have to do is let him know that this is what the mad suckler said

1377
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,940
- You do? - Oh, yeah.

1378
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:32,940
He's pretty sufficiently...

1379
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,940
Like, you've made it clear to him not to fight.

1380
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,940
- I've ruined his life. - I pull his pants down.

1381
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,940
[laughter]

1382
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,940
- Wait, who's? - Whose pants?

1383
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,940
- Which one? - Myself.

1384
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,940
[laughter]

1385
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,940
You try to pick between each, Jeff, and you get confused.

1386
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,940
- Yeah. - So I just pull my own pants down.

1387
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,940
Yeah.

1388
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,940
And I look at Patrick as he looks at my balls, and I say,

1389
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,300

Ray William Johnson's dick is exactly on eye level with the window that Jim Diederick is looking out of.

1401
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:38,700
Basically, Jeff, the mad suckler sent us. He wanted us to teach you a lesson. Do you feel like you've learned something here today?

1402
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:44,700
You see him like nodding. He's like, he's like crying. He's a mess.

1403
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,200
Yeah. All right.

1404
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,100
Well, we'll we'll get you around then.

1405
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:55,200
The first person to figure out how to explode my pagoda gets a grand prize.

1406
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:03,300
You see a guy whose avatars Ted Kaczynski just run in there.

1407
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,500
Start trying to figure something out.

1408
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,860
Yeah, what do you guys did you guys just deposit him then on his stoop of his burning pagoda?

1409
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,860
I kick him off the mountain

1410
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,440
Hey shit, okay

1411
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:22,560
Like cartoon violence style that I know that'll kill him. I will kill him

1412
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,760
Oh, man, all right, not supposed to kill him. Well die in the matrix you die in real life

1413
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,560
Well, I go like a little I find a very small cliff and I kick him off of that

1414
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:36,680
I'm gonna need you to do or feet. Why don't you kick him down the stairs? I kick him down the stairs

1415
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,420
Yeah, you kick him down the stairs he takes

1416
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:50,780
You Larry took one damage he's fine. Yeah, he's like this is fine. I love this is my fetish

1417
01:19:50,780 --> 01:20:00,120
And he's like a crumpled mess on the ground and you guys just fucking step over him with your dicks hanging out yes

1418
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:06,020
We're walking away into the sunset and I turn back and I look him in the eye and I say sir

1419
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:17,460
this is a Wendy's you see it you're walking we go that you hear that song

1420
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:27,820
from you know the movie Breakfast Club is playing you guys are on the ski lift

1421
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:33,100
heading back down you see the you see the young man he said my pants are still

1422
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:40,100
down. He said, "Wow, Jeff seems to have really lost it there. Hope I still get paid."

1423
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:46,100
He's a total weirdo. Listen, do you feel like my balls are almost too big?

1424
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,100
Um, no, they seem okay.

1425
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,100
Now, what about his balls? Do you feel like they're too small?

1426
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,100
Proportional, I think, but...

1427
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,100
Thank you! That's what I've been saying!

1428
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,100
You have no taste.

1429
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:04,700
Yeah, oh I, okay, well, I mean, I wish, wish you would all just, just for recommendation,

1430
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,380
you guys should probably put your pants back on while you're in here. There's gonna be some, uh,

1431
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:13,740
this is an NSFW server, so, uh, but. Well, just click it on.

1432
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:18,860
What do you want me to click on? Click it on. NSFW, click it on.

1433
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:25,900
Is Patrick trying to get this, this little boy to... He's not a little boy. He's not a little boy.

1434
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,900
He's an 8 year old boy.

1435
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,900
He's literally 3 years old.

1436
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:33,900
Jeff Tiedrich calls him boy.

1437
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:38,900
You know how you do that to people who are like 22 if you're a piece of shit.

1438
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:40,900
Yeah, 22 months.

1439
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:42,900
Yeah, 22.

1440
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,900
Looking pretty bad for you, Patrick.

1441
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:46,900
No.

1442
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,900
You've got tiny genitalia and you're trying to shove them.

1443
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,900
Caleb's balls are out too.

1444
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,500
Yeah, but you didn't tell him to click it on.

1445
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
Also, I'm not ashamed of them, I'm proud.

1446
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:04,900
I told him to click on the NSFW tag so that it becomes a non-safe-for-work server.

1447
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,900
He's in charge of the server.

1448
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,900
Yeah, he says, "Let me go do that, it's gonna take an hour."

1449
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,900
And he shoots himself in the head.

1450
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,900
And he starts doing that.

1451
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,900
Yeah, you guys did that.

1452
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:27,740
So the Suckla messages you all on your own PSPs and he says, it says like good work and

1453
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:31,940
it has a bunch of S's at the end of it for no reason.

1454
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:38,580
And he says do what you must and dot dot dot like a boomer.

1455
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,580
It's all good.

1456
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,580
Like a freaking boomer.

1457
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:41,580
And you're good.

1458
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,580
