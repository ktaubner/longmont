1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're a jerk. Oh wait. Oh, yeah, we have to do it. Okay set it up this one. Yeah, okay

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,480
I like the window reverse. I know

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,080
I don't want to be a robot anymore, and this is my normal voice. Wait stop is

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
jerk the J word. Well, okay, in the context of that, jerk was an answer.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,200
I guess you can say jerk, but you can't say it with off after it,

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
maybe. Yeah. Is that where jerk comes from? Is this? Jerk comes from

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,240
chicken. No, it doesn't. I think. No. Jamaica. No, no, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,000
Jerk comes from... Herky jerky movements. Yeah. But is jerking like

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,600
jizz? Or jizz is a new... Oh my God, that's a dollar in the jar.

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
You can't say that, guys. Here's gets the swear list better than you

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,840
you and you're the one you were here for its inception.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
That should be the JC word.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
You can't say inception either.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
You can't say inception?

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
Yeah, it's a PG-13 movie.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh my God, yeah.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Okay, well that's newly established.

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,840
Whatever.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Hey, Pierce, how are you?

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Hi, guys.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Good to be back.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
What a lovely set up you guys have with all these mic arms that touch each other.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah, I bet you're impressed.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Look at this.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
It looks like the Eiffel Tower right now.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Say that again?

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
That looks like the Eiffel Tower?

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
What?

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
This looks like the Eiffel Tower.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
In what way?

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
I think it looks like a spider.

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
No.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
The spider tower.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
No, it's not.

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
It's a spider.

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,620
looks like the Eiffel Tower. I think it looks like a spider. No, the spider

42
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,640
tower. Yeah, it actually looks like the spider. The Eiffel Tower does look like

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,160
a spider.

44
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,960
What are you on me with four legs, a four legged spider? No, it doesn't. It

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,060
looks like a four legged tower. It looks like maybe a million spiders in the

46
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,820
shape of the Eiffel Tower does. Yeah, we're in the really good point. You get

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,080
it.

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,020
Yeah, I think as I get older, I'm realizing that I have no interest in

49
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,440
going to France. Yeah, keep me away from there. Yeah, I do want a country for

50
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,040
high schoolers. I do want to eat a snail, though. I never want to see that country.

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,740
You can eat a snail... Off the ground. Yeah, you can eat a snail at home.

52
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,800
Every time it rains, I get hungry for a snail. I took that... You took that food

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,020
disgust test, too. The funniest question on it was,

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,000
there's this test where they test how disgusted you are by certain food hygiene

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,980
things, whether or not you eat something, and one of them was, "If you were eating

56
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,780
a salad and you found a snail on it, would you keep eating the salad?" I was

57
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
like, "I don't know." That's such a funny thing to ask you instead of,

58
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,840
like like a cockroach or an

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,140
thing. Why is

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,580
perfect thing? Because it is food. Yeah, and it's a question.

61
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,540
The snail is probably an escargot salad. It's a

62
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,740
one of the animals that is when it's alive. It's closest to its food form.

63
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,680
Yeah, because it's just there's almost no difference between maybe a crab, a

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,140
crab also is up there. I just cursed and I didn't even realize what you say.

65
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,300
Well, it's clearly you realize that you're getting a coin salad.

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,820
I said, what kind of F.

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,020
So I didn't even catch that.

68
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,660
I mean, yeah, none of us caught that.

69
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,340
My gosh. Wow.

70
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,540
Internal things. I mean, good job for self-reporting.

71
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,780
And that actually is pretty.

72
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,980
That's very noble of you.

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,180
Wow.

74
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,460
You all looked at me and then I was like, did I say something wrong?

75
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,300
And I was like, oh, yeah, I did.

76
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,700
Yeah. Have you guys.

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,780
I've I've I've started not cussing in my day to day life.

78
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,180
yeah, I my girlfriend said a swear and I said, Oh,

79
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,740
what did I do that?

80
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,940
If you guys don't go a full year, whose fault do you think it will be for

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,380
tapping out Patrick? Yeah, no, you guys think one another. I am definitely the

82
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:07,900
worst. I

83
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,140
the dirtiest mouth, but he's been paying. I'm a potty mouth, but Patrick doesn't

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,820
like the swear jar. Yeah, I don't like the

85
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,880
I think it's good yeah. I don't like the cops, but I'm going to abide by all

86
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,500
their rules.

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,860
So no same things wait. I think anti police anti cop on there. You better

88
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,180
bet

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,100
wow that is he just got home

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,580
yeah, and also I think it's fun to have a to be building. I maybe the

91
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,140
community well the community where community is where it's a movement.

92
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,340
There are also who really don't like the swear jar.

93
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,980
I've learned people who message me say well, they can buzz off. Yeah, don't

94
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,480
bend the knee to those haters. Yes, they message me. They send me all these

95
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:58,880
messages. They say F U P O S not point of sale, not point of sale, not point

96
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,480
of sale, and they say I'm going to K I double hockey sticks you wait. Can you

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,380
not talk about like homicide? No vote. We decided violence is okay. Violent.

98
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,580
Oh yeah, you can talk about all the violence. You I'm gonna murder these

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,900
mother haters. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, that's exactly what we're looking for.

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,740
Yeah, you can say these

101
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,360
monkey fighters. What? Jesus Christ, dude. Wait, are you let's say... No, can I

102
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,220
not say Jesus Christ, Lord's name? No, you can say it. You can say it. Oh, we

103
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,940
decided that it's an atheistic, it's gnostic. It's an atheist swear jar.

104
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,500
Monkey fighting is from snakes on a plane, though. Oh, it's on this Monday

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,460
to Friday plane, remember? Yeah, yeah. Not what... I don't know why everyone

106
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,980
did jc after I said that just me yeah, it's only me who did that. Oh,

107
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,080
you're everything to him yeah, yeah, you are my world. Well, good luck. I'm

108
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,780
gonna try to make it through without swearing. It's gonna be do you guys

109
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,700
have anything in your slides today that has cussing in it? I mean well, so

110
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,380
here's what I was thinking right, so we're this we decided that a lot of

111
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,940
these words, the p us, why were the d i c word? I'm not spelling them fully

112
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,940
because I don't you get the idea. I don't want to go all the way, but it's

113
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,820
some of the more anatomical words testes right. This is a medical, this is a

114
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,680
medical episode. We're returning to practice. It is medical in this context,

115
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,220
so in this context, we are the doctors answering these questions right and then

116
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,120
the patient doctor, confiance, basically this you're you're locked in a doctor's

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,180
office right now with us. Oh yeah, nothing leaves these these. So I think

118
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,420
if the if the patient says it, the patient types it out, I think that we

119
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,200
we can spell it out. We have to repeat it. We should rest up like well you did,

120
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,980
but yeah, I got a doctor's outfits. Almost I'm wearing a doctor's outfit.

121
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah, yeah, and I'm a hip doctor in the nineteen nineties. She'll doctors. I'm

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,140
the chill guys to her all doctor yeah. Have you guys ever had a young doctor?

123
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,160
It drives me crazy. I have a young set away from me. I was me crazy with

124
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
desire. Yeah, if you don't wait now, oh, I did want one time the one time I've

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
been to a doctor. I did have an athletic ponytail doctor to clean my ears out

126
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,720
yeah get away from that's the only thing they did.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,760
They laid me down and they were in my ear. I had to lie you down for it. Well,

128
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,600
well, what do you think I'm going to tilt my head like this? She said, get on

129
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,640
the mat. She said, get on the

130
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,920
get on the mat. It's time to squirt on the mat. Yeah, she said, I'm going to

131
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,280
bubble your ear up with my squirt.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,920
She did. She said that she's going to bubble your hold my squirty. That sounds

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,200
like a

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,060
doctor bubble my squirting ear. She did and then she said does that feel better

135
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,840
and it did yeah. I can imagine if you would feel better to get squirted in

136
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,020
your ear. She gunned my wax out. Guns, she plunged my guns out with her squirt

137
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:57,040
gun. Wait, her bubble gun? You went to the doctor to get them chemically

138
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,700
irrigated? To get ear wax out? Yeah. Is it that bad? Well, I woke up one day

139
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,080
and my well for like two days, my ear was itching really, really bad and then

140
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
I'd go in, 'cause I scratch my ear,

141
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,220
I just put my finger in and I go like this.

142
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,380
- You do that thing with the--

143
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,220
- And then I make a--

144
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,040
(imitates scratching)

145
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Sound, and--

146
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,380
- How come you couldn't do it right there, but he could?

147
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,300
- What do you mean?

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,140
And then I could go--

149
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,960
(imitates scratching)

150
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
I have two techniques. - That's the one I know.

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,780
Oh yeah, I don't think we've talked about this,

153
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,940
but the first time I met Caleb,

154
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,140
are you gonna do your little Pewds voice?

155
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,660
- Are you doing that with the--

156
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,500
- Robot voice?

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,140
- It's not gonna sound like anything.

158
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,980
- Let me try it.

159
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,580
(imitates scratching)

160
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,420
- It's nothing.

161
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,240
- Just a piglet.

162
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,740
yeah

163
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,100
that almost sounded exactly the same

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,540
the first time i met you, Caleb

165
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
i thought it would be funny

166
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,540
i had a really bad allergic reaction

167
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,040
to what?

168
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
just i don't know

169
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,540
to meeting you

170
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
some ambient pollen

171
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,040
yeah

172
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,540
to meeting you

173
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
maybe weed

174
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
but you were just like

175
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,540
what the fuck is wrong with you

176
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
you were right in my face

177
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
oh god

178
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
but Caleb said it so he has to put it in

179
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,540
it's a memory swear

180
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
okay, i don't have any more cash

181
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
because i only allotted one dollar

182
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,540
for today

183
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
i'm still

184
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,040
was i mean?

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
no, no, no, you were just

186
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,540
it stuck with you

187
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,140
- No, it's the exact thing that I would do in that situation, first impression,

188
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,220
you go really, really hard. I mean, you broke the ice. I wasn't offended,

189
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,460
it was just shocking.

190
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,380
- I'm a sweet guy.

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,620
- You're a sweetheart.

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,460
- I'm so sweet.

193
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,660
- Anyhow, yeah, I was scratching my ears like that. It really hurt, really,

194
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,820
really itched. And then after two mornings of that, I woke up and then my

195
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,700
ear was wet on the inside and I couldn't hear and it itched and it hurt.

196
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,620
- Oh my God. Wow.

197
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,260
I went to the I went to the urgent care and she was like okay. One year looks

198
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,360
fine. The other year is completely going to be bubbled. Yeah, she said I need to

199
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,700
get my bubble gun to squirt you out here. Here, while I get my bubble gun,

200
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,140
yeah,

201
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:47,460
there's a like a case on the wall. She turned a key and I've always wanted to

202
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,620
use this yeah. I thought that they just put like peroxide in your ear and make

203
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,940
so they they I drop peroxide, but then they also have a windex bottle that is

204
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,440
pierced on three sides that it goes triangle blast. That's what you put in.

205
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,480
That's cool. It was great. That's pretty crazy. I want that badly. It was cool,

206
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,500
man. I would love to get like every single cavity in my body just deep

207
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,860
cleaned. Yeah. Or just filled. My butthole? Filled with like the expanding

208
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,580
foam. Yeah, the foam. Yeah, they should put foam in my hole. Or what they do

209
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,820
with like an anthill where they... Oh, yeah. Yeah, molten tin. Oh, I would love

210
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,240
that. It would be very immoral, but whoever was willing to do that to a human

211
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,520
body would be one of the greatest because he would have yeah you just some

212
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
Sarah's poor all the

213
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,360
put all the molten metal in there and then you just put the person in a

214
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,300
microwave and all the stuff will come off. I said stuff,

215
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,520
okay, yeah, like you say, I would I would actually put them in

216
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,760
acid and then I bring their body back up and everything would be melted,

217
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200
except for the metal yeah. So that would be my well micro, if you were of a

218
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
house, so it's a little easier to do. Oh, a microwave that can fit a person

219
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,940
your microwave not fit a there is a my you can I don't even have a microwave

220
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,340
Wow right yeah he's got an air fryer that only goes to 400 yeah we've talked about

221
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,900
this and my air fryer well that's because Teflon is very dangerous above

222
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,540
400 I don't have a Teflon one you have a nonstick I have a really really good air

223
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,380
fryer and he's his goes to 400 damn I made that up about Teflon - but you got

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,820
scared he's got every single that one's good for you

225
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,820
otherwise he wouldn't have been called Teflon Dime.

226
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
I think that they find Teflon in like polar bears and stuff now.

227
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,320
No.

228
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,820
Yeah.

229
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,320
What is the...

230
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,820
And that's good. It keeps them alive.

231
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
I don't believe so.

232
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
What's... It's like the film on non-stick pans.

233
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Is that what Teflon is?

234
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So non-stick pan...

235
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,320
Okay, yeah.

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,820
Yeah, and so the...

237
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,320
I feel like every time I make an egg on the Teflon pan,

238
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,820
I'm just getting little bits of Teflon on the egg.

239
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
You definitely are. It's really, really bad for you.

240
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Oh, you are. That's what happens.

241
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Yeah. Are you using a fork and scraping the pan?

242
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
I'm using a spatch, but...

243
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Are you scraping the pan, though?

244
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,420
I get yeah, it's bad right. Yeah, it's really bad. So what are you supposed to

245
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,740
do with eggs? You're supposed to use a lot of oil in a steel pan. Yeah, but

246
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,820
then the steel pan, I guess I also heard butter, a ton of butter,

247
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,260
clad,

248
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Ragusea says, "I always use my non stick pan for eggs only." Ragusea is...

249
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,140
Look at Ragusea, look at the size of his body, his weird proportions.

250
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,220
Look at his head. Yeah, he's got a puffy body. He's puffy. Yeah. And it

251
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,300
is completely... He's got a puffy plump going on. And he's a nerd who lives

252
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,300
he's in Atlanta, right? Get out of there. You don't belong in a cool city.

253
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,500
He's in Knoxville. Okay.

254
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,900
I guess so. But he belongs in the Pacific Northwest. That's where he should

255
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
be. He belongs in the Plum Museum. He should be in Seattle and he should be

256
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,100
wearing a really, really bad t-shirt. He should be wearing the Sub Pop logo.

257
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
He should be in a Peeps container. Adam Ragusea, if you're listening...

258
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:45,900
We know you are. You have this one. If you're listening, I need you to go up

259
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,520
shirt size. That's right. Wow. Yeah. Adam Ragusea, you need to stop wearing mediums and

260
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
get some large.

261
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,160
Adam Ragusea, you gotta stop doing laundry. You gotta stop drying your shirts really,

262
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,840
because your shirts can, I can tell they got a lot of right on.

263
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Adam Ragusea. Adam Ragusea, one more thing. Stop buying v-necks.

264
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
Yup.

265
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
That's right.

266
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,340
Also, you got a bacon neck v-neck.

267
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,960
This is whack. Yours are so whack. A bacon neck v-neck. You're referencing the Michael

268
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,460
Jordan Haynes commercial?

269
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,460
Uh-huh.

270
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,460
It's a...

271
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Bruh.

272
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
What is wrong with you?

273
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,460
Nothing, really.

274
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
Okay, that's...

275
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Adam Ragusea, fix your wife's teeth. Yes.

276
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,460
Yes.

277
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,940
You have enough money, mother...

278
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
And make it...

279
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Hold on. Mother...er.

280
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Nice.

281
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,740
Hey, Adam Ragusea, how about you make another good recipe video?

282
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Yeah, that's right.

283
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:52,340
That's right. That's right. Stop making your podcast. Start making your podcast.

284
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:58,540
Start making your... We're just going in on Adam. It needs to end now. Make your

285
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,680
pee pods on the cast iron. Hey, and JKenjiLopez, stop taking the point of

286
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,520
view videos unless you're gonna play paintball. Nice, dude. That's him playing

287
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,360
paintball that no yeah that's me playing people with him. Yeah, or I said this

288
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,480
for making me make a twelve hour bowling a you piece of crap. I'm done with the

289
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,200
soundboard. Okay, yeah, we want camera to talk again. He's zoning in. He's

290
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,560
basically looking at his phone. You would be such an excellent producer for

291
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,840
Howard Stern. Oh yeah, I don't think I would be trying to fix his voice with

292
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,080
all the voice effects. I'd be down there. I'd be eating Robin out underneath that

293
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,680
booth that she's always been. Oh my God, you would never see. I don't think

294
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,720
we're allowed to say that what is his name? What is his producer's name again?

295
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,920
The guy who does the impression of Ronnie the limo driver? No, no,

296
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,220
who's the guy, the guy who's always there and you go and he does the Ronnie

297
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,920
impression. Otis. He's great. Otis. Otis. His name ain't Otis. Okay. I was at

298
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,120
the, I was at the movie theater.

299
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,620
Otis, this my producer.

300
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,920
Where were you? I was at the movie theater.

301
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,300
I wish I had the sound board so I could hit the D. You will never have a sound

302
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,120
board. You are the last person that will ever be behind those wheels and this

303
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,980
is something that has really been making me laugh for the past few days that we

304
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,660
me and Alex are seeing the Dungeons and Dragons movie, which was piece of which

305
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,420
I had a fart sound on the sound board so bad piece of poop, but some this couple

306
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,380
brought their really little kid like this, like probably like three year old

307
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,500
girl, like really little and she was right. She was doing the little kid

308
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,700
thing and running around the front of the theater and like like this, like

309
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,440
screaming and cheering and like running back and forth and at one point she

310
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,200
like their her parents are sitting in the front row like on the right and she

311
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,880
ran over to the left of the front row and then she stopped and looked around

312
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,740
and went Daddy. Where are you

313
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:54,800
kids are as stupid as a rock? It was a fun. I was that was the hardest. I left

314
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,620
in a movie theater in so long

315
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,540
like like twenty feet in one direction, get really scared, lost. Yeah, I think

316
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,980
that is that you think that movie would have is too scary for that kid.

317
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,620
Yeah, that's why they got free. I think that there were parts where there

318
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,060
were monsters on screen. Yeah, what

319
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,100
why bring your kid to that? If you bring your kid to like a movie that has

320
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,900
like like realistic looking dragons and like you know that the crowd for that

321
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,740
movie made me so mad because it was all. How would that was all middle aged dads

322
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,280
we're bringing like bringing their like thirteen year old sons to the movie to

323
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,580
try it. You could tell they're being like oh we're going to see the dunes.

324
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,620
Oh yeah, no more iron man for you literally like three of those of those

325
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,320
father son couples yeah

326
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,340
they're couples.

327
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,980
I think you made a pedophilia joke just now. I know Cameron didn't make a joke.

328

330
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,760
put your keys in there.

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,860
Okay, you miss not I'm not you miss a dime. It's a time. It's a dime. Oh, I

332
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,020
said there's another penny. You have to put next to it. Oh

333
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,460
yeah, I have to put this penny in for wrongness

334
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:16,100
being incorrect. Wrongness is a big one. Yeah, let's get let's get in the

335
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,420
right to yeah. So if you guys have a private friend, the other practice

336
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,760
episodes or listen to them. Practo is a website that mostly caters to the

337
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
country of India,

338
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,700
and... Which is the biggest... So I have discovered... Concentration of people on

339
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,060
the planet, is that true? I do believe so. Or is it China? This time around,

340
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,180
I've discovered there are some people from other countries who post there.

341
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,740
Yeah. Really? Yeah, I know. There are. There are some people who post about,

342
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,040
post in from America, even. Yeah. Right. Even really good countries like

343
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,540
America.

344
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,860
It's kind of the only website where you can get on demand access to a medical

345
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,920
professional. It's a medical advice. It's it's yahoo answers for doctors and

346
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,760
patients. Yeah, it's like it's just like that, but you have to be I think you

347
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,420
have to be like a verified doctor to actually like answer any of the oh no,

348
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,120
you do not have to be verified anything to really you don't have to be a

349
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,880
verified. I think we'll see probably some of it, because sometimes we include

350
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,320
the doctor's response. Yeah, some of these yes, my favorite doctor's response

351
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,280
is basically just buying time like all right. Well, why don't you tell me a

352
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,000
little bit more about what's happening? It's so funny, because there's also

353
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,980
this website has no functionality at all for replying to an answer like they're

354
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,500
like, so it'll be like yeah, somebody somebody who ask question like I'm

355
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,300
dying. What do I do and the doctor will be like well? What do you mean and

356
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,620
there's no way for the person

357
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,280
other thing to mention about Practo? What do you is that? It's so many doctor

358
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,940
answers. It is a website that basically does not exist. It's impossible to find

359
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,160
yeah. You have to Google this thing. I remember because we were like trying to

360
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,140
find new stuff for it and the only way that Pierce told me that the only way to

361
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,720
find it was looking up the word tummy worm on Google until you find yeah

365
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,860
then from there you can get to the search page, but you like can't get

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,060
succession level Schrodinger's thing. If it's crossed out or under the lines,

429
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,440
an idea or a video

430
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,540
penis. Look here. We go

431
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,440
hi there. My son was playing on his video game whilst needing the toilet. He was

432
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,440
really addicted to it. He wet his pants whilst wetting his pants. One drip of

433
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,240
liquid fell down his leg and he wondered what it was. He touched it and held it

434
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,140
up and he said it smelled like urine and it was an oddly colored pee. However, he

435
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,440
looked closely and saw white dots in the white liquid and he was worried what it

436
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,300
should be my son is eleven and he is not really public or pubic yet with only a

437
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,500
flea, a few long pubic black hairs help you wait like a

438
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,960

439
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,120
one or two really

440
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,280
we get like that's how

441
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,420
yeah

442
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,360
Patrick still hasn't grown pubic hairs yet.

443
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,260
Fortunately, it is cartoon logic. You grow for homer hair on your

444
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,600
just

445
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,020
like a really long fume.

446
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,460
Yes, that is what happened. That's exactly what happened. What happened to you?

447
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,300
Yeah. Patrick just woke up and was fully pubic. I actually, I guess I would

448
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,020
believe that. I mean, but that is this is also funny also that it's white dots

449
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,580
in the yellow drop of yeah. Of course, that's like the shimmering of the light,

450
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,900
right? The big twist to me in this one is that the kid is in sixth grade like

451
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,320
and he's and he's so addicted to video games. He just pees his pants on

452
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,820
his face.

453
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,300
He was really addicted to it, really addicted to video games. Also, I love

455
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,060
wondered what

456
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,720
a single drop of

457
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,200
liquid means that he's so addicted. He does this all the time, pissing his

458
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,860
pants while he's playing. Dad is never contact, but it's like that I piss my

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,380
I have to go

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,840

469
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,620
addicted to porn videos, sir. I am addicted to porn videos. How I can avoid

470
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,100
this habit. I am loosing my concentration on studies. I want to become a

471
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,060
government servant. Please help me. This one, I saw this one too and I

472
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,300

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,300

475
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,620
Started seeing sad videos. Hi, doctor. My boyfriend has suddenly started

476
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,020
seeing sad videos and emotional things and even he does not sleeps at night.

477
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,220
he watches these videos all day long and a counseling psychologist says this

478
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,220
situation should not be ignored. Take him to a psychiatrist for evaluation and

479
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,500
necessary medication. If required, the doctor will advise after necessary

480
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,860
diagnosis. This is probably the most deranged behaviour you can have on the

481
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,620
internet. It really is. Sad videos and more deranged to post on a medical

482
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,380
website and then the, it's even more deranged for the psychologist on the

483
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,300
website to be like, this situation should not be ignored. This is serious.

484
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,540
The worst in porn addiction is watching sad videos all the time.

485
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,040
And you need to come see me.

486
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,740
You need to come to my office so I can fix all that.

487
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,640
This is by far the most serious reply that I've seen on this website.

488
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,940
Yeah, they never get this serious.

489
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,140
It's always like, "Take a capsule or you're fine."

490
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,640
Yeah, or just keep looking for answers.

491
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
Or send me a picture.

492
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,340
Yeah, send me a picture.

493
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,840
This guy says, "This situation should not be ignored."

494
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,580
watching adult video. Hello Sir slash Ma'am. I am twenty two years old. I

495
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,120
watch the adult video while watching that kind of video. My sperm comes out

496
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,540
and I feel dizzy and sleepy. Please consult me how to get rid of it. It's

497
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,920
watching the video mail. Twenty two years old. Yeah,

498
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:18,280
I like I like my sperms come out is like well. How you just watch a porn

499
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,600
video

500
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
cartoon birds going

501
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:34,960
that would be definitely worth going to the doctor and then how to get rid of

502
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,760
it. Get rid of what you're watching poor

503
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,980
he wants to get rid of the sperms. I think

504
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,820
this one I thought was funny. My amount is debited, but not video call, no

505
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,800
video call with doctor, but amount is debited.

506
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,400
that's my reaction to getting scam.

507
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:02,640
Maybe this is also the sound of that. Also their anger, I'm aware that it is a

508
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,500
different country and that could be his name. I don't

509
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,300
this is also another time. There's so many posts of I was supposed to have a

510
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,880
video call with the doctor. He never called me. Yeah, I think I've been

511
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,000
debited, but like I don't think it's an I don't think it's an it problem. I

512
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,800
think it's I think it's all the doctors who have a who like put in their fake

513
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,040
potential, so they can sex picture of your penis yeah

514
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,640
addicted to sex. I have been addicted to my aunt for

515
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,680
when she sleep. I have a tendency on peeping and pressing private areas.

516
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,600
No

517
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,680
peeping

518
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,240
we can guess that the advice here spans. You are a deranged rapist to it is

519
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,160

522
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,920
just, but you shouldn't do it like that. His wife is on is asleep and he's

523
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,760

524
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,720
you look up the word peeping to know I looked up on

525
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,400
I did. I looked up on because I also looked up peeping really well. I didn't

526
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,000

527
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm addicted to watch blue films.

528
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,300

I search blue

532
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,500
because somebody was like there was a lot of really bad ones that were like

533
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,600
my baby turned blue. My friend turned blue and now he's asleep forever, but

534
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,200
this one I just thought was this is blue films is the the fancy version of sad

535
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,700
my videos. Oh yeah,

536
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,500
the boyfriend, the boyfriend yeah,

537
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,860
I don't want to say sad videos because people were making fun of me

538
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,280
addicted to watching blue films. Yeah,

539
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:01,140
it's a little more yeah, there's a little more dignity in it. Yeah, those

540
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,740
are all my slides. Hell yeah, dude, beautiful, okay, I'll go next. I think

541
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,500
we helped everyone just based on yeah, yeah, all right, so I tried to make an

542
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,760
they were or a doctor. So you come in and you say help I'm addicted to

543
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,000
watching blue films, so we all

544
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,440
the laughter is the best medicine.

545
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,480
You're sitting in a waiting room and you see somebody go in and you just

546
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,120
hear for

547
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,840
dying

548
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,480
and then you just hear them all to all just doing like a high pitch voices to

549
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,540
I know

550
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,400
yeah, so the bros sounded back up

551
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,120
yeah, the doctors have a

552
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:52,360
completely addicted to blue fills

553
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:00,720
this all right. So fudge one two three four was I was trying to make an

554
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,080
account to maybe like I was trying to become a doctor on here to see. Oh

555
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,480
really,

556
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,540
but I didn't get one. I didn't get my code. They were supposed to send me like

557
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,540
a like an oh like a one time password or whatever, but also fudge. One two,

558
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,840
three, four has been seen 64.

559
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,440
Wait,

560
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,440
you cannot use fudge.

561
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:36,440
That happens 64 times in other data breaches that we had. That is crazy.

562
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,980
so this first one here,

563
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,380
I didn't really think it was like

564
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,420
a baby ate lizard poop with lizard poop was funnier.

565
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:53,140
Female doctors can't stop masturbating. I'm gay, so I need a female doctors to

566
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,900
talk to. Thank you to which Dr Murphy said gay and want to talk to females.

567
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,540
Okay,

568
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,500
I

569
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,540
day. Do you this next one here? Matrix

570
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,540
marrying relative? I'm going to marry my relative.

571
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,340
Direct blood relation. What precautions do we take before

572
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,840
marriage? I'm gonna do it. It's so funny to not even be like

573
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,740
should I do it?

574
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,940
I'm already halfway through going to do it. Yeah, this is

575
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,240
our wedding the morning of the wedding. He's like, maybe I

576
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,640
should have

577
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,840
walking down the

578
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,980
I love precautions. We should like precautions. We should take before sex,

579
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,520
okay, but

580
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,760
you should make sure you have a really good come back. Yeah, I say when people

581
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
ask if your blood really

582
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,660
very good doctor, you should get a really good prosthetic to sky. I guess

583
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,360
you should get a suit and a ring

584
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,620
think about the budget. Yeah,

585
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,460
a girl

586
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,120
appearance

587
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:08,260
appearance. What am I supposed to do in order to look extremely hot to a

588
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,160
girl? What am I supposed to do to look extremely hot to a girl to which

589
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,960
this doctor says consultant

590
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,040
to chat all day? There's a diabetologist.

591
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:25,180
This guy, this guy commented on like like a bunch of shit. Oh my God, a

592
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,820
bunch of stuff just saying consult on practo chat. That's what I'm saying.

593
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,720
really wanted to talk to people. And then you pay, you know, you pay to talk to them on

594
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,760
PractoChat and they never show up to the video call.

595
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,260
Dang.

596
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,520
The whole website, it's a...

597
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,800
I might have sworn a lot and not gotten busted, so please let me know how...

598
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
We'll invoice you.

599
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,240
Once it's released, I'm sure, yeah, thank you.

600
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,440
We'll count it, we'll tally it up at the end and then you can...

601
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,960
But do you think that the doctors who...

602
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,920
We'll send you an invoice.

603
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:52,920
...who do this half-butt advice are going to get paid, like, just for sitting down and

604
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,600
answering a hundred questions with, "I'll talk to you about this later."

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,480
Yeah, this whole website's a scam.

606
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
Is PractoPay doctors?

607
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
The thing is I will I think no, the I know the patient the patient pay for a

608
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,760
video call. Yeah, so I think that I would imagine that this is a lot of

609
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,560
these people are the doctors like the doctors responding on text. You think

610
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,520
it's just a hobby. They don't get paid for that. I think they're doing this.

611
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
No, I think consult on Practo chat. I think that is a direct that will

612
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,360
directly lead to the right this to write this. No, I don't. I would imagine

613
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,480
I think he's doing it because it has this button. This is yeah, exactly.

614
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,840
Yeah, so that yeah, it's a it leads to him. This is the beginning of the

615
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,000
a scam yeah exactly. All of them are always saying send me something

616
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,600
because I think I think the doctors on practice are probably doing the exact

617
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,720
same thing as us where they're looking for the people who need a consultation.

618
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,720
The most of they go on there and they type in like a baby turn blue.

619
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,240
Hey, I hit me up

620
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,840
glob

621
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,840
this next one

622
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,400
depression. My beloved blocked me from her twitter group. I'm extremely

623
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,040
worried. Heart is sinking. What to do? My beloved- He got- He's sixty-five

624
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,840
years old, and he also got no help. Nobody replied to this. Oh, my God.

625
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,640
That's fudge. My beloved blocked me from her twitter group. This next one.

626
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,840
Damn, so sad. Humiliation porn. If I stop humiliation porn to normal porn,

627
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,860
I get severe anxiety and depression, and then just a bunch of ellipses.

628
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,120
but don't stop. I guess that excuse before

629
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,220
I don't watch

630
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,880
this kind of anxiety and depression. If I don't go to the website that has a

631
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,080
you are that is a forty characters.

632
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:35,100
This next one, please reply on this. I want to see a porn videos, but I'm

633
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,340
thinking what if in future my kids marry a porn star, marry many girls do sex on

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,100

00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,920
me, sir. I saw this today and I'm worried. It suddenly appears. Is it

649
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,000
normal sir. I'm so worried. Please help me. None of these have photos.

650
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,520
Yeah, I

651
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,680
wonder if the doctor on the back end can see the photos that are being

652
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,480
attached. Maybe this photo is of a ghost. Yeah,

653
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:01,440
this next one here. Is this normal? Is it okay at that age? And I'm

654
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,160
not sure if we've seen this one before.

655
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,200
When I was younger around ten or nine, my brother was around nine as

656
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,200
We both had seen porn and we decided to try/have sex by rubbing and putting our penis on each other's bottoms and anus.

657
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,200
It lasted about 10 minutes. And we hadn't really started puberty at that age, so we weren't sexually active.

658
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:28,200
And we didn't have any orgasms and stuff like that. It basically just rubbing our penises on our bottoms and anus.

659
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,200
We are not gay. We have never done it again. And I'm just wondering if this is normal or okay at that age.

660
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,760
that age. If this is incest or not and I'm worried that we've seen this one

661
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,920
for because he asked this a million times the same exact way. Okay, so if

662
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,320
you're worried, if this is incest or not, it's not

663
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,560
no

664
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,800
out of your brain. If you're the same age, I think it's just not incest. No

665
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,680
matter what no, no, it's fine, and also you're not you're just rubbing yeah,

666
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,080
there's no

667
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,400
sexually

668
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,980
not even pubic yet. Half of the games that boys play are lick something off

669
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,540
my ass,

670
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,240
something off my car. The interesting about this one, if you go, if you go

671
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,780
back here, the if you go back the again the

672
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,200
if you go back again, oh sorry,

673
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,520

674
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,040
no, no, I just it's asked for mail fifteen years, which I feel like you're

675
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,320
supposed to realize this question when you're like thirty

676
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm supposed to ask you for you. Yeah, he needs to be fresh. He's a brother

677
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,080
getting it up to my

678
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,100
this is the kind of thing that you say one time at a bar when everybody's

679
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,400
crazy story.

680
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,320
It was so funny me and my brother. We would rub our penises against each

681
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,220
other's bottom slant anus. You're not supposed to be posting out of a web

682
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,940
and we were ten or nine to beer. Steep you start using slashes in your

683
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,320
please help Sir, please Sir. Are you there? Help help? Help look at my

684
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,920
picture

685
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
I was just cleaning a glass.

686
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,080
Last call. Hello, Sir, I would really like a beer to help

687
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,440
to help with my problem of memory.

688
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,720
Hello Sir, I'm fifteen years old

689
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,780
brother game with rubbing

690
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,480
an anus game with my favorite brother when we were nine or ten

691
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,600
and I'm wondering, did you have less than three? Okay, it was incest. If

692
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,160
you have less than three pubic hairs, it is fine, yeah

693
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,260
engineer and model actress are in love. What should we do in order to both have

694
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,900
peaceful married life? How to protect from public and have freedom is to

695
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,760
outside India. Is that correct? I don't reframe your question for better.

696
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,840
It is so rare that they say I have no fucking. I'm talking about that's an

697
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,740
effort where I saw there was a couple of I didn't include them. There was a

698
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,280
couple of ones that I saw that were just

699
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,560
just

700
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,460
posting to the practice thing to doctors, you can't middle finger the swear jar

701
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,340
that is no

702
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,460
great. So he's making a mockery of it.

703
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:07,740
I saw a lot of posts that were just like hello doctor. I am perfectly healthy

704
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,620
and I feel amazing

705
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,320
and then the doctor just reply and go that's great.

706
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,940
That's very good news. Yeah,

707
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,580
sharing food with gay guy make you gay. Recently, I shared food with the same

708
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,980
spoon of the person which they ate who is gay. Now I'm afraid a gay now

709
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,900
gayness is contagious. Today, I shared a cigarette with a gay and now I'm

710
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,220
afraid that his saliva might have swallowed by me. Can anyone tell me this

711
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,700
gayness is contagious when the saliva is swallowed?

712
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:41,300
Does kissing gay make you gay? The other day I was drunk and kissed a gay

713
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,580
thinking that she is a girl. We kissed like more than an hour, a deep lip kiss.

714
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,800
At the realizing that is gay, I'm afraid since we had a lip kiss, saliva is

715
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,460
transferred to my mouth. Is there any possibility that saliva affect my

716
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,500
manhood? Can anyone tell? No.

717
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:05,020
This is wrong. I would like to say yes, yes, and yes. You can catch gay if you

718
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,500
get gay saliva in your mouth, it will turn you, it will change your manhood.

719
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,460
Sharing a spoon. Sharing a spoon will make you gay. It's all very, very

720
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,260
contagious. Especially cigarettes because of the- And it's not okay. And

721
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,100
it's not. You're inhaling it. Even if you're gay, it's not okay to become gay

722
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,060
in that way. Exactly that is like that's like we're born makes a vampire.

723
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,020
Yeah, I is like a lesser vampire right yeah, you should be born that way. I

724
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,520
don't want you being turned yeah, you shouldn't be a thrall. Yeah, no, no,

725
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,340
no, unfortunately,

726
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:33,280
doctors understand you're either born gay or someone makes you gay with a

727
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:33,700
kiss

728
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,460
is next one here. I hit with gun bullet. My son's I was

729
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,880

730
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,360
force of action shot in the face and it's painting. I think the I think the

731
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,740
response to this was like, can you please give me more information

732
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,940

733
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:03,060
this next one, schizophrenic child is schizophrenia an excuse for a twelve

734
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,420
year old to cuss an adult

735
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:10,260
he is told this only happens when he is told to get off the Internet.

736
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,240
off video games and when that's all right, this is a very

737
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,040
opposite. I hate to both sides. This

738
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,180
once I heard the second part of this and why he's cousin, I feel

739
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,180
a little bit more completely understand why that would make

740
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,220
me listen. Here's what I'll say. It's okay to throw stuff. It's

741
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,200
okay to refuse to do as you're told. Cussing is never okay.

742
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,720
Yeah, I'm your mom. You can punch your mom. You can break

743

746
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,380

00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,000
my professors will understand me and this got a response from a doctor

782
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,300

00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:35,660
pain coming up from right center chest. I randomly have a pain that I call it

786
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,740
Dorito attack

787
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:44,540
scraping my insides, but instead of going down, it comes up. I've had that

788
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,060
anymore.

789
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:53,760
Okay, and not to go practical, but this is called an esophageal spasm. When

00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,120
Dorito.

792
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,200
From now on, it will be

793
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,000
funny. It is the Dorito attack, and then I think this is maybe my last one

794
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,060

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,540

801
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,180

eight after four minutes.

819
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:41,200
I ate pizza after four minutes of drinking milk today by mistake. Is it

820
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,060
harmful? Dude, when people- This one, I was lying in bed last night trying to

821
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,180
fall asleep and laughing about remembering four minutes of milk happening.

822
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,120
That's so much. If it's- That's non stop. Four minutes. That's gallons of

823
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,360
milk. Gallons of milk. Yeah, gulping and breathing loud through your nose.

824
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:55,680
Yeah.

825
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,640
I ate pizza after four minutes of drinking milk by mistake. Dude, this is

826
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,340
exactly- It was an accident. This is how my girlfriend talks all the time.

827
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,480
she like doesn't do a thing to or does something wrong and she says it was an

828
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,320
accident. I'm like what do you mean? How did that? How is it an accident that

829
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,840
you didn't brush your teeth

830
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:19,980
yeah for minutes of milk? Give me some idea. I had a problem on penis,

831
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:24,900
something dry white color of sphere cover my penis with bad smell. I don't

832
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,700
understand what happens on me. So please give me some idea about this type of

833
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,140
problem. I'm suffering from this.

834
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,880
you you search sphere. No, I actually did it is fun. I'm seeing everybody

835
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,040
slides and guessing what they search. You search type of problem. No, I think

836
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,040
I think this is one of the ones where I saw something else and ended it like

837
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,920
did something that was similar. I don't think I actually searched any okay, dry

838
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,720
white color of sphere yeah. Let's try to actually diagnose this guy.

839
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,720
I think that you have a marble. I think he has a marble stuff.

840
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,020
it has a bad smell. So it might be a thing in my

841
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:09,780
that they eat there yeah, maybe an egg yeah, a white. Oh, no, I searched idea.

842
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,300
That's what it was. I just remembered I have a white orb that smells bad.

843
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,920
Maybe you have a stinky white

844
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:21,180
yeah, that's my that's my official diagnosis.

845
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,820
Does it come on

846
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,540
okay?

847
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,820
You have an orb that comes off

848
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,680
never removable problem. What should I do? You should take it off

849
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,560
obsession with idea of dirtying hands. My son, thirty one years, has developed

850
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,120
a severe problem about eating with hands. He worries of washing his hands

851
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:46,360
or otherwise his phone or computer will be spoiled. He gets so much agitated

852
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,400
that he wants to commit suicide. We are Indians and he does not like others

853
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,800
eating with hands and considers Chinese better. I just like the my son,

854
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,280
thirty one year because I completely it blindsided me. I thought this was going

855
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,220
to be like a problem that they're like young child had right now. It's just a

856
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:08,380
guy with fuck it with the OCD. Well, I said it. You did say it's a guy with OCD

857
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,820
who has OCD that makes him consider Chinese better right. I think that's

858
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,540
kind of what OCD is yeah

859
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:22,040
that is not working. Can you thank you gosh? I got spot. I number can I reduce

860
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,680
can I reduce I number how, if any of idea of you, please say no other

861
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,120
problem

862
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,020
this is you can go one or zero. This is a

863
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,580
Cameron's been asking us about oh yeah. Can he get in? I

864
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:41,020
am right. I've never seen it so eloquently, though, because you've been

865
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,420
asking. Can I get an eye patch blah blah blah? This is I wanted a boils shut. I

866
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,220
don't want to patch this boils down your question to its essentials. Yeah. Can I

867
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,320
reduce a number

868
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,120
pizza sauce poo

869
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,820
this morning. I had a bowel movement where I had pizza sauce like my God was

870
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,040
running. I had only got an hour before it was normal and I did what this could

871
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,620
be. I go see a doctor. I saw this one to sauce yeah.

872
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:11,940
Did you put it on a beat? I also saw this one and I sure it was a

873
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,400
immediately. I was just like someone else

874
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,180
who is

875
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,960
Also, you know that it is a men often do just have pizza sauce. Yeah, the fact

876
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,560
that this is a female, I would say this person is like seconds from death.

877
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,460
Yes, there's no when women have bad.

878
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,260
The thing is, I can't think of his pizza sauce consistency would be one

879
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,760
thing, but this is pizza sauce color.

880
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,260
Yeah, which which

881
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:45,760
bright red is it pizza sauce uncooked or cooked because it changes. It becomes

882
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,060
a little bit more brown when you

883
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,920
so they probably have like stomach cancer or something yeah or they

884
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,020
or

885
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:58,180
they two full bottles of ragu four minutes of pizza.

886
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,620

00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,500
maybe of a red toilet.

888
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,980

902
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,080
morning and check, but it's not actually a scratch. It's something creepy and

903
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,640
it's making

904
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,940
it's a creepy, mysterious, creepy thing. It's a creepy, itchy thing. I have a

905
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,840
creepy, itchy thingy that's happening. I have a creepy dot on my hand

906
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,900
dreaming, imagining when I am recumbency on the bed and I am traveling in the

907
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,760
metro in a car. I always dream just like I want to be something I keep imagining

908
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,640
and want to be many things. I am and it is different. For example, if I want to

909
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,680
go to film writing, I have a fantasy I have become and I keep on reacting and

910
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,280
being happy. It feels good. Then, after five minutes, I ignore to become an

911
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,040
actor, a cricketer, or an officer in the same way.

912
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:49,000
It's so funny that he's like, all right, so I want to be maybe four or five

913
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,040
things, but then I snap back to reality and I want to be four or five

914
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,800
on the train. I imagine being an actor, you have to consult a psychotic. You

915
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,920
need to see a doctor right now. We need to pump you full of lithium. You can't

916
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,560
have those thoughts anymore. Yeah, those are dangerous thoughts. Yeah, I'm going

917
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,400
to put you in a straight jacket. I'll read this one really fast daydreamier

918
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,640

919
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,520

920
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,080
world praises me and all types of fantasies. I feel like everyone praising

921
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,560
me. I'm really wasting a lot of time when I daydream, especially when I hear

922
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,960

without nailing one word like oh sorry, let me let me start over. It was my

965
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,480
father that I eat without how wash

966
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,480
jerks last flicks. I want us to know if there's a permanent best treatment for

967
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,260
problem of jerk or flicks medicines are going on

968
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,480
medicines are going on

969
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,200
addiction of porn. I know this is funny question. Why is my body struggling

970
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,860
throughout the day to poop, but when I watch porn I poop a lot

971
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,840
I know this may sound weird to many, but hopefully I get a lot of people that

972
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,600
are like that. I can discuss this nasty thing to talk about. I want to get rid

973
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,400
of this problem. Now I am addicted to porn before poop and if things will go

974
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,720
like this, then what will happen at the age of fifty, please suggest me

975
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:57,160
just on his phone. I'm like the bus yeah, wait, why do you try to shit on a bus

976
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,640
like a Boston Express or something like one of those? Sometimes they have a

977
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,780
toilet on the bus, yeah, like the lucky star bus, but why not just be on the

978
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,280
toilet?

979
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,600
He has to watch porn before he's just in his seat. He's like I feel like I got to

980
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,800
poop at some point. He basically got the diaper equivalent of porn.

981
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:18,280
Tongue licking spoon in a restaurant. My mistakenly in a restaurant, I was having

982
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,740
noodle with spoon that I mistakely tongue like the spoon. I

983
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,300
should be

984
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,460
yes

985
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:32,320
right now. My mistakely in her rest her rot. We must amputate your tongue

986
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,980
penis erection of my hubby. My hubby's penis is not able to being erect for a

987
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,960
long time due to which he is not satisfied during mating with me. So

988
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,680
suggest some ideas for being satisfied. I hate when my hubby's having problems

989
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,320
first meeting with me. I doing this with a ball, so I want to mate. Oh, no,

990
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:48,740
there's a

991
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,880
awkward, awkward, speem release. I release sperms when I'm in a ten

992
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,620
situation searched most, especially for example, when I've not done enough

993
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,500
writing in an examination. The examiner calls for submission of scripts are

994
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,780
about to collect. I release sperm uncontrollably due to the tension. It is

995
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:07,100
reoccurred severally, even without me having without me been on erection, very

996
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,800
pleasurable, awkward, though, whenever I check it, I notice its sperms, which

997
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:15,760
always get me thinking. So I have an issue wait okay wait look at the timing

998
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,380
of this five years ago. What was happening five years ago? Who was on

999
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,480
Saturday Night Live?

1000
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,040
Three guys from the Lonely Island, and they were one day looking for

1001
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,880
inspiration for a new digital short in my search speem and they said we can't

1002
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,000
do speem and they can't it can't be awkward speem release because anybody's

1003
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
going to Google that know where it came from. We're going to invent a little

1004
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:43,340
word called jiz yep and wow. So that's my theory sperm dribble instead of shoot.

1005
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,500
I'm a born dribbler, but I can shoot two ropes of I lie

1006
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,600
dribbler

1007
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,860
I'm a board

1008
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,460
dribble, speam count ten million

1009
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,120
pretty good right yeah ten million. Well, this person was unhappy with it

1010
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,640
right. I have one more that I know we did at the live show, but this is my

1011
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,940
favorite one of all time, so I just want to put it. I want to see it again.

1012
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,440
so it's the classic

1013
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,200
bubble in

1014
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:14,280
I have one big bubble in my bump. The bubble is inside the bump. Please

1015
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,920
suggest me medicine, so that I get relief from that bubble. You keep

1016
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,800
thinking the best part is over

1017
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,080
and bubble. It's a

1018
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,840
break this down the bar to sir. It's very formal. Sir, I have one big

1019
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:33,960

1021
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,340
is inside the bump. Please suggest me medicine, so I get relief from the

1022
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,700
bubble. So now we know the problem is not the bump. No, it's the problem is

1023
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,700
the bubble. I'm going to have that bump whether you like it or not. The bump,

1024
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,580
I was fine with the bump. I mean, I got used to the bump. This bump is going

1025
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:57,460
to be here forever. I'm fine with the bump. I'm a bumper, but I don't need a

1026
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,760
bubble inside it. That's the last thing I need. In my bump. Wait,

the doctor's response, so that you can start wearing glasses

1085
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,240
and don't swallow a live baby cockroach repeatedly.

1086
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,840

1087
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,380
"Oh, I swallowed a cockroach! What do I do?"

1088
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,680
See, at Eye Doctors, you don't swallow a cockroach!

1089
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,720

1090
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:31,560

But I'm weighing in on everything.

1095
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:41,460
Why do you see an Eye Doctor? 'Cause I'm a guy doctor.

1096
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,100
You know you messed up when a gynecologist is telling you--

01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,760
There are two pimple together, no other symptoms now had been fifteen minutes.

1100
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,840
Okay, I will guess there's two together. It was a spider.

1101
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,940
What despite I think it also could have been two best friend mosquitoes. Yeah,

1102
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:13,580
they don't may there. They don't have friendships. It's not. It was one clumsy

1103
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,820
mosquito who fucked up the may

1104
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,900

1105
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,940

1106
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:29,240
very, very small native American. I did I search I search by and there was a

1107
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,380
bunch of stuff like I got bit by a dog. I got bit by a dog. One there's a ton of

1108
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:37,920
I got bit by a crow yeah, but eagle there's so many eagle by the one there

1109
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,360
was one nested in all those that was like my son was bitten by a human.

1110
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,880
I tried searching. You cannot search more than one word, which is such a shame.

1111
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:49,520
You can. Well, it doesn't work, though. It doesn't work. I search grandma bite

1112
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,840
grandma to get bit or be bit by grandma. Yeah. All right. Purple legs.

1113
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,380
My thighs turned purple last night and now they are lighter, but still purple.

1114
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:04,580
You are turning into a mascot. Yeah, this is good. Yeah, yeah, that's telly.

1115
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:08,200
All right. I love this one. It's literally so charming relationship during

1116
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,900
pregnancy. I am seven week pregnant advised by doctors to avoid making

1117
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,420
relationships for three months. I'm fine to avoid it completely, but sometimes my

1118
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,620
husband was in mood and we do kissing only, but I get feelings while smooch.

1119
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:25,420
Can kissing and my feelings harm baby? Please advise.

1120
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,020
- Yes, that is very sweet.

1121
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,420
- But it is very harmful.

1122
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,620
- You're going to need to stop that right now. Your baby will die.

1123
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,820
- You stop kissing your husband right now because then your baby's going to

1124
