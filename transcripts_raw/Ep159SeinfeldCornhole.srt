1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,000
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,840
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,000
- Oh, I just Scrooged.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,840
- No, the Scroog guy's like this.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,660
- No.

9
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,500
- I'm gonna screw you.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,360
- He goes like this.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,540
- I thought you were doing Scroog.

12
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,360
- Oh man, there's a screw in my chair.

13
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,200
- There's a screw in Caleb's chair.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,880
- I like my version of it.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,720
- I'm gonna screw you.

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,560
- Maybe he could be like,

17
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,280
Okay, we can combine it like, "This is my screwing chair!" he could say.

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,800
"I'm gonna screw you in that chair!"

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,080
Yeah, there's this...

20
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,300
Yeah.

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,680
Like, yeah, there's like...

22
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,760
You see that chair? That's where I'm gonna screw you, because I'm the screw guy.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,320
This is my... maybe he could say like, "This is my screwing screw," and he's got a screw.

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,800
I don't like when it's like, like people refer to sex as screwing.

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,360
I think...

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,240
That's so weird.

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,120
I think they should do it more. They should do it in like...

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,480
It's a gross image I think, because when I think of a screw I think of like, you know,

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,280
when you like see a screw and it's got like the fucking threads.

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
A spiraling screw.

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,960
I think they should do it more, like it should be more accepted as like a, like you should

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,840
like, when you confront your wife for cheating on you, you should be like, "Did you screw?"

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,320
Have you been screwing that one guy?

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Which I mean, you know, watch any made for TV, or not made for TV, but like, you know,

35
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,560
edited for TV movie.

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Yeah.

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,040
And it's like, that's all you're, I miss that.

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,920
I haven't had cable in so long.

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,360
Haven't seen a Hallmark movie in a while?

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,880
a Hallmark movie but like good TV I mean it's it's you can't you don't get the

41
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,800
like the edited version of good movies but if you get like to be or voodoo or

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,360
something and just scroll through like the free with ad stuff they have you can

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,040
find like the so like yeah perfect like sci-fi channel stuff that's like

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,560
forgotten like I found a show that had one episode called legend of the dog man

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,560
have we talked about the the TV edit of the departed no where they do like in

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,900
the intro they're like they're like yeah Boston it's a town full of weirdos

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,840
freaks it's awesome dude first you had the freaks and some real creepy and then

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,320
creeps and the Polish it's awesome dude dude I fuckin I'm miss made for TV edits

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,480
That was like such a like thing like the early 2000s was like watching just

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,160
edited like. Right. I could never. Maybe it's just a nostalgia thing I'm thinking now. I could never do that.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,520
I never, because this is probably very specific to me but like I would be like

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,280
well if I watch the edited for TV version I'll just have to watch it again

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
because I'll like miss stuff so there's no point. Like I wouldn't watch movies on

54
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,360
airplanes either because I was like oh they edit some of those so it's I won't

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,960
even be watching the movie because they take out some of the scenes so what's

56
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,920
they take out the boring love scenes between the girl and boy. They take out when they say

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,560
certain things or use certain violences against each other. Not on Spike. On Spike

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,160
they take out all the girls. Yeah I mean Kill Bill is like two minutes on Spike.

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah it's the best two-minute movie of all time yeah. It's just called Bill. Yeah

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,560
yeah you should have seen the version of eighth grade they did now they'd

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,240
probably double the length of the movie instead yeah probably double the girls

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,320
and probably they chopped and screwed it yeah it's all purple yeah yeah or pink

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,840
actually because of all the girls are in it yeah yeah

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,360
speaking of - I just remembered on to be I used to watch I think it was AMC had

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,420
like a show where Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were trying to reboot arena

66
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,940
football yeah oh yeah they bought a team they bought the team in LA and they

67
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,860
named it the LA kiss this was recently right yeah this is a like 2014 yeah came

68
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,920
out and like the first like I feel like I've talked about this before on the

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,900
show but I don't think ah the first like episode is a guy who's like you know

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,940
like arena like footballs like my passion but my doctor says if I get one more

71
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:16,460
concussion I'll go blind and like it's all like the like the training process

72
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,140
and like them like recruiting people for the team and he like has an injury yeah

73
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,960
in the middle of practice which I mean you know get that like do that to like

74
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,980
raise drama in the show make the make a show about Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons

75
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,680
doing business interesting but it's just so funny like imagine losing sight

76
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,220
because you wanted to play football for you know in Simmons yeah I mean like you

77
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,060
know that's like dying for your country though yeah that's like a super and that

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,580
country is Israel is real rock and roller he's the man in the world I I was

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,580
watching a show on to be because I couldn't find anything to watch and it

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,060
was about is like a cryptid show where they like go and like interview people

81
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,080
about like the cryptids that live in their country or whatever and I was

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,780
watching one about the Tata Duende which is like a gnome from like Belize or I

83
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,780
think it's Belize but basically it's like this thing where like the Tata Duende

84
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,020
is not like a cryptid it's like a thing that that like parents tell their kids

85
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,500
like oh you better behave or the Tata Duende is gonna come and like attack you

86
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,300
or like take you away at night but it's so funny good it's like doing like a

87
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,300
like a ghost adventures episode about like the tickle monster.

88
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,300
I had one of those as a kid but my mom...

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,300
You had a Tata Duende? You had a personal tickle monster? No, no, it was like

90
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
the guy. My mom would say like, "Oh, you leave

91
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,300
if you don't clean your room, the guy's gonna come

92
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,300
the guy's gonna come and inspect the house." I think it was probably

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,300
just somebody just like... Oh, that's your fucking landlord, what do you mean? I don't know, I don't know if we had a

94
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,500
landlord but if you if you don't if you don't clean up the bathroom the guy's

95
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,880
gonna come in the guy's gonna come and he's gonna take it away like she would

96
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,760
like threaten us like child services nice way basically we used to threaten my

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,220
mom with with child with CPS cuz she she knew a lady who worked there and her

98
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,660
name was in the like family like phone book and so if my mom ever did any like

99
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,540
grounded us I'd be like yeah I'm gonna call her tomorrow I'm gonna call her I'm

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm gonna say that you bit me.

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,940
- And she was like, "No!"

102
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,780
- "You serious?"

103
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,620
- I did not just open the room.

104
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,460
- I didn't know how to dial a phone though.

105
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,300
- Yeah, yeah, it was bad.

106
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,100
- Yeah, 'cause you had a rotary phone.

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,580
- I didn't have a rotary phone.

108
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,300
- I, you know what, I was thinking about that the other day,

109
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,980
getting like a landline for my apartment.

110
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,900
- You should get one of those ones

111
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,740
where you have a cone here.

112
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,320
- Yeah, dude, my grandmother had a payphone in her apartment

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,160
like that you could--

114
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,340
- That's the worst financial decision I've ever heard.

115
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,140
- No, I mean, you don't need to pay for it.

116
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,980
Like it's like unlocked or whatever,

117
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,800
but it's so, it was, I can't believe that,

118
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,540
'cause like I would always be like,

119
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
this is the coolest thing ever,

120
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,220
I just wanna put quarters in there.

121
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,620
Like as a kid, so I would just put all my quarters in,

122
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,900
and then we're like, can I get the backers?

123
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,740
She'd be like, no.

124
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,340
(laughing)

125
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,140
- You just willingly put the quarters in?

126
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,260
- Yeah, well sometimes I'd be like,

127
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,780
can I borrow a quarter to put it in?

128
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,860
Just 'cause I thought it was like fun,

129
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,860
'cause you like open up the slot and like put it in,

130
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,740
and you hear it like roll around in there,

131
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,220
and if you put in like a nickel or something,

132
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,060
it like returns it.

133
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,300
- Yeah, you can get the quarter back.

134
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,140
- Did you guys ever know how fun that is?

135
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,980
You absolutely can, but she didn't--

136
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,480
You just have to call the operator and say,

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,740
"Please, can I have my money back?"

138
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,740
She had a key to open it to get the quarters out,

139
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,180
but yeah, she just kept the quarters.

140
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,020
Did you guys ever know a fucking kid--

141
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,220
Oh, like in her apartment, not like in the lobby.

142
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,660
Yeah, like, no, in her house.

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,460
Oh, okay.

144
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,980
I thought it was in the lobby.

145
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,820
In the lobby?

146
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,640
What lobby?

147
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
I said her house.

148
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,740
I thought you said her apartment.

149
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,580
Oh.

150
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,420
I think I said her house if I didn't--

151
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,300
Did you guys ever know a fucking kid

152
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,460
who had a gumball machine in his house?

153
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,020
Oh, when kids had little gumball machines

154
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,460
or like the Lionel coin bank.

155
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,300
- Yeah.

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,780
- I was like, man, you just made a money, huh?

157
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,060
- Yeah, like what the fuck, dude?

158
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,580
I remember talking with a kid, I was like,

159
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,920
why'd you like buy a gumball machine?

160
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,580
Why not like buy just gumballs?

161
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,660
And he was like, well, because I have people over.

162
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,740
I spent $25 on this gumball machine.

163
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,620
So if 100 people get one gumball--

164
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,140
- You go to Gary Vee's house?

165
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,980
- Yeah, I did.

166
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,860
(laughing)

167
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,860
I mean, you know, this kid was,

168
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,340
I'm sure he's friends with Gene Simmons,

169
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,660
if that makes any sense.

170
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,920
(laughing)

171
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,500
- He would be good friends with Gene Simmons.

172
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,560
- It's so genius when they have things like,

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,440
like a gumball machine that has like a track

174
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,620
for the gumball to roll down,

175
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,100
or one of those things where it's like you donate,

176
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,640
but like you put the quarter in and it like rolls around,

177
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,580
down like a funnel, you ever seen one of those?

178
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,580
- Oh yeah. - 'Cause they're like,

179
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,740
if there's-- - The dinosaur?

180
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,840
- The dinosaur?

181
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,620
- The Chad one, the Children's Hospital,

182
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,000
- I don't know. - It's like a dinosaur,

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,380
they would have them out in Walmart,

184
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,120
and you put like the quarter in the dinosaur's mouth,

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
and you watch it go down its belly.

186
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,420
- Exactly, shit like that, yeah, they had one of those,

187
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
they used to have one of those in the um...

188
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:42,920
Just to get kids to give it money.

189
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,220
They used to have one of those in the Arsenal Mall.

190
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,820
They used to have an arcade in the Arsenal Mall,

191
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
and they used to have one of those right outside the arcade,

192
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,220
which is so funny, 'cause it's like,

193
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,920
you know kids are gonna be leaving and just putting the tokens that they didn't use in there?

194
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,220
Like, that's not gonna help kids with cancer.

195
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,620
That's a horrible... Like, it's either I could put my coin in this, like, funnel,

196
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,620
or I could go play skee-ball and, like, win a prize, like...

197
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,920
But what if a kid with cancer's last wish is to play skee-ball?

198
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Exactly, yeah.

199
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,440
Sorry bud, we can't do it. No tokens. We only have quarters.

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
You can turn a quarter into a token pretty quick.

201
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,160
It's hard. You gotta go to the airport. You gotta go to currency exchange.

202
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, I never thought about how that was right outside the arcade. That really does seem

203
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
like the worst place to put that.

204
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Oh, absolutely.

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,400
Like, yeah. There's a very clear choice of what you can do with your quarter there.

206
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,160
Yeah. You can put it in your mouth.

207
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Yeah.

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
You guys ever swallow a quarter?

209
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
I swallowed a quarter.

210
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
I swallowed a damn penny.

211
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,640
Yeah, I squeezed it on my butt.

212
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,720
I ate a quarter in the pool.

213
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
A quarter?

214
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,640
I ate a quarter in the pool.

215
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
A quarter is so huge.

216
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,140
I swallowed a quarter too.

217
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,120
I would throw the quarters in the pool and then like jump into the pool and like catch

218
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
them before they reach the bottom.

219
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,680
And you always jump into the pool with your mouth wide open?

220
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,040
No I tried to catch it with my mouth because I thought it was funny and then swam back

221
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,640
up and swallowed a quarter.

222
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,560
There was so much, so I'm drinking like chlorine water in a quarter and as soon as I got out

223
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,040
of the pool, like I'm like kind of choking.

224
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm just like my mom's like freaking out. I was like I ate a quarter. I ate a quarter.

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,960
I feel like it should be a bigger deal, but it seems like it's no one really cares.

226
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
It doesn't matter. Yeah. Oh yeah. My little brother ate a penny.

227
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,640
What was I never I never told anybody because I was like somebody's gonna kill me for doing

228
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,320
that. It's gonna I'm gonna die and I don't want them to know that I'm gonna die. Yeah.

229
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,240
Well, no, like I would say either someone's gonna get mad at me or they're gonna say you're

230
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,640
gonna die in a week. Yeah. And either way I don't want that. I'm gonna see Ed, Edd,

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,180
and they're gonna fucking cut me open for a damn jawbreaker.

232
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,020
- Yeah.

233
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,840
- Yeah.

234
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
- Those jawbreakers are too damn big.

235
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,220
- Here's the thing, the jawbreakers, first of all,

236
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,740
that ain't going in my mouth.

237
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,440
That thing's humongous.

238
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
You know, second of all,

239
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,680
do these kids eat anything other than candy?

240
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,520
- I don't know.

241
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,340
- Yeah.

242
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,880
- Third of all, that kid, that Ed kid is not 10.

243
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
He is 30 years old.

244
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,760
Listen to his voice, dude.

245
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,120
He is 30 years old and he's a girl.

246
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,440
And fourth of all, that plank's not real.

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,540
It's just a piece of wood.

248
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,000
It can't talk to the guy.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,080
- Exactly.

250
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,560
- So there's a lot of things about that.

251
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,400
- Why would you take those out?

252
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,320
- Will you give me your hand?

253
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,140
- No!

254
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,980
- Why?

255
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,820
- No.

256
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,640
- What?

257
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
Will you close your eyes?

258
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,360
- No, don't put the handcuffs on me.

259
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
- Why?

260
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,600
- I don't want to put the handcuffs on.

261
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,080
- Why, 'cause you're scared?

262
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,520
- I'm not scared, I just don't want handcuffs on me.

263
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,360
- Why?

264
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
- 'Cause I don't like 'em.

265
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,560
- You're scared of the police.

266
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
- I put them on.

267
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,220
- Come on, put 'em on.

268
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,060
- No, I don't put 'em on.

269
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,660
Seriously put them on. This is so embarrassing. Dude, I'm filming you right now. Oh my god. He's resisting arrest

270
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,960
He's literally resisting arrest. Come here. Come here. You have to give me your hand. No, I'm an officer of the court

271
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,400
Get it on him. It's

272
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,900
Those aren't even oh wait, those are like the little kid I could fucking little kid. Yeah, I'll destroy these

273
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,980
No, don't destroy don't try it, please

274
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,600
Don't can you just let me handcuff you to smell something in my house like me

275
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,480
You fucking you

276
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
You you're going to jail. Oh

277
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,780
Yeah, I spent $50 on those. No, you did not spend $50 on these

278
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm sorry from here. I can see those are at least $50 handcuffs are made out of platinum. That's why they're so easy to break

279
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,460
I'm sorry. I'm acting up. I lost a lot of blood earlier at the doctor.

280
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,100
Yeah, oh yeah, Caleb went to the hospital for the first time in 10 years.

281
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,740
I did, I went to the doctor and dude, dude, it was so, it was crazy. I didn't realize what this, what, that they do this now.

282
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,820
I walked in, I've been having like heart palpitations. I walked in, I was like, yeah, I've been having heart palpitations.

283
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,240
The doctor said, she said, by the third thing that she said, she was offering me SSRIs.

284
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,320
Really?

285
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,740
I swear to God. She was like, she was like, so, like, hi, my name is whatever.

286
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,380
whatever and I was like yeah cool and she was like what are your symptoms and I was like

287
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,860
oh I've been getting like heart palpitations at night and she was like okay so we can do

288
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:04,300
a couple things one I can send you to a cardiologist or two I can give you SSRIs like right now

289
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,540
and like see you on your way. SSRIs are fucking evil. Dude it's horrible. The worst medicine

290
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:15,140
of all time. I mean look at the first two letters no disrespect. And then Rhode Island

291
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,140
at the end. This is like the scariest shit I've ever had.

292
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,980
No disrespect to people who like need to take SSRIs for their mood or something,

293
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,380
but you should just be willpower on your way through it.

294
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,180
Yeah. Have you ever tried being normal?

295
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,340
Have you ever just like thought about eating a vegetable?

296
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,260
Just don't jump out the window. You know what you need to do?

297
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,500
Literally that fucking easy. It's called turmeric.

298
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,780
It's called self-control, dude. It's literally called hanging out and

299
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,780
watching TV and eating a sandwich. Yeah, watch The Simpsons. Hey, smile, honey.

300
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,860
Smile more. You should smile more. You look pretty when you smile.

301
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,860
You're taking these damn SSRIs. You fucking bloated ass face.

302
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,820
And also you want to have sex with me because you're on SSRIs.

303
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,220
Yeah.

304
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,100
Oh, speaking of sex, I forget, like, I haven't been to the doctor in a long time.

305
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,020
It is sexual.

306
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,340
Yeah?

307
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,540
The doctor is sexual.

308
00:13:59,540 --> 00:13:59,940
Yeah, and what a way.

309
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,740
That is weird.

310
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,620
That is the most intimate contact that I've had with a woman since I've been with Jana.

311
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,140
She was like touching, like, my face.

312
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,940
Did you get, did you-

313
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,060
She's holding me.

314
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,380
She held me.

315
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,500
Did you get like a full checkup?

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:19,540
She held me dude. She fucking held me close, wouldn't let me go and she was like

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,100
those are crazy because it's like I know you don't need this you know I know you

331
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,420
don't need like a picture of me for my temperature and this just makes me want

332
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,980
to like stand here for 20 minutes like playing with it like a memoji

333
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,140
temperature changes if I open my mouth is like pulling up like a picture of

334
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,700
somebody on my phone and like holding it up to try and scan that like it took all

335
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
my willpower not to...

336
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,420
Dude, it was so fucked. I like went in there really hoping like,

337
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,900
"Please be cancer, please be someone really fucking evil."

338
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,260
It's worse when it's just nothing.

339
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Well, she was like, "Okay, so you have, she was like,

340
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,740
you have ideal blood pressure and you have the heart rate of an Olympic athlete."

341
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
And I was like...

342
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,900
She was trying to fuck you.

343
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,460
I was like, "Well, you like, like was good, like what's up, what's our next move?"

344
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,700
Oh my God, yeah. She was like, "The rhythm of your heart is actually perfectly in sync with mine."

345
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,780
And we're the same blood type. And we have the same last name. It's beautiful.

346
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,260
They also hooked me up to, they put electrodes on me.

347
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,820
Oh yeah.

348
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,180
Dude, that was fucking freaky.

349
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,220
They shocked you?

350
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,260
Yeah, they shocked me.

351
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,980
Oh wow.

352
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,460
Yeah.

353
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:19,860
No they didn't.

354
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm straight. It was beautiful.

355
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,140
No, they just like, they hooked up like all these little fucking stickers to me and then

356
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,700
they put all these wires on me and they fucking, they found out that I have the heart rate of an

357
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,740
Olympic athlete.

358
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,460
Wow.

359
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,780
Yeah.

360
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,260
That's good.

361
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,980
But she did say it was bad.

362
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,980
I mean, that actually, that sounds bad to have the heart rate.

363
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:34,980
That's bad?

364
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,300
Yeah.

365
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,440
- Yeah, 'cause you drove there, right?

366
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,280
- Yeah.

367
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,500
- Yeah, you probably shouldn't have the heart rate

368
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,340
of an Olympic athlete.

369
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,220
- Well, no, like people who are in really good shape

370
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,940
have like slightly below normal heart rates.

371
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,780
- Oh, okay.

372
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,220
- And so she was like, you have like a low heart rate,

373
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,900
but you also are not like 1% body fat,

374
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,940
so it's probably bad.

375
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,780
- Yeah. - Yeah.

376
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,940
- So I just don't, I think my heart

377
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,340
is a little on the slow side.

378
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,580
- The thing about heart problems

379
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,380
is if you just ignore them, they go away.

380
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,220
- Yeah. - Yeah.

381
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,380
- But I did-- - I mean, that's most problems.

382
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,220
I don't, you don't have to go

383
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,620
to the fucking doctor for anything.

384
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,900
I remember the last time they took my heart rate at the doctor, they were like, "Oh my

385
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,940
God!"

386
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,900
And I just never went back to the doctor and said, "Fine."

387
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
That's the move.

388
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,680
I was like, "I don't think my dad's been to the doctor in 30 years and he's been chewing

389
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,060
tobacco for 30 years."

390
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,700
It doesn't matter if they don't tell you everything's wrong.

391
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Nothing's going to be wrong.

392
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,420
Also, if my dad died tomorrow, I'd be like, "Well, he's close to 60.

393
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
That makes sense."

394
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,500
if he had gone to the doctor ten years ago and then we had this ten years of

395
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,620
like oh no dad's gonna die yeah yeah it's way better for him to just be like

396
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm out yeah I mean you know you like as somebody is just like an extreme

397
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,300
hypochondriac I still I don't go to the doctor because if they tell me anything

398
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,940
I'm gonna freak out also you know doctor that's the number one place to get sick

399
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,180
that's they have to keep all the diseases there to test true to test

400
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,780
whether you have there and they're spraying those things on their

401
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Also, Brooklyn hospitals are like way...

402
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Like they had me pee, they did a pee sample.

403
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
And they drank it?

404
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,780
Well, I peed into a red Solo cup.

405
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Really?

406
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
What?

407
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,780
Yeah, I was like, "Fuck you, I swear to God, dude."

408
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,780
I swear to God, she was like, "Just grab one of those cups."

409
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,780
And usually it's like a little thing with a green cap on it for shit like that.

410
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
It's just a red Solo cup.

411
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,780
I don't think you went to an actual doctor.

412
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:36,580
The more I hear about this visit, the less I think you were in the right place.

413
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
La Providencia.

414
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Family Medical.

415
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Yeah.

416
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:45,300
I mean, that would be if you open, like if you have an apartment next to an urgent care,

417
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,060
just put an urgent care sign on your apartment door.

418
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,180
That's free blood, free urine.

419
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,420
Free blood and free urine, yeah.

420
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Well, that's heartbeat.

421
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
Free heartbeat.

422
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
You can get the tools, too.

423
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Yeah.

424
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,420
up medical tool prices before. Oh yeah we did it's pretty fucking expensive.

425
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,660
We could do, I mean you know we chip in we all get it together. It's literally really

426
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,740
easy to draw blood you just have to cut somebody and take the blood out. That's

427
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,140
true. I mean if you want all the fancy shit they I mean they just that the tube

428
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,180
they have to draw blood that's the same as like a gumball machine with the track.

429
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,900
True. Like that's just to look cool to make you excited about the blood. It's like a silly straw from Crazy Browns.

430
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,220
Right yeah if you want I mean that's also that's why they that's why they it cost

431
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,020
so much to go to the doctor here it's because they're using all these fancy

432
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,300
the tubes and needles exactly a real doctor just cuts you with their canine

433
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,360
tooth and they let it drip out onto a napkin and they ring the napkin out into

434
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,960
their blood machine yeah that's why if you ever look at like if you go to like

435
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,280
urgent care or like the hospital you look at the medical bill silly to tax

436
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,980
yeah most of the of the bill yeah it is I do feel after this visit I do feel

437
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,700
like American health care is so expensive because the doctors have to be

438
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:58,820
sexual to you. I honestly do. Yeah. She was so in love with me dude. She diagnosed herself

439
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,860
with humongous boobs. I swear to God.

440
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:08,380
Man, yeah, that's the other thing. Healthcare in this country is so expensive.

441
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:15,900
It's just so expensive. I'm sure you're clapping at home. The thing about it is it just costs

442
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,100
so much damn money and it's due to the system as well.

443
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,340
Oh, you know what?

444
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,980
Don't get me fucking started on the system.

445
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,140
And Joe damn Biden is one of the guys doing it.

446
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
Yeah, well.

447
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,820
It's not about--

448
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,020
He's not allowed to talk about Joe.

449
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,340
It's not about the system, right?

450
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,180
Right.

451
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,460
It's about literally the factors

452
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,820
that influence the system. Absolutely.

453
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,060
Class.

454
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,260
Yeah.

455
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,180
Healthcare.

456
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,540
Healthcare's a huge factor in the system.

457
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,560
The system.

458
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,400
Yeah.

459
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,820
I mean, the system, you know,

460
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,020
you gotta learn the system to teach the system.

461
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,100
different branches of the presidential government. Here's a question you want my

462
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,580
you need my age, you need my weight, you need my height when I go to the doctor.

463
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,940
What are you gonna do build a statue of me? Well that too but also like you don't

464
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,380
care what my favorite color is? It's blue you don't care? You know you thought I

465
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,540
wouldn't notice that you're not asking me my favorite color? Right. And my

466
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,140
favorite time and my favorite number my favorite letter? Oh what about my favorite

467
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,740
food? My favorite song. My favorite song. Can you play my favorite song? It's like the

468
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,820
The nurse comes in, asks me for all this information,

469
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,140
the doctor comes in, asks me the same information again.

470
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,980
- Exactly.

471
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,420
- That is the most annoying part.

472
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,220
- It is, so it's, they are,

473
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,340
it's a conspiracy to make nurses more annoying.

474
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,380
- Yeah, nurse comes in, she's hot, right?

475
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,660
She's big and hot.

476
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,060
Nurse leaves, doctor comes in,

477
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,900
she's like the Russian nesting doll

478
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,860
that that nurse was sitting in before.

479
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,300
Looks the same, bigger, hotter, right?

480
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,540
She comes in, she says, "I'm gonna need 50 cc's of your cum."

481
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,180
50 cc I'm gonna need two double I mean 50 cc's on my two double D's yeah and

482
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,540

483
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,460
on my double B's my double butt cheeks I call these my double D's. How about poop on a butt?

484
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,220
No, I don't want to think about poop on anything. How about poop between two butt cheeks?

485
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,780
Unfortunately we're out of those little vials to put the stool

486
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,500
samples in so I'm gonna need you to put it between these two slices of bread.

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,780
also could you take the lemon twist it and rub it around the rim a little bit

496
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,500
that would be great I'm the doctor yeah I after you after you you know fill this

497
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,260
cup with your urine sample I just need you to microwave it and throw in a few

498
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:03,100
marshmallows for me would you mean would you even be mad if there was like if you

499
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,580
found out that there was like drinking my pee?

500
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,420
Well, yeah, or if you found out there was a guy who sits outside your toilet all day

501
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,580
eating your shit, like I wouldn't care. I just feel like...

502
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,540
If there was a guy eating my shit in the toilet?

503
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,220
If he's just eating it, that's fine.

504
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,820
So you know that hole that goes, the tube that goes from your toilet all the way down

505
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,380
the street? If he just put his mouth on that like he was like a hamster sucking his food

506
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,380
out?

507
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,740
If he was eating it right out of the tube, I'm fine with that. But if he's storing it

508
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,660
in any capacity, that's not okay.

509
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Because he might clone me.

510
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,040
because he might take my DNA. I mean as long as he's not cloning me. Yeah that's a

511
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,680
good yeah that's the other thing is a lot of the a lot of the like a lot of the

512
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,800
doctor questions are very clone heavy. They are. So they can build a profile.

513
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,000
What's something that only you would know but that someone else would know to

514
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,360
ask you that only you would know? Yeah. Are you sexually active? Yeah. Have you ever been

515
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,920
cloned before? No reason. Cloned by your doctor? No reason it just doesn't work twice.

516
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,400
That's a, you can't clone a, are you a clone?

517
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,560
You actually can't clone a clone.

518
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,600
It's just something we have to know.

519
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,520
She also kept trying to make me get STD tests.

520
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,160
She kept being like, which I feel like

521
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,200
it does not reflect well on what I look like.

522
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Like I walked in and she was like,

523
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,640
first SSRIs, second off,

524
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,600
we have to get you an HPV booster shot.

525
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,040
I was like, I think I'm fine, lady.

526
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,120
- Yeah, speaking of HPV,

527
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:33,600
list top 10 worst sounds the human body makes by Cole 33 number one vomiting I

528
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:40,400
vomit I don't like the sound of vomit I gotta be honest it doesn't if somebody

529
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,720
faking like making a fake vomit sound does not bother me at all but the actual

530
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,800
sound of vomit well I don't it's the dry heave that bothers me I think it's the

531
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,200
sound of the puke hitting like the like the speed it's the sound of the end of

532
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,760
you coming out of the body to like you there's a difference between so like

533
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,500
because it sounds like a cough that's shooting stuff out, you know?

534
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,000
And it sounds very disgusting.

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Speaking of dry heaving, I was cleaning my ears yesterday.

536
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,500
Where is this going?

537
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't know, I went too far into the ear.

538
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You went far enough to make yourself gag?

539
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I put the Q-tip in my ear.

540
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Are you kidding, dude?

541
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,500
And I coughed and was like dry heaving.

542
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know.

543
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Don't put Q-tips in your ears.

544
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Why?

545
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,500
It's not good.

546
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,000
If you're going to use a Q-tip, you got to use it like around the very edge of your ear.

547
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I was bored.

548
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm going to get you a Tamagotchi.

549
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Why?

550
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,000
What does that have to do with any of this?

551
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Just would give you something to do.

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, okay.

553
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know what?

554
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Good point.

555
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I forgot to set up a report.

556
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,700
But yeah, I don't know how I made myself dry heaved cleaning my ear.

557
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,000
You put it so deep into your ear that it hits your nose.

558
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
And it hits your medulla oblongata.

559
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,000
That is not where the medulla oblongata...

560
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Your uvula.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,840
the he pointed to his throat I don't know what I'm a do love part of your brain

562
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,240
it's from the water boy very funny word though yeah here's the top comment from

563
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,960
blue and black midnight rose okay this is gonna be good yeah listening to someone

564
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,560
vomit is absolute torture one time a very long time ago a kid in my class

565
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,340
said he felt sick so he was sent to the bathroom and the thing is the bathroom

566
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,440
was right across the corner from the classroom and you could hear any body

567
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,920
fluid coming from people in those bathrooms I was trying to take a test and

568
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,920
and I heard loud gagging and gooey vomiting through the walls.

569
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,640
I felt so sick and ill I couldn't focus on my test anymore.

570
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
- Gooey vomiting.

571
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
- Oh, it's so gooey.

572
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
- Ooey gooey.

573
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,120
- I think that you--

574
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,200
- Yeah, well, they didn't know that it was gooey

575
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,400
until the vomiting guy left the bathroom

576
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,880
and they heard the janitor go in and go,

577
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
"It's so ooey gooey."

578
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,000
- And then heard like the sounds of Scooby Doo eating

579
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,840
or something.

580
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,720
- Yeah, and then heard the janitor walking and going,

581
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,640
(imitates vomiting)

582
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
(laughing)

583
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
I don't have a fear of vomiting.

584
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
I never would.

585
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Oh.

586
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,160
I think the worst time I ever vomited, uh, I was like five years old and I got like a

587
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,360
uh, the Burger King had like a chicken parm.

588
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,560
That's, you were the dumbest five year old of all time.

589
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
I know.

590
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,360
It was like a Burger King, like, I don't know if it was a chicken parm, I think, I think

591
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
it was.

592
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Chicken parm?

593
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Yeah.

594
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
As in parmesan?

595
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,120
Yeah, it was like a chicken sandwich with like tomato sauce.

596
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
At Burger King.

597
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
At Burger King?

598
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Yeah.

599
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,200
of those and I was like I just immediately I've never I think that's the

600
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,020
first time I've ever had food poisoning really because I remember the next day

601
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:31,280
just like getting up and I think I just like I had just really bad diarrhea and

602
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,120
then like my mom was like are you sick and I went yep then just fucking just

603
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,840
projectile vomit on the ground but I didn't I didn't have to go to school

604
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,680
which was nice one time I vomited when my dad tried to tell me that my parents

605
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
were getting divorced.

606
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,920
We were like, I swear to God, I was like, I was like feeling really sick coming home from

607
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,960
football and he was like, you know, son, we mean, I mean your mom and I'm in the front

608
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
of his Suburban.

609
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm like, yeah, dad.

610
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Yeah, what's good?

611
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
What's good?

612
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Let me know.

613
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,320
He's like, you know, we've been having immediately just vomit all over his dashboard and dude,

614
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,800
he's never been more relieved in his life.

615
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,160
He's like, oh my God, kick that can down the road.

616
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Yeah.

617
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm going to skip to number two here.

618
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,180
two's farting. Oh, that's smelly. Come on. Yeah. There are so many variations in

619
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,800
sounds in farts or trumping as my Nan calls it. Whoa. I think it funny,

620
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,440
especially if it's quiet and someone lets out a little squeaky one it sets off

621
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,880
the whole office. That's bad. That's the fact that this person works in an office.

622
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,360
Yes. It's scaring me. I do feel, speaking of doctors, I do feel like if a doctor or

623
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,840
or a nurse or an EMS worker.

624
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,000
- What if a doctor farted?

625
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,840
- No.

626
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,760
- Let's go down that road.

627
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,700
- No.

628
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,720
If a doctor smelled one of my farts,

629
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,080
they would like admit me to like cedar sign.

630
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
- Yeah, there's some farts you get where it's just like,

631
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,440
oh, there's something wrong with you.

632
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,920
- You maybe don't even need to call a doctor,

633
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,320
you need to call a priest.

634
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
Like this is like, there's something like truly

635
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,200
like an ancient evil in me.

636
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,040
- Yeah.

637
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,640
- You know, like that's how I feel.

638
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,480
But I have not--

639
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,300
- Every once in a while I get one of those.

640
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,820
of those. She loved me so much. Yeah. She loved me down. Here's a comment. As I was

641
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,180
writing down this comment, I farted. My mates kicked me out of their stupid Jojo

642
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,260
Siwa gang just because I farted in front of them. For some particular reason, I

643
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:31,380
always fart. For some particular reason. There's a bunch of kids dressed like, like

644
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,940
looking like, like, was it Lisa Frank? Yeah. Yeah, looking like all dressed in

645
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,700
like Lisa Frank clothes bow tie yeah whatever it's like you can't hang out

646
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,020
with those if you're gonna be right again kid yeah they're wearing like

647
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,700
slings and leather jackets like like white they're like those Disney gang's

648
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,340
yeah yeah other jackets and they're walking around like hey we're gonna go

649
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,940
walk through graffiti on the side of the ball and we should start a gang like

650
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,260
okay we should start a Jojo see what gang we should just start like a tunnel

651
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,260
snakes type gang yeah yeah I mean imagine like a tunnel snakes type thing

652
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,180
but it's just like a picture of Jojo Siwa on the back is...

653
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Yeah.

654
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
That's crazy.

655
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,260
You guys, you could just say, I mean, I just moved here and I've already picked up on this,

656
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,140
so I don't know if you guys, you know, if you've had any experience with this, but certain...

657
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,100
So you have to be really careful wearing certain colors.

658
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,900
Like if you wear green in the sewers, the ninja mutant turtles might run up on you.

659
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,900
That's a really good point.

660
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,300
You know, if you wear like a gray blue in the ocean, they might think you're a shark.

661
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Yeah.

662
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Yeah.

663
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,500
You have to be careful wearing your fin.

664
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Your fin hat.

665
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Yeah, your shark fin.

666
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,500
you don't want to wear anything rainbow and Bushwick. Definitely not.

667
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Definitely not, dude.

668
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
These guys might think you're a part of this gang in Bushwick.

669
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Also, Leprechaun might run up on you.

670
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
You have to be careful, too.

671
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Pretty much anywhere in the city, if you wear transparent clothes,

672
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
the police are going to... Yeah, you definitely got to watch

673
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,500
what you wear. If you wear, like, for instance,

674
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
a police station, if you wear, like, a suicide vest,

675
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,260
vest yeah that's like a bad you're gonna get you get clapped up yeah it's like

676
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:12,900
it's real out there yeah my brother farts silently but is so stinky very very

677
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,500
annoying plus it smells like barf my favorite type is the cheese toasty or

678
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,300
the cornhole creeper the cornhole come on man the cheese toasties really bad

679
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,940
yeah toasty that that's like a food cornhole creeper but it's like okay

680
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,380
but refined to a fart as a cheese toasty.

681
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,380
- Why is it-- - Yeah, it's gross.

682
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,060
- It's nasty. - Why is it a cornhole creeper?

683
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,980
I've never seen-- I've seen corn, I've seen a hole, I've never seen--

684
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,580
I've seen corn!

685
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,180
I've seen a hole, I've never seen no damn cornhole creeper!

686
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
Why are you in my cornhole?

687
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:53,460
Call it a cornhole, because corn's the only thing that comes out of it!

688
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,100
Everything else is just a brown sludge! Corn!

689
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,300
Intact!

690
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,780
It's my cornhole!

691
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,780
*laughter*

692
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,780
*laughter*

693
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,780
*laughter*

694
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,780
But like, does the name-

695
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,780
That's my new character, Poop Seinfeld, by the way.

696
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Poop Seinfeld.

697
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
I've heard the word cornhole, but I've never like-

698
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Like, cause it's-

699
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,780
Obviously it's-

700
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,780
derived from a thing that's called a

701
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,780
cornhole.

702
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Is it just-

703
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,780
What is a cornhole?

704
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,780
A cornhole is the game, right?

705
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
It's the game where you throw the bean bags.

706
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,780
Cornhole is the game where you throw a beanie baggie baby across the world into the hole.

707
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Not work, not work.

708
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,780
You guys know I have a hard time saying stuff sometimes.

709
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
You just leave me alone.

710
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Across the fucking Mission BBQ parking lot you throw a fucking bean bag.

711
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
And you try to get in there.

712
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,780
Why is it called a bean bag? Is it because it's a bag full of beans?

713
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,780
Is it a bag full of beans? Is it these bags?

714
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Well Jay, I'm hungry, I might have to split one open.

715
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,780
I might have to eat the beans.

716
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
I think every toy should have food in it!

717
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,780
And after that, I'm gonna go eat the corn out of the hole!

718
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,780
*laughter*

719
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,780
Jerry, you don't want to do that.

720
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,780
No! Let me see your corn hole! I wanna eat the corn out of it!

721
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
I put my hand in the hole!

722
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,780
Let me put my bean bag in your corn hole!

723
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,780
He's a disgusting monster.

724
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Yeah, it's okay. It's a corn hole

725
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,780
where you throw a bean bag?

726
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Yeah. Wait, what?

727
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Excuse you! While you're drinking beer?

728
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,780
*laughter*

729
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,780
What's next, a pizza penis?

730
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,780
What's up with these food metaphors?

731
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,820
What's next am I gonna park my bread car in your soup garage?

732
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,500
What am I gonna do get on the french fry subway?

733
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:44,060
Why don't I just sit down on my peanut butter chair?

734
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:51,940
Jerry that is that is an actual peanut butter. I know I'm gonna peanut butter chair. I made it at home

735
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:57,940
it feels warm it's all feels good it molds my body it's like a temper panic

736
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:12,220
it's so what's the deal with calling it food and poop Seinfeld now is the new

737
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,900
version what is this you put the poop

738
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,940
put the food in your mouth and it becomes poop

739
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,500
My poop up my butt I'll burp up a cheeseburger. I don't think so

740
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:37,540
Jerry the left side of your face is

741
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:50,140
Burning toast Jerry

742
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,400
(laughing)

743
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,080
- Cheeseburger butler.

744
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,640
(laughing)

745
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
- Cheeseburger butler.

746
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,160
- Yeah and then like some--

747
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,680
- Jerry that's the greatest idea you've ever had.

748
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,680
- Some like assistant comes in and just like

749
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,280
shoots Botox in his face as normal again.

750
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,080
Like this happens everyday.

751
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,480
Yeah that's just what he does.

752
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,720
He just starts, if you mention emojis

753
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,800
he just starts doing this at some point.

754
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,640
- Texting!

755
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Emoji me no me

756
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:31,040
This poop is smiling why is he smiling it makes no sense?

757
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,520
Why would poop smile? Thank you. It comes out of my body. I have a smile

758
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,480
If you were happy would you wake up every morning with a smile on your face?

759
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
I don't think so

760
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,640
If you poop happy

761
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,800
frowning

762
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,320
They should make a smell so bad. They should make a frowning poop. They should how they not made a frowning

763
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,880
Gonna take me 10 minutes to get out of the voice

764
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,920
Maybe snoggin his voice for a couple minutes. Yeah number three snoring

765
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,560
My aunt Dottie has super loud snoring and I woke up one time when I was sleeping with her on a vacation

766
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,000
And I couldn't go back to sleep because she was snoring so loudly snoring. That's not like that bad a sound

767
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So I even with your on man, what you?

768
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
What are you doing baby boy? What is that about man?

769
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
She better be warm as hell!

770
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
My snoring is pretty bad.

771
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,500
Really?

772
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
It's bad but it's not a disgusting...

773
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I mean I talked about this like last episode.

774
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Just how bad it is.

775
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Yeah we already talked about snoring.

776
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah fuck snoring!

777
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But yeah whenever I snore it sounds like I'm dying.

778
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah number four, chewing.

779
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Chewing...

780
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Are you get disturbed when people chew with their mouth open?

781
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't give a fuck.

782
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,440
It just depends. If I'm already like stressed out or like if I'm if I'm annoyed already by something

783
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,860
It'll piss me off. If it's someone that annoys me and I can like pick apart like why they're annoying me

784
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,360
Right, and they're like chewing super loud with their mouth open. They just like got food all over their face

785
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,960
I'm just like you just fucking stop. Yeah, but like in general doesn't it doesn't bother me like immediately

786
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,740
Yeah, like maybe if it's like chewing and there's like a few snorts in there

787
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,680
I could never, you know, somebody's eating like an actual pig like that that kind of bothers me

788
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,980
But I mean if they're chewing with their mouth open like talking with food in their mouth

789
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,080
I don't care. You know what I sound

790
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,800
I don't like when people are eating if somebody bites the fork when they're eating but they like pull their teeth on the floor

791
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,120
What are you doing? Why would you do that?

792
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:32,800
T thing is so just there's no there's no reason that you're not gonna human mouth is one of the most disgusting

793
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,080
Doesn't taste very good

794
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
Leave it at that. It doesn't

795
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
Don't taste like food

796
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,200
Hey, you'll be able to pop off your teeth eat it like gum

797
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,980
We're just doing time for made of food again now remember that yeah, I felt made of food

798
00:37:52,980 --> 00:38:03,400
What's this a cry gave me my full tooth you only give me a quarter that could be one that could be one yeah

799
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,800
maybe Jerry Seinfeld talking about food is so funny. It's very funny.

800
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,000
Just food though. Just food. Any food Seinfeld is so good to me. Yeah. Because like the

801
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,960
idea that he is confused by like food. Just like the thing that everyone is always

802
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,440
eating and it and makes sense to everyone. What's the deal with the

803
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,000
gingerbread house? It's not a house and it's not made of gingerbread.

804
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,260
(laughing)

805
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,900
- What's a cheese booger?

806
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,140
I've never had a cheese booger.

807
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,020
Everyone's always eating these damn boogers

808
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,300
and cheese boogers.

809
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
- Where's the sand on my sandwich?

810
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,100
I don't know how to get the food into my belly.

811
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
- I like the--

812
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,340
- I wish I just had a hole in my stomach,

813
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,100
then I can put the food in there.

814
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,580
- That's a very good idea actually.

815
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,740
It's efficient.

816
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,580
That's just--

817
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,420
(laughing)

818
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,260
- Colossomy bag?

819
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,100
- Yeah, colossomy bag.

820
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,540
this kind of fucked up yeah yeah I think maybe I mean worse sound a human body

821
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,740
can make probably a colostomy bag emptying oh yeah yeah that's it that's

822
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,020
not the human body anymore though no that's the worst that we're sleeping on

823
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,740
the realm of I'm gonna hit you with a knowledge bomb right now we're sound a

824
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,420
human body can make your true love saying I hate you it's true I'd probably

825
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:26,140
say Justin Bieber singing but that's just me maybe you guys are girls I mean

826
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,600
Yeah, number five, screaming.

827
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,100
Hello.

828
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,740
No comments at all on screaming.

829
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,820
I mean, screaming is--

830
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,180
Screaming's a cool sound.

831
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,680
Yeah.

832
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,940
Screaming always makes me laugh.

833
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,440
True.

834
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,940
Really?

835
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,440
Every time.

836
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,340
No matter the context.

837
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,020
OK.

838
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,460
No, but a scream is a very funny sound, I think.

839
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,820
Sometimes it makes me scared.

840
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,460
When I'm doing it, it makes me scared.

841
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,960
Yeah.

842
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,460
Yeah, when I hear myself screaming, that's pretty scary.

843
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,180
Yeah.

844
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,420
But if I'm hanging out with someone, they just scream.

845
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,620
It's like, that's very funny.

846
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,980
When I hear a scream on the subway, I get scared.

847
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Yeah, that's scary.

848
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,640
Like, in the train station.

849
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,060
I was like, do you remember that one time in Boston

850
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,280
when I was fully convinced that there was a mass shooting

851
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,220
on the train tracks or something,

852
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,780
and it was just snow falling off of a train?

853
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,420
But the snow fell off of the train

854
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,140
in this huge, insanely rattling, loud sound.

855
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,860
And then a lady goes, "Ah!"

856
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,940
So everyone just starts, the guy closest starts running,

857
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,140
and then the people that he runs by start running,

858
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,580
and then now it's like that mobile game

859
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,540
that you get ads for where one guy is running

860
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,240
and he picks up all these groups.

861
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,080
And so I just started running and a lady

862
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,680
was like immediately out of breath

863
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,880
and going up like two flights of stairs.

864
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,600
She's like, "What are we running from?"

865
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,040
I was like, "I don't know.

866
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,440
(laughing)

867
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,280
"I don't know."

868
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,560
And then we got up and then we were just like

869
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,040
got our breaths and kind of acknowledge each other.

870
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,760
And then just, we just both just like

871
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
we didn't try to call the cops or anything.

872
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,960
Completely convinced there was a mass shooting going on.

873
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,900
Just leave.

874
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,740
- Yeah, just get out of there.

875
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,200
- But screaming in like that in public,

876
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,160
you always are, I always assume I'm like

877
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,520
somebody is being

878
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,920
uh... attacked

879
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
and i'm always also immediately surprised because i'm like

880
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,040
i'm not doing anything and i don't know if we are not going to also i feel like

881
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,400
every time i hear a scream and i think someone is being attacked or dying and i

882
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,280
go like look at the window or like like run the look around the corner it's

883
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,600
always just like a kid

884
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,460
like playing with the yeah i was just about to say it was like a kid like

885
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,880
running and playing with his friends

886
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,340
i was at blue park the other day

887
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,460
and like i just started hearing like it was like

888
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,320
you know like

889
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
eight o'clock so it's starting to get dark.

890
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,920
And they do it like ten times in a row too.

891
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,920
They were like running down the street and the screaming's getting louder.

892
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
And they're saying, "You're killing me!"

893
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
Right.

894
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,920
"You're so funny!"

895
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,000
They're like running down the street so the screaming's getting louder.

896
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,840
I was just sitting, I was like covered in sweat just kind of like sitting there trying

897
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,120
to cool off and all I could hear was just like, "Ahh!

898
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Ahh!"

899
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,360
Like, "Oh fuck, someone's getting killed!"

900
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,000
You should not be able to scream on the street unless you have a license for it.

901
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Absolutely.

902
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
This is my screamer's license.

903
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,880
I think if you are you have to go take a test to see how funny you are.

904
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,440
It should just be like alcohol you have to be 21 to scream.

905
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
I agree.

906
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
That would solve the issue.

907
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,640
Because a lot of these kids are screaming way too young.

908
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
Exactly.

909
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,000
It messes with their, it stunts their brain growth.

910
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,640
And then also they get to our age they have that fucking tracheotomy box and they scream

911
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
too much.

912
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
I would love to get one of those.

913
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,080
They have a Darth Vader voice modulator to help them speak.

914
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,400
They're always going "Hooober."

915
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
You know how kids be, they be saying "Hoober."

916
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,900
Kiss me on the Darth Vader shit these days.

917
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,400
Yeah, Darth Vader be saying "Hobur".

918
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,900
Yeah.

919
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,600
Number six, burping.

920
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,400
Burping, um...

921
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I think I've like...

922
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,900
I think I actually don't like the sound of burping sometimes.

923
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Really?

924
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,400
Yeah, I mean it's always funny, but like...

925
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Yeah, I mean, shrek.

926
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Shrek.

927
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,900
I don't care about burping really either way at all.

928
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,400
I don't think it makes me happy or sad.

929
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
I never realized burps smell.

930
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Dude, I was just about to say that.

931
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,320
say that a burp is worse than a fart, worse than a shit, worse than a piss, worse than

932
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,480
a cum and a spit and a smell and a poop.

933
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
I don't think it's that bad.

934
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
It's worse than all those.

935
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,800
I just think like, like getting burped in the face, somebody burps in your face.

936
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,840
I think if somebody like, yeah, I think ultimate disrespect, you're walking down the street,

937
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,640
a guy just comes up to you, burps in your face.

938
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,840
I might have to like immediately.

939
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,600
If you don't kill that person on the spot, you're a pussy.

940
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,200
I would punch bone splinters into their brain immediately.

941
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
Yeah.

942
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, I would probably immediately like...

943
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Why are you laughing?

944
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,320
I'd probably do like a finger punch like in Kill Bill.

945
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,720
Just like burst right through their chest, probably pull their heart out.

946
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Yeah.

947
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Probably like give it to a kid who needs it.

948
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,840
A kid who needs a heart transplant immediately.

949
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
I might just like...

950
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,320
Copy them off from Temple of Doom.

951
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,200
I might just literally just rip them apart completely and just shred them.

952
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I might do that.

953
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,400
You burp at me, I'm shredding you.

954
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,400
Yeah, absolutely.

955
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
You're getting threshed.

956
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,200
Yeah, I might pick them up over my head and run around looking for a woodchipper and it

957
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,160
takes me like an hour and then you're just completely out of breath.

958
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,160
What am I doing this for?

959
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,960
What happened again?

960
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,400
I never learned to burp as a kid.

961
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,560
I couldn't like belch because I didn't drink soda or anything.

962
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,000
I also never ate all that much food.

963
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I never eat a lot of food and you burp so.

964
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't think I've ever burped from eating.

965
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I never did eat that much food growing up.

966
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I just wasn't really into it really.

967
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Genuinely that is how I live my life nowadays is that I'm just not that into eating food.

968
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's just such a funny thing to say.

969
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's true.

970
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Yeah, I didn't eat that much food growing up.

971
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
This wasn't for me. Not even like, "Oh, I was too poor to eat."

972
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It was just like, "I just didn't want it."

973
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I mean, it was all around. I lived it. It was basically Thanksgiving every day.

974
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I mean, the thing is, you put food in your mouth and after one chew, it's like, "I'm done with this. I want this gone."

975
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh, do you really?

976
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I want this in my stomach immediately. I want the taste. I do not...

977
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
That keeps happening. I keep, like, chewing.

978
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You're, like, I'm getting so old now.

979
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I hate the texture of food so much.

980
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Like, I'll order Chinese food and then, like, three or four bites in, I'll just, like...

981
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yeah, it's like, "Fuck this, dude."

982
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm like, "Ah, I can't fucking finish this at all."

983
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,560
Yeah, like used to be an absolute monster truck dude. Yeah, I was I you could you fucking used to watch me

984
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,920
Just eat just insane shit. You should be fries fries not with the meal, but fries as an extra side order kind of guy

985
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,200
Yeah, yeah

986
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,960
Yeah, I mean I worked at a I mean I worked at restaurants and I'll just get like discounted meals

987
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,480
So just come to like like your apartment because you lived right down the street from that Clover

988
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,380
So I'd get like my discount at Clover and like show up with like, oh, yeah, they got apple fritters there

989
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,900
So I'd show up with like this gigantic sandwich, an order of fries, like a drink that's like

990
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,020
just all sugar and then like apple fritters or like a side salad and I'd just sit there

991
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,820
and just eat all that in your apartment.

992
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,340
It's pretty beautiful times.

993
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,340
Oh dude.

994
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,500
That was, I mean still, if I could have that meal right now, I'd fucking.

995
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,700
Dude, I honestly, the thing is like I'm not sure that like, like being fat sucks in a

996
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,980
lot of ways, but also just like not caring and eating anything you want almost

997
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,660
outweighs the bad things about being fat. Which I still do, but I think I just

998
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,740
like exercise a little bit now. So now it's like I'm fine. I'm trying to get

999
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,500
absolutely ripped right now. I'm eating disgusting things right now. I have that thought that I should get

1000
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,740
insanely ripped because it would be funny. It would not be funny. As soon

1001
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,660
as I start working out. Everybody who has the thought of

1002
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,060
like it would be so funny if I got ripped. It's not that it would be funny, it's you

1003
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,060
want to be ripped.

1004
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,060
Yeah.

1005
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Well, no.

1006
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,860
You would be too good looking, I think, if you got ripped.

1007
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Really?

1008
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,860
Yeah.

1009
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,860
Probably.

1010
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,860
Yeah, it'd be upsetting.

1011
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,860
Yeah.

1012
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,860
That's why I don't do it.

1013
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,260
Me, it's funny. I look like a Prometheus alien if I get any muscles.

1014
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,260
Yeah.

1015
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:44,060
But if you did it, you'd look like a super movie star, Hollywood style, Bollywood style.

1016
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,060
Bollywood style?

1017
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,060
Wow.

1018
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,060
They have beautiful people there.

00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,060
They do.

1020
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060
They do.

1021
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,060
Anytime.

1022
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,060
They do.

1023
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:55,380
I do you know there's like AI like what what celebrity do you look like yeah it's

00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,340
look like the squirtle of like a David Krumholz blastoise yeah that's what I

1026
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,740
look like I would love to get really ripped but I can't even play a video

1027
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:16,580
game that I enjoy for more than like 20 minutes yeah like my brain like not like

1028
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,660
I could never do something that I have to do yeah I just would never yeah I

1029
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,660
I fuckin' I, Gus gave me like a workout plan and I fuckin'

1030
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,420
- Yeah, no, nothing.

1031
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,900
- I can't, like I did it for like two days

1032
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,820
and I was just like, oh, I'm like,

1033
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,380
I just wanna skate, that's it.

1034
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,380
- Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,820
I mean it's not fun. - I still have that workout

1036
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,740
but I might just do that but who knows.

1037
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,860
- I've been going to the gym man,

1038
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,140
it's the worst shit ever.

1039
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,700
- Oh, I fuckin' hate it. - It sucks, dude.

1040
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,540
- I hate going to the gym.

1041
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,040
You go, you sit, you wait for everything.

1042
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,540
Yeah.

1043
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,040
So many fucking people there.

1044
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,540
The other day I was there, there's just like insanely autistic, like really old guy there,

1045
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,540
who was just like walking around, like doing the machines, like rattling and talking to himself.

1046
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,040
And then I walked by him, and he said, "Shove it up your ass, you Nazi piece of shit."

1047
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,540
[Laughter]

1048
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,540
And I was like, "Holy shit, dude."

1049
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,540
I was like, "What the, where the fuck is this coming from, dude?"

1050
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,540
I'm being persecuted as a bald man.

1051
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,040
Yeah.

1052
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,540
It's fucked up, dude.

1053
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:16,040
Yeah.

1054
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,540
By this fucking guy.

1055
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,040
And he was like an old white dude.

1056
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,040
You could have cleaned his clock.

1057
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,040
I could have.

1058
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
You should have.

1059
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
I'm not going to suck his dick, dude.

1060
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
What are you talking about?

1061
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,040
It's fucking weird.

1062
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
I don't know.

1063
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
There is a shower there.

1064
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
There is a shower.

1065
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:34,040
He seemed like the kind of old man who mostly goes there because it's an easier place.

1066
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:37,040
There he can shower around people, so if he falls, someone sees it.

1067
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,040
Yeah, yeah.

1068
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,040
It's not a bad idea.

1069
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,040
Oh, I fell.

1070
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Oh, someone needs to pick me up.

1071
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Oh, I fell in here.

1072
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,040
Oh, someone needs to pick me up.

1073
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,040
Penis first.

1074
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
Yeah, that's not a rope.

1075
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,700
- Oh, penis first. - Yeah, that's not a rope.

1076
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,240
(laughing)

1077
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,160
- Oh no, I dropped all of my soaps.

1078
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,480
(laughing)

1079
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm too old to pick it up.

1080
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,360
- It's like any communal shower is like prison.

1081
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,520
- Yeah. - He's like, oh.

1082
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,040
- Things happen to any communal shower.

1083
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,560
- Just turns into prison, he's like, it's like prison.

1084
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,680
I drop my soap and I get to have sex.

1085
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,800
(laughing)

1086
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,720
- Yeah. - Number seven is hiccuping.

1087
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,040
- Hiccuping is disgusting.

1088
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,160
- I hate hiccups. - You think so?

1089
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,520
- Really? - I hate getting hiccups.

1090
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,020
- I don't like getting them, but I don't care about hearing them.

1091
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,020
- Getting hiccups is one of those times when I'm like,

1092
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,520
if I had a button that would painlessly end my life,

1093
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,520
I would press it right now.

1094
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,020
- It's like that, have you ever heard that interview,

1095
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,520
like George Clooney, apparently,

1096
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,020
he broke his spine or something,

1097
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
or had some spine thing,

1098
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,520
and he was like, "I almost killed myself."

1099
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,020
That's how I get, any time I get the hiccups.

1100
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,520
It's like, I could seriously end my life right now,

1101
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
and I would die.

1102
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
- I'd be content.

1103
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
- I would die happy.

1104
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,520
It would be the only relief I've ever had.

1105
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,520
- Exactly.

1106
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,020
- Here's a great story.

1107
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,620
Hiccup is embarrassing plus very funny. If you don't believe me then guess what?

1108
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:53,220
When it was my birthday and birthday party, everyone came and we put a Bremen cheesecake and a melted chocolate cake. Yum!

1109
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,620
Instead of everyone saying happy birthday, everyone told me to sing a solo and everyone else clapped for me.

1110
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,820
But something happened, which was when I began to sing, I hiccup again and again,

1111
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,020
and everyone thought I was singing so they didn't notice I was actually hiccuping.

1112
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,020
So everyone clapped while I was hiccuping. In the end of my hiccup, I told everyone I was hiccuping. Haha.

1113
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,820
Laugh out loud!

1114
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,100
That's quite the story.

1115
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:13,740
Yeah.

1116
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:14,620
I don't believe it.

1117
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:15,420
I don't believe it happened.

1118
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,580
I would never confuse hiccuping for singing.

1119
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,080
No.

1120
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,020
That is very funny.

1121
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,620
I'm a bit of a smart man.

1122
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,540
Happy birthday.

1123
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,300
I don't know.

1124
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,180
I'm going to give myself hiccups.

1125
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,220
I'm terrified.

1126
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,220
Yeah, I don't want to fucking...

1127
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,540
I will say I never have hiccups in the times when I shouldn't have hiccups.

1128
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:32,540
I don't think I've had hiccups in an insanely long time.

1129
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:36,060
I've never had hiccups before like stand up or something.

1130
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,700
Something where I had to like talk and could not have hiccups.

1131
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,060
I think that would be the end of my life probably.

1132
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,500
I mean you know those, do you ever read like in the like Guinness Book of World Records

1133
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,460
it always be like there's a woman who hiccuped for five years straight.

1134
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,500
That's the best thing in the Guinness Book of World Records is when they have like, it's

1135
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,980
like this is the guy who jumps the highest.

1136
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,140
Yeah and this is the guy who lives in the most misery.

1137
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,540
And this is the ugliest fucker in the world.

1138
00:50:58,540 --> 00:50:59,540
Yeah.

1139
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,540
The world's ugliest dog.

1140
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,740
Yeah here's the world's ugliest woman, she doesn't know we took this picture.

1141
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,740
It's so awesome.

1142
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,740
I took this photo on the train.

1143
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,740
Yeah.

1144
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,140
- Imagine submitting your photo

1145
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,460
to the Guinness Book of World Records

1146
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,340
and being like, I'm applying for the ugliest woman ever record

1147
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,540
like at least maybe I can get this.

1148
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,860
And they're like, sorry, you're not ugly enough.

1149
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,780
You're still like living the worst.

1150
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,620
- Come on. - Please, come on.

1151
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,940
- You don't mean that.

1152
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,180
- Yeah, not ugly enough for ugliest woman ever.

1153
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,940
- You actually just won the award for most beautiful.

1154
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,380
- You're kidding.

1155
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,580
Are you serious?

1156
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,340
- Yeah, and then you see that it was your mailman

1157
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,340
who was opening your letters and was giving you that award.

1158
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,100
- He's signing everything Guinness.

1159
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,940
That's his name.

1160
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,780
- Yeah.

1161
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,600
- Yeah.

1162
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,740
- And hit me after beer.

1163
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,060
- Is it, it's not the Guinness World Records,

1164
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,740
it's not like the Michelin thing?

1165
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:45,580
- I don't know.

1166
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,400
- The book is made of beer.

1167
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,780
- I was just thinking it could be the Michelin thing.

1168
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,620
I don't know.

1169
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,460
- Yeah, it could be made by Michelin.

1170
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,300
- Which like, you know, everyone found out.

1171
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,340
- That one freaked me out.

1172
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,400
- Yeah, everyone found that out at the same time,

1173
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,140
even though it's like, you know, public knowledge forever,

1174
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,580
but then it became like a whole Twitter thing

1175
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,420
where it's like--

1176
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,020
- Yeah, what do they, whoa, like did you know

1177
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,420
that it's the Michelin is actually the tires?

1178
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,180
- They give these food, the food, the best food

1179
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,180
It's also that beer that old ladies always buy too.

1180
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Yeah, Michelin beer.

1181
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,180
Yeah.

1182
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,180
True.

1183
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Michelin Extra.

1184
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,180
Michelin Ultra.

1185
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:23,320
That would be funny if Michelin just gives it...

1186
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,460
Michelob Ultra is a good beer so I wouldn't get it.

1187
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:32,900
The only person I ever saw buy Michelob Ultra in the... when I worked at the liquor store

1188
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,740
was a really really old lady with a lot of plastic surgery.

1189
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,240
Yeah.

1190
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:37,740
And that is-

1191
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,240
Yeah, it's the latest beer.

1192
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,240
O'Tools is not the official beer of the PGA.

1193
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:41,740
Yes it is.

1194
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,240
The Michelob Ultra is, dude.

1195
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,740
No, no, look it up. O'Tools-

1196
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,240
Are you fucking disabled?

1197
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,240
It's- they don't have- you're not supposed to- there's not-

1198
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I'm sorry, that was too far.

1199
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,740
What the-

1200
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,740
O'Tools- they wouldn't have a non-alcoholic beer.

1201
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,240
Yeah, they do.

1202
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,740
No, they wouldn't.

1203
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,740
It's on the cans.

1204
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,740
Remember I was like, drinking O'Tools for a while?

1205
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,740
Michelob Ultra!

1206
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,240
No!

1207
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
Official beer, dude!

1208
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,400
Dude, O'Doul's, because nobody ever buys them

1209
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
or looks at the label, they can just say whatever they want.

1210
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,360
- Look, O'Doul's can--

1211
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,960
- Official non-alcohol, official soda of the PGA maybe.

1212
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,880
- The other official, maybe it says the unofficial beer.

1213
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,720
Maybe I misread it. - I mean, that was like

1214
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,000
the funniest like five months,

1215
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,080
where I was just like drinking like O'Doul's and shit.

1216
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,400
- It was so fun. - I was like,

1217
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,040
"Oh, I'm gonna be like the most sober guy in the world."

1218
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,840
- It's also really funny to be like quitting alcohol

1219
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,480
and instead of dropping that like, you know, extra calories,

1220
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,360
you're drinking 1200 calories of soda that tastes like beer every night.

1221
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,120
That is so funny.

1222
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Yeah.

1223
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,960
I stopped drinking like O'Doul's and shit just after like...

1224
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
It's terrible.

1225
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,640
Oh yeah, no, I switched to just like drinking like Polar's and shit, but like it was so

1226
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,640
for like the...

1227
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't know.

1228
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,640
Like I...

1229
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,240
Let's not get into this, but...

1230
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,560
Number eight, grinding teeth.

1231
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,360
I'm sorry I called you disabled, but could you do a jumping jack please?

1232
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,800
(laughing)

1233
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
- Grinding teeth is gross. - Boring.

1234
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,240
- Number nine, choking.

1235
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,720
- Sometimes I grind my teeth and I hear my teeth crunch.

1236
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,560
- Yeah. - It's pretty bad.

1237
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,920
- I have so many cracked teeth just 'cause I grind my teeth

1238
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,760
so much in my sleep. - All my teeth

1239
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,580
are completely flat.

1240
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,540
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1241
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,960
- I told you guys I have a bunch of teeth falling out

1242
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,200
and dreams about one specific tooth in my mouth.

1243
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
- You need to encase that thing in gold.

1244
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,240
- Yeah, probably.

1245
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,440
- That's the only way to save it.

1246
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,680
- I'm really afraid that something's gonna happen to it.

1247
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,520
I don't know why I keep having dreams about it.

1248
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,560
- All right, well I'm gonna tell you right now

1249
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,360
because you told me this, I'm gonna do something.

1250
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,760
- Don't do anything to my tooth, please.

1251
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,600
- I'm gonna do something to it.

1252
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,400
- That is like my worst nightmare, that tooth.

1253
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,240
- I'm gonna dress up.

1254
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,040
- Because I keep having nightmares about it.

1255
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,000
- I'm gonna dress up like a tooth fairy ballerina

1256
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,840
and I'm gonna sneak into your house.

1257
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,340
- Don't do that, seriously don't do that.

1258
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,320
But if it's enough money that you're putting

1259
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,600
under my pillow, you can do that.

1260
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,400
- And if I look like enough of a slutty tooth fairy?

1261
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,480
- The tooth fairy's not slutty.

1262
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,320
- Are you kidding me?

1263
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,280
- She's doing her job.

1264
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,600
- That's a Halloween costume I don't think I've ever seen.

1265
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,820
tooth fairy tooth fairy well yeah cuz when the rocks on time why would I do a

00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:35,020
Words just like I think you know Charlie Brown a slut

He's a kid he's a damn four-year-old you can't have sex he's a baby well, I'm Jerry Seinfeld

1273
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,780
Charlie Brown is a slut and he's younger than me.

1274
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,780
Do you know how to make me into a cartoon?

1275
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:03,780
Did you ever read his Jerry Seinfeld's Halloween book?

1276
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,780
What was it? He wrote a children's book about Halloween.

1277
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,780
And I read that shit. I took that out of the library so many times.

1278
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,780
Because it took you so long to read it? Yeah.

1279
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,780
Reading two pages at a time. I'm going to need to extend my

1280
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,280
I spend my borrow on this.

1281
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,280
Yeah.

1282
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,280
I miss the library, dude.

1283
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,280
I do too.

1284
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,020
I spent so much time in the library as a kid.

1285
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,640
I'm sure you wouldn't be able to guess that, but I loved riding my bike to the library

1286
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,100
and just hanging out there, dude.

1287
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
I myself.

1288
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,460
Yeah, and you print out pictures of like Godzilla.

1289
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,980
I wouldn't even go on the computers.

1290
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,980
That's how fucked.

1291
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Whoa.

1292
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,380
I would just sit there and read the books, dude.

1293
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,380
I was crazy.

1294
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,220
I only went to the library to take out CDs as a kid.

1295
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,820
Yeah, that's sick that they had CDs.

1296
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,820
They have movies there too.

1297
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,220
- They had VHS when I was growing up.

1298
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,500
- When I found out the library had music and DVDs and shit.

1299
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,300
- They did have video games in the library in Watertown.

1300
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,140
The one--

1301
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:00,980
- Fucking crazy man.

1302
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,800
- Yeah.

1303
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,640
- Each library they had Quadrophenia.

1304
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,980
- But I wasn't allowed to take them out

1305
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,180
and also I didn't own a video game console.

1306
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,340
- You should be able to get drugs from the library now.

1307
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,180
- You should.

1308
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,420
You have to return them though.

1309
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,260
- Yeah.

1310
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,420
- You should still mark in at the library.

1311
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,260
- They should.

1312
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,740
- That's actually, you know what, not a--

1313
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,220
- That's a great idea actually.

1314
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,060
- That's actually not a bad idea.

1315
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:22,220
a bad idea. It's like a genius idea. Yeah, but you still have to return it. Yeah, I know.

1316
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,940
I forgot about the return policy. Yeah. Yeah, you have to return it and if you return it

1317
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:32,960
like damaged or used, you get fined $10,000. I think I want to be the first guy to get

1318
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:41,940
addicted to Narcan or to methadone, like one of those like get off of heroin things. I

1319
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,520
I think that is...

1320
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,400
I think I could do that.

1321
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,340
It feels like it has to be pretty good, right?

1322
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Yeah.

1323
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,160
It's pretty easy to get addicted to anything.

1324
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,160
It is.

1325
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,160
Yeah.

1326
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
All you have to do is do it a bunch.

1327
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,600
I had coffee today for the first time in weeks.

1328
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh, really?

1329
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,600
I feel amazing.

1330
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,600
I drank two Yerbas.

1331
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,600
That's a lot.

1332
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,600
Yeah.

1333
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
I've been having...

1334
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
I've been cutting down all caffeine.

1335
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,600
I had...

1336
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,020
And then my doctor was like, "Your heart is slow."

Yeah.

1341
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,420

1343
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,980
well that's there's no but why would I make half a cup worth we'll just make

1346
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:58,180
that

1347
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,180
Girls weren't loud and annoying enough.

1348
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,180

Are you serious?

1351
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,180
First you're going to nag me about the dishes, now you're going to do this?

1352
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,180
Collecting phlegm in your mouth is so gross.

1353
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,180
I will say.

1354
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,180
I mean, as somebody who's sucking it up.

1355
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,180
You do that constantly.

1356
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,180
I have to. I have too much phlegm.

1357
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,180
That's literally, you do that every five minutes.

1358
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,180
Take a damn Zyrtec, brother.

1359
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,180
Maybe I gotta take Mucinex.

1360
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,180
Take a damn Mucinex.

1361
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:32,660
yeah maybe that's it that is it crying is annoying cries yeah crying sucks dude if

1362
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:37,060
I see someone I mean I hate when people wait wait hold on number 23 noise your

1363
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,900
back makes when laying on a wooden floor and making your body no you're missing

1364
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,660
important word on a wooden floor and making your body go up and down I know

1365
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:49,940
that exact same I do know that sound yeah it's like it's like a it's like an

1366
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,460
armpit fart but yeah your whole your whole back that the like arch of your

1367
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:59,340
back uh-huh it's pretty cool number 24 is kissing or the comment is especially

1368
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:05,660
grown-ups repeatedly kissing babies over and over again I yeah I mean people

1369
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,640
kissing is not a good sound no yeah so yeah the mouth is the most disgusting

1370
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,940
part in the body yeah I mean it's like like yeah I think it might be the the

1371
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:18,380
poopy but people kissing said you know when people like a little mouth touching

1372
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,980
a butt that's well that's pretty gross yeah well let's think of gross throw

1373
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:27,980
What's the most disgusting sound with this new knowledge that we have that the human body could feasibly make?

1374
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:34,480
Probably like if you like burped out your fart well and your back was on the ground.

1375
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,480
What if every time you popped a pimple it made like a...

1376
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,480
Well, it also has to be contextual, right?

1377
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,980
What about like this sound?

1378
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,980
That's gross.

1379
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,480
Like, okay, so like vomiting.

1380
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,980
Like you wouldn't know it was vomit hitting the water unless you saw the person vomiting.

1381
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:58,280
So maybe if you watch somebody eat a piece of shit and then afterwards they go, "Yum!"

1382
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,280
That might be pretty disgusting.

1383
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:05,140
Yeah, that might be more like twisted or like subversive.

1384
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,060
I would go, it would be subversive.

1385
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,060
That person would be an artist.

1386
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,220
It's a very good point.

1387
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,220
It'd be Maria Abramovich.

1388
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,220
That should be her new next thing, just eat shit.

1389
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,220
And say, "Yum!"

1390
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,060
important that's why it's a subversion.

1391
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,500
Actually it's they do here's it's

1392
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,620
actually critiquing capitalism because

1393
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:29,260
you know she does Red Robin. Yum!

1394
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,360
And people would go oh my god yeah she's a

1395
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,420
genius. That is artistic.

1396
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:38,900
Okay bye. Bye.
