00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,740
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,120
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,960
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,200
(explosion)

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,760
- I'm never joining the military.

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,600
- Yeah, me neither.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,520
- Never again.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,360
- Never, yeah.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,200
- Never again.

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,460
- Yeah, fool me once, military.

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,420
- Shame on you.

13
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,260
- Shame on you, fool me twice.

14
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,240
- Fool me twice, I'm never joining the military again.

15
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,840
- Fool me twice, I'm in the military again.

16
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,320
- Fool me again?

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
I'm a major.

18
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Yeah, whoops.

19
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Sorry, I'm a war hero.

20
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Yeah, bummer.

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,680
Fuck, I got a Purple Heart and they let me get a discount at Applebee's now.

22
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,800
The enemy fooled me today.

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,040
The enemy fooled me and I became a prisoner of war.

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,400
That's what the pin says.

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
That's what the Purple Heart says.

26
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,520
It's like a sticker.

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,720
t-shirt that says I went to Vietnam and this shirt and minus two legs have

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,000
different shirts depending on how what limbs you lost yeah or what happened to

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,400
you in Vietnam yeah I went to Vietnam and all I got was this destroyed lung

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,280

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,320
ass that's all it says doesn't elaborate and there's a purple heart on it I guess

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,960
there's a purple heart on the shirt there's a purple heart that says I

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,320
inhaled the most Asian orange yeah yeah yeah yeah

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,280
bioweapon eating contest champion that's how they decided who won the Vietnam War

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:54,780
more. They got a Vietnamese guy and a big fat American dude. Joey Chestnut's great uncle

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,560
and sat him next to Kobayashi. He wasn't even Vietnamese. They were just like, "He's the

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,440
closest competitive eater." And they just made it see who could eat more Asian orange.

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,920
They had a dunk tank too.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
It was a separate thing.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
And a contest.

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,320
Yeah, they like the Agent Orange was just the carrot hot dog that Kobe Ashae endorsed at

42
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,000
By Chloe over the summer.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,720
Vietnam was really just one long NBA All-Star weekend with different events that everybody

44
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
was participating in.

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,000
It was sort of East Coast All-Stars versus West Coast All-Stars, but it's Vietnam and

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
America.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,720
They just had little contests like who could smoke the most out of a shotgun.

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Yeah.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Yeah.

50
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Man, the cats are--

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
You could have the most Vietnamese wives.

52
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah.

53
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Who could run--

54
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
At the same time.

55
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,560
It was like a race.

56
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,600
It was a race to see who could run from the altar the fastest.

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,280
Yeah.

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
Yeah.

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,600
Oh, boy.

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
How we doing, boys?

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
What are we--

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
The cats are--

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't care.

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
They're sitting in their basket just fucking-- they're like fighting.

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I don't know what--

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Whoa.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,320
Every classic episode starts with a little bit of cat talk, so I'll allow it.

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,640
going on with the cats? They're Yoda they're like half asleep but fighting.

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,360
Cool. Half asleep but fighting. Yoda's like asleep on top of fucker just like swatting at

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,860
his head. He's having a dream. Yeah. Yeah. He's having a dream that he's beating you up.

71
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,280
That you're cat size and he's beating the shit out of you. He's finally killing me. Yeah. Yeah.

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,400
Damn, they look weird. Cool man. Finally he admits that they look weird. Yeah. They don't look weird,

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,080
they look bad. They don't look bad. They look bad. God damn, I want a Coke Zero so bad

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,600
since you cracked that seal. Oh my god. This isn't a Coke Zero, this is a Polar

75
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,960
Grapefruit. I know, that's Water Zero. I've just been, I've been craving.

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,600
- Water zero.

77
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,840
- I'm ramping up my caffeine intake again.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,840
I think I'm about to hop back on the Monster 000 pretty soon.

79
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,780
- Have you had the new, have you had the Fiesta?

80
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,960
- No dude, I've been out the game for like five months.

81
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,440
- Yeah, they got a mango one now.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,360
- Is it like a pinata?

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
Why is it a Fiesta?

84
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,240
- They got a pinata on the,

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,220
it's an embossed pinata on the can.

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,160
- They should make, serve it in a pinata.

87
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
- They should, wow.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840
- And you have to hit it to make the drink come out.

89
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,800
They got another one it's the Rosa one it's not that good.

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
It's a grapefruit or something.

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,880
Do you think with pinatas candy was the first choice or did the inventor.

92
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,520
No there's definitely like the first version the inventor of pinatas.

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Had like empanadas.

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
It was like milk in there.

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
Well the first.

96
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Yeah it was always dulce de leche.

97
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,760
He just busted open a donkey's head and milk started flying.

98
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,640
The first pinata was just a guy saw a hornet's nest and he was like, "I bet I can make that

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
beautiful.

100
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I bet I can make that look like an animal."

101
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,360
Kids, you know how much fun you have hitting a hornet's nest.

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,880
You guys know how much fun you have when you hit a horse with a stick?

103
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,480
Yeah, the guy got the idea after he lynched a donkey.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,080
He was like, "What if there was candy in this?"

105
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Yeah, what if the kids could come too?

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
This was already so fun.

107
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah, what about a kid's version of this?

108
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
- Yeah. - I got it.

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,040
- They all got together and lynched a donkey

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
and they're like, "Oh, but we spent so much money

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,280
"on babysitting to come out to do this."

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,200
(laughing)

113
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,120
We need the kids to be able to get in on this.

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
- Yeah, it's just a pinata full of ground beef.

115
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,760
They call it the pinata prototypes.

116
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,800
- I would like that.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,440
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind that, honestly.

118
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,160
- I made a killer hamburger the other day.

119
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Killer, I'm talking killer.

120
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,440
- Killer. - Yeah.

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,680
It made a smash burger the other day.

122
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,640
- Nice.

123
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,480
- Yeah.

124
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,000
- I just got this new plant-based meat

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,960
that they made it look like real ground beef,

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
like it went through a grinder and everything.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
- Is it the Beyond?

128
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,160
- No, it's not Beyond.

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,820
- Or the Impossible?

130
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,480
- It's called the Meatless Co. Company

131
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,720
or something like that.

132
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
- Meatless Co. Company.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
- Meatless Co. Company.

134
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Let me look it up, hold on.

135
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,200
- Is it good or is it bad?

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400
- I haven't tried it yet.

137
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,120
Now everything, the people who make fake meat think that meat just tastes like soy sauce.

138
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Because that's what all of that tastes like.

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,040
Like everything tastes like soy sauce.

140
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,440
Like the Beyond Burger is a soy sauce sponge.

141
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,480
Yeah, well I mean they can't, the people who make it don't eat meat.

142
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
So they wouldn't know.

143
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
True, they're just guessing.

144
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
They're guessing, yeah.

145
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
That's a really good point.

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah.

147
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah, I mean it's like a lot of, oh man.

148
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
I fucking.

149
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,200
yourself in the face right now. Whoa that was like a, that was like you knocked yourself.

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,340
He just hit himself in the face with a plank of wood. With a nail at the end. Yeah. Yeah

151
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:11,380
it's the meatless farm company. A meatless farm? Those are pretty common. Those are actually

152
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,680
really common. Yeah. It's not that crazy. Yeah. I don't even know, what is in there?

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Yeah, it's always like a shit ton of oils and then starches.

154
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,520
What it is, is it's phytoestrogens and soy oils.

155
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,280
Yeah.

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,120
And...

157
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,960
It's HRT.

158
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
And breast meat.

159
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,400
They make you eat meatless food to turn you into a girl.

160
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
That's right.

161
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
And that's what Obama initiated.

162
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Yeah.

163
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,360
That's what he initiated with the H1N1 pandemic.

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Or as I call it a fan-demic, which is a fake pandemic.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,040
And then, yeah, and then he turned my mom into a girl.

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,920
And now he's trying it again with this shit.

167
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Yeah, it's his fault.

168
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,620
Yeah, he's, he's, Kovic.

169
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,620
If you, if you translate Kovic from Slovenian,

170
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,000
it says Obama.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,820
No.

172
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,660
No, it's not.

173
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,920
It says girl.

174
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,760
It says girl.

175
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,200
It says girl good, which is even worse.

176
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,920
Yeah.

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,740
Oh no.

178
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,580
Yeah.

179
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,740
It's kind of a broken translation, but it literally means girl good. They're brainwashing you. That's

180
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,820
why they can't stop saying COVID. It's because girl good and then they say 19 because they're

181
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,060
trying to raise the age of consent to 19. So they're saying girl good at 19. It's basically

182
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,380
what they're saying and they're brainwashing people. But think about it. But y'all ain't

183
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,660
ready for that conversation. It affects men more than women, right? Because women are already women.

184
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,220
You can't translate the word "COVID" into any other...

185
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,060
Well, you're wrong, because it translates to "girl."

186
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,420
No, you're wrong.

187
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,780
On Google Translate, they have a shield.

188
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,860
Obviously, Google's not going to tell you the answer to the conspiracy. They're part of it, dude.

189
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,180
No, I'm just saying...

190
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,820
They're part of the ones who created the translation in the first place.

191
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,460
If you type in "COVID" into Google Translate, it gives you a warning,

192
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,500
and it says, "Get information about COVID here."

193
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,660
Check out a little website, I think if you hit Google,

194
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,820
check out, basically it's sort of like the,

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,720
no, it's even better, it's sort of like the

196
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,420
uncensored version of Google, it's called elgoog.com.

197
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,260
Check it out.

198
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,300
- Oh yeah, look up nip steam on elgoog.

199
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,220

201
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,340

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,940
- Iku, I give up.

204
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,300
Go to El Gug and type in B-Lack

205
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,500
and hit I'm feeling lucky and you're gonna see my face.

206
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,340
- B-Lack. - Guaranteed.

207
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,460
- Look up, look up, go into El Gug

208
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,600
and then look up Puck Out.

209
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,340
(laughing)

210
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,820
- Puck Out.

211
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,860
- Puck Out, wait no.

212
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,620
Puck, Puck Eno.

213
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,460
- Puck Eno?

214
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,820
Puckino out, surlg.

215
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,000
- Girls, girls, two girls, one cup.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,240
(laughing)

217
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,980
That was one of the,

218
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,260
that was like the most stressful brain moment

219
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,300
of the past two months for me.

220
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,260
I can't believe you did that, dude.

221
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,100
That was amazing.

222
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,740
- I think I said, I think I said--

223
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,580
- You're a genius.

224
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,400
That should be like a drunk,

225
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,020
that should be like a field sobriety test.

226
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
I think I said one cup.

227
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,020
Many girls.

228
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Or just girls too.

229
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
Girls too?

230
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I think I said that.

231
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,020
I wish that Lena and Adam would make a girls too.

232
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
Yeah, girls too.

233
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,020
Girls too, now it's guys.

234
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
Whoa, guys.

235
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Guys.

236
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
Yeah.

237
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
They would never make a show called guys.

238
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
Yeah, because it'd be too awesome.

239
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,020
There's always, it's like you have, your window is another TV to you.

240
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,140
to you know it's not even it's a never anything interesting it's always they

241
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,020
were fighting in the other one they were fighting the basket every time fell onto

242
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,200
the couch oh that's actually dramatic whoa the cat moved from a spot to

243
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,100
another spot and when they were fighting he pushed him holy crap you guys the cat

244
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,660
is blinking and opening and closing its eyes no that's pretty cool that's like a

245
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,580
It's like the Cain and Abel story.

246
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,580
That's like Luke Skywalker and Anakin Skywalker fighting in the lava.

247
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Yeah.

248
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,580
Yeah, that's true.

249
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,780
Have you watched the new Clone Wars at all?

250
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
No.

251
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
No.

252
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Me neither.

253
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
I was just wondering.

254
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
That's exciting.

255
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:55,020
I watched some of like the old Clone Wars series, the animated one, but I always found

256
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:01,300
interesting how many grown men just love that show yeah including my uncle but my

257
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,500
uncle also likes Ben 10 which is like my uncle is like a huge Ben 10 fan weird

259
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:23,660
I yeah which uncle is except he's well yeah he's the one he honestly looks like

260
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,700
one of the monsters yeah Ben 10 presses two and then just switches to be a big

261
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,180
fat guy with alopecia what are his powers what why would Ben 10 turn into

262
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:46,140
eating cheeseburgers and holding a ghost hunting magnet thing okay I don't know

263
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,780
or something like that, going to technical college

264
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,740
for computer science.

265
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,380
Is that a superpower?

266
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,740
That is a superpower, yeah.

267
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,020
Yeah, that's right.

268
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,860
That is a superpower.

269
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,700
That's one of the modern superpowers.

270
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,660
If you're listening.

271
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,500
Yeah.

272
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,320
You're like a real life superhero to us.

273
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,160
You're like a real life superhero.

274
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,340
Get that degree, baby.

275
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,440
That's right, going to technical college,

276
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,860
learning how to write HTML in the same room

277
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,860
that a woman learns how to put shitty fake nails on somebody.

278
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,700
That's what it's all about.

279
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,340
I went to technical college.

280
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,180
Yeah, but then you, it's like you just got progressively,

281
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,060
like went to progressively more evil places for college

282
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,900
and then you finally dropped out.

283
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,140
Yeah, that's pretty true, yeah.

284
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,780
Which is kind of, that's how it should be,

285
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,900
that's what I did too.

286
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,740
But I only made two stops.

287
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,500
But you graduated, dummy.

288
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,180
I did, which is one of the worst mistakes ever.

289
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,020
Yeah.

290
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,840
Yeah.

291
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,660
I mean, I'm in debt, but I'm only in like two years of debt.

292
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm still in less debt than you.

293
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,260
No.

294
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,080
Yeah.

295
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,920
No.

296
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,040
'Cause I went for the same amount of time as you,

297
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,960
but I also am, I was super smart with money.

298
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,920
No, you have the same amount of debt pretty much.

299
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,620
No, okay, let's say it at the same time.

300
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know, I don't know how much.

301
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
(laughing)

302
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,000
I know it only cost me like, I don't know what it was.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,480
It only cost Patrick $5 because his uncle--

304
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,980
It was like 8,000 or something at the second school,

305
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,360
and only went to the first school for like one semester.

306
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,360
My old college before I transferred was $900 a semester.

307
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,080
University of North Carolina in Wilmington.

308
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,680
It was $900 a semester.

309
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,540
- That's 'cause it was in state, right?

310
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,360
- Yeah, and that was with me, I was living on campus.

311
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,700
And then I had to drop out because it was too expensive.

312
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,120
I couldn't afford it anymore.

313
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,280
- I was on loans.

314
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,640
- Yeah, I wasn't on loans until I started,

315
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,680
until I moved, until I met you guys.

316
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,640
Coincidence?

317
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,480
Hmm.

318
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,300
- Well, I think--

319
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,140
- I don't know.

320
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,980
- You borrowed money from me.

321
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,800
- I think I--

322
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,320
- I got a loan from Cameron.

323
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
- Yeah.

324
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,980
- Yeah.

325
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,920
- I think I paid in-state for Emerson somehow.

326
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,140
- They don't have in-state tuition at Emerson.

327
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,980
- They don't?

328
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,640
- Private school, yeah, there's no in-state.

329
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
- Then I was paying.

330
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,680
- Then you were paying a whole lot of money, baby.

331
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,520
- Yeah.

332
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,340
- Yeah.

333
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,180
- Fuck.

334
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,920
- Yeah, man, we're fucked forever, it's okay.

335
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
- Yeah.

336
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,640
- Man, it's so shitty that, man.

337
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,920
It sucks 'cause like, it literally,

338
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,040
like you learn nothing there.

339
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,120
- Oh no, dude.

340
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
- Yeah.

341
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
- No, absolutely not.

342
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,620
- Like you go to like--

343
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,000
- Just so you can like know everybody in there.

344
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,480
It's just like so people,

345
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,560
like 30 year old Elizabeth Warren stands,

346
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,840
we're like, oh my God.

347
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,060
We'll see Emerson next to him and go,

348
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,200
oh my God, this is my new assistant.

349
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
And you get to work for minimum wage for like six years

350
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
before you finally, before--

351
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,160
- Before you pitch the worst script in the world to them.

352
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,080
- That person who hired you dies,

353
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,760
and you lose your job.

354
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah, you have to work in a restaurant

355
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,480
for the rest of your life.

356
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,320
- Right.

357
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
- Yeah.

358
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
- And you're living in LA.

359
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,080
- Yeah, you really are just like,

360
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,000
you're paying for like a little asterisk next to your name

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,560
that can only be seen by the worst people in the world,

362
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
and it will give you a job.

363
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
- It'll give you a job only in LA.

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,160
All the scripts that I read in school,

365
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
it was always like,

366
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,040
she's a 19 year old in New York City

367
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,320
and both of her parents are too busy

368
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,760
working for the CIA to hang out with her ever.

369
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,000
So she's gotta make it on her own.

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,160
She's gotta make it on her own doing stand-up comedy.

371
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,280
But she has depression!

372
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,600
Yeah, and huge tits.

373
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,480
Huge, big, beautiful tits.

374
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,320
It's either that--

375
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
That might have been a note I gave.

376
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,580
(laughing)

377
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,300
That's been in every single class.

378
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,260
They're like, yeah, so this one's about my mom

379
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,420
who was actually an alcoholic and then killed herself.

380
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,660
So it's about, she should have huge tits in the script.

381
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,220
Can you just write that in?

382
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,300
- The male analog of that show, that script,

383
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,840
is like lethal weapon, the show.

384
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,900
- Lethal weapon, yeah, well just people just kept

385
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,940
writing Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Yeah exactly it's just guys writing Brooklyn Nine-Nine

386
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,740
scripts. Well it's half Brooklyn Nine-Nine and then it's half like um like this

387
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,740
this quiet boy his mental illness comes to life and dates him. It's just like

388
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:33,460
stuff where it's like... His mental illness becomes a big supermodel. Yeah his mental illness becomes a humongous penis that he gets to use.

389
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Yeah, he has to navigate his way. He has to navigate his way through this

390
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,020
through this awful college dorm that every single person is a supermodel and

391
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,420
and yeah yeah and they all they're crazy they like him too much they don't

392
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,940
realize what he has underneath in his brain but then also desire to make

393
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:58,980
movies one of the darkest most twisted things you could possibly have. I would also read

394
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,700
scripts where it was like I like so many of the scripts took place in high school

395
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Yeah, no, what the fuck was that?

396
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,700
And it would always be the thing of like her, like, her hot high school body.

397
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Yeah.

398
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,700
And I was always like, yeah, and his girlfriend who was in ninth grade, she was so hot.

399
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Yeah.

400
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,700
It's just fucking, it's just weird.

401
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Let's take back the school from my ex-girlfriends.

402
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
The pilot.

403
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Yeah.

404
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Yeah, whoops, I dated every single girl in the school.

405
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,700
And so now every episode is me going through and apologizing to them.

406
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Yeah.

407
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Because I would, because they would talk during movies.

408
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Well, it's not even that.

409
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,860
Most of the time it's like, and I go through the school and I use my verbal wit to make

410
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,700
them apologize to me without realizing it.

411
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Something that I think that is so funny.

412
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
I still do.

413
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Something I think is so funny, like this is very much like the Aaron Sorkin model for

414
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:00,080
like writing is to be a guy who is like in conversation extremely dim and slow

415
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:07,500
and then spend like five hours writing like one very like one like smart quip

416
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,320
or whatever that's supposed to take place in conversation and then being like

417
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,800
I'm like the smartest guy ever yeah yeah cuz I just I just spent five hours

418
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:22,520
writing a conversation that appears to be like smart and witty because I spent

419
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,040
five hours on it. Yeah. Yeah. And then like the the right like have you seen that

420
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,960
fucking clip of it's studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and it's the fucking oh my

421
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
god he's like he's explaining to his dad he says something like this is like the

422
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,440
the French whatever of sketch comedy writers like that what's that fucking I

423
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,240
don't know. Salon. No oh the salon yeah it's something the salon of a sketch

424
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,500
comedy writers and he's like well your brother is over in Iraq serving this

425
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:04,900
country it's so fucking crazy I cannot believe that show exists yeah yeah

426
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:11,620
exists so great I want to get on this like Alex was telling us about like a

427
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,020
scene where somebody like steals a joke on the show or something like that and

428
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,180
and they go into the room and beat the shit out of them.

429
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:27,220
Can you imagine how much cooler SNL would be if people were beating the shit out of each other for jokes?

430
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,260
Just people waiting in the wings at all times.

431
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,820
That'd be sick dude.

432
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,780
Julio Torres shoots somebody for a joke.

433
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,340
That'd be sick.

434
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,180
All right we have um we're revisiting just an absolute

435
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:50,780
So, a lot of people said that their favorite episode of this podcast was Diaper Talk, which

436
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,780
I just looked up.

437
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,820
It's episode 73, if anybody cares.

438
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,560
But I figured we should revisit.

439
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,580
We looked at this adult, this diaper lover forum for adult diaper lovers in that episode.

440
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,580
We read through some great-

441
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,580
A-Disc, a-disc community.

442
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
A-disc.org.

443
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Yeah.

444
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,700
And so I thought we should go back to that forum because there's just so much going on

445
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
there.

446
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,940
ever we will ever plumb the depths it's a this was this was also Cameron's idea

447
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,300
because he is so attracted to the smell yeah no I just use the forum constantly

448
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,900
so I figure I want to spotlight some of my favorite yeah any members really he's

449
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,060
trying to he's trying to plug his own account he's kind of clout chasing right

450
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:41,300
now yeah a disc stands for a diaper di di that's the di diaper shit crap no a

451
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,260
Now a disc stands for a diaper in Sir Cameron's.

452
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,140
Because he is eating it.

453
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,540
But I scrolled through a bunch of threads last night to find stuff and I think I found some

454
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,540
really like heinous, awful stuff for us to read.

455
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,900
Are we looking at this first one or did you cross out that it's too heinous?

456
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,500
The first one, no, it's just not good.

457
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
It's boring.

458
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,540
I figured we should just start with the bangers right away.

459
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,060
So this first one I want to-

460
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
These are bangers.

461
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,260
I mean, wait until you hear this, okay?

462
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
This is um...

463
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,740
Yo we found some diaper forums last night that was bangers bro.

464
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm gonna read this first post, okay?

465
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,260
Sorry I'm wearing my young money shirt.

466
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
This is by ID Diaper Boy.

467
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,940
IDF Diaper Boy.

468
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
ID Diaper Boy.

469
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,060
Question about being caught.

470
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,460
I have a question that I'm hoping for some help.

471
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
In junior high my mom caught me twice.

472
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,020
Around the same time I also hid the diapers under my mattress.

473
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,940
Then when I was about 23, my parents visited my house while I was in the military.

474
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,340
I forgot to throw away a used Depends.

475
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,940
While we were all watching a movie, my dad reaches between the cushions and grabs the

476
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
rolled up green Depends.

477
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
*laughter*

478
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Why is it green?

479
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
He said, "Is that the color?"

480
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
Is it green from shit?

481
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Yeah, is that the color that Depends are?

482
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,940
Or did it turn green because of how long it was in the cushions?

483
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Because it was in the cushions.

484
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah, or how long it was in the cushions.

485
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,940
It's the same one from junior high.

486
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,940
If you want to shit in a diaper, that's fine.

487
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,220
But like at least have a common decency to put it in the trash can.

488
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
Fucking throw it out!

489
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Throw out your diaper!

490
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,860
I love- he was in the military.

491
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Was he like-

492
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,420
Oh, they're green cause he's-

493
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
It's a camo diaper!

494
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,420
It's a camo diaper!

495
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Wait, wait, wait.

496
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,900
It's like an army khaki diaper.

497
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,180
He says, he says, he said, "A diaper?

498
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,340
I jumped up, grabbed it, and threw it in the trash.

499
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,620
I told them a friend was over earlier with their baby and must have forgotten.

500
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,540
Nothing was said when we went back to the movie."

501
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Imagine pulling out clearly an adult-sized used diaper.

502
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Yeah, it's a paper.

503
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,540
A huge diaper, it says, depends on it.

504
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
It's green.

505
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,540
It's in your son's couch.

506
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Your military son.

507
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,540
I can't get over the military part.

508
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,540
First off, you have to think, "Well, that's one big baby."

509
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,540
But then you have to think, "Not only does my son have a friend with a kid,

510
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:06,280
eat this friend changed this kid on my son's couch and then hid the diaper in

511
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,460
oh they must have forgot it what are they gonna carry it with right then

512
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,500
there's a there's a wrap on the door he's like hey I forgot my son's diaper I

513
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,060
think I left it in the couch I think I may have left it think I might have

514
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,260
fallen out of my ugly looks at his dad yeah I told you I told you yeah in tow is

515
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:35,780
the is a six-foot baby it's just a baby but it just looks like Charles Barkley

516
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,500
and then the response to this post is I'm guessing she knows and it's just

517
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,900
being discreet for your sake if nobody has said anything great I would not

518
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,500
stress over it and then ID diaper boy response to that and says oh I'm not

519
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:55,820
stressed over it that was almost 20 years ago almost 20 years ago yeah that's

520
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:02,980
why would you post it then? This is from April 20th 2020. This is from 4/20.

521
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,940
That's why it was a green diaper dude. Didn't post it then because this

522
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,860
community had been confined to the shadows at the time. Yeah. This was before

523
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,580
you know the... For Obama. This was before the Cultural Revolution. The person responds

524
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,540
again and says she knows then. My mom would have gone all Sherlock Holmes and

525
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,420
My father would have come unglued.

526
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,980
Consider yourself lucky.

527
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
- What is it?

528
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,860
Is that like, is unglued like a diaper?

529
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,420
'Cause there is that video that we watched at one time

530
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,780
that's the guy who glued himself to the chair

531
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,140
with the diaper.

532
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,020
- I don't think we watched that.

533
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:42,040
- No, I was thinking his father was flat Stanley.

534
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,300
And he was two pieces of paper glued together

535
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,460
and he would get so mad, you know.

536
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,580
But yeah, see, I mean like 2000,

537
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,220
that would have been 2000 that that happened right 20 years ago that was

538
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,680
that was before Glee came out you know yeah these people still had to had to

539
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,580
hide and then somebody says wait so you change yourself on the couch some point

540
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,540
and just left the used diaper end up between the cushions gross and then ID

541
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:14,540
diaper boy responds and says no I set the diaper on the arm of the couch the

542
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,500
couch was next to the front door and the garbage cans were right outside I must

543
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,840
have knocked it down and sat on it while I was waiting for my parents. You would

544
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,400
know if you sat on a diaper dude. You would know. Changing yourself. Yeah. That's

545
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,640
gonna be hard. Yeah. That well if you teach a baby to do it. Or you could

546
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,260
sit on your hands so it feels like somebody else is doing it.

547
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:54,900
diapers man shit shit diapers man how big is this form how many users does it have

548
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,820
a lot it's really active it's uh there's a lot of there's I didn't put any of

549
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,460
these in the ones we're gonna look at but there's a bunch of discussion there's

550
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,740
like um there's discourse over coronavirus because a bunch of diaper

551
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,700
lovers are on there like like being like what the hell why are there shortages on

552
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,940
diapers right now this is so fucked up and there's a thread that was like

553
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,860
please respect that right now like there are shortages on certain products and I

554
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,260
don't want to get it to give the diaper lover community a bad name with us

555
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,180
complaining about this there's a lot of arguments about that.

556
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
Damn.

557
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Imagine someone just walking out of Costco with a pallet full of adult diapers.

558
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:48,540
Or like 10 years from now when people are reminiscing about how horrible this time was, somebody's

559
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,420
like, "Yeah, I had to, my dad actually died."

560
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,060
And the guy's like, "Whoa, I had to start using the toilet like a big boy."

561
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,420
It got dark there for a minute.

562
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,780
Yeah, they ran out of the Sesame Street diapers for a really long time.

563
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Yeah, exactly.

564
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,740
I'd use the Lego Batman diapers for like two months.

565
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,380
This next one we can't read because it's so long.

566
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,060
It's like novel length, but I just wanted to put it here because of the name, the name

567
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
of the thread.

568
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,580
"Confessions of a British Diaper Lover."

569
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,140
Yeah, it's really "Confessions of a British Diaper Lover."

570
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,260
And it starts with, "Well, where do I begin?"

571
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,260
It's literally the longest thing.

572
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,260
It's so long.

573
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
Oh my God, dude.

574
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Where the fuck do you begin?

575
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,260
This is like 3000 words.

576
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
It's insanely long.

577
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
This is a tale of two cities.

578
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,260
I am a diaper lover. I'm in my 30s, heterosexual, and I live in the UK.

579
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,260
I have a partner or a responsible job.

580
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
Read it in his voice.

581
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
I can't do it.

582
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
And a fair number of friends.

583
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,260
Where do I begin?

584
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,260
My interests are all fairly normal, and nothing about me screams odd or weird.

585
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:12,780
not true. Read it in a goth voice. Yeah, you're British. Do Bill Cosby. Do a Bill Cosby's voice.

586
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:22,700
Confessions of a Cosby diaper lover. I can't do Bill Cosby's voice. What is the truncated

587
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,740
version of this? I don't know, I haven't read it. Oh, you didn't read it? No, it's so long.

588
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,940
Dude, there's a diaper bread he lists here called a P. Deuce.

589
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,180
It's P-E-A-U-D-O-U-C-E.

590
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,780
P. Deuce.

591
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,100
Because they only say like nonce over there, so they didn't even know.

592
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,060
There's so much detail.

593
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,460
This is like...

594
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,980
Oh my god, wait, okay, I found a good passage here.

595
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,180
This is like the... this is like Nouseguard for a diaper lover.

596
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,340
Just every single detail of this guy's life.

597
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,940
We were at home one day and I have a very clear and vivid memory of looking at some kind of leaflet.

598
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,620
In it was a picture, probably a sock image, of a smiling girl who I thought looked about my age.

599
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
She was white with dark hair in bunches.

600
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,860
She held a teddy bear by its arm in one hand.

601
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,380
She was wearing only what looked like a large pair of white knickers.

602
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,860
I studied the picture closely and could see that what I thought were knickers

603
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,300
in fact had tabs and she was actually wearing a nappy.

604
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,060
For some inexplicable reason, I suddenly felt a surge of the most intense jealousy that one could imagine.

605
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,380
I suddenly wanted to wear a nappy too, like the girl.

606
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
That's an origin story right there.

607
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Here's a good one right here.

608
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,540
I had no childhood traumas, toilet related or otherwise, and was neither neglected nor

609
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
privileged.

610
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,040
There was no new baby or sibling rivalry issues that it caused either.

611
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,300
My sister and I get on very well.

612
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:01,580
My diaper issue is not, there's a, my diaper thing stems from a non-sexual incident.

613
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:08,540
Is that what, is it, is it theorized that people with diaper fetishes, it's a, it's

614
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,700
a, it's a kid sex thing?

615
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,420
Why would you need to put that in your diaper forum thing?

616
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:21,260
I don't know, I feel like, I mean, I feel like he's probably the outlier as far as having

617
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,900
some sort of kids sex thing that he did

618
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,620
that makes in this way

619
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,900
the uh... which is the next one

620
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,180
is where started stuff starts to get kinda crazy i think

621
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,500
uh... this one this post is a

622
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,620
what is in your most memorable diaper moment

623
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,180
and some of these most memorable diaper moments of the decade

624
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,700
uh... structure i just want to go into the third post here which is by user

625
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:54,700
username PC baby who shows up a few times in this um in these posts. Their profile picture

626
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,620
is literally just a baby, an angry baby on the computer. And the art style is like a

627
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:08,060
boomer like funny comic in the newspaper. It's like the I need to go look for my Pokemon

628
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:14,700
on go creatures style yeah, but yeah this would this PC babies most memorable

630
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,180
a half shortly after my parents were killed by a drunk driver. If you want

631
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,540

632
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,380

653
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,240
thing that ever happened to the white dot

And their most recent post is, "I am ex-UK Royal Marine Commando."

659
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,480
[Laughter]

660
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,680
Jesus fucking Christ, how many of these people?

661
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
How many of these people are in the military?

662
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Yeah, all of them. I'm learning that veterans are big babies.

663
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Wow.

664
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Yeah.

665
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Fuck.

666
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:22,220
I broke my arm at summer camp a long time ago. I was trying to jump over a rope of chains

667
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:32,120
Yeah, well one right above that is age 20 witnessing my best friend die in a car accident

668
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:45,080
Best and worst diaper experience from PC baby best was the first time my aunt changed me after my parents were killed

669
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,500
It was done so gently and lovingly worst experience second day in the children's home not wearing a nappy and wetting and soiling

670
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,040
Myself as I walked down the corridor to the kitchen

671
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,760
There's another in the worst thing that ever happened. There's another military person

672
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,920
This is the worst thing in adulthood being overseas in a country where they don't want us

673
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,240
And I don't want to be there either and getting injured and needing back surgeries

674
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,020
Crazy god damn, dude

675
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,020
I

676
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,840
Broke up with the girl I dated for a year and thought I would end up marrying

677
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,360
Ending up being one of the best things that ever happened to me, but I didn't feel that way for a long time

678
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,900
from wandering toddler

679
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:38,940
Gay Gus 91 in the off-topic section says for non pooers has any

680
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,520
Has any not poo lover ever put a fresh nappy on then need a poo?

681
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,040
What do you do change a waste a nappy try and hold the poo for a couple hours?

682
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:58,440
Back to the to the what is being enjoyed a big poo in a

683
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:15,780
Back to the what has been your most memorable diaper moment on the second page. There's a post by loves and Pampers

684
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,760
Their most memorable diaper moment was waking up in the hospital after a car accident wearing a tens back in the 80s

685
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,260
I had always enjoyed diapers before then but never dreamed

686
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,860
I would end up in them at the hospital

687
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:33,820
The accident left me paralyzed from the waist down a short time later the nurse came in the room to change me felt like I was

688
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,820
Two years old again

689
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:43,420
Yes, dude. God some of these are just so fucking sad. I'm gonna get into this man. These people are actually these people are truly happy

690
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Yeah, I guess I mean they have escaped. This is the ultimate

691
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,420
just like

692
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,460
Matrix red pill yeah

693
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,220
Did you take the diaper pill?

694
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,040
The brown pill and you just diaper yourself you treat yourself like a baby you piss and shit

695
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,040
You only fuck with with with women who are true rider dies and are willing to change that shit

696
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,500
I heard that's true busy pooper rider diapers. And yes, sometimes you enjoy a big poo in a diaper sometimes

697
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:24,080
Listen to this one. That's how God intended it. Also PC baby is a 12 and a half years Catholic. He says Wow

698
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,000
Yeah, you made I

699
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,520
Think the first time my wife then my girlfriend I was 17. She was 16

700
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,100
We went parking out in a field full moon that night took my brother's old four-door Mercury

701
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,960
She diapered me in the back seat of the car, and I ran around playing in the dirt in just my diaper and plastic pants

702
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,440
I was you imagine I was so much by then thought life couldn't get any better. I was right

703
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,320
It was a high-life moment never got to play outside again except a few times by myself

704
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,120
Could you imagine just?

705
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:58,720
Walk it like you're going like oh me and my friend like you're in high school

706
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,000
and you like stumble upon that like oh we're gonna go smoke weed in the field

707
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,280
tonight yeah you smoke weed for the first time and just in the middle of the

708
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:22,320
field you see a guy like two years older than you just fucking what is plastic

709
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,920
pants mean this like they're like British yeah no they're just like they're

710
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,240
I mean just plastic pants, just like waterproof sweatpants basically.

711
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Azmat suit pants.

712
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,640
Or is it like that Tim and Eric spaghet where they put the cigarette juice into the pants?

713
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,240
I don't know, I don't think I've seen that.

714
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,960
You guys are not true fans.

715
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,080
No, you're thinking of D-Pants.

716
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,800
You're thinking of Tim's Kitchen Tips.

717
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Oh yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

718
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,840
You're thinking of D-Pants from Diarrhea Jones.

719
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,000
You're thinking of Tim Allen's Tool Time.

720
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,640
Tim Allen's.

721
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,080
most memorable diaper moment the first time I woke up wet I don't get a chance

722
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,040
to wear to bed often so with the right drink and the right hypnosis it's still

723
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:12,840
as great as the first time. Hypnosis. This is making me have to pee and shit. Me too.

724
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,360
I got it's really it's giving me it's giving me just a like a deep desire to

725
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,200
just shit my pants. Don't do it. You should try it. Do you think you

726
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
You could just shit your pants.

727
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah, I don't think I could.

728
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
I don't think I could piss my pants.

729
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,960
I don't think I could shit my pants.

730
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,680
It's one of those things like when you can bite into your finger like a carrot but your

731
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,080
mind doesn't let you.

732
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Yeah.

733
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Yeah.

734
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,800
You can't shit your pants unless you have a doctor.

735
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
That is what is, that's why these people are happy.

736
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,200
They have a meditative mental, they've conquered it.

737
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,600
Yeah, they've removed the mental block.

738
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Exactly.

739
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
It's like a tantric thing.

740
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,160
have so focused their desires on one thing that they can bypass their bodily

741
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,600
needs. So they, their all instinct tells them not to shit themselves and yet they do.

742
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,520
Ruby Rainey's most memorable diaper moment. I was just about to read that one. The first time I

743
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,480
toked while wearing a disposable one. I don't think I've ever been more

744
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,580
blissfully relaxed. It was amazing and incredible. I recommend it if you're 420

745
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:22,080
friendly. I'm cross-faded as hell off this blunt and this diaper I'm wearing. I'm 420 and

746
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,960
diaper friendly. God what a combo. Yeah. Man if your whole thing is like pretending to be

747
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,960
a baby. Yeah you can't be smoking weed. Babies can't smoke weed and drink. No. What like

748
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,120

- Oh, you can't be, I, yeah.

- Right.

788
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,040
- Close down the whole grocery store permanently.

789
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,020

799
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:38,580
for the wife and imagine imagine the raw fucking masculine power of sitting in

800
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:50,060
front of your father-in-law and with your wife and taking my fucking your

801
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,460
daughter

802
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:00,780
Earlier today at lunchtime I sat at my kitchen table in a wet and poopy diaper.

803
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,900
All during the time I was eating I sat in my own pee and poop.

804
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,140
Not unusual for me since I am medically incontinent.

805
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,140
Alright, that's fair.

806
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
You're medically incontinent.

807
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
Yeah, you get a pass.

808
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,140
But just change.

809
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Change.

810
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,140
That's true.

811
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,140
Eat a whole meal.

812
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
There's a post here.

813
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,140
Yeah, wait.

814
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:24,120
There's a post here from Baby David Messiah whose bio says make diapering great again.

815
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,320
They said, "I drunk coffee, smoked three cigarettes, and just sat quietly alone."

816
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:36,900
Chamberpot says, "Did a little yard work, peed a few times, started a nice campfire in my

817
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:45,200
fire pit, and sat there poking the fire and adding wood to it and adding pee to my diaper."

818
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
I'm just adding some pee to my diaper.

819
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Yeah, I'm adding.

820
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,520
I'm building on it.

821
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Let's see, what's the next one?

822
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Oh yeah, this one, um, Mayday, family may have found diapers.

823
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Um, this is by, a post by a Canadian diaper lover.

824
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,880
So I wore a goodnight last night while my folks were out and left another one in the washroom,

825
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,880
hiding behind the toilet paper rolls.

826
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,880
Now today, I went in there and noticed that the toilet paper was disturbed,

827
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
and my other last goodnight was gone.

828
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,880
My dad does not know about this, and he may have taken a toilet paper roll out

829
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,480
paper roll out and put it on top of the toilet as a signal that he did not flush the toilet

830
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,720
in the early morning while everybody else was asleep. It could also have been my twin brother,

831
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:34,400
who also did have a diaper fetish at 12 or 13. The lead is so buried there.

832
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,920
This is like fucking, have you seen three identical strangers where it's like...

833
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,800
It's just like that but with diapers where it's like

834
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,680
like they're doing like a study to see like if it's inherent.

835
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,000
Um, I just found a really great subsection of this forum.

836
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,500
Yeah.

837
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,480
It's called "Mature Topics."

838
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,760
How mature are we getting here?

839
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,840
The first post, uh, Virginia pro-second amendment rally.

840
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Removing firearms from the law abiding will never stop a bad person from using a firearm against the law abiding.

841
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,640
This is by...

842
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,640
Diapered Stag.

843
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
*laughter*

844
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
Oh my god.

845
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,640
Oh fuck dude.

846
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,640
*laughter*

847
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,640
If you are looking for a terrorist group, look at Antifa.

848
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,640
*laughter*

849
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,680
dressed in combat gear and carrying guns does not automatically make them evil. In

850
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,960
fact the Virginia protest was one of the most civil protests I think I've ever

851
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,400
seen. They even cleaned up after themselves which is an amazing feat to

852
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,000
these people. Yeah, cleaning up after yourself is just so hard for them.

853
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,760
Oh this rocks. Yeah, I'm looking at mature topics now. Why everyone thinks circumcision is

854
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,520
mutilation social justice themed songs

855
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:27,760
is this all just a there's a religion social justice marriage etc there's a

856
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,880
thread from diaper freak who says pegging I have dropped hints to my wife

857
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,540
that I want to try to try pegging and someone else says I have brought up the

858
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:49,960
topic it is not going to happen. Goddamn dude. Yeah. What a fucking site. Buddhist thread

859
00:47:49,960 --> 00:48:02,180
ask any question about Buddhism. I'm just searching Israel. This might be dangerous.

860
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:11,100
yeah any other pagans just wondering if I'm the only pagan honestly they're all

861
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:17,780
pagan of gods and goddesses do you follow they're all fucking pagan freaks

862
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:26,060
absolutely my therapist says that diapers and regressions are healthy yeah man

863
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,020
Oh my god, it goes all the way back to 2008.

864
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,020
Oh my god.

865
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
Fuck.

866
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,220
"Using diaper gel for science" from Sleepy Brandon.

867
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:39,060
You can use the gel for plants.

868
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,140
It actually works.

869
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,460
My science experiment actually did work.

870
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,220
It doesn't matter if it's used on or just used.

871
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,020
You can use still on some plants.

872
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:55,420
Believe it or not, it actually helps plants grow and last a very long time.

873
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,620
- What is diaper gel?

874
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,080
(laughing)

875
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,080
- It's a gel that's, it's a gel you put, I don't know.

876
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,940
- Oh God, Caleb are we looking at the same one?

877
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,780
- No I just,

878
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,020
(laughing)

879
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:20,020
I just scrolled back to the very beginning of mature topics

880
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,500
and the first post, from April 13th, 2008,

881
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,140
All lowercase "hey" really embarrassing question.

882
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,340
Here's the body.

883
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:35,140
"Okay, well, I got a white head on my balls, like a big one, and I just popped it like a normal white head and it sort of hurted when I did it.

884
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Is it normal to have these on my balls?"

885
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:43,140
*laughter*

886
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,140
And someone says, "Yeah, it's normal."

887
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,140
"You kind of explained it in a gross way though."

888
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,580
the guy responded, "Well sorry just so nervous though never has happened to me

889
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:57,440
before I'm just really scared right now."

890
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:07,380
I found someone from my hometown on here or the town over.

891
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:17,020
Oh yeah it's your dad. Well I found someone on here and the post was "Sigh

892
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:35,540
yesterday afternoon my younger brother in quotes passed away yeah this um this

893
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,580
website I feel like the deeper you go it's just like it's so it's it's dark

894
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,820
it's like Lovecraftian knowledge yeah just the knowledge that this

895
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:49,820
specifically that like someone in the town over from you is not only a diaper

896
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,900
lover but posts on the diaper lover forum. Not only a diaper lover, a 62 year old diaper

897
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:01,020
lover. And engaged enough in the in the in the practice to join a website a

898
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:06,580
community. Yeah. Dude it's like it's like they live. It's like Dracula.

899
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,580
you put on the sunglasses you can see the diaper under their pants.

900
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,580
You see the diaper.

901
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,580
Let's talk sports.

902
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
High school shootings.

903
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,580
This thread is locked by Roland.

904
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,580
And there is that.

905
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,580
We know what Roland that is.

906
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,580
Yeah.

907
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,580
That's a photo. No, that's not Donald Fagan.

908
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,580
Hunting in a diaper. First time hunting in a diaper.

909
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,580
Peed two times and no leaks.

910
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:35,580
Kind of like just sitting in my stand and letting go.

911
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:42,580
Ultra-nationalism. Is it coming back from Roland in 2008?

912
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:52,580
God, what the fuck is going on? I don't know if it's happening as bad here, but I'll give you a portrait of the scenery here.

913
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:59,580
There is a fight between if a southern part of Bulgaria can be called Macedonia.

914
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,820
(laughing)

915
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,580
Bro, they're getting into fucking issues here.

916
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:09,340
- Yeah man, it's, wait, there was another,

917
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,620
one second, there's another one I wanted to read.

918
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,280
Let me find it really quick.

919
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,120
First public diaper accident.

920
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,380
This is Rearslover97.

921
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,220
This is my first public diaper experience.

922
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,640
I was doing some late night shopping.

923
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,460
I had the sudden urge to number two.

924
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,860
I had to hurry up to buy wipes and pay for everything.

925
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,920
there was a long line because there is only one register open

926
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,740
i was crossing my legs and doing everything in my power to hold till i

927
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,440
get to the family restroom

928
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,300
so just

929
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,220
first pay to spin a picture of this guy is is at the front of a long line at one

930
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,940
register

931
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,800
he's crossing his legs

932
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,540
the stubbornly that it is like that's very visible hold the crops your legs

933
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,660
uh...

934
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,900
it was my turn to pay and as soon as i was paying i couldn't hold and it just

935
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,100
loose

936
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,740
luckily it was not allowed but it was not a solid one

937
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,540
no one noticed, but i looked really embarrassed. After i was done, i just went to the family

938
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,300
restroom to get changed. It took me some time to clean up, as that is all i'm going to say

939
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,420
about cleanup. From my public diaper experience, i think i handled it well. I just need to

940
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:18,020
stop panicking because it shows on my face, and then slo-mo responds and says yeah that

941
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,100
sudden change from a panicked face to an embarrassed one is a bigger tell than just pooping yourself.

942
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,540
I think pooping yourself is a pretty big tell.

943
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,940
Yeah I wonder how numb these people are to the smell of their own shit.

944
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
Russell100.

945
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,260
They don't realize everybody can smell that they have shit themselves.

946
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,060
Oh one I read last night that I didn't put in here because it wasn't very funny was somebody

947
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,300
was like saying like yeah I poop in public all the time in my diaper and I just walk around

948
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,580
all day like that and someone else was like don't do that like that's not fair to other

949
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,420
people to make them smell your poop and then they're like and since you're pooping all the

950
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,780
time you probably got used to the smell of your own and you think it smells good

951
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:09,300
but nobody else thinks that. Which diaper has the loudest crinkle? I found a post here it's

952
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:15,380
it's from 2008 it's from Craydon and the the topic in mature topics is

953
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,220
homosexuals and in quotes faggots and it I'm not gonna read the whole thing but

954
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:40,540
the first sentence is as a wise man once said there are black people and this is

955
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:46,820
it man this is the every episode from now on is about this website we're making a

956
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:51,180
whole i have about it is we're starting a podcast network and this is the first

957
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,400
spin-off podcast yeah yeah

958
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,360
and russell one hundred says it is a long time ago now

959
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,820
but i remember for digging a clothes shop and then doing a massive who in my

960
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,500
nappy as a complete accident

961
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,540
and they said i think i was about seven years old at the time

962
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,140
it doesn't count

963
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,140
mhm

964
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,780
if you're seven years old seven years old you shouldn't be having accidents you

965
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:19,180
You should be making awesome LEGO guns and getting shot for them.

966
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,380
You need to be two years old or forty years old.

967
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,380
Exactly.

968
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,620
In between that window there's no...

969
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
There's no...

970
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:34,380
Have you ever felt the need to poop and rush to put on a diaper just so you could take a

971
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,740
poo in it?

972
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:36,740
No.

973
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,220
No, I've never done that.

974
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,180
Yeah, I can't say I have.

975
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:45,660
Here's a post from Anon E-Mouse, I think we talked about them in the last diaper talk.

976
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:51,860
Their post topic is "What do you think about one player sex?"

977
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,220
Oh fuck, that's so good.

978
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,700
Oh my god, wait, okay, wait, wait, wait.

979
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,420
I'm going single player.

980
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,500
Okay, listen to this.

981
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,720
This is a diaper lover and celebrity.

982
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,300
What would it be like to be a diaper lover if you were a celebrity?

983
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,020
would you do if you're a celebrity and I scrolled down and there's somebody said I

984
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,340
thought I remember hearing a while ago that this guy was a supposed diaper

985
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,620
lover not positive maybe I'm remembering wrong and it's a screenshot of Samwise

986
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:37,060
Gamgee like in the Hobbit outfit not that would be funny though it's like like you

987
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,940
just like finally get a job as like a PA on like you know the new movie about like

988
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,140
Tom Hanks as a magician or whatever and he shows up on set for the first day and

989
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:52,300
you like go to bring him something in wardrobe and he's wearing a diaper and

990
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:58,100
there's a closet stocked with diapers and then he shoots you with a silenced

991
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,460
pistol. Someone responded to the celebrity thread and just said Tiger

992
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:07,260
That's a good guess.

993
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:13,300
If you had to guess, I would say like, I mean, probably like John Travolta.

994
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:18,640
Because I feel like if you have a couple things going on, you kind of have everything going

995
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
on.

996
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:26,860
Oh no, this is a post from GameBaby in 2008.

997
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:31,140
GameBaby says, "Is masturbating at 14 ok?

998
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,980
I really got something on my mind. I masturbate three times a week. Is this okay or should

999
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:40,420
I stop? It feels good, but I wish to know.

1000
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:45,900
What's your professional opinion as an expert on teenage boys masturbation, Patrick?

1001
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:50,020
I don't know, but a lot of people on here are saying like, "That's fine. I do it three

1002
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,380
or four times a day."

1003
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,940
Why aren't there diapers with adult themes on them? I mean, there are diapers with Disney

1004
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,580
characters like Lion King, Cars, and DreamWorks characters, the ones from Madagascar, etc.

1005
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,580
However, I have never really seen diapers that have adult-themed licensed characters on them.

1006
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:11,380
Why not? How fun would it be to have a diaper with the Enterprise, an X-Wing, a Xenomorph,

1007
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:17,380
a Necromorph, or the Back to the Future DeLorean, or Master Chief, or Johnny Five, or so on and so forth?

1008
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,780
We need a Watchmen diaper set.

1009
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,640
Right?

1010
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,620
And it's like, "Oh, and it could look like Rorschach's Meer-Rorschach's Max."

1011
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,660
So when you pee it makes a different ink blot.

1012
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,180
What does this look like?

1013
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,180
Shit.

1014
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,780
It looks like a poopy diaper.

1015
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,660
It looks like shit.

1016
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:40,180
Here's a poster, I'm looking like it really early in 2008.

1017
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:46,620
There's a post here from Valentine that says Obama Biden '08 and it says, "Well, Obama named

1018
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,660
his running mate and it's Biden.

1019
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,700
Any thoughts on this?"

1020
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:56,060
And someone with a political compass thing that shows how libertarian they are says,

1021
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,260
"Any reason you're happy he picked a white person?"

1022
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,260
Whoa.

1023
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,260
Wow.

1024
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,260
Damn.

1025
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,820
That's fucking crazy.

1026
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,660
Biden has all the experience of McCain.

1027
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,660
He brings foreign policy.

1028
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,660
Oh, this is just...

1029
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,660
Yeah.

1030
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,660
Yeah, that's just Patrick.

1031
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:12,660
This is just a very serious...

1032
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,660
Oh, that's just my thoughts.

1033
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,660
That's just my thoughts.

1034
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,660
Oh, that's just my thoughts on Joe Biden.

1035
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,660
I'm just thinking out loud.

1036
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,660
I'm just thinking out loud.

1037
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,660
Um.

1038
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,660
Do you guys see any more good ones?

1039
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,660
I see one.

1040
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
There's one about weed legalization.

1041
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,660
But they just love pot, dude.

1042
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,660
There's so many military people on this site.

1043
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,660
I don't get it.

1044
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,660
I get it.

1045
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
That makes perfect sense to me, dude.

1046
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,660
You spend all day being yelled at by a guy who's bigger than you.

1047
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,660
And that's his job.

1048
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,660
You want to go home and you want to shit in your pants.

1049
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,660
Oh my god, wait.

1050
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,100
somebody was i found this but i think that's what it's tactical

1051
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,240
somebody listed new to the site a little shy lake and just posted like a like a

1052
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,440
hello message and pc baby responded to it and said

1053
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,940
hi jocelyn firstly welcome to the group i hope you find the support you need

1054
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,240
it's also nice to meet a girl gamer as most of the girl gamers online are

1055
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,840
usually boys are men playing at all to character

1056
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,400
as far as being a furry though goes though someone passed me my shotgun

1057
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,520
If you can't find the info on making a nappy that you need, let me know as I may have some

1058
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,960
external links that could be useful.

1059
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:24,880
Now I'm just thinking about like an MKUltra type program that the military like tried sometime

1060
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,240
in the early 2000s where they just made everybody wear diapers.

1061
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:36,120
Imagine though being a diaper lover and you'd say, "Furries, pass me my shotgun."

1062
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Yeah.

1063
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:42,600
Pass me my military issued hand- service weapon because...

1064
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,600
Yeah, you can't...

1065
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,680
Yeah, at least furries don't fucking shit in their fursuits.

1066
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,500
Well maybe they do though.

1067
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,500
Maybe some of them do.

1068
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Yeah, maybe this one does.

1069
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,500
We don't know.

1070
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,960
That's sort of a deadly combo.

1071
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,380
I found- I don't think the post is funny but I think the title of it is very funny.

1072
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:04,520
So a post from Kite that says "Free speech is dead."

1073
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,760
(laughing)

1074
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,360
- They were right, dude.

1075
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,200
- God.

1076
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,020
- They're fucking right.

1077
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,040
All right.

1078
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,840
- Yeah, I think we're at an hour.

1079
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,040
- You guys wanna do patrons?

1080
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,880
- Yeah, sure.

1081
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,320
- Wait, let me go pee first.

1082
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,600
- All right, well we're just gonna start.

1083
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,240
- We're just gonna do the patrons.

1084
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,200
- Okay.

1085
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,040
- Bye, Pat.

1086
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,800
Big shout out to Poco.

1087
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,640
- Oh, yeah, Poco.

1088
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,760
- Poco for everything.

1089
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,280

1090
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,560

Nice one dollar patron.

01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:56,140
That's a cool name.

1160
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,200
Oh yeah, it's a one dollar patron.

1161
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,040
You don't get anything.

1162
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,860
Yeah, what do you get?

1163
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,500
You're just in it for the love of the game.

Very powerful name, very strong name.

1169
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,980
Yeah, the last name is very strong.

1170
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:15,820
The first name is incredibly weak.

1171
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,780
No, no, no!

1172
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,740
Dude, take that back.

1173
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,580

Brad Diaper.

1180
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:34,940
Yeah, it's kind of topical for considering the episode. I hope it's probably Debor Mike Brolin

1181
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:38,180
master chief level

1182
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,140
