1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,940
- All right, we're on.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,280
- This is feeling weird, man.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,060
- We haven't done it just this way in maybe,

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,180
I mean, honestly, what is it, two years now?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,020
- Guys, every--

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,860
- One year. - Two years.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,540
- One year, it's felt like two years.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,500
- This guy-- - You see that thing

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,820
yesterday where it was like one year ago,

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,140
that's when Ice Spice's song came out?

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,980
- Yeah.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,780
felt like five years ago. What ice by song to me, honestly, ice spices fame

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,700
feels like the blink of an eye. Maybe it's because I'm interested in geology.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,440
The how rivers are formed geology and not rocks are formed through water, the

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,460
history of prehistoric life. But to me, the prehistory of fame is like it's

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,020
less than this. Wow. Well, when you zoom out, when you zoom out of most things,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,580
The universe is what? 10 million years old?

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,580
Yeah.

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,580
10,000.

21
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,580
So it's 10,000 years old.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,660
Ice Spice's being around for one year is basically the blink of an eye, the flash in a pan.

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,660
Wow.

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,580
So that's when people say one hit wonder, it's like, yeah, I wonder why.

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,700
I wonder if they're going to have another Big Bang.

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
Exactly.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Wow.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Yeah.

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
Because again,

30
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,700
And that's rocks and geology and dinosaurs.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,660
Let me, that's if there was a science, maybe the science equivalent of a youth pastor, he

33
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,220
you'd be like, "You guys are all obsessed with these one-hit wonders. Let me tell you

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,820
about the real one-hit wonder."

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,820
The Big Bang.

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Jesus Christ.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,020
There is a science teacher, I think, is it?

38
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,380
Well, this would be more of a guy...

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,380
Middle school science teacher.

40
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,460
Yeah, but he was kind of exactly analogous to a youth pastor in that he's at a science

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
church and he's dressed up as a Christian science teacher.

42
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
So what you're proposing is...

43
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,620
And he's sitting on the chair backwards. And you can imagine maybe even just the way that

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,420
every youth pastor looks in a meme or video.

45
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,240
So what you're proposing is a, I like this idea, a science church with a science youth

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
pastor.

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,320
And he does all the youth pastor joke meme stuff, but it's for science.

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
How's everyone doing tonight?

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
Wow.

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,920
Yeah, but they don't have like, they don't have like science class, like they have Sunday

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
school.

53
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
And what's going on?

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
It's actually...

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Let's actually check in, what's going on in everyone's week?

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,860
It'd be called the SSS Science Sunday School.

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,640
It's less, there's less danger that he would be able...

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,000
Saturday because they're not observing the day of the Lord.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,600
The youth science pastor wouldn't be molesting the kids because he has an intimate knowledge

60
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,760
of the human body and he knows how to pleasure himself with the help of another.

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,200
Maybe he would have a wife or a husband.

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,960
He could be touching and playing with the little frogs.

63
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,240
They're even smaller than a kid.

64
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
He feels even more power over us.

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,280
Or he's poly too, which is weirder because maybe he's just like...

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,880
Poly people are not scientific.

67
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
He would be, instead of molesting the kids...

68
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,440
so emotional. They're not doing experiments on the kids. You'd be

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,300
doing two experiments on twins psychologically. Yeah, seeing and

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,920
physically physically cutting them open, seeing if they have joining them

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,720
stuff, conjoining them, joining them, taking them apart, conjoining them

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,760
apart, joining every combination, joining them at different parts of the

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,880
body, like the foot or the ankle or the hand. If you were joined to your

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,200
twin at the bottoms of your feet, that would suck. That would suck. And you

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,500
you had to walk on your hands like a long dog, bro. You just invented cat.

76
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,340
Yeah, you just invented girl boy

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,420
girl boy, girl,

78
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,220
another one of the difference between this and cat dog is that since the

79
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,860
bottoms of their feet, they would have a huge hole in the middle of their body

80
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,420
with the legs. Well, that's where you could put and you could play basketball

81
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,420
or their

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:45,700
there could be a new sport yeah, but with a moving basket. Oh my God, you

83
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,040
It runs away from you.

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,380
This is a great, well, base, it barely runs.

85
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
Although you'd probably get pretty good if you were doing that.

86
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,380
They would get really good.

87
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,140
I've seen videos of guys with no arms or legs doing some incredible things.

88
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,260
Yeah, Felipe Nunez got no legs.

89
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
I saw a video.

90
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
He jumped down the stairs.

91
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,860
I saw a video of a man with no arms breaking a swimming record.

92
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,860
Wow.

93
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
And I was like, I would be so...

94
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
What was his name, Bob?

95
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:22,580
I don't think his name was Bob I believe he was Chinese.

96
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,660
Oh a Chinese guy can't be named Bob?

97
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,980
I knew a Chinese guy named Bob.

98
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Me too.

99
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,980
I'm lying.

100
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,820
(sad horn music)

101
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,060
(laughing)

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,020
- I feel like when we don't have video,

103
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,700
we're more irresponsible.

104
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,420
- Oh, absolutely.

105
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,660
- You get away with a lot more.

106
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,500
- Get away with 10 times more.

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,340
- Right, 'cause there's no, nobody can post a video of it

108
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,100
and say, "Look what this guy said."

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,660
- Exactly, yeah.

110
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,780
And nobody's gonna click on a screen recording

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,300
of an audio from a podcast.

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,380
- Of a Windows Media Player visualizer.

113
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,880
Exactly. Nobody's going to do that shit.

114
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,980
So you can say whatever you want, Pat.

115
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,580
And there's no proof that it's that it's you.

116
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,380
It could be any of us.

117
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,580
Yeah, that's true.

118
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,680
Maybe if we change all of our voices.

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,380
That's what I was about to say.

120
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,080
I can pitch you up and you can say whatever.

121
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,580
That's true.

122
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,680
Look what the chipmunk said.

123
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,880
This fucking chipmunk went on this podcast, said something crazy.

124
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,180
You know what I'd like?

125
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,980
This chipmunk said motherfucker.

126
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,180
Chipmunk said motherfucker on this podcast. He's not allowed to do that.

127
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
What were you saying?

128
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,180
Um, I have a new, I have a movie for the movie club.

129
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,380
What's the movie club?

130
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,580
There's a new thing.

131
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,380
The movie club is a new thing?

132
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,380
It's free on YouTube.

133
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,380
It's called The Wrong Guy with Dave Foley.

134
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380
The movie club is free on...

135
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,380
What the fuck is a movie club?

136
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
You're just saying, what's the movie club?

137
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,380
You gotta watch it if you wanna be in the movie club.

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,380
I don't wanna be in the movie club.

139
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,420
movie club you need to start with this. I'm starting a movie club. Here's the first movie.

140
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:07,140
Thank you. He said it exactly. He does everything I say. The Wrong Guy, 1997. That is one of

141
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:13,540
the best movies I've ever seen. We don't have these mid-budget comedies anymore. Yeah, we

142
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,580
do. No, we don't. Yeah, we do. What movie? Blades of Glory. Oh, alright. That was the

143
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,580
last one. Barbon Stargo to Vista Del Mar. That's yeah, I guess that's the second to last one.

144
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:35,780
No, I'm feeling say Barbon Stargon. What? Barbonheimer. Barbie. Barbonheimer be like.

145
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:42,500
No, explosion. Explosion. I don't want to be part of your movie club. You don't want

146
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,140
to be part of the movie club. You're kind of you're kind of normie. That's not normie.

147
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,340
That was really Normie. That was hella Normie humor. That was cringe. That was Normie and

148
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,700
cringe? That was not Normie and cringe. That was not Normie and cringe at me. It was Normie

149
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,980
and cringe of you to do a Barbenheimer joke bro. That was so fucking... That was literally

150
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,420
three weeks ago. That's okay. Barbenheimer opening weekend called, they want their joke

151
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:12,080
back. That actually makes it funnier because it's tragedy plus time. There was no tragedy

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,580
That's why Oppenheimer was so funny.

153
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,580
You think there was no tragedy involved with Oppenheimer?

154
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Wait, Cameron just said that. There was no tragedy with nuclear bombs,

155
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,080
the big one and the little man.

156
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,580
This is the episode that's going to send us to prison.

157
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,080
Here's hoping that we don't.

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,580
I don't want to go to jail.

159
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
No, I don't think I would fare very well in prison.

160
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,580
Because all the crap that we've said so far, in this seven minutes.

161
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,060
I am going to I have to today I have to go pay $2,000 to get my fucking car out of the

162
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,660
pound and then I have to ride dirty as certain rap villains would say from

163
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:57,420
what does that mean because they're taking my license plate off oh so you

164
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,140
I'm gonna tell them that I live at Eric's house cuz he's a driveway they're

165
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,940
gonna drop the car off there and then I'm gonna go move it to somewhere that

166
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,420
is not his house. Yeah, but I have to drive from there. But you wouldn't why

167
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,820
not just tell them the place you want to go in the first place? Yeah, because I

168
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,180
have to basically walk into this parking lot and be like, hey, here, can you can

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,260
I pay to have this car park? There's no license plate, right? So you have to you

170
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,380
can't be like, go find a parking spot in this general area. Yeah, yeah. So I have

171
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,060
to do some deception. I have to buy a new license plate. This is gonna be really,

172
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,780
really tough. I have to outsmart a tow truck driver today. That's hard, which I

173
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,860
don't know if you know tow truck drivers. They're pretty smart guys. The

174
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,380
bar for tow truck drivers, like the bar exam.

175
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,780
It's the actual bar. Yeah. It's the actual bar and then there's

176
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,180
also the CDL license that you got to get and then you got to take a class

177
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,900
called trickery 101 at the community college and it's taught by a magician.

178
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
They're bastards.

179
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
They are real bastards.

180
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
They're like mosquitoes.

181
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
I'm really not looking forward.

182
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
This is going to be, I already know.

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Do you ever wake up and you know what is going to be the worst part of your day?

184
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Yeah.

185
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
I hate that.

186
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,900
That's when I go to the dentist.

187
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
I'm going to the doctor today.

188
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
That's how I know that's going to be the worst part of my day.

189
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
That's going to be easily the worst part of your day.

190
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
You're going to get some, I can already tell you're going to get some tragic news.

191
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Something bad is going to happen.

192
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,900
You're getting a prostate exam.

193
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Yeah, I'm getting a prostate exam.

194
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,900
That's not tragic.

195
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,900
From a doctor with, who's an arm wrestling champion.

196
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,900
From Wolverine.

197
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
You're going to get the top of the world.

198
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,060
That's not tragic. From a doctor who's an arm wrestling champion.

199
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,500
From Wolverine. You're going to get the prostate exam from the cartoon with the doctor with

200
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,860
the big hands. Yeah. You're going to get that. That's going to be your doctor. They're going

201
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,780
to put chemicals up to my body. It's going to be a foam finger. Honestly, they're not

202
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,780
even going to do anything to me, but I just hate my doctor so much that I'm suffering

203
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,700
just thinking about going there. You hate your doctor? I literally, I can say this because

204
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,700
there's no video and we're all behind a paywall. I want to kill my doctor. Okay. You and I

205
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,440
You want to kill him or her?

206
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,960
Her.

207
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,980
Whoa!

208
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,420
Wow, okay.

209
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,460
What the fuck?

210
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,480
A little too far.

211
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,500
You can't say you're going to kill a woman.

212
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,520
I said it's not on video.

213
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,540
The hell is that?

214
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,360
She's an elevated woman.

215
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,580
She passed schools.

216
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,100
That's true.

217
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,920
Once she passes schools, she becomes a man.

218
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,440
You're saying women doctors are acting like men.

219
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,980
That's what you're saying.

220
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,000
They're at the level of a man who's a tow truck driver.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,520
They've reached that level.

222
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,160
And you want her dead.

223
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,180
Yeah.

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,960
crimes for crimes against me and my body. Yeah, crimes against your body because you

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,440
made you breathe in that cube that one. Yeah, and it charged me a whole lot of money. Yeah,

226
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,560
I do not like doctors. I fucking hate my dog, but I know I know dentists the most. I know

227
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,360
that the worst part of my day is to dentists are terrible. I liked my dentist in Boston,

228
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,320
but I will never go to a dentist again. I do like that flavor they put in your mouth

229
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,800
fluoride that orange flavor. Oh yeah, they don't do that since you're eight. I've always

230
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,160
been afraid of dentists because my little brother almost died at the dentist. He went into anaphylaxis

231
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
when they put the...

232
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
B in his mouth.

233
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,360
They put a B, yeah. And they take that B to numb your mouth.

234
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Sting it on each tooth.

235
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,440
They have a B on a toothpick that they stick in your mouth and they put it right in your

236
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
gums.

237
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,560
Applying honey all over, it makes no sense.

238
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,760
Honey on his gums.

239
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,480
That is scary that you can die from a...

240
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
A B.

241
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
A B.

242
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,840
I've never been stung by a bee. I'm convinced that when I get stung by a bee I will die.

243
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,000
I got bit by a wasp. I got stung by a bee. I got bit by a wasp or stung by a bee. I got

244
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
stung by a bee and I went. Is it a hand on something and there was a wasp? Are you allergic

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
to wasps and bees? If you're allergic to one it goes to both? Maybe. They're in the same

246
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,480
family. Is it the same venom? I actually don't think so. But I got stung by a bee and my

247
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,080
mom is super allergic to bees. She like dies every time she's been stung by a bee. She

248
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,760
dies and then comes back. Or she's been like, dies. She's like rolled around on the floor

249
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,760
because there was nobody home and had to like crawl to an EpiPen. Oh Jesus. Yeah, she's

250
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,840
like super allergic. So I thought that I was too. I don't even have an EpiPen. Yeah, you

251
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,760
need an EpiPen. I know I need one. I'd have to get an EpiPen every time I need a carrot.

252
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,960
I got stung and I freaked out and I was like my throat is closing. I'm dying and I went

253
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,640
to the emergency room and I walked in and I was like I got stung by a bee and they were

254
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,360
like who gives a fuck. Yeah. And I wasn't allergic at all. I'm so scared of anaphylaxis.

255
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,920
Yeah, that's maybe the most scary thing on the planet to me.

256
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,120
They had this shit, the laughing gas distributor or whatever it's called, the latex thing.

257
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,240
My little brother is like so allergic to latex that they put that on him.

258
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,680
He was laughing so hard he couldn't tell them that he was in trouble.

259
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,680
He's like, "I'm in trouble!"

260
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
I think that's what happened.

261
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,720
I think he just started like choking really hard.

262
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,200
He was like four years old, so he also doesn't, he can't say.

263
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,200
He can't even say I'm going into anaphylaxis. He doesn't know what that is.

264
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Anaphylaxis, what's that? A damn Pokemon? I would be really upset to find out that I was allergic to a shark bite or something.

265
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Because then you get bit by the shark and you lose your arm.

266
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
And you're like, "Oh, well at least I escaped with my life."

267
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Wait, my throat is closing up. I'm also itchy.

268
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,200
I can't itch because the other arm gets the spot better.

269
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,960
Exactly, yeah. Or you're walking around and you're holding your arm that he bit off and

270
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
itching it.

271
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Yeah.

272
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480
I'm really scared of phantom limb syndrome.

273
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,880
I have phantom limb sometimes.

274
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
For what?

275
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
My other legs.

276
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,200
Your back legs?

277
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Your back legs?

278
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
My back legs.

279
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
That would suck if you had a full centaur phantom limb.

280
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,000
I start walking backwards sometimes and I'm like, "Oh, it's because of my back legs."

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,880
That would suck if you were a centaur and they took off your horse part and they let

282
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
you just do normal legs.

283
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
They give you this big hairy ass.

284
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,080
Yeah, now you're walking around and you think you're bumping into people with a big hairy

285
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
ass.

286
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,760
Or you're trying to grind on a girl, but you're actually...

287
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
You're ten feet away.

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,760
You're ten feet away.

289
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,440
Because you grind on a girl.

290
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
so

291
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,400
well, they would because their dicks are in the back yeah,

292
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,680
a sitar with phantom limb syndrome. He's doing every every

293
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,940
yeah,

294
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:29,920
girls like trying to to eat his ass out, but she's like don't don't don't come

295
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
to close. You're walking

296
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,360
stop to stay right there ten feet away. Okay, now just like

297
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,060
Oh

298
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,360
true. If you had a phantom,

299
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,560
woman just going like,

300
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
playing peekaboo

301
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,160
arm amputated, you could phantom limb jack off anywhere. Oh yeah, nobody be

302
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,960
able to see what you're doing. You're just that's true. You see you doing

303
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,660
making a face and going

304
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:12,080
Jack off. I have a phantom limb. I'm just scared of the pain that comes with having a phantom

305
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,660
limb. I'm scared of almost every medical possibility there is known to man.

306
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,120
You get shot in your phantom limb?

307
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
That would suck.

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
You lose your phantom limb.

309
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
And then you get shot into it.

310
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,240
Oh, you get shot. I thought you said you get a shot.

311
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,600
No, you get shot in your phantom limb and it's like, "Oh my God! No!"

312
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,640
Yeah, because there's no way to get that bullet out.

313
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,400
Yeah, you need to go to the phantom doctor.

314
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
Exactly. He's miming all this stuff.

315
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,400
You know the stuff where it's like,

316
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,840
they like, have you ever seen the experiments

317
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,920
or the studies or whatever they do

318
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,520
where like, so you know how some people get phantom limb

319
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,800
and they get like an itch on it that they can't scratch?

320
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
And then they do a thing where they like,

321
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
they have like mirrors.

322
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,740
So you look into the mirror

323
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,400
and it reflects your other arm or whatever.

324
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,000
So it looks like you have an arm

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
and then you just scratch that arm

326
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,560
and then their itch goes away.

327
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,720
Oh that video of the dude getting hit in the hand

328
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,560
with the hammer.

329
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,400
Yeah.

330
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,220
Yeah. I've seen that one.

331
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,060
They hit him in the hand?

332
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah, there's a fake arm

333
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,120
and they hit the fake arm with a hammer really hard

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
and he like screams.

335
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,800
- Yeah. - Oh.

336
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,960
- He screams like a banshee.

337
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,640
- Well, maybe he's just scared of--

338
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,480
- Yeah. - Loud noise.

339
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,200
- I'd be scared if that happened.

340
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,680
- Yeah, you would, I mean, we should do that to you

341
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,580
'cause that would be a funny reaction.

342
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,360
(laughs)

343
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
- You just wanna have a funny reaction.

344
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,560
- We have a fake arm in here and a hammer in here.

345
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
- And we do have a panel that we can put--

346
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,880
- The one episode that we don't have--

347
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,680
- I know. - Video of every component

348
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,080
to fully realize this. - We can actually do it.

349
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,920
- We literally have two fake arms and a hammer.

350
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,360
The fake arm that we have is covered in like fake scabs.

351
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,920
It would work. It would work on me. I'm not that smart.

352
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,360
No, even if we have the panel up to make it look like it's your arm and everything.

353
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,800
Just put it in my head. It would work on me.

354
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,400
The sound would scare the shit out of you. Just going like that.

355
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah. And to see the gold.

356
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200
It's funny that you got like Luigi stuff going on.

357
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
What does that mean?

358
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,600
Like Luigi's like afraid of every... I'm thinking of his mansion.

359
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,880
ghosts. Yeah, that's a scary Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi Luigi

360
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
for being scared of everything. He screams whenever he sees a ghost or a

361
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,120
monster. He screams that he sees 600 ghosts that are running towards him.

362
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,520
His whole thing in Smash though is like he runs towards you like he run his

363
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,600
fighting style is a scared style. I don't know anything about Smash.

364
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,680
Scared style? Virgin. You know his kung fu? You think it's a virgin? You don't

365
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,180
know anything about smashing. Okay, buddy, if you're talking about smash

366
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,580
bros, that's the type of virginity you're taking away is that of a three

367
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,200
year old boy.

368
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,040
And that's based on what I've read about the smash brothers scene. What

369
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,180
what's what? There's a bunch of pedophiles in the in the in the in the

370
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,500
competitive smells and all the thing. Probably. Yeah, I think I read about

371
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,440
that a while ago. I mean, yeah, they're playing competitive smash. I mean,

372
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,480
I play smash bros when my friends come over. Yeah, so you're a competitive

373
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't even know you in the same group.

374
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
No.

375
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
When my young buddies come over.

376
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,040
You know who's really competitive with it?

377
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,600
Joe.

378
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
With a video game?

379
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Joe is competitive.

380
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Competitive as in he gets mad or competitive like he's good.

381
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,420
When I lived with Joe and Neil, Joe and Neil would play Smash on the Switch in the living

382
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,520
room and I would hear it from my bedroom and all I would hear is like, "Ness is a fucking

383
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
bullshit character!"

384
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,720
And then Neil was just like, "Well no, you shouldn't."

385
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,520
I don't like fighting games. I don't understand them at all.

386
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,720
They're fun for an hour.

387
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,820
I don't get why anyone would want to play a video game competitively.

388
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,720
A lot of the fighting games have sexual women characters.

389
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,920
Okay, I'm back on.

390
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,720
Yeah.

391
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I just talked about this on beers we drank, but there was a very funny clip that came out.

392
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
No, you don't get to censor this.

393
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,220
No, what are you doing?

394
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,720
I could have told the whole story by now.

395
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,220
Well, you didn't have to tell the whole story.

396
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
There was a guy...

397
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,720
How does it feel getting buzzed?

398
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,220
I don't think you've ever been buzzed.

399
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,540
He can't get buzzed, that's the worst problem.

400
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
I can buzz myself.

401
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
I can't.

402
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,920
No, you can't because you know you're doing it.

403
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,780
You know you're getting buzzed.

404
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,260
Basically a guy who had a nude mod on for a Street Fighter tournament.

405
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,260
I saw that.

406
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Oh you did?

407
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
That was a funny clip.

408
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
I gotta check that out.

409
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,260
That was a funny fucking clip.

410
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,900
You gotta check it out because you gotta see Chun Li's big floppy boobs.

411
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Whoa.

412
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
They flop.

413
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Yeah.

414
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
They put the jiggle physics.

415
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
What's the game?

416
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Were those dead or alive?

417
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
What's the game?

418
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Dead or alive is what you just asked me.

419
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
I literally would probably say.

420
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
What's a game where those dead are alive?

421
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
I woke up one hour ago.

422
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
That means you should be,

423
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
that's not a long,

424
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
that's not, how long does it take to recover from waking up?

425
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Is that a short time to you?

426
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm still waking up.

427
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
You're still waking up from an hour ago?

428
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
It takes me two hours to wake up.

429
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
I think I have chronic Lyme.

430
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
You won't survive in this world.

431
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
I won't.

432
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:58,180
I've been waking up so early. It's been so nice. It's been so goated. My time difference.

433
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:06,180
I woke up at 8 o'clock and then I went biking for 2 hours 2 days ago. And that was, I felt

434
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
good.

435
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,020
I've been waking up at like 7, 7, 7.30 naturally every day. And I've been getting so tired

436
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,700
that I can't stay awake by like 9.30. It's incredible. It's so nice.

437
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,700
I've been biking from Ridgewood to the end of Williamsburg and then back.

438
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
It's real nice.

439
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Sometimes I'll stop at Blue Park and go skate.

440
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm getting my steps in. I'm getting my exercise on.

441
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
That's not steps, that's pedals.

442
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
When I was flying back from Ireland...

443
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
One step is equal to four pedals.

444
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
No, four steps is equal to one pedal.

445
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
What kind of bike has one pedal?

446
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
You're on a unicycle.

447
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Half of a unicycle.

448
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,700
My pedal got stolen.

449
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
That's a bad situation.

450
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
That's not going to be a very good vehicle for you.

451
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
You could still ride it, but it's just not going to be ideal.

452
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
No, it's going to be bad.

453
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,700
When I was on the plane back from Ireland, because it's like a seven-hour flight but a five-hour time difference,

454
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,700
I watched six hours straight of movies.

455
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,700
I watched the Avenue Avatar again, and then I watched that new...

456
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
What's the Avenue Avatar?

457
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
The new Avatar, and I watched the new Guardians of the Galaxy.

458
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Bro said the Avenue Avatar.

459
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,900
six hours of movie straight and got off the plane. It was basically the same

460
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,700
time that I got on the plan. Isn't that crazy? It felt I felt so insane. I felt

461
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,900
like I was in a pocket dimension. Yeah, that were only movies. You were a movie

462
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,060
world. I was in movie were six hours and I got if you watch more than one movie,

463
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,220
you get on the plane, you eat lunch, you watch six hours of movies, you get off

464
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,100
the plane, you eat lunch again at the same

465
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,280
the day of

466
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,920
that is definitely laugh so hard that to think about yeah that I went into a

467
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,060
special time world time pocket to watch movies and eat an extra

468
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:57,500
time traveled, but all I got was an extra lunch

469
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,340
to live a day that's 30 hours long and just use it to watch movies and eat an

470
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,220
extra lunch, but you miss out on lunch on the way there. I know yeah, the way

471
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,200
there is horrible. And the movies are basically taking double the time. Which is the scariest

472
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,280
thing ever. Isn't that horrifying? Yeah, you leave at 8 and you get there at 8 and it's

473
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,120
all and you watch two movies in that time. And you only ate one meal. But you might as

474
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,720
well have watched four movies. Yeah, I'd be watching four. If you watch more than one

475
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,120
movie on a plane, when you land it does feel like insane. Dude, I watched those two movies

476
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,360
and I had like an hour and a half left in the flight. It felt crazy. You didn't watch

477
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,740
any other movies? No, I watched too many. I don't like two movies and I couldn't watch

478
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,280
three long ass movies. I watched Casino. I watched Casino that took the whole flight

479
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,500
from Austin to New York on the way back. But on the way there, I watched the Social Network

480
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,520
and then the movie Overboard with Kurt Russell and Colby Hahn. I don't know what Overboard

481
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,000
is. It's just like a very mid like 80s like comedy where Kurt Russell essentially, Kurt

482
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,860
Art Russell tricks a woman into thinking that he is married to her and then she has to take

483
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,560
care of her three or I think it's four little piece of shit kids.

484
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,320
Does she have brain damage?

485
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,800
She has amnesia because she fell off of her yacht.

486
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Well fuck her then, she has a yacht.

487
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,540
And she's rude to him at first.

488
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
To her husband?

489
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,240
It's not her real husband.

490
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,740
He was building her walk-in closet on her yacht.

491
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,220
And he's trying to hit a lick on a cumbo.

492
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,340
He was just trying to get $600 so that he could father his children.

493
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,900
And then the whole movie is just like him training her like a dog to get him beer and make the

494
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,740
kids learn how to read.

495
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
That's cool.

496
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,340
And then they fall in love from that somehow.

497
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,020
Because that's what girls actually secretly want.

498
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,820
They want to be trained like dogs to get you beer.

499
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
I love watching two movies on a plane.

500
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,820
It's so awesome.

501
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,740
time when I was flying back from Mexico, I watched Men in Black and 8 Mile and that

502
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,900
was a good double feature. Yeah, I watched it. Getting to the end of 8 Mile as we

503
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,860
were about to land was the first time ever in my life I was like, "Please don't

504
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,700
land yet. I don't want the plane to land." Yeah, I think I have... Let me finish this

505
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
let's see. We need to do one more loop real quick. Yeah, just loop around real quick.

506
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I have ten minutes left of overboard. I don't know how it ends. That's the worst

507
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,740
feeling, man. I don't know how it ends at all. When the plane lands and there's ten

508
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,340
minutes left? Uh-huh. What about, "I'm never gonna watch this movie off a plane"?

509
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,380
I'm not finishing Chinatown. I'm not finishing. You just go to the flight tracker and you're

510
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,740
like, here's it. I was playing one of those games. You know, those games they have. Oh

511
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,460
yeah. Here's a trivia question. I want to see if you guys know the answer to this. I

512
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,340
definitely do. So this is a, you know how they have all their trivia games and whatever

513
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,620
on the flight. Let me find this picture I took. This was, I opened up this game that

514
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,860
was called, I can't remember what it's called. It was called like world. There were two different

515
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,740
trivia games. That's why I remember pop culture in the world. Something wise.

516
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,460
I can just see that it cut off something wise on my picture. Sam, this

517
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,580
was question one of ten. Okay, see if

518
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,940
question one of ten. What gift should you not give to your Chinese colleague?

519
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:19,460
What are the good of the most cigarettes, tea or time pieces? I'm

520
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,580
gonna say time pieces. I think it was time pieces. If I remember correctly,

521
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,340
It seems like the kind of thing that would be bad luck, because I know Chinese people

522
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,900
love cigarettes and tea, obviously.

523
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,420
So that doesn't seem like the most bad luck thing.

524
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Yeah, probably.

525
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,980
Oh, it's just the first trivia question.

526
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,220
You just press the game and that's the first thing that pops up.

527
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,060
Speaking of Chinese colleagues, I watched Police Story the other day.

528
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,060
That movie is so good.

529
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Dude, what's Police Story?

530
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
The Jackie Chan movie?

531
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,060
You got to watch it.

532
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
You haven't seen that?

533
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,060
I haven't seen any.

534
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,460
Only Jackie Chan I've seen is Rush Hour.

535
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,900
You gotta watch the old Jackie Chan movies.

536
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
He was so goaded.

537
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Yeah.

538
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Dude, that movie.

539
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
He got hit by cars.

540
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
Yeah.

541
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
He does the most insane stunts.

542
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
The one where he slides down.

543
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Yeah.

544
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,260
Dude, the stunt is so sick.

545
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,060
Because those movies, you're just watching them to watch the stunts or whatever.

546
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:16,860
They do a triple, they show every single angle, one in slow-mo and then the two other angles

547
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,160
at the end of the movie.

548
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,920
he slides down this pole that's covered in lights and then everything around him is like

549
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
blasting sparks.

550
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,920
Exploding and shattering, yeah.

551
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Dude, it's so crazy.

552
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
It's so good.

553
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Those movies are so...

554
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,440
He hangs off a fucking car, he hangs off the bus and then he's fighting the dudes.

555
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I've seen that clip.

556
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
That's a police story?

557
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Yeah.

558
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Police story is like...

559
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
It's so good.

560
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
I saw the clip.

561
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
It's so funny too.

562
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,000
I love all that stupid shit where it's just about him and the girl.

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Just all the...

564
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah.

565
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Oh yeah.

566
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
With all the phones and stuff.

567
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
All that stuff is so good, man.

568
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,700
is it Jackie Chan is completely go to did you see the interview with him about that bus

569
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,000
scene where he was like yeah the bus was going way too fast and the guy can tell the guys

570
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,540
like really all the guys who fell off the bus got really badly hurt yeah yeah there's

571
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:08,040
like so many the I forget what moves oh he was in cannonball run and then after I watched

572
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,900
the movie I just like when I just right in cannonball run yeah he's in there for like

573
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,400
a little bit and then he said that the the blooper reel at the end of the movie was very

574
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,240
inspiring to him so then he employed that in every single one of his movies after that.

575
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,520
I didn't even know that Cannonball Run was a real thing people do.

576
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
Really?

577
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah.

578
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
I've never seen Cannonball Run.

579
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,280
It's about who can, the Cannonball Run is a...

580
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,600
So you go from one side to the other, right?

581
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,000
It's a route from, there's a specific diner or some shit in either New York or LA where

582
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
you drive from one to the other, you try to do it as fast as possible.

583
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,480
And somebody's done it in like 20 hours, like something crazy.

584
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,720
they go like 130 miles an hour the whole time.

585
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,920
Yeah. Jesus Christ.

586
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Yeah. I think I would like to do something like that.

587
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
I'd like to break some record.

588
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
I'm going to try to do something.

589
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,280
Some shit they did on Jackass.

590
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm going to do something that's along those lines,

591
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
but from the earth to the moon.

592
00:27:59,600 --> 00:27:59,840
Yeah.

593
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,800
That's going to be...

594
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,480
Fastest earth to the moon.

595
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,520
I think that that'd be a pretty easy record to break, honestly.

596
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,480
If you throw caution to the wind when it comes to space travel...

597
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
The cannibal run, do you have to be alive once you get there?

598
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,720
[laughter]

599
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,020
Yeah, I think the car just has to go there. Yeah, I think you have to if my

600
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,820
dead body is still in the car. Well, but how did it so explain how you think

601
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,020
that it would keep going with a dead body in the car? Well, it will be

602
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,620
self-driving using technology and artificial intelligence because it's

603
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,520
going so fast that the g-force I can't survive. I can't because you can't if

604
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,920
you're not in the car in the first place. There's no way it counts, right?

605
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,220
If it's just a car that goes there by itself, you get to the other car the

606
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,140
whole time. You get to the other diner and all of your skin is in the back seat. And

607
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:50,260
I'm driving it until I die and then the self-driving takes over. But I'm just going so fast there's

608
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,020
no way I can survive beyond 10 minutes. How fast would you have to be for that G-Force

609
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,500
to kill you? Probably a thousand miles an hour? Yeah, I guess it's also how fast it speeds

610
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,700
up. It's more about G-Force than the speed itself. Yeah, so it needs to have some serious

611
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,180
torque. How far, so it's one diner to the other, how many miles is that? I think it's

612
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,180
It's 10 miles?

613
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,780
It's 10,000 miles to from here to Austin.

614
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Or 1,000.

615
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
No, it's definitely not 1,000.

616
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
1,050.

617
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
No, it's like 1,000 miles.

618
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,780
1,050 going from 1,000 to 1,050.

619
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,300
No, it's way more than 1,000 miles from here to Austin.

620
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,940
Probably if I had to guess, 3,500 miles.

621
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,220
Let me see how many...

622
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,940
I couldn't even hazard a guess.

623
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,340
I have no clue.

624
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
Could be 100.

625
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,180
From here to the comedy mothership that is...

626
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,500
You have transit selected.

627
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,060
Oh, that would take two days.

628
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Only two days?

629
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Yeah.

630
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,060
To walk, walking directions are not available.

631
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Just click on the...

632
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
Drive.

633
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,860
Just look at the distance.

634
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
One day.

635
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,940
How many miles?

636
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
One day worth of miles.

637
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
It's 1700 miles.

638
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,940
1700 miles.

639
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
1748.

640
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,940
So, yeah, it's probably close to 4000 miles between here and LA.

641
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,940
So that's how long, okay, so if you're going a thousand miles an hour, that's only four

642
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
hours.

643
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,600
Yeah, but the tough part I think there is designing a car that goes that fast.

644
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
That's not so hard.

645
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
That's not that hard.

646
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
You just get a rocket ship to put on top of your car.

647
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Rocket boosters.

648
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Yeah, rocket boosters and nitrous.

649
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Don't know that.

650
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Laser bastards.

651
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Nitrous might work.

652
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Laser bastard.

653
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
And flying car.

654
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
I don't even know, is that your bodyguard?

655
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,600
What's a laser bastard?

656
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Laser bastard.

657
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Oh, okay.

658
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
I thought maybe you were going to have a guy who like fights the police when they chase

659
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,200
you called your laser bastard.

660
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Laser, Laser Bastard is the name of a...

661
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Or can you use wormholes?

662
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Wormholes are strictly disallowed.

663
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay.

664
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Laser Bastard is a German Jewish guy.

665
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Fly by car, pass Jupiter, go to a wormhole and appear in LA.

666
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
That would be way, that would take way longer.

667
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
I had a landlord named Laser.

668
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
You did?

669
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
You just remembered that.

670
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
My first landlord was named Laser and then I learned that that is apparently

671
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
like a Hasidic name.

672
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Laser Wolf.

673
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I think that was his name.

674
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200
What? Fiddler on the Roof or something?

675
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Probably. Oh yeah. That's the only...

676
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
That's the only Jewish piece of media I can think of.

677
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
His name was Laser something. I just remember I was like...

678
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
The last name doesn't matter if your first name is Laser.

679
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Well if it doesn't, it's Wolf.

680
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Or Bastard.

681
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
That's true. Bastard too. Laser, Bastard.

682
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Laser, Wolf, you're thinking of Star Fox.

683
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah. Yeah.

684
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Yeah, Star Fox from Fiddler on the Roof.

685
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,700
when the song that Slippy Toad does.

686
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Slippy Toad is definitely Jewish also.

687
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Yeah.

688
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
Right?

689
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Because he's nervous?

690
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Come on.

691
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
Because he's a frog, a green reptilian?

692
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
What are you guys talking about?

693
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
No.

694
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
You are being anti-Semitic.

695
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
They say he's Jewish in the game.

696
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,700
They don't say he's Jewish in the game.

697
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I don't know.

698
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,700
(Laughter)

699
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
They do.

700
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Peppy says, and by the way, Slippy...

701
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Frog.

702
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Is Frog a Jewish last name?

703
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Maybe.

704
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700
I don't know.

705
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,780
it could be actually i don't know i don't know what actually then

706
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,260
it could be

707
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,240
because it's all good be a little jewish lessons i don't know that any last name

708
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,240
yes in with the any other i was not yet by the jewish lessons confuse me

709
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,940
because sometimes people are you think they have a jewish last name but the

710
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,960
just like russian or something and you're thinking very hard about this

711
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,500
type of stuff like walberg

712
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,940
not thinking that hard about this kind of stuff now

713
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,500
is that i wonder if you have a mccain jewish rightness and i'll let him is

714
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,100
clement of

715
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,260
which i was uh... just assumed it is jewish

716
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,360
uh... but he's just running into

717
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,360
i would assume he's some kind of citrus

718
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,340
as a beat those in the

719
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,520
as a buzz man

720
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,140
now you don't get the song for that

721
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,540
you'll get a song for that

722
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,500
you can get a lot of that's a lot of the song you get how it was that was that is

723
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,860
a good song to

724
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
This is not a song.

725
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
This is a cricket.

726
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,020
That's a song in the terms of modern ideas of music.

727
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
That's true.

728
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Something that...

729
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,100
Somebody who enjoys IDM might like that.

730
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Yeah.

731
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
That's my...

732
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
That's the best name for a genre.

733
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
433 Remastered.

734
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:16,100
Bringing new elements forward in the mix that could never have been heard before.

735
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,100
They do need to make more intelligent genres.

736
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Remastered versions with crickets.

737
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,700
How about some intelligent mumble rap, huh?

738
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:31,180
We need IDR, intelligent damn rap.

739
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Now what do we got?

740
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
We just got IDM.

741
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,540
I hate IDM.

742
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,860
Intelligent damn music.

743
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Intelligent damn music.

744
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,380
I've never listened to an ounce of it in my life.

745
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,460
Me neither, but I just know I hate it.

746
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,820
I just know I don't like it.

747
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,100
Yeah, you've listened to, what's his name?

748
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:54,100
Intelligent dance music, that's IDM. Same with Better Off Alone.

749
00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Oh, Planet of the Bass. That's IDM. Certainly that's IDM.

750
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Full version dropping y'all! That's ACDM. Wait, what's today?

751
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Alternative comedy dance music. That comes out in four days.

752
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:15,100
For real? Yeah. But I don't know where it's getting released,

753
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:21,980
be in line at GameStop in four days. I'm going to, um, no, I was, I got to go to the Apple

754
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:30,260
store. I'm going to, I'm going to do, I am tomorrow's my last day with Apple care for

755
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,220
my AirPods and they keep connecting while they're in my pocket. So I'm going to try

756
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:40,260
and get them replaced before I lose Apple care. Okay. So after this, you guys, I've

757
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,980
got a very, very important mission. I think I'm going to convince them that my

758
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,300
shit's broken when it's not. See, this is tough. I have to outsmart a tow truck

759
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,420
driver. You have to outsmart a genius. Yep. They put it in the name to scare

760
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,980
you. Uh huh. And look at me, the old goof is over here. I got to go in there.

761
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,340
Genius. I have to go in this Apple store and say, Oh, you have to act as

762
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,980
stupid as possible. Yeah, no, no, no. What you have to do is you have to act.

763
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,300
I go in and I act like... You act really, really smart. Okay. This is my Apple store trick that

764
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,940
I've always done. Okay. I go in and I just hit them with every piece of possible tech

765
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,980
jargon I can think of that maybe relates even a little bit to how my computer is broken.

766
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,340
Yeah. That's completely wrong. Yeah. And they will completely cut the bullshit every time.

767
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,500
You just go in and say, "Yeah, I think it's a problem with the BIOS," and they will immediately

768
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,980
will just take your computer and... I think the firmware won't update. Literally just

769
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,780
say that and they will help you. Otherwise, they just assume that you're a stupid person

770
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,180
and they just are going to ask you to turn it off and on.

771
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,680
Yeah.

772
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,580
That's what I've always done.

773
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,680
It's always worked for me.

774
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,180
Because they assume you've already turned it off and on.

775
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,680
Exactly.

776
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,680
They assumed that I'm more of a genius than them.

777
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,080
Because none of them know any of that crap.

778
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,780
They all just give it.

779
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,680
They all just, they just know how to use their little restaurant card scanner

780
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,280
and type in the issue and put it in the back for the goblins

781
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,480
and the gnomes who actually fix the Apple computers.

782
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,180
The smart gnomes and the smart goblins.

783
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,080
I was thinking of going in there like,

784
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,680
Ed, you're telling me to go in there like Double D.

785
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah, exactly.

786
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,980
Yeah, maybe even like Jimmy Neutron.

787
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,380
Yeah, who was not from that universe, but similar one.

788
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,680
You were thinking Sheen.

789
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
You got to go Jimmy, buddy.

790
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,880
Yeah, yep.

791
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,680
Sheen Estevez.

792
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
And keep Carl out of it.

793
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,880
Keep Carl.

794
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,680
No Carl.

795
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,280
No, you should never be going into any stores, Carl.

796
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,580
Carl is going to...

797
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,180
My laptop broke because I was looking at Jimmy's mom.

798
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,480
They're going to say that'll be $40,000 because you were looking...

799
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Oh, yeah, sometimes it breaks when you look at Jimmy's mom.

800
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,880
Yeah. If you look at Jimmy's mom on your MacBook at 3 a.m. you're gonna get a

801
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,040
porno virus. No. You're gonna get a porno virus. No, no. You're gonna get a fucking porno virus.

802
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,640
What are you talking about, man? Your computer is gonna get hacked from pornos. Okay, so we're gonna

803
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,360
cleanse from that and here's like something that I was thinking about. Here's something that's a

804
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,880
little silly that I was thinking about. Okay. You guys could weigh in on it. It better be very silly. I was waiting. I thought of this

805
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,720
weeks ago and I was waiting to discuss it with you guys. I really wish that animals, every

806
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,860
type of animal could, of their own volition, with no humans involved at all, go out and

807
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:15,360
get their hair cut. Because here, I'm going to lay out my reasoning here. You know when

808
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,880
you're walking around and you see a person and you see they have some kind of crazy haircut

809
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,720
or even just a normal haircut that looks a little weird and you're kind of like, "Oh,

810
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,800
that's interesting. This person has decided to cut their hair. I wonder if they like that

811
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,520
haircut. That must be what they think looks good on them. They must think that looks cool.

812
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,560
Can you imagine if you got to experience what your dog thought that it would look cool like?

813
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,760
And you have no input at all. It goes out, it comes back, and it's like, "Check me out."

814
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,520
You see a bird fly by with a mohawk, you're like, "That bird is feeling it. That bird

815
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,320
wanted a mohawk. Every bird would look like bubble yum or whatever.

816
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,520
Double bubble. The blowout haircut? Yeah. Every bird would look like the bubble gum

817
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,120
bird, the bubble gum duck. Why is it a duck? What type of, what types of birds

818
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,920
would want this haircut? What types would want another?

819
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,420
You know, it's just, it would be so fascinating. Some birds naturally have

820
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,020
crazy hair like an emperor penguin. Exactly. So would a crazy haired emperor

821
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,620
penguin, would he go out and get a haircut and get it completely shaved?

822
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,620
I can hear it. I consider birds hair to be feathers. I call them feathers. Yeah,

823
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,040
I don't. I consider it to be a

824
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,580
hair. It's an interesting theory. You're positing. I it's an interesting theory,

825
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,980
but it will find no quarter here. Okay, well, that's fine. I saw I saw a guy,

826
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,320
a dog guy with an insane haircut the other day with a haircut that he maybe

827
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,060
gave himself the dog. I can't even believe I saw this. This dog at the dog

828
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,260
park had it was full. It was like a schnauzer and it was fully shaved front

829
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,400
legs, fully shaved body, back legs shaved just so that it looked like it had

830
00:38:59,400 --> 00:38:59,860
pants

831
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:08,320
and the owner was like like there was some other people there who like had

832
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,060
seen this dog before and they were like, oh, we like his new haircut. It looks

833
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,540
like pants and the owner was like yep.

834
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,520
so the owner went to a groomer and was like put pants on my dog. I need to put

835
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,780
pants on this dog. My friend in high school, his mom would get the cat to-

836
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,040
she had the cat to look like a lion. Cats already look like lions. Well, she

837
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,940
had like a big- They give it a mane and then like the rest of the body would be

838
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,600
like really like short and then they would like kind of like fade the boots

839
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,820
in, so it looks like big paws. That's what I mean, man. Yeah. Oh my God, which

840
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,860
dog at the dog park, if it was given the chance, would dress in fully Balenciaga.

841
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,860
Uh-huh. That'd be like an Italian greyhound. They'd be wearing a Balenciaga.

842
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,860
Some dogs would be. Which dogs would be the New Balance dogs?

843
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
You know, that's what I'm thinking about. I'm walking around.

844
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I wish they could express themselves so I could feel cute about them.

845
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Every single dog breed, let's think about it.

846
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,860
Yorkie, Yorkshire Terriers, they're going to be wearing little baby gap clothes.

847
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:18,040
I think that Bill is cool in streetwear, so he'd be wearing full Diamond Supply Co. with

848
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,860
a Diamond Supply Co. backpack.

849
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I think so.

850
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Diamond Supply Co.

851
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I think he would be dressed like he was homeless.

852
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Huff jeans.

853
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Huff jeans, Huff socks.

854
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Huff socks with the weed on them.

855
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
With the weed on them.

856
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
Huff shoes from 2014.

857
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Yeah.

858
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,740
Doesn't exist anymore.

859
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Then he'd have like a Benny Gold snapback.

860
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,740
A snack pack.

861
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,740
A snack pack too.

862
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,740
He'd be wearing snack pack merch.

863
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,000
(laughter)

864
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,320
- He'd be telling you all of his weird Twitter poems.

865
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,160
- Yep.

866
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,980
- Uh-huh.

867
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,440
That's what Phil would be like.

868
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,800
Phil would be exactly like that guy, Snack Pack,

869
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,480
who's still around apparently.

870
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,320
- Yeah.

871
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,140
- Pushing 50 probably.

872
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,480
- Pushing 50 years old still going.

873
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,000
- Hi!

874
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's so nice to be nice.

875
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
- Is that what he does?

876
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,580
- Yeah.

877
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
- I don't even know who this is.

878
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,260
- You don't know who Snack Pack is?

879
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,080
- Not really.

880
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,000
- Noah told me the other day that he had Snack Pack merch.

881
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,080
- Yeah, I believe that.

882
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,080
Noah was like, I used to have a bunch of Snack Pack merch.

883
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,160
- Yeah, Snack Pack used to be lit on Facebook in 2013.

884
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,480
- And Noah is, I need to find these photos of him in this,

885
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,320
in this merch.

886
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,320
I need to find these photos of Noah wearing Snack Pack merch.

887
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,000
- I kind of have a vague remembery of this.

888
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,840
- Yeah.

889
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,040
- But I don't, I don't remember the shirt though.

890
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,120
- He had the merch too.

891
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,960
- I did not have the merch.

892
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,920
- He's pretending not to remember.

893
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
- I was friends with Snack Pack on Facebook though.

894
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,760
- Yeah.

895
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,580
- I fucked with him on Facebook.

896
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,900
I did not. I hated that guy immediately.

897
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,420
You've just always been just a skateboarding cool cat, man.

898
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,420
I've always been sick as fuck.

899
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,700
Do you hang out with the skateboarders who are the Twitter skateboarders?

900
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
What does that mean?

901
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
I don't know.

902
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,700
We can just move on then.

903
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,700
That's fine. We can just go to the next topic.

904
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,700
What's the next topic on the list?

905
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I don't know. I brought the...

906
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,700
The Twitter skaters?

907
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
I've made friends.

908
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Is there skateboarders who are the Twitter skateboarders?

909
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
What do you mean the Twitter skateboarders?

910
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Are they like hella toy but they act like they not though?

911
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
(Laughter)

912
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
(Laughter)

913
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Yep.

914
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
Or like skateboarders who don't like comedy?

915
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Are there skateboarders who are like

916
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
I don't like the skateboarders who like comedy?

917
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Are there drama skateboarders?

918
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
There's drama skaters for sure.

919
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Is there drama in the skating world ever?

920
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Some skaters just really hate comedy. It's really funny.

921
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Is there drama in the skating world?

922
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Yeah. Really?

923
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:42,780
I've told you guys about this before, but the best beef ever, it was a one-sided beef.

924
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,300
This guy who owned this company called Team Burrito.

925
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,580
Funny.

926
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,940
Yeah, and the logo is like bootleg Supreme box logo.

927
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,100
It says Burrito.

928
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,460
I was obsessed with this when it happened.

929
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,700
He also owns this shoe company called Footprint.

930
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,700
Funny name for shoe.

931
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,300
He got wasted, he had too many white claws at a Wu-Tang concert.

932
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,760
His footprint was doing a Wu-Tang collab.

933
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,420
Got too many white claws there.

934
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,580
Goes on Instagram live and then just starts saying, "Fuck you Jason Dill and your fake

935
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,900
ass company.

936
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,260
Fucking poser piece of shit.

937
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,100
Your fucking shoes don't even pass the rebound test."

938
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,660
Which is a test he made up.

939
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,460
Jason Dill is the Grillo's mascot?

940
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,620
Jason Dill is the Gorillaz mascot, yeah.

941
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,260
He's the guy who wears the shirt that says "Fuckin' Pickles."

942
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:37,960
Mm-hmm.

943
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,760
Now, Jason Dill owns Fuckin' Awesome.

944
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,460
Oh.

945
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,680
By the way, Fuckin' Awesome, if you're listening to this, man...

946
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,520
Change your name.

947
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,840
Change your name. It's got a...

948
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
I don't know if you noticed,

949
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,480
you accidentally did a mistype of a cuss inside of the name.

950
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,060
But also, my wife bought some shoes of yours.

951
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,180
Those shoes... Okay.

952
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,020
And she didn't know that it had the fuckin' name on it.

953
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,160
She bought the shoes that I own.

954
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,460
She copied me.

955
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,460
She completely copied you.

956
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
Your wife is a copycat.

957
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Yes, dude.

958
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,460
Damn.

959
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
Your wife copycatted you.

960
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:11,300
She copies pirates every single day in the way that she buys purchases for our house and

961
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,580
wears her clothes.

962
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:17,380
Yeah, but she bought the FA Experiment 1s which have the logo on them.

963
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
And they look like shit.

964
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,100
I don't know what that logo looks like.

965
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,100
Shit.

966
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Which one?

967
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
It says fucking awesome.

968
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,500
That's the Hulk Hogan font too.

969
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, it's the Hulkamania font.

970
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,860
That is so hella toy.

971
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,640
is toy to switch to play with funny fonts. Fucking awesome is toy as fuck. Their other

972
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,640
gear is pretty sick, or it used to be very sick but now it's kind of insisting upon itself.

973
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Alright, we're starting Escape Brand, you and me. Okay. What about me though? You get

974
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,640
to come up with the name. You are the receptionist. Team Rider. Team Rider, that's what it's called?

975
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,020
team rider. That's the name of our team. Rocket. No, that's not the name of the team. And we

976
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,900
are making, okay, here's what we're making. We're going to start out. We're going to start

977
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,260
out. We should start small. We should start small. We should start at the hardware. We

978
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,200
should start at the boards. You're ruining my idea right now. No, I'm see how not fun

979
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,020
it is to start a skate company with him. You're ruining my idea. You're, well, okay. What

980
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:18,140
do you want to start at boards immediately? Oh dude, I don't even want to do boards. I

981
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,220
don't want to do shirts. What do you want to do? I don't want to do shorts. I want to

982
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:29,540
stickers, knee pads, elbow pads, helmets, shin guards. This is what we're making.

983
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,900
Special cell phones that have one button to call 911 and your mom. Yes. In case you fall.

984
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,780
And they're attached to the knee pads, so if you fall and hit me, it automatically calls your mom.

985
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,860
This is Team Rider. We make the biggest helmets on the fucking market. We make knee pads. You

986
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,460
will never get hurt wearing Team Rider. That's a guarantee. If you walk into the break and

987
00:45:49,460 --> 00:46:00,820
We make skateboards that go on a rail like a roller coaster.

988
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:08,780
We make a full Michelin man foam suit that is protecting you from falling over.

989
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,860
That's also what this guy who owned Team Burrito does.

990
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,700
He has socks that have shin guards built in.

991
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,700
Really?

992
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,700
Yeah.

993
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,700
See this is the kind of shit we're making.

994
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,740
Yeah, we're going up against Team Burrito.

995
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,940
We're going to be way safer. We're being way safer. We're team safety.

996
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,580
Team safety. That's what we are. Yeah. We are team safety.

997
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,460
Everything is also full black and yellow. It's high viz.

998
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,820
You will never get hit by a car. It's all only made out of high viz.

999
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,940
There's no material involved that is not high viz. It's full high viz.

1000
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,940
The wheels are high viz. I don't think we can make wheels yet.

1001
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,100
We don't want to make wheels. We don't want to make any of the parts of the

1002
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,180
skateboard. It's just skateboard stuff to make sure that safety is happening.

1003
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,300
but the next phase is skateboards that are safer than the average skateboard.

1004
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,300
Yeah. Skateboard made out of styrofoam.

1005
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,300
Okay, because here we go. We sell these big puffy shoes,

1006
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,300
skate shoes. On the bottom of them, they have magnets.

1007
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,300
You're like, "What the hell? Why are there magnets on the bottom of the shoe?"

1008
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,300
Metal bowed.

1009
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
Year later, metal bowed.

1010
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,300
Metal bowed.

1011
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Metal bowed.

1012
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,300
If you have any kind of separation between you and the board,

1013
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,300
that is what we call a gap of danger.

1014
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
Mind the gap.

1015
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
Mind the gap.

1016
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,340
that's a classic shirt. So this shit is if there is any space between you and the board,

1017
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,220
that's space that a spike could go through or a spider or a spider could spider especially.

1018
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:34,020
Also, it's the everything is everything is pre-sprayed with industrial level raid. And

1019
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:40,180
we're yeah, we've got deep. Yeah, there's a lot of the thing that the that they say that's

1020
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,940
the one that they said that you can't use in bug spray anymore. That's why you also

1021
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:49,140
So that is why we also have gloves and respirators because you have to because

1022
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:54,340
the stuff is so toxic. So imagine this right helmet big as fuck big padding

1023
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,240
around you basically it basically looks like a mushroom top on your head. You

1024
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:05,240
look like toad respirator on your face goggles and then a Glock and then Glock

1025
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,940
Glock in your case you get someone tries to rob you in case a security guard

1026
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,540
tries to touch you. With a blade in it. Lead blanket vest in case someone tries

1027
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,540
just to x-ray you. In case you're skating next to a hospital and the x-rays come out the window.

1028
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,540
Yeah, the x-rays thing start swiveling around and they shoot it at the window.

1029
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:28,540
Wrist guards. Or if a nuclear bomb goes off. Wrist guards. Turtle shell. Wrist guards that

1030
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,540
are made out of turtles. A little pill that you swallow and when it goes into your stomach

1031
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:37,540
it puffs up and becomes very big and it stops any of your internal organs from moving around

1032
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,820
being jostled. Yes. Basically one of those foam dinosaurs that you put in the

1033
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,980
bathtub. Yeah. And it makes your insides feel like jelly. And this is

1034
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,460
team safety. This is team safety stuff. Yeah. And that's what... oh it's just some

1035
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:57,100
team safety shit. Pants with knee pads built in. And we're gonna sponsor

1036
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:03,700
rappers. And a backpack that comes with a giant flashing LCD screen on the back

1037
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,100
that shows your face, all your allergies, all your pre-existing medical conditions.

1038
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:12,660
And also a parachute, just in case you fall from something high.

1039
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,020
A parachute that has a helicopter attached so you can go back up if you're falling down

1040
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,020
a bottomless pit.

1041
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,020
Yes.

1042
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,020
This is all amazing ideas.

1043
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,220
Because a parachute only saves you if there's ground beneath you.

1044
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,700
Yeah, if it's a bottomless pit, the parachute is just going to make it more agonizing.

1045
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,180
It's going to make it worse.

1046
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,180
Or if you're going down over water, you could go sideways until you get out of the water.

1047
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:38,020
And also everything is made of the, it's the same thing as the inflatable vest on a plane

1048
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,020
where you just pull it and it's going to, you're going to puff up, it's a life jacket.

1049
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,140
Yeah, you're going to look like Bubble Buddy once you're done wearing all this team safety

1050
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
gear.

1051
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,180
And all this gear, it's free for the good of society.

1052
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,780
It's paid for by taxpayers.

1053
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,780
So tell me.

1054
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,860
And that's why, and this is also, this is, we're not going to clue Patrick in on this,

1055
00:49:55,860 --> 00:50:02,860
but this whole thing is a way to sow discord in the skating community.

1056
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,560
But also in the larger community because we want people who are walking around

1057
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,160
with no pads on and stuff. We want people to be like, "Fuck you, man!

1058
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,860
My tax money is going to have to pay for your exploding limbs."

1059
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,360
And then your team safety sunglasses,

1060
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,660
they scan that person's face who's yelling at you,

1061
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:26,800
send it to a database up in the sky.

1062
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,080
The one thing server.

1063
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,460
The one thing I will say that later.

1064
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,940
The one thing I will say is if you do that, you will

1065
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,780
be removing

1066
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,480
Kobe Shadix from employment because then

1067
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,100
SCARDA is not going to exist anymore.

1068
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,300
He can fall back.

1069
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,740
It'll be like tiny.

1070
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,460
It'll be like we're using we're using a

1071
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,820
microscope to find

1072
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,020
injuries, to find like tiny microscopic

1073
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:51,620
stapled his finger to a paper by accident.

1074
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,420
No, we can still do skating, but it'll be like

1075
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,600
the mother fucker poked himself with a mechanical

1076
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:02,400
so I was he didn't draw blood, but it was red. I was a piece of lead was in

1077
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,520
his finger for three years and

1078
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,280
I don't know just one day I went to write something down and missed the

1079
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,140
paper and it went into the back of my finger.

1080
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:16,400
Oh no, he stubbed his heel on the corner of the door

1081
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,640
with his because he was walking backwards

1082
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:26,580
Office scarred. He hit his head off his hand. Office scarred. Office scarred, yeah.

1083
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:32,680
Workplace scarred. He was sad. Oh, that would actually... He got too hungry. Wait. That would be sick.

1084
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,380
Where it's like, it's scarred but instead of extreme sports, it's all like OSHA violations,

1085
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,180
all like, like that OSHA shit we read. I'm surprised that's not, well that's because I think it's...

1086
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,380
Jacobi Shattuck just watching... Legally it has to be anonymous. Yeah, that's true.

1087
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,140
If it wasn't, that would be a great show.

1088
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,180
Yeah, it's just like dudes getting into forklift accidents.

1089
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,780
Yeah.

1090
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:59,220
Dudes doing that video where the guy is putting the pallets on the dolly

1091
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,620
and then all the pallets fall forward.

1092
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,980
I got in a forklift accident.

1093
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,100
And then he flies forward.

1094
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,300
Yeah, I lifted my fork and I accidentally ate a bite of salad.

1095
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,620
Fat ass.

1096
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,380
Fat fuck.

1097
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,140
Well, no, it's like, "Ugh, veggies, ew."

1098
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,340
You're fat.

1099
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,260
Well, it's not even about-- I guess I'm fat, but it's not.

1100
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,260
You were in the whale, did they?

1101
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,340
(laughs)

1102
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,860
Did they have to use AI technology to slim you down at all

1103
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,700
to play that part?

1104
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,660
When I was in the whale, I escaped like Jonah

1105
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,660
by the grace of God.

1106
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,500
No, you were more of a Pinocchio.

1107
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,580
I watched Sodom and Gomorrah

1108
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,420
get wiped off the face of the planet Earth.

1109
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:34,140
You were Brendan Frazier's stunt double.

1110
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,780
No, you were in a whale 'cause you were a Pinocchio

1111
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,180
'cause you ain't a real boy.

1112
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,980
I'm a man.

1113
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,940
No, you're a puppet.

1114
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:41,780
You a donkey.

1115
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,060
I'm not a puppet, I'm not a donkey.

1116
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,100
Then who's my puppet master, pray tell?

1117
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,100
the U.S. government.

1118
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,100
Geppetto.

1119
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,100
The U.S. government.

1120
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,100
And Geppetto.

1121
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,100
And Geppetto.

1122
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,100
Who works for the U.S.

1123
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,100
Geppetto is still there.

1124
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,660
You can't get rid of Geppetto.

1125
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,660
I could get rid of him.

1126
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,660
He's old.

1127
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,660
One punch.

1128
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,660
You wouldn't get rid of Geppetto.

1129
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,660
Break all his teeth.

1130
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,660
You wouldn't get rid of Geppetto.

1131
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,660
That's your father.

1132
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,940
You guys are confusing me with another guy.

1133
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,460
You're a fat puppet.

1134
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,740
He's not a puppet.

1135
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,740
He's a marionette.

1136
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,740
Marionettes are puppets.

1137
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,740
Marionette is a type of puppet.

1138
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:11,740
No.

1139
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,300
And you're a big fat one.

1140
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
No.

1141
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,300
You're a 400-foot puppet.

1142
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,900
They have to use chains on you instead of strings.

1143
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,400
405 pounds is not that heavy. I can deadlift that.

1144
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,900
No, that's pretty heavy for a human puppet.

1145
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,200
I wish I was 405 pounds.

1146
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,900
You do?

1147
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,300
I think I'm going to get, I think I'm going to try to be 250 pounds in one year.

1148
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Yeah.

1149
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,300
I think I'm going to try to gain 70 pounds.

1150
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,100
That's all right.

1151
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,600
That's fine.

1152
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,500
Do you think I could do that?

1153
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,400
I mean, I don't want you to because,

1154
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,900
Why?

1155
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:45,200
Like, because I know, I know you're going to have to do like some kind of crazy diet to do that and we're going to have to sit

1156
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,320
here in the office and you're going to be walking in here eating like two whole rotisserie

1157
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,360
chickens and just like just stinking up the place with your fat.

1158
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,880
Do you think rotisserie chickens stink?

1159
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
I'm not going to get fat.

1160
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
No, I'm not getting fat.

1161
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,200
I'm going to get really strong.

1162
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,600
Yeah, but you're still going to be eating like crazy.

1163
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,120
You're going to be eating like Taco Bell wrapped in McDonald's.

1164
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,120
I did.

1165
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,120
Oh shit.

1166
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,120
Wait, that is...

1167
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Taco Bell wrapped in McDonald's?

1168
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
Stoner meal.

1169
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
I think that...

1170
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,120
Uber Eats should have a...

1171
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Stoner option.

1172
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,960
No, it should have, they should do a promotion.

1173
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,460
Do you want to stoner-fy it for $2?

1174
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,460
Where you mix and match any two fast foods.

1175
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,460
Uh-huh.

1176
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,460
You can do two orders.

1177
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,460
No, no, no, no, no.

1178
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,460
You can.

1179
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,460
You can, it's just morally wrong.

1180
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,460
No, no, no, no.

1181
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,460
They wrap it, they combine it together.

1182
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,460
Uh-huh.

1183
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,060
They put all the food, it's not like you're getting a Taco Bell and a Big Mac, a Taco Bell,

1184
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,060
you know what they sell.

1185
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,060
What do you mean wrap it?

1186
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,060
Do you want them to put it in a ball?

1187
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,060
They put it, they combine it all.

1188
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,060
They may, if you get...

1189
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,060
The cost would go way up.

1190
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,060
They'd have to hire chefs.

1191
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,060
So here's what you get.

1192
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,060
It's expensive.

1193
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,460
okay, it's a promotion. Here's what you get right and this is this. You order

1194
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,380
it's a it's a DNA combination, but it doesn't have DNA. It's just a

1195
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,900
combination. You get a crunch wrap and a big Mac. They put the crunch wrap into

1196
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,420
the big man. Here's my idea.

1197
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:03,380
Okay, okay, this is so it all goes in it all goes to the Uber eats like

1198
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,380
there's a like you know how they have like the getter building and like the

1199
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,020
like stuff like that. I live in a

1200
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,500
jet G. T. T. I. R. like that where they have like the it's basically like they

1201
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,900
are open building. They open they open these grocery stores just so the riders

1202
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,780
can go there. Yeah, it's like snacks only. So it's one of those right. One of

1203
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,340
those where the person goes to both Taco Bell and McDonald's. They take the

1204
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,620
their bike back to that spot and scientists combine it and then the chefs

1205
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,300
and the scientists see here's the foods already made. So the job of the

1206
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,000
you guys are just inventing a restaurant at this point, but

1207
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,020
it's a restaurant that only uses your Uber Eats order. One restaurant takes food that's already made by a

1208
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,660
chef and uses scientists to combine it. Exactly. Make one restaurant that does that. Well, here's the question.

1209
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:48,460
Do you consider God a chef? Yes. I would consider him more of a

1210
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,180
Lord. Okay, so if the Lord or the chef takes...

1211
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,700
Or if he makes fruits and he makes animals, these are already foods,

1212
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,940
y'all. So here's my... You think scientists are combining them? Okay, I think the

1213
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:08,880
I just want to throw this out there. I want to throw this out. We're saying Taco Bell

1214
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,660
and McDonald's, right? Yeah. So you get the ground beef from Taco Bell. McChicken Bell

1215
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:22,180
Grande. That's pretty good. Take the beef from Taco Bell, the seasoned beef. Uh-huh.

1216
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:28,860
The cheese and the buns from McDonald's. Yeah, keep going. The McSloppy Joe. Yup. They already

1217
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:33,000
did a bell beafer. What's a bell beafer? You don't know about the bell beafer? I don't know

1218
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,440
about the bell beafer. You don't know about the bell beafer? This is a real food item

1219
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,520
that my dad talks about every Thanksgiving. It was a Taco Bell sloppy joe? It was a Taco

1220
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:48,780
Bell sloppy joe. Oh my god. It was a Taco Bell meat sandwich. Wow. The bell beafer. The bell

1221
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,200
beafer. And they took it away and they also took away my dad's precious enchiladas. Well

1222
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,400
that would make sense. They're trying to slim the menu down. Trying to streamline it. Well

1223
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,800
with my science restaurant, you could make the Bell beef for custom with ingredients from

1224
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
different restaurants.

1225
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,640
You can already just get the Taco Bell meat.

1226
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, but are you guys going to join the class action lawsuit?

1227
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Where?

1228
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
With Taco Bell?

1229
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,720
I, buddy, I have a whole case.

1230
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:19,000
There is a class action lawsuit that has been filed against Taco Bell because they misrepresent

1231
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,880
the amount of meat that is in a Crunchwrap Supreme.

1232
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,600
Oh, I got to get that on that.

1233
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,960
I ate a Crunchwrap Supreme the day that I found this shit out. No meat at all.

1234
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Yeah.

1235
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,960
What did you order with beans?

1236
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,360
One corner of meat.

1237
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,360
Oh.

1238
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,840
I was going to say, yeah.

1239
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:38,080
Single corner. Hey, sour cream lovers, come on down to Taco Bell, get a Crunchwrap Supreme.

1240
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
I do love sour cream.

1241
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,080
Lettuce lovers, knock yourselves out.

1242
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,080
I do love lettuce.

1243
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:46,200
And if you don't like the sour cream, replace it with a different ingredient from a different

1244
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
restaurant.

1245
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,000
So now at Science Deluxe.

1246
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It should be called...

1247
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
That's a terrible name.

1248
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,280
so science deluxe. It should be called like uber deluxe uber super deluxe

1249
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:04,400
uber experiment ubers x uber experience. You can't suggest that. No, you're out

1250
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,440
of this. You didn't want to be a part of this venture like businesses, but okay,

1251
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,440
so it's it starts with it goes to the has to start with an x. What about just

1252
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:19,760
x.com uber experiment that would have worked a month ago, uber experimental

1253
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,520
experiment. It's experiment. Uber eats experiment. It doesn't have to be

1254
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:29,480
combinations, it could be anything you want to experiment with your food.

1255
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,080
You can order something and ask... So you get grocery store...

1256
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,280
Can you make it glow in the dark? You get grocery store ingredients,

1257
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,440
you get like Uber Eats, it's like, "Okay, I want like a porterhouse."

1258
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,440
Okay. And potatoes and asparagus. Yeah, see now we're... There's a private

1259
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,560
chef. Yeah. What I'm thinking of even... Well, that's a different business,

1260
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,840
that's Uber private chef. Okay, maybe this will fix the idea for you.

1261
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:53,560
maybe it's like a slot machine and it spins three food items from

1262
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:57,760
the wheel, but you already pay for it. It's like a get what you get. It's

1263
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,360
a flat rate. Yeah, it's like you pay $15 and whatever comes up. I know

1264
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,080
this is not a

1265
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:11,080
but it's the novelty of it. It's supposed to be a novelty thing. I

1266
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,120
think this is a great idea.

1267
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,680
I'm fine if they rig it. If it's $15 and they rig it... You can pay extra

1268
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,280
choose the item. If they rig it so that it's $20 to choose it. I think that even if you

1269
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,840
I think that they should add something to Uber Eats that is like you gamble you pay 15 bucks

1270
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:31,640
or whatever the price is that makes it like makes sense for them where they get a house

1271
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:39,080
edge you pay 15 bucks and you get an entree from a list of of restaurant and sometimes

1272
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:45,040
it's Taco Bell but sometimes it's it's a it's a Wolfgang Peter Luger Wolfgang Puck Wolfgang

1273
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:53,000
puck, salt bays restaurant. I might go to Fogo de Chao tomorrow. Solo? Solo Fogo? You

1274
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,040
might dolo Fogo? I was thinking about it. How are you going to get there, Blood? Bus?

1275
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:07,080
Wow. The Fogo bus? Here's something I found out. Take an hour and a half bus ride to Fogo

1276
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:14,380
de Chao. If you take the Q58 bus. I know how to get there. You take the Q58 bus all the

1277
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,160
way to the Queen Center Mall. I've taken the bus there before. They got an Olive Garden.

1278
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,800
They got a Chick-fil-A, they got an Olive Garden, they got a Fogarty Chow all right there.

1279
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,180
Is it an hour and a half really? No. It's less than an hour. I mean you could take the

1280
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:31,500
Q58 from here. There's a bus that goes straight from Central Park to my house. Oh yeah. It's

1281
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,500
amazing. I've seen that bus. Anytime I'm even close to there I just get on that shit. It's

1282
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:42,620
like a coach bus too. It's all comfortable and shit. I like the buses here. The buses

1283
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,660
here have chargers. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Hey, the rest of the country. Get on the level

1284
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:55,180
up Nashua, New Hampshire. You've got like five buses. Dice made a leap of logic in my

1285
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,700
brain, but Dunkin Donuts is releasing spiked coffee. Yeah. Did you see this? Like in a

1286
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:06,700
can in the store? They're doing the raspberry refresher, the iced tea, the cold brew, and

1287
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:11,820
then I would think like a regular Duncan. No, it's hot. They're all hot. They're all hot.

1288
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,820
you got to heat them up. I mean you have to get them from the they have to keep

1289
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:19,140
them in the rotisserie chicken area. Yeah, the history chicken area of

1290
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,620
Duncan is a grocery store. I mean, it's a, you know what? I think it rose

1291
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:27,660
history chicken from Duncan would be pretty good. I trust. I like all the

1292
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:32,940
food from Duncan. Yeah, Duncan's got good stuff for the disgust. Browns

1293
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,380
make me shit immediately. I think I'll get some Duncan Donuts in two weeks.

1294
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:37,780
Yeah,

1295
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,800
You're really planning out your meal. You're doing meal prep.

1296
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,300
So you're doing FOGO tomorrow.

1297
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,000
You're just gonna make dinner at home.

1298
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,720
These are all just lunches you're gonna get.

1299
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,260
You're getting FOGO.

1300
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,880
Duncan breakfast.

1301
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,300
OK.

1302
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,520
And I'm going to get it in Massachusetts.

1303
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,020
Oh, you're going to Massachusetts.

1304
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,860
That's why I said that.

1305
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:05,020
I haven't been home in probably since March.

1306
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:05,980
I haven't been back in a minute.

1307
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,820
Yeah, I've not been back since March.

1308
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,160
I haven't been back in North Carolina.

1309
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,760
I got to go to New Hampshire soon.

1310
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,520
Yeah, I'm going to be going to New Hampshire.

1311
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,120
I'm going to go to Manchester, Vegas, bro.

1312
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:16,840
I'm going to go to...

1313
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,720
I'm going to hit Plastow.

1314
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,360
I'm going to hit the Savers.

1315
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,640
I'm going to hit the Shoe Barn.

1316
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,720
The Plastow Savers is so good.

1317
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,120
Fire.

1318
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,600
I have to pee so bad.

1319
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,120
I saw a Tabuska shirt there.

1320
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,960
Pat, you're going to plug my dates while I pee.

1321
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,520
Okay.

1322
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:37,160
So on August 24th, Caleb will be going to prison.

1323
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,400
He'll be on Mars doing the Martian showcase.

1324
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,880
He'll be doing the Martian talent show.

1325
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,080
Just for Laughs Mars.

1326
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,760
Just for Laughs Mars trial.

1327
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,800
Yeah.

1328
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,680
And then he will be going to then.

1329
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:53,560
Yeah, I think it's just the 24th through the 26th.

1330
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,440
He will be in DC and he's going to go.

1331
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,800
No, he's not going to do that.

1332
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,080
No, you will not do that anymore.

1333
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,080
I am gonna do some stand up.

1334
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,080
It's going to sing that on stage.

1335
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Y'all bring the memes back.

1336
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Y'all, if you, okay, if you go to see Caleb open for Adam Friedland in DC, you got to do WWE style printouts of memes.

1337
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,080
And you got to hold them up and show him while he's performing.

1338
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,080
Tell him that you liked his funny tweet about dying and you can't believe he's alive.

1339
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:36,080
You can't believe he's alive. Print out photos of his tweets and show them to him while he's on stage.

1340
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,080
on stage.

1341
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,620
He's a meme and do right shit on your forehead.

1342
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:44,720
I heart laughing at live comedy on your forehead.

1343
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:51,180
I heart Caleb's set.

1344
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:56,280
If you're bald and you do that, Cameron and I will send you $25 each.

1345
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,560
I'll commit to that.

1346
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:58,760
I'll commit to that too.

1347
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,760
If you're a bald guy, we will give you 50 bucks.

1348
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,200
But unless you actually do it, and then I'm going to wiggle my way out of it.

1349
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,560
And then we will figure out a legal way to not have to pay you.

1350
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,840
I'm not paying you $25 for anything.

1351
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,520
Because, okay, you have to be naturally bald.

1352
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,520
What time is it?

1353
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,400
It's probably time for you to go to the doctor.

1354
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
It's 1219.

1355
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,400
I gotta go.

1356
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,400
Okay.

1357
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Alright, bye everybody.

1358
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,400
You can, I'll just, I'll keep going.

1359
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:28,320
Okay, what else can we, okay, so if you're, you have to be naturally bald.

1360
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,080
You can't like shave your head the week before.

1361
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:36,920
Like you got to like prove that there was like you were on the Norwood scale at some point.

1362
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:43,400
You got to prove that your like hair is like thinning as fuck and like stuff like that.

1363
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:52,520
And I guess maybe like there could be, no it still has to say I heart Caleb's set.

1364
01:04:52,520 --> 01:05:00,280
I guess I'll just I'll come right out and say it. We started a law firm.

1365
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,720
