57
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,760
release together okay I contribute to the show you'd be a great clip show host

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,720
honest oh yeah I would yeah that is your that is your perfect placement it's it's

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,280
I was saying that when we did the stream like it's good that Patrick is the one

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,760
with face cam because he's you laugh - you laugh hard and you he laughs hard he

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,280
holds his nose like a pig he does he like there's always it always seems like

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,780
you're about to have something come out of your nose when you laugh mm-hmm

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,280
it's because you always have milk in your mouth yeah I don't want the milk to

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,200
shoot out yeah so you always like funny little teeth so when you smile it's

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,960
really like I don't have really good little teeth and like a really stupid

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,400
nose and like really funny eyes I don't have big and fat and so when you laugh

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,320
it's like really awesome to look at is what we're saying if I was on face cam

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,760
It would just be me staring into the camera without moving my face at all.

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,960
Which is why I'm glad that we just sit there just like...

70
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,560
Yeah, we were on a Zoom call the other day and we did not know that Cam was frozen for like 10 minutes.

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
Yeah, Cam was frozen and he's just sitting there like...

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
Sometimes he's just still for a long time.

73
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,200
He was so vacant we didn't know what the fuck was going on.

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
We didn't even notice he didn't blink.

75
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Yeah.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,780
I like to think about what I'm gonna say next you know and I need to sit there you

77
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,640
need to sit there and create 1,000 small worlds in your mind yeah I'm running

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,960
simulations destroy them I'm basically like what will happen a hundred years

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,920
from now if I say this joke that I'm about to say Cameron I just tried to do

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,960
that as a joke to see how long it would take for me you to notice and I like my

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,560
hands started to shake I can't wait you tried right in I tried yeah I was trying

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,320
to try to sit still for half a second I know my fucking hands started shaking

83
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,400
you might have like ALS I don't have I think you might have ALS you might have

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,520
Lou Gehrig's disease no you are never gonna play baseball that would be

85

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,480

89
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,800
you're like a yeah if I ever got back you're like a car to you're like a

90
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,600
cartoon like cereal mascot just like jumping around the frame of the screen

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,280
oh it's shaky the shrew yeah in every every I am the least like a shrew I'd be

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,160
more like a boar or something I'd be like every cereal mascot is either either

93
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
protecting or trying to get the cereal yeah they're never just so is everybody

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,800
in life they're never enjoying the supermarket people are protecting everyone

95
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,960
else is trying to eat the cereal. That's a really good point.

96
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:12,200
What about Toucan Sam? It's basically Toucan Sam's just an uncle trying to be nice to his kids.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,120
Those are his nephews dude. Yeah I said he was an uncle.

98
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,560
And then you said his kids. Well their parents died and he took them in.

99
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,160
He's a foster father.

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
They're birds.

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,120
Yeah, that's just - he's not the foster father, he's the father who fostered.

102
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Fostered.

103
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,160
He's the father who fostered their youth.

104
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Yeah.

105
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh my God, dude.

What do you think, me?

110
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
What do you think?

111
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Why would I be talking about you?

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, Caleb's been keeping track.

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Why would I know when the last time -

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,180
the last time. - Caleb, you've been out three weeks.

115
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,740
- This is three weeks. - That's three weeks.

116
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,000
- Patrick, Caleb, three extremely powerful--

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
- This took me three days. - I always thought,

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,840
I thought that I was like insecure about how slow

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,120
I grew facial hair until I met you, Caleb.

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,320
- Yeah, I'm not insecure about it.

121
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,040
I grow it very fast and it's very thick and strong.

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,800
- I know, I'm saying you saved me from being,

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
I didn't say you were insecure.

124
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,120
I said you saved me from being insecure.

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,200
- I have an amazing-- - Yeah.

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,480
- You, if there's one thing-- - I look at you--

127
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,840
- If there's one thing I know about Caleb,

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
He's great at growing hair.

129
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,040
Yeah, it's true.

130
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
I look at you and it's like, it's like, I'm like an I'm like an

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,140
ape.

132
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,640
It's like it's looking at you is like looking into a radioactive

133
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,240
mirror.

134
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,540
You know that's not true.

135
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,640
I do look like I do look like a radioactive mirror that you've

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,940
been looking into every day for a year.

137
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,640
I look like white doctor Manhattan.

138
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,940
You look like a porcupine without lopecia.

139
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,540
I don't look like a porcupine.

140
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,740
You look like a porcupine.

141
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,140
Take that back to Caleb.

142
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,340
Caleb looks like a porcupine.

143
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:57,140
like my uncle with alopecia. I am two eyebrows away from looking like my

144
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:07,700
alopecia uncle. Damn. Maybe I should just go uncle Matt mode. I should just pop him off, just shave my whole body

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,620
every day. Just wake up be like all right dry cereal for breakfast and think about

146
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,060
ghosts I guess that's what I'll do I look like a you it's like a ghost newspaper

147
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,500

148
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,140

149
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:37,020
the path you have you you suck I'm getting discord notifications to

150
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,700
distracted. It's from your brother. It's not from my brother. Yeah it is. It's from Levi.

151
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,740
No it's not from him. It's from Levi. I got the same ones. No you didn't.

152
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,420
My Uncle Matt has a ghost hunting newspaper that he reads in the mornings.

153
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:58,460
Pretty cool. You already said that. Yeah I just thought. Can we get a new detail on it?

154
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:06,620
Yeah it's yellow. What is? It's see-through. It's not see-through. It's not a dead

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,620
newspapers go yellow? I basically have a yellow uncle. Your uncle is Matt Groening.

156
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,620
You want to try that last syllable again big guy? Isn't it? Excuse me? Isn't that how you say it?

157
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,620
Oh this is gonna be a fucking Zamas thing. Try it again. No try it again. No go ahead.

158
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,620
No this is way worse than Zamas already. Oh. This is a lot worse than Zamas immediately. Matt Groening.

159
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,500
that's better yeah okay that's a little less I mean it's definitely so far from

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,460
what how you say his name which is graining yeah but a graining it's yeah

161
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,220
it's raining it's like Boehner no I've been saying it wrong this whole time

162
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,220
yeah I'm definitely gonna believe our pronunciation of how you said his name

163

181
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,940
for having dyslexia. That was Bill Maher's defense too. That was Papa John's defense.

182
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:18,460
I'm bad at reading. Because the Republicans won't fund the public schools.

183
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,620
The Republicans gave me dyslexia and that's why I said that. Yeah he misread

184
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:33,620
new rule into the entire sentence I'm a

185
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,820
house new rule that was what he was

186
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,220
trying to say you're right I'm saying

187
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,220
you it said new rule and he said I'm a

188
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,780
house oh gosh he said he's a house yeah

189
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,660
then the other was just that was just a

190
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,740
coincidence he just added that on that

191
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,980
emphasis uh-huh he was just doing like

192
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,580
an ad that wasn't even part of the

193
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:01,540
misreading yeah yeah Bill Maher would be funny if they um it would be funny if

194
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,140
they like to save like Bill Maher's like ass they like cut that one part out like

195
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,860
him saying the n-word so he's like senator I'm a house what it's just a

196
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:21,500
joke and everybody and it gets in more trouble for making a joke that makes no

197
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,180
sense. What the fuck is his show even doing anymore? The writers don't care.

198
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:35,500
It doesn't make sense dude. Is he paying a mortgage on that? People are mad because he's not paying

199
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,340
like taxes on himself being a house. Yeah he's technically a house.

200
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,740
That's how yeah that's how that's the new. Yeah more like Bill Manner am I right?

201
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:52,420
Oh my god! He is a house, you were right.

202
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,820
Yeah. And Matt Groening is... What is Matt Groening, Patrick?

203
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,540
Come on. I'm just asking, just tell me what he is.

204
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,540
What, what, what, what is great...

205
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,540
He's just struggling now. He's just gasping for air.

206
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,960
- I'm afraid to say any word that ends in -ing from now on.

207
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,220
(laughing)

208
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,780
- Oh, it does end in -ing.

209
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,700
Dude, I do have fucking dyslexia, Jesus Christ.

210
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,020
- You didn't believe us?

211
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,780
- You thought we were joking?

212
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,620
- No, this--

213
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,820
- You thought we were just fucking with you?

214
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,660
- No, this whole time--

215
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,580
- And that his name was the N word?

216
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,880
- This whole time, I didn't know

217
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,060
there was another N in his name.

218
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,540
- Damn, dude.

219
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,380
- Wow.

220
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,000
- At what point, how many--

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
How many times have I said his name?

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's my question, yeah.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And how many pe- you really gotta think about the company you keep

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
that nobody ever corrected you on that or Samus.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've been saying it around you guys!

like, zero in on that exact syllable.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So I think he would've noticed.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I think he would've smelled that out if you had said it around us.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is my Mandela effect.

233

Can we take it to another level?

240
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
- Absolutely not, no. - Can somebody say that it--

241
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,520
- No, not a chance. - Can somebody say

242
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,040
they wish they could imagine how it feels on their lips?

243
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,360
- I wish I could imagine how it would look behind bars.

244
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,520
- Caleb, I wish I could give you some of that.

245
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,040
- I would look like a pedophile if I was in jail.

246
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,880
- I wish I could give you more of my hair.

247
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400

- No, I don't.

249
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,760
I look like a child out of jail.

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,600
What'd you say?

251
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,160
- I wish I could give you more of my hair, man.

252
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,040
- I wish you could too.

253
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,880
Where would you-- - I got so much.

254
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,480
much. If you could give up hair and give it to me

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,080
locks for love donation style. It's so crazy. Where would you take it from?

256
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,520
Um, oh I have like too much chest hair now. That'd be funny if you just had it like

257
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,480
an exact like circle out of your chest that would fit my head like a glove.

258
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,120
Yeah. Just like a circle of hair that is just gone now because it's all on my

259
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,280
head. And it's like it looks exactly like your hair when I met you. Yeah exactly.

260
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
My hair looks good.

261
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,120
I have beautiful hair.

262
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
There's no weird angles to it.

263
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,760
It grows really thick and full too.

264
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Yeah.

265
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,760
You're full of crap.

266
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Yeah thick and full.

267
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
My hair's not full of crap.

268
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,760
It's called fertilizer.

269
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm trying to make it grow better.

270
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,280
It's like a chia pet but you have to put something on it.

271
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,080
God, dude, how many fucking times in my life have I been saying it like that?

272
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,720
That's how my brother says it I think.

273
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,800
That's how my family says it.

274
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,480
I think it's a New Hampshire accent thing.

275
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,280
Yeah, the New Hampshire accent is

276
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
who does who put the N word into things.

277
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,600
(laughing)

278
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,000
That is, yeah, that is true, yeah.

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,240
Yeah.

280
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,920
Damn, dude.

281
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,740
God.

282
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm trying to think of what words I've ever said wrong.

283
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
I've never said a word wrong.

284
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,960
You know, it's hard because I say everything pretty correct

285
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,440
because I'm very smart, you know?

286
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
I realize I say most things wrong.

287
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,760
There's one word I know that you say really funny

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,600
every time. Pen.

289
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,440
Pen.

290
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
- Pen and Ben.

291
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,100
- Oh, what is it?

292
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,940
- I use-- - Pen?

293
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,780
- No, no, I know that one,

294
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,600
but there's a specific one I'm thinking of.

295
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,860
- Mayim, can I get a pen, bro?

296
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,140

- Pen. - Pen.

298
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,460

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,580
- There is, I know what you're talking about.

304
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,820
- There's one really funny one.

305
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,500
- Yeah, I don't say anything funny.

306
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,340
Not true.

307
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,300
- Yeah, oh my God.

I don't know what.

370
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
But he looks like something.

371
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Hey, hey, really good one, Pat.

372
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Yeah, that's funny.

373
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
That was a good one.

374
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,720
comedy was. You just go up on stage and you're like...

375
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Women and men are so different. It's sometimes women are uh...

376
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
They do something.

377
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,840
You know I can't really think of it right now but it's like there's almost a very funny

378
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,720
difference between the two, you know?

379
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
That...

380
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I don't know, you sir, where are you from? What's that, Indiana? Oh man.

381
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
They got something there.

382
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
There's something funny about this.

383
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,220
There's something hilarious going on there.

384
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,720
They got some funny crap going on there. I can't talk about it right now.

385
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,720
Basically they're saying dirty words you can't say on television and they... and uh...

386
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,480
You know what y'all can come up with them. I don't have to do so Donald Trump is in the news

387
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Something so something or other I don't even know who that guy is, but I'm sure you guys there's probably a joke about it

388
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,800
I was eating lunch the other day, and I can't even I don't remember what happened, but I remember laughing at the time

389
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,640
So this family this family walks into a talent agent's office

390
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,240
No some crap

391
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Something they're like

392
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,040
They do something that guy right there

393
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,680
In the front row he's something I don't know what you know, they would they would have done something

394
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:57,640
Kramer still gets like

395
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:03,400
Yeah, I'm video from the laugh factory

396
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,680
Kramer cannot remember his racist rant. As Kramer says the name of the creator of

397
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,840
The Simpsons. Oh come on I'm not gonna fucking live that down ever. No neither did he.

398
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,600
Let me know and I'll bleep it out. That's all I guess. I guess you have to.

399
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,920
If you bleep it out we want you to know not only did Patrick spell out the full N-word.

400
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,640
He said it and he said it get this in a Jamaican accent. So there's different

401
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,200
If it's bleeped out, that's what happened there.

402
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,160
- I think it's so much funnier if it's bleeped out.

403
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
- I, why don't we just get a clean take?

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,640
- And it's also less incriminating.

405
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,040
- Why don't we get a clean take of me saying it?

406
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,440
- A clean take of me saying that n-word.

407
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,280
- Okay.

408
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,120
- Yeah, go ahead.

409
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,200
- All right, and slate.

410
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,040
- We'll bleep this out.

411
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,640
(laughing)

412
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,200
- We need something to bleep out.

413
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,040
- Yeah.

414
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
- Somebody say something that we can bleep

415
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,600
out of the episode, please.

416
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,440
- Uh.

417
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,480
(groaning)

418
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,020
- We're having so much fun.

419
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,120
- I hit my death vape.

420
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,000
I have a Cameron story today.

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,840
- You hit it just now?

422
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,680
- No, yesterday.

423
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
My first Cameron story ever.

424
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,560
- Wow. - A lot of Cameron stories.

425
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,400
- Yeah, yesterday.

426
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,440
- A few of those are rare.

427
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,020
These are, yeah.

428
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,520
- I have, I had this vape that I got in LA

429
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,960
that every time I hit it, even once,

430
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
makes me completely just freak out.

431
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,140
Like I would just, I would hit it every single day in LA,

432
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,900
every night, and I would just lie in bed

433
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,180
and like just be like I'm never gonna be happy again

434
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,100
and just fall asleep.

435
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,940
(laughing)

436
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,780
And so.

437
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,580
- That's the worst, wait, that's the worst

438
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,380
when you smoke so much weed that you think for a second

439
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,580
you're like I've unlocked something wrong in my brain.

440
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,420
- Yeah.

441
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,140
- You get so high that you're like I have just unlocked

442
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,960
a secret thought and knowledge pattern

443
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,660
that will destroy my normal life.

444
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,620
- Yeah, so that would happen to me literally

445
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,180
from one hit from this vape pen.

446
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,580
And I did it every night and then I stopped for like a year

447
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,620
And then I found it again, I found the pen again,

448
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,900
but it had been in my super hot room without AC,

449
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,020
so I thought it was fucked up, I thought it was broken.

450
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,940
So I was trying to get it to work the other night,

451
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,860
and then it wasn't working.

452
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,380
And then yesterday I was just like,

453
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,420
oh, I wonder if it's working, and I just wasn't thinking,

454
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,020
I just assumed it wasn't, and I just took

455
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,900
the biggest fucking hit I've ever taken from it by accident.

456
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,740
'Cause I was just--

457
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,820
- You big milky cloud.

458
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
- Yeah, and I just instantly started panicking,

459
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,700
'cause I was like, oh shit, oh fuck.

460
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,260
And I just lay down on my bed--

461
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
- That's the worst.

462
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,740
That's the worst when you get accidentally high.

463
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,500
- Yeah, no, that's what made it so bad is because I wasn't expecting, I wasn't prepared.

464
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,500
It was the middle of the day.

465
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,420
I always do it at night because then it's like if I start freaking out, I can just go

466
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,420
to sleep.

467
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,660
But, yeah, I was just lying on my bed looking at the ceiling and just like I started thinking

468
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,220
to myself just like I should be normal.

469
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,980
I should be normal, normal, normal.

470
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,180
I was like, what am I?

471
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,940
I had this moment of clarity where I was like I'm just thinking the word normal to myself

472
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
over and over.

473
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,340
I have to put an end to this.

474
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,980
So I was just then I was just listening to the new M.U.R.E. album really loud and lying

475
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,280
on my bed and then I was like I have to turn off this music because I won't be able to

476
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,980
hear if anyone's sneaking up on me.

477
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,780
Dude, I don't I will never understand how people smoke weed.

478
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,780
So yeah.

479
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,780
So yeah.

480
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,860
Then I turned off the music and I just lay down for like an hour or two and then when

481
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,060
I was getting up to leave my room I was like super dizzy because I had just been lying

482
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,100
down and super high and I was like

483
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,940
walking out of my room and the door to

484
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,220
my room slammed shut behind me like I

485
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,260
just let it go in a slam shut right as I

486
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,140
got super dizzy and I was like oh my god

487
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,860
I just got shot

488
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:47,860
there was a super loud bang behind me and I just instantly felt like I was gonna pass out

489
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,100
what you thought you got shot you are not

490
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,580
that you are smoking fucking

491
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,940
Cameron you can't that's k2 or something

492
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,340
- That is not weed, dude.

493
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
- Yeah, you're smoking demon stuff.

494
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,960
- And you think you were shot by a sniper?

495
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,440
- I just think that in general, though.

496
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,840
I would think that normally.

497
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,880
- I would say sometimes I will--

498
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,540
- That was when I wasn't as high anymore,

499
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,560
I'll just add that.

500
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,160
That's just me.

501
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
- That's just you normal.

502
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,160
- But if you're just walking around

503
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
and you heard a really loud bang,

504
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and then you felt like you're about to fall over,

505
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
all of a sudden.

506
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
- I do feel like every time I look at somebody

507
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
and I have food on my face or something,

508
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,320
and I can tell that they're looking at my face weird,

509
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,280
I do think for a second, like,

510
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,640
I have been shot in the head and I have not noticed yet.

511
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,840
- Yeah, it's a reasonable thought.

512
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,980
- You know, yeah, I feel like it's pretty reasonable.

513
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,440
Just like, you're gonna be like,

514
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
wouldn't that be the worst if you're laughing?

515
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
- You didn't know. - I mean, it is

516
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,640
the same feeling as having mustard on your face.

517
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,880
If you look at somebody and you have a giant hole

518
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,720
in your head and you're like--

519
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,160
- And your brain's still working.

520
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,800
- Yeah, this person's looking at me so weird

521
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,560
and they don't wanna say anything.

522
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,880
Yeah, that would be, that's a nightmare way to go out.

523
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Fucking, I, I straight up, I smoked weed for like a month.

524
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,200
Straight up. Straight up.

525
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,540
I straight up.

526
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,240
I smoked weed for like three months this year.

527
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,360
Like you guys-- That's pretty sick.

528
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,120
Yeah, I remember it was one of the worst three months

529
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
of our friendship. Yeah, yeah.

530
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,840
It's not even close.

531
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,160
I don't, I wasn't even like--

532
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,040
Patrick was coming on the podcast,

533
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,840
just putting up, just laying eggs every single week.

534
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,060
Dude, I didn't even know what the fuck I was doing.

535
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,500
like most of the February episodes I'm just kind of like out of it.

536
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
You're asleep yeah.

537
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,780
Yeah I'm like not doing anything.

538
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,300
That was just that wasn't just the episodes too.

539
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,660
That was just how you were.

540
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
Right?

541
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,300
You'd be awake for like six hours a day and we had to catch him during that.

542
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,540
We would cancel episodes because he would not be awake when I said we were recording.

543
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,540
Yeah.

544
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,220
It was awesome dude and then he woke up from that and now he can't read anymore.

545
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
I yeah.

546
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,720
Yeah.

547
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
[laughs]

548
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,220
Yeah.

549
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,520
Dude, I can't fucking read any-

550
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,920
I- losing- losing that vape pen

551
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,520
before

552
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,320
New York kind of saved me.

553
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,620
Oh, yeah, dude.

554
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,520
You would be-

555
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,820
You would be in

556
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,620
Guantanamo Bay right now.

557
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,420
Dude, I would be- I don't even know.

558
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,020
I, like-

559
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Or you would- you might be like a-

560
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,420
like famous if you would come smoking.

561
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,920
Yeah.

562
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Maybe.

563
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,420
Maybe that was it.

564
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,120
You might be like a Brad Pitt-style movie star.

565
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
No, you would be like one of those, um,

566
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,680
people on tik-tok that everyone thinks they find and post a post a video to

567
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,600
Twitter of go look at this insane guy I just found but it has like a hundred

568
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,760
thousand views and it's somebody doing something on purpose - yeah oh my god

569
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,920

571
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,960
making out with your cat I mean I there have been times when I've smoked weed

572
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,280
and thought that my dog could read my thoughts.

573
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,120
- Yeah? - Yeah.

574
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,960
- Yeah.

575
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,440
- Pretty, I would say every third or fourth time,

576
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,360
I would sit next to my dog and be like,

577
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,840
we are, I can feel you.

578
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,680
- Yeah.

579
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,840
- And then I fuck my dog.

580
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,960
(laughing)

581
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,600
And it's pretty simple.

582
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,880
- Have I told the story of my 18th birthday?

583
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
- Yeah, I don't know,

584
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
I don't really like smoking weed anymore.

585
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
I feel like every time I smoke it, I fuck my dog.

586
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
(laughing)

587
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,760
It's just kind of, I don't know.

588
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,600
- No, you just have to try a different--

589
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,520
- I just, I react to weed in a weird way.

590
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:25,800
sometimes Caleb you just have to try a strain other than dog pussy now it sucks

591
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,260
cuz now I get like brain fog and I get dog on my penis and my neighbor's dog is

592
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,360
coming over now and it's like oh I fuck him yeah it's like well you know yeah

593
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:43,280
it's hard having to clean the jacuzzi every other night is when I come over

594
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,280
and watch my roommate fuck the dogs in the jacuzzi dude he gets high every night

595
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,960
we have a jacuzzi in our one-bedroom apartment that we share

596
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,560
it's pretty sick dude I heard somebody the other day talking about how

597
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,760
they go jacuzzi-ing which is when they go over to their neighbor's house and

598
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,600
drink two Heineken's and sit in the jacuzzi

599
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,320
They live in Idaho and I was like yeah that's probably that's like a sport over there.

600
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
That's a night out.

601
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,360
Yeah that's in the Olympics.

602
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
That's like the biggest thing ever.

603
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Yeah.

604
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah.

605
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,440
Dude my 18th my 18th birthday I smoked too much weed.

606
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,080
I was also on Adderall at the time so it was a mix of Adderall weed and just like I chain

607
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,560
smoked cigarettes because I thought like this is gonna make me feel normal.

608
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,100
If I just smoke a whole pack of Camel Blues right now.

609
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,480
When you're like yeah I'm feeling like so high or drunk I'll smoke cigarettes until I

610
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,480
have to vomit.

611
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Yeah.

612
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
For some reason fix it.

613
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,000
I smoked a whole pack of Camel Blues because I was like well I'm 18 I can buy these now

614
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,160
and I walked around the beach for like an hour and everyone was like Pat you look like

615
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,240
complete, you look like a ghost.

616
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,800
What is going on?

617
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:11,880
And I walked away from everybody and they say I fell down and it looked like I got shot

618
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
by a sniper.

619
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:22,000
And I was in front of a family at Hampton Beach and they saw me dig a hole in the ground and

620
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,280
just projectile vomit into the hole and then get up and run away.

621
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,800
with every single every time you guys say you make it you make it clear how normal

622
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,200
it is to think you've been shot by a sniper well I'm thinking now how funny

623
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:52,640
it would be to just see like a random teenager get shot by a kid just you're

624
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,280
trying to watch the fireworks and then you're like was that a firework yeah and

Yeah, not a bad idea.

643
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Yeah, I think if I get any thinner,

644
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,080
then I lose my--

645
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,120
Then you'll just waste away.

646
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,360
Yeah, I'll waste away.

647
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,400
I don't think I can--

648
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
You think you lose what?

649
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,920
You think you lose the John Candy thing?

650
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,000
I'll lose my John Candy thing.

651
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,880
Yeah.

652
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,720
It's not funny--

653
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,280
You're such a natural fat guy talent.

654
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,520
It's not funny to see a skinny guy fall down.

655
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,160
Yeah, that's true.

656
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
That's very true.

657
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,880
You don't fall down that often though.

658
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
I do.

659
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Yeah he does.

660
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
That's his whole thing.

661
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,200
He pretends to walk into doors and stuff.

662
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Oh yeah.

663
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,080
That's like his thing.

664
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,160
But no Chevy Chase did that.

665
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Chevy Chase got fat.

666
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,200
Chevy Chase got fucking nothing on me.

667
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,760
I'm funnier than Chevy Chase.

668
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:09,080
You also, you guys both said the N word on set of a show now.

669
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,720

686
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,760
Cuckoo kangaroos. Cuckoo kangaroos? No. We're going to develop a video game called Cuckoo Kangaroos.

687
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,320
You won't develop anything. You don't have any sort of knowledge. Cuckoo kangaroos versus the hungry hamster.

688
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,360
Cuckoo kangaroos versus the hungry hamster. You don't know anything about unity.

689
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,040
Okay let's beat it out. Let's go. Alright. Alright. It starts out.

690

701
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,600
to be from the south like Caleb is no and then so you keep stirring it and he

702

00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,320
game still yes the first cutscene he kills him in the first cutscene then and

710
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:09,400

722
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,440
he plead and it's that and it's a typing game and he's the host of it and I

723
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,040
really got to guess what it is yeah I wonder how many different you have ADHD

724
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,040
and dyslexia at what point do you just say I'm disabled how many different

725
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:41,660
things I physically I disabilities no I believe in you believe that you believe

726
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,400
in people with learning you believe people with learning disabilities aren't

727
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,240
disabled I wouldn't call myself this we should get you I would call myself

728
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:56,120
differently and walk around school scooter that we're gonna roll you around

729
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,720
we're gonna give you a little I don't like guys to push me from twisted metal

730
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,700
We're gonna roll you around Urban Outfitters and when people will say stop you're destroying all the dr. Dre chronic

731
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:12,680
Vinyls, you're destroying all the Japanese office t-shirts. Yeah, you don't understand he has dyslexia

732
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm sorry. Oh, you can't read the shirts cuz they're in Japanese. Yeah. Yeah, I have dyslexia

733
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
I can't read Japanese

734
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,920
Actually dyslexia means that you read you have a Japanese brain and you can read Japanese perfectly

735
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,300
You can read any sort of kaiju perfectly just that was a

736
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:40,940
That was the thing in Percy Jackson. You guys have read the Percy Jackson books. They said that I did a Cameron

737
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,020
I've never read a fucking all right well

738
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,080
Then let me talk about it you watch a video for a few minutes

739
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,840
And you just well with the adults talk about reading you just kind of chill out all right

740
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,900
Yeah, get yourself a little a bowl of ice cream. I've read I've read books before you very hard

741
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,260
I read oh if you wanted

742
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,160
- The worst, have you ever read the novelization of Trainspotting?

743
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,160
- No.

744
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,000
- Isn't it, I don't think it's, is it a novelization or was it based on a book?

745
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
- It's not, not the novelization.

746
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I, yeah, it was based off the book.

747
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I have a copy.

748
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,640
- You read the novelization though.

749
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,680
You read, they wrote another book that was based on the movie that was based on the book.

750
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
- They printed the cover.

751
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
- And then a movie and then a book on the book.

752
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,880
- You read the junior novelization of Trainspotting.

753
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,960
- I read the spark notes of Trainspotting.

754
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,120
- You read, it was, you know, like the, that graphic novel, novel Bible.

755
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,880
You read that but for Trainspotting.

756
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,040
I but it's all written in Scottish slang.

757
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,240
So, dude, I had the fucking hardest time.

758
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,360
- That's why you are dyslexic.

759
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
It's because you read that and you were like,

760
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
this is correct.

761
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,200
- This, all of this makes sense to me.

762
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,200
- You had to move your brain in such a way

763
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,840
that it was accustomed to Scottish slang.

764
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,200
And now English makes no sense to you.

765
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,460
- No, nothing makes, I can't fucking read.

766
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,840
That's all right, dude.

767
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,440
I can't read numbers either.

768
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,800
- You can't read a number?

769
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,440
- No, like if it's higher than like a thousand,

770
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,040
my brain short circuits, it's really hard.

771
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,680
I couldn't read numbers in the hundred thousands

772
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,840
if they didn't have like, if it wasn't like 900,000,

773
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,960
like 99,000.

774
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,080
- Patrick's still telling on himself.

775
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,680
- It's called dyscalculia.

776
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,200
- Oh yeah, I think someone I know has that too.

777
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,040
- Yeah.

778
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,860
- It's you.

779
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,720
- It's me, it's probably me.

780
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,840
- Dude, that was the fucking worst.

781
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,000
I worked at a Clover and I had to have the belt

782
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
with all the change in it.

783
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,840
- Yeah, it sucks all their items.

784
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
- You hit you with the belt

785
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,160
when you couldn't read the numbers.

786
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,240
- I hit me with the belt 'cause I couldn't read.

787
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,920
- All their menu items are 10 digit numbers.

788
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,760
- Yeah.

789
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,580
(laughing)

790
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,200
- That's a huge bummer.

791
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,040
- Yeah, I was like, oh my God.

792
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,080
- I was like, a one billion,

793
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,920
- It's 'cause it's a math.

794
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,600
- 156,346,231.

795
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,080
- It's 'cause it's a math restaurant.

796
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:51,920
- It's 'cause it's a lab.

797
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,760
- Yeah.

798
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,580
- It's 'cause it's a food lab.

799
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,420
- Can I get that again?

800
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,420
to do an equation to tell you what the meal is.

801
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,340
- Your total is hello.

802
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,820
Oh, I'm sorry, I was reading that upside down, guys.

803
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,400
I have dyscalculia.

804
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,020
(laughing)

805
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:06,860
- Yeah, your total is boots.

806
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:09,360
- It's actually 11.34, my bad.

807
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,220
- Hey, that's my bad, bro.

808
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah, but I'm pretty much a math genius

809
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,120
and I've never had any sort of problem in my life, so.

810
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,780
I don't know, maybe I just don't get it.

811
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,620
Yeah, super, super smart.

812
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,500
you don't you'll never understand I think is I'm not cuckoo and I'm actually

813
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:37,020
really normal kangaroo no I think it's a it's brave of me every day to breathe

814
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:44,940
I'm brave to be dyslexic it's very brave of you to continue to exist mm-hmm it'd

815
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,660
be funny if you like had it would explain a lot if you had like like a

816
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:55,120
a Rain Man type ability to like read the ingredients on like the back of a 7-Eleven

817
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,700
sandwich perfectly though. Like everything else you just can't even,

818
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,800
might as well not even try. As soon as you see an Italian job.

819
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,960
It's his abilities knowing all the YouTube videos from 2009.

820
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,560
Just every single thing that was uploaded in that year. He knows all the URLs.

821
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,600
The demonic sex videos.

822
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
That's true.

823
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:22,740
I do have - in high school I used to have a keyboard shortcut that was just the whole

824
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:28,340
DemoniusXFleshlight video transcribed and every time I would send it to people it would crash

825
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,340
my phone.

826
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,340
It was awesome.

827
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Nice.

828
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,560
Was it an auto fill for like if you type V or something?

like I'm so excited watching this little girl do the splits oh that's weird I

859
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,680
mean no no that is worse than that it's like yeah no it's like I'm watching

860
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,980
these little girls do the splits I should be in prison yeah that was one of them

861
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:20,100
what the fuck is wrong with you lady yeah and then all the other people defending

862
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,100
her were like no she's just making fun jokes about the show toddlers and tiaras

863
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,580
she's saying that the people who make the show should be in prison yeah yeah

864
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:33,680
it's the it's the Robert Downey jr. Tropic Thunder defense yeah like no you

865
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,400
don't she's a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude exactly that

866
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,920
what she should have said. Once she said I should be in prison she was using the

867
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,160
royal I which means the creators of toddlers and tiaras. The royal I because

868
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:51,480
she thinks that Prince Andrew should be in prison because he was actually involved.

869
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:57,320
She's been saying this forever she's on your side. She was ahead of the curve okay and if

870
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:03,480
you doubt her you're in the CIA mm-hmm she's in the CIA we should just join the

871
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,840
Do you think the CIA would take us as ops?

872
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
That would be so cool if it were coming out.

873
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
The CIA would take...

874
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,840
Wouldn't it be funny if like, I mean just like right now though.

875
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,120
The CIA would only take Cameron, let's be honest.

876
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,120
They would not take me.

877
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
They would not take me.

878
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Dude, I don't know, I...

879
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
They would not take you, you're too...

880
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,880
Dude, that's why Caleb would be the perfect op, because he's gotten in enough trouble

881
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,680
with them that people wouldn't suspect him.

882
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
I think, yeah, I mean...

883
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,800
I think they would take everybody but me.

884
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,560
I don't think I have any talents to give the CIA.

885
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,200
I have a perfect body for Krav Maga.

886
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,640
true I think they would see me and they would see they would see a Spartan 117

887
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,560
They would see your powerful kangaroo leg muscles and go this is the guy who can jump all around everyone

888
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,880
They're gonna turn me into an Israeli Spartan and I think I would do really well as that

889
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,880
My CIA handlers talking to me like Patrick we need you to go over to Yemen

890
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,320
and we need you to keep this this food shortage we need you to keep the famine going

891
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:05,680
Anything you see, grab it. And no sharing. No sharing. No splitsies. No splitsies. And you're like, not a problem.

892
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,160
Yeah, and you go to the wrong country. You misread Yemen. You don't even know the name of the word. Yeah, you go to Turkey.

893
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:19,640
I go to Switzerland. I'm in a Swiss chocolate factory the whole time.

894
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah, there's a lot more white people in Yemen than I thought.

895
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,980
Yeah, Yemen's kind of cool.

896
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,680
Yemen's kind of cool, they got a lot of chocolate here.

897
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,200
This place is swag.

898
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,480
This place is cool as hell.

899
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,120
They got a million bank accounts here that have just been walking, that have been going

900
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,120
through.

901
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:41,620
Nah, dude, I would be an expert CIA op, dude.

902
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
I would be incredible.

903
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
I'd be a great-

904
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,200
My face and my head, it's like, I already have a bald cap on for like disguises.

905
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,620
I would be a great CIA patsy.

906
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,680
You would be a great CIA honeypot.

907
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,680
Uh-huh.

908
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,480
- Yeah, and I mean that you look like Winnie the Pooh.

909
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,740
(laughing)

910
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,580
That's what I mean.

911
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,640
- I would kinda be the guy they would hire

912
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,920
to go and actually like, you know, kill a lot of people.

913
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,480
Like I'd be like going into a building

914
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,120
and like killing a hundred people in it.

915
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:07,960
- No, you would be the person that--

916
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,800
- With like their hands and stuff.

917
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,960
- That talks to the people that they capture

918
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,200
at the black sites and you're the one

919
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,860
who puts them through dark experiences.

920
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,400
- Yeah, they basically hire me to go to an office building

921
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,600
and blow it up with--

922
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,720
- They would hire you to go,

923
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,480
they would hire you to go to an office

924
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,260
or like an office building that they have some guy tied up and you're sitting

925
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,660
there and you're going like I'm going to put you through pain until you tell me

926
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,180
that's just reminded me of the book I read and there's impression the book I

927
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,620
read about the inventor of remote viewing my name is puss and boobs it

928
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,860
reminds me of this movie I saw about the inventor of lying

929
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,540
I don't know British the inventor of fuck I don't remember his names Ingo

930
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,740
Swan the creator of remote viewing and he claims he got hired by the CIA to like

931
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:58,580
to like see what was happening on the other side of the planet and on the moon

932
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:04,100
with his mind and he said that the way he got recruited was that he saw he saw the

933
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,500
hottest woman ever in a in a supermarket and he got extremely aroused and then

934
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,860
afterwards some agents came up to him and questioned him and we're like did

935
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,860
you know that woman was an alien and he said that's how he got involved with the

936
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:25,420
CIA. What? There's a lot of crazy like, I mean learning about like, like how MK

939
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:42,180
Helter Skelter is pretty, that's that was that one drove me fully insane. Yeah.

940
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:46,500

He talks about how every picture of the moon is fake and there's alien cities up there.

948

I think there is. I think there's an alien Chicago and they do alien improv and it's actually a really great scene right now.

949
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,020
Yeah.

950
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020

Yeah.

958
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,060

Yeah, man.

960
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,060

Yeah, it's pretty much.

962
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,900
They got aliens speaking Spanish.

963
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,540
That's where the Spanish language came from, is the moon.

964
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,180
Nah, I think white people arrived here in a, in a...

965
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,180
Man, the moon's white.

966
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,340
A giant avocado toast, am I right?

969
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,140
lonesome shorts and they got here they were wearing chubby shorts and riding

970
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,260
cross-country skis shall be short who does that remind me of Cameron Cameron

971
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:25,780

972
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:31,860

974
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:43,460
clearly back and I think Tom it was either time and I was taller it was God

975
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,460
who measured us who's one of us is good at numbers okay I just remember being I

976
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,780
measured you yeah you did no don't disagree with him no I mean I have no

977
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,620
- It was in your bed.

978
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,460
It was in your bedroom.

979
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,420
- It was in Caleb's bed.

980
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,260
- Me and Patrick were already laying.

981
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,220
- You guys were experimenting and exploring each other's,

982
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,260
the entire length of each other's bodies.

983
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,180
- While we're measuring every part of ourselves,

984
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,940
why don't we also measure our length?

985
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,780
- Yeah.

986
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,980
- And then you said, we already did that.

987
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,780
And I said, no, from head to toe.

988
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,540
What if we also had the exact length penis?

989
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,360
- No, I've seen yours.

990
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,500
- Let's say it at the same time.

991
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,060
Let's say it at the same time.

992
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,060
I've seen yours already on Neil's phone.

993
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,060
Let's say our penis at the same time.

994
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:28,560
Okay.

995
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,560
Penis size.

996
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,060
Alright.

997
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,060
Three.

998
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,060
Two.

999
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,060
You didn't say yours.

1000
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,060
[Laughter]

1001
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,060
The fuck?

1002
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:39,060
[Laughter]

1003
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,060
I trusted you.

1004
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,060
No, Patrick said two.

1005
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,060
[Laughter]

1006
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,060
That was good.

1007
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,060
[Laughter]

1008
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:50,060
Yeah, that was a pretty good one.

1009
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,060
That was a really good one.

1010
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,060
Yeah, you know, sometimes you just gotta go old school.

1011
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,060
That was like a Sammy Davis Jr. joke.

1012
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,060
That he would say, "Oh, today..."

1013
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,060
Speaking of old school, you know like big time Tommy?

1014
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:10,060
The fat Italian guy, he's like, "Take it ease. Old school. OS for life."

1015
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:15,060
Oh wait, that's... Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the guy Jesse always says, "I'm gonna be that guy when I'm old."

1016
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Yeah.

00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,820
My sister hates him.

1035
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,300
My sister hates him so much because she has to watch -

1036
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,100
He did a Harlem Shake video where he pooped into his friend's mouth.

1037
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,380
Yeah, it's like Harlem shit or something like that.

1038
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,180
But then after that he became a children's YouTuber.

1039
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,020
Yeah, and he tried to get it scrubbed from the internet.

1040
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,820
You can find it on some Russian site.

1041
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,380
I found it on the internet archive and I downloaded it to her computer for her.

1042
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,380
Yeah, have him watch this video next.

1043
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:11,780

1045
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,900
because of because I'm very smart. Okay so. I check the news all the time on the channel. Turns out I am the

1046
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,900
only one who doesn't look at other stuff during recording. I think we understand

1047
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:32,500
now why Caleb. You look at the back of your eyelids sleepy pie. No I don't. There you do.

1048
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:38,280
you're sleeping right don't close my eyes if you're one of the seven doors Cameron

1049
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,360
you'd be sleepy you'd be asleep if you were one of the seven dwarves you'd be

1050
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,100
asleep right now if you were one of the seven doors you would make it to the

1051
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:50,700
meeting cuz you were too sleeping yeah you're shorter than the seven dwarves

1052
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:55,300
combined all right you're if they were combined they would be very tall that's

1053
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,660
seven of them no because also there's no regular humans in that those are all

1054
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:04,300
everybody's the size of an ant so they're even smaller yeah they're all who's yeah

1055
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:09,820
that's a place on a snowflake yeah yeah it's called snow white yeah the clues in

1056
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:15,700
the title yeah who will talk about it reddit theory did you know that snow

1057
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:22,620
white takes place on a snowflake and snow white is a psychopath yeah yeah snow

1058
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,380
white just kills all the Goombas yeah but that's just another theory just a

1059
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,740
- I think the dwarves are stuck in purgatory

1060
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,940
with Ed, Edd, and Eddy.

1061
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:36,060
I think they all were molested.

1062
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,060
- Is the hungry hamster a psychopath?

1063
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,820
(laughing)

1064
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,060
Think about it.

1065
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,000
He is so mean to Sullivan the frog about all the nuts.

1066
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,820
- What the hungry hamster has

1067
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,900
is called intermittent explosive disorder.

1068
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,660
(laughing)

1069
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,660
- Some viewers think that the hungry hamster

1070
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,260
may have an affliction called Mean Hamster Syndrome or MHS.

1071
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,340
It's possible.

1072
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,180
- Yeah.

1073
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,020
- I'm watching it right now

1074
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,840
and that's actually kind of possible.

1075
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,740
- Does Cuckoo Kangaroo secretly have

1076
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,580
borderline personality disorder?

1077
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,420
- No!

1078
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,500
- He doesn't.

1079
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,460
- No.

1080
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,380
- How would you know that? - Does Cuckoo Kangaroo

1081
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,220
- How would you know that, Caleb?

1082
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,060
- Have BPD?

1083
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,780
- No, he has chronic fatigue disorder and it's serious

1084
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,460
and sometimes it keeps him from eating a balanced breakfast.

1085
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,300
So you might want to think about what you say

1086
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,740
before you say it and not be so mean.

1087
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,300
- Does Cuckoo Kangaroo--

1088
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,660
- Interesting touch by the director of Cuckoo Kangaroo.

1089
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,860
Cuckoo Kangaroo is never shown eating breakfast

1090
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,500
throughout the entire film,

1091
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,080
suggesting that the whole film actually takes place

1092
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,840
over the course of one day, possibly within a dream.

1093
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,620
- Cameron, you are the crazy crocodile

1094
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,380
and Patrick, you are the plump pedophile.

1095
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,940
I am not any sort of kangaroo.

1096
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,780
You're a cuckoo kangaroo.

1097
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,620
I am, just make me an animal.

1098
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:01,600
No, they call me crazy normal Caleb.

1099
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,800
They call you Caleb the bitch.

1100
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,640
They don't.

1101
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,080
(meows)

1102
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,740
Yo, we can play all we want talking all these animal names,

1103
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,360
but don't you dare be calling me a bitch.

1104
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,840
Oh, you're a female dog, all right.

1105
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,920
Cuckoo the bitch.

1106
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,200
I'm gonna come through and I'm gonna hit you with my--

1107
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,440
You're gonna hit me with your kangaroo legs.

1108
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,040
I'm gonna come through

1109
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,800
and I'm gonna kick you twice in the face at the same time.

1110
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,640
Yeah, like what animal?

1111
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,080
I'm gonna, like a fucking, like a frog.

1112
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,920
- Like what kind of animal?

1113
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,480
What kind of kooky animal? - Like a jackrabbit.

1114
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm gonna come at you like a jackrabbit.

1115
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,960
I'm gonna jump up both legs, karate kick you.

1116
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,440
- You know what a, you know the craziest type of kangaroo

1117
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,680
is a jackrabbit?

1118
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,760
- You're a pedophile.

1119
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,000
(laughing)

1120
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,960
Come on, we just said this.

1121
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,720
If you can call me a kangaroo,

1122
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,960
I'm gonna call you a pedophile.

1123
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,800
- It's not an animal. - I might throw

1124
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,360
something else in there.

1125
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,360
It isn't, oh, you think they're human?

1126
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,160
(laughing)

1127
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,040
- He's humanizing pedophiles.

1128
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,640
- No, dude, they're dirty, you, sorry, not they,

1129
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,360
you guys are dirty animals.

1130
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,980
- Hey, cuckoo kangaroo, I'm gonna eat your pouch.

1131
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,840
- Cuckoo kangaroos say I'm gonna eat your pouch?

1132
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,980
- I'm gonna eat your pouch. - Whoa, it seems like you,

1133
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,400
oh, you're the cuckoo kangaroo and I'm not!

1134
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,120
I just said cuckoo kangaroos say I'm gonna eat your pouch

1135
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,960
and you just did. - How would you know

1136
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,800
what a cuckoo kangaroo would do?

1137
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
- Because I've read up on them, because they're cryptids.

1138
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,360
- Why did you read up about them?

1139
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,200
- 'Cause I'm a huge cryptid enthusiast.

1140
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,480
- 'Cause you're a huge cuckoo kangaroo,

1141
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,320
You're a huge cryptid?

1142
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,640
- I'm not a huge kankaroo.

1143
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,800
- Yeah.

1144
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,640
- Yeah.

1145
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,460
- You're the kanker sisters

1146
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,840
from fucking Ed, Edd, and Eddy, bitch.

1147
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,680
That's what you are.

1148
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,500
- You're all three.

1149
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,340
- Yeah.

1150
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:33,880
- Cameron kinda, when Cameron had long hair,

1151
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,000
he did look like the blonde one.

1152
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,160
- I used to have longer hair

1153
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,760
than I've ever had before in my life.

1154
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,600
- When you had blonde hair.

1155
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,440
- I'll say this, when Cameron has long hair,

1156
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,520
he looks like any other girl, 'cause he's a girl.

1157
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,640
They don't call you Cameron the girl for nothing.

1158
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:46,480
- No.

1159
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,040
- We don't call you Cameron Diaz.

1160
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,240
- We don't call you Cameron Diaz.

1161
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,080
Remember Cameron Diaz Cuban man?

1162
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,080
Yeah.

1163
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,080
I do remember that.

1164
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,080
That's so funny.

1165
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,780
Man, that was like a year to the day probably.

1166
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,820
My name is Cameron Diaz.

1167
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,840
It's so good.

1168
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,840
Yeah.

1169
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,360
I thought about that the other day.

1170
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,360
Yeah, it is good.

1171
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,360
That's a classic one.

1172
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,280
Go listen to that instead of the Cuckoo Kangaroo because that doesn't make any sense.

1173
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,200
At least that joke made some sense back in the day.

1174
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,000
The Cuckoo Kangaroo is kind of one of those funny Cuckoo Kangaroos.

1175
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,560
Back when stuff was normal on this podcast.

1176
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,120
It feels like stuff doesn't make sense now on the show.

1177
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,560
I know it makes perfect sense come on cuckoo kangaroo hungry hamster everyone

1178
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,480
knows we're talking about yeah everyone knows exactly what we're talking about

1179
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,440
yeah people love it too I think the best part of hungry hamster is that the

1180
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,080
creation of it happened off of the podcast so there's no way to ever find

1181
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:42,920
out right it means it's cuz I was like sick yeah you know like it's insanely

1182
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,960
hungover I was insanely hungover sitting on Caleb's bed and I was talking to Noah

1183
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,500
Noah and then out of nowhere I was just like man I'm feeling like the Hungry

1184
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:59,100
Hamster right now. I just kept saying that. Yeah guys clip that that's Hungry

1185
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:03,420
Hamster origin. Origin of the Hungry Hamster joke important for all listeners

1186
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,480
of podcast about list. Nobody's gonna care. There was someone who DM'd us I think.

1187
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,160
Who asked us about the story. Somebody asked is there any history behind the Hungry

1188
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:17,400
Hamster I think. Yeah yeah is there any history around fucking anything of

1189
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,760
course there is. The Hungry Hamster actually has roots in white supremacy so

1190
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,000
you may want to check yourself. If you think about it the stereotype of the

1191
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,320
Hungry Hamster you know you gotta think why is he hungry? Who's denying him food?

1192
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,600
I just want you to consider shit like this before you two make make wry jokes

1193
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:43,000
about hamster, hungry hamsters okay? Yeah. Oh my god. Especially coming from you Patrick.

- All of them, dude. They all have... That's what I'm saying. - Oh no!

1200
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
- Alright, that's the podcast is over. - We're gonna have to end Jemima this, dude.

1201

- It's over. - We're never making another episode.

1202
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
- We're gonna wipe the entire archive. - Yeah.

1203
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,620
