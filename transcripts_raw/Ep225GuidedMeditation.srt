(bell rings)

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,580
- And let's begin.

11
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,420
- Namaste.

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,660
- Namaste to you as well.

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,180
- Bidu bidu.

14
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,020
- What?

15
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,060
- I thought we were doing the minion episode today.

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,780
- We clearly said meditation.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,940
- I, you know what, guided meditation.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,620
- First letter, last three letters.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,460
- Yeah.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,280
- My yon.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,980
- They are exactly the same.

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,020
And you know that you are working with a dyslexic with ADHD.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,300
So.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
You have Daha?

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
I think this is on...

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Huh?

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Daha?

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
That's what you said.

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
I did not say Daha.

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
You said Daha.

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,300
D-A-H-A.

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Do you think that you're...

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,300
No, I said B-Doo.

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,780
There's only two things I can really say.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,980
You think that your dyslexia and ADHD is bad enough that you could get a handicap placard

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,980
for like a...

37
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
I think I could get a handicap placard for my driving.

38
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,940
I bet you could get a handy job out of it.

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,020
Sorry, you both said something awesome.

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Yeah.

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
You first.

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,020
Probably for my driving.

43
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
Oh yeah, you're a bad driver.

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
Yeah.

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,060
job out of it. Nowadays this society

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,100
venerates mental illness and makes it okay

47
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,220
and gets sex-a-shual pleasure out of it.

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,180
You think that people who have...

49
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,140
Sexual pleasure. ...who get hand jobs,

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,140
men who get hand jobs are...

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,300
Disproportionately dyslexic and ADHD.

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,340
Wow, and you've done the research on it.

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
I've seen the stats on this, yeah.

54
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,940
You know, this is supposed to be kind of a

55
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,060
hippie kind of episode. You're

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,860
coming in with some serious...

57
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,260
Well, I've been completely thrown off.

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,860
You know what, that's a really good

59
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,460
point and I think we should center ourselves a little bit. All right ring the

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:40,820
gong. Okay. By the way there's a regulation. Regulation gong. You might say

61
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,180
this is small but in movies and stuff because the monks are always hitting it

62
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,860
but monks are very small. It's forced perspective. They're like elves or gnomes and they have to

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,160
live far away from normal society. They live high up on a mountain because the

64
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,980
gravity is lower up there. They look so small up there. It's like how things that are

65
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,440
that are far away are small.

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,280
- Oh yeah.

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
- Are, end up being smaller.

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,300
(laughing)

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,260
Stuff that is way up high like the monks.

70
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,900
They don't get too big.

71
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,020
- No. - They're, you know.

72
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,060
- Well it's also hard to carry such a big gong

73
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,100
all the way up a mountain.

74
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,300
- Yeah, you gotta make a fucking tiny gong.

75
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,980
- It's like when I'm moving into an apartment

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,220
and I find out, oh, I'm gonna be living on the fourth floor,

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,500
like, I'm getting a small bed.

78
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,340
- Exactly. - I'm getting a bed

79
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,180
that's this big so I can bring it up the stairs.

80
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,500
- Imagine moving your gong into a fifth floor rock up.

81
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,180
- Well yeah, you gotta get a gong mover

82
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,820
to be able to fucking put it on the thing

83
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,660
and pull it up a crane.

84
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:32,640
I'll just size it up later. I'll just grow it you think it'll be easy bringing that gong through your hallway. Hell no no

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
You think oh, it's flat. It's very movable

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah, no

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,220
My apartment it's my gong not even to mention the rammer. Yeah, yes

88
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,880
Pretty blood that's what it that's what it said on the Amazon listing for our going

89
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,620
This is a it said hit it with the rammer. It is a rammer it ours has no yak hair on it

90
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Well, actually, you know what? There was some red strings, but they got completely disappeared.

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
Oh, okay.

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
We could put some strings on it.

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,620
They might have been holy or sacred.

94
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
From a red yak?

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
I put some on my hair.

96
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,620
You don't have red strings.

97
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
You barely have hair.

98
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Oh, there's a little bit on the back here that I forgot to get. So, you can get that.

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,620
The minion makeup really does cover up your insanely bloated Wisdom Tooth surgery face.

100
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,400
It's kind of crazy. You looked like a freak before you put on this minion

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,180
Yeah, yeah half your faces and you have a yellow fucking microphone

102
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,460
Paired you're born. Uh-huh you were born. We were all born

103
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,900
You know guys I just want to start this off. I mean we're we're getting into the the thick of it, and that's okay, but

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,620
You know it's important the beginning of every day. It's just that's kind of like a day to us

105
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,180
We do one of those thing we want to do as some affirmations and look into a mirror and tell ourselves some things that are

106
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,180
That we want to make true with the law of attraction

107
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,340
Okay, okay, so I've prepared some some affirmations for us to all read together in unison

108
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,260
That we can kind of center ourselves and prepare for this day ahead of us and really get some positive energy

109
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,420
Going in here, so let's let's go ahead and get these affirmations up on screen and let's get the thing

110
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,940
focus so I can click on it. But first, DJ hit that gong. Okay. Wow. Great gong ring that

111
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,860
time around. That was a really good one. Yeah. Alright, are you guys ready for the affirmations?

112
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:36,460
Yes. Yup. I always make a lot of money in the crypto market. I make thousands of dollars

113
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,780
every single day. Can we get the visuals up also maybe? Yeah, yeah. Let's get some visuals

114
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,780
up over this. I need to see these. Okay, hold on here. Let me get these visuals pumping,

115
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,240
because these are, I would say, pretty huge. Yeah, there we go. Oh, yeah. Now we're really

116
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,080
rolling in a psychedelic manner. Now, here we go. Let's move on here. Okay, let's see

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:04,860
this next one. Money creates a positive impact on my life and the life of others. Okay. I

118
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,780
can handle massive success with ease.

119
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,660
These are pretty good.

120
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,740
My income is rising at a rapid rate.

121
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:22,260
I am a sexual goddess, and my boobs are legendary.

122
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,180
I have a fat ass and a good heart.

123
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,820
God is my refuge.

124
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,420
I am a vast empress on a gilded path of greatness.

125
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,380
I am a tiny baby and I deserve a cookie.

126
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,340
I must respect the sanctity of human life.

127
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,300
My skin color doesn't define my worth.

128
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,660
Interesting that Patrick didn't read along on that one.

129
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,340
I can't say this one, this is not my natural skin color.

130
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
He doesn't agree.

131
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
I'm not, hold on.

132
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Well say it again.

133
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Okay, ready?

134
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
No negativity.

135
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,700
color doesn't define my worth. Okay, it just took you a while. You're a little late to

136
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:09,980
that train. Alright, let's keep going. I am a pretty princess and everything just works

137
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:19,620
out for me. If my survival means that evil must win the day, so be it. If I am evil according

138
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,940
to what the world says, then it is what it is. If goodness is not available to me, then

139
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:33,020
I will claim what was offered to me. Prepping my meals brings me great

140
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,940
satisfaction. I'm way into meal prep. And then one last one for us here. Oops.

141
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,700
Oh. I guess it disappeared. I guess that's the last one. Well I guess I mean do you

142
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,220
remember it off the top of your head? Yeah it was I am best friends with

143
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,140
Cameron. I am best friends with Cameron. I'm best friends with Cameron. I'm best

144
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,740
friends with Cameron. Okay three two one. I am best friends with Cameron. That's the

145
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,900
- I'm ashamed that one got deleted,

146
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,500
but I'm glad we got it in anyway.

147
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
- That is a shame.

148
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,220
- Yeah, and these are all, I just wanted,

149
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,020
these are all, I did not write these affirmations,

150
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,300
these are all, I found them all.

151
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
So this is kind of like a found,

152
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,980
just on different fun websites I like to check out

153
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,700
to kind of-- - Oh, okay.

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,340
I will say, listen, I thought I was dressed like a hippie,

155
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,420
right, 'cause of my tie-dye thing,

156
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,300
and also my new-ass hat,

157
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,460
but you are dressed seriously like a hippie.

158
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,940
- Yeah, I can't help it.

159
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,420
This is just the way I dress.

160
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,660
- You look exactly like my friend Jennifer's mom

161
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,780
died of cancer. Exactly like her right now, minus the mustache. This is crazy.

162
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,840
It's great. We all took the antibiotics I've been prescribed and now

163
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,460
we're all complete hippies. Yeah, it must have been that. That must have been

164
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,580
what opened our third eye. I saw God's light and a laser, but... See, it didn't

165
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,380
work on me. You guys are soaring. For me, it just kind of helped my wisdom teeth.

166
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,740
I saw something crazy this morning because I've been in a psychedelic mood

167
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,540
because I've been thinking of different sacred geometries and how mushrooms can

168
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,840
actually you know I was thinking about a mushroom but then there's all this is so

169
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,140
good in like on top of a steak or something yeah a giant mushroom cloud

170
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,680
that destroys Hiroshima or Nagasaki is a fucking bad thing to see here's and

171
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,420
here's a kind of an addendum to that imagine if you will a bird soaring high

172
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,580
above the sky yeah he's a mushroom cloud what does the bird think this is the

173
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,420
beginning of a great forest that's right a forest larger than one I've ever

174
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,660
encounter. Then all of a sudden he's turned into dust. Yes. And his shadow is cast on a brick wall forever.

175
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:36,420
When I see a mushroom, I think this could be a gnome's home. Yeah. You definitely could make a stoner

176
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:42,020
comedy about Hiroshima and Nagasaki where some guy, he smoked weed and then the explosion happens and

177
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,180
he goes, "Oh no, I'm too high!" and he puts his joint down. But he says that in Japanese probably.

178
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,900
this could be in Oppenheimer. It probably is. Probably a fucking stoner in

179
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,220
Oppenheimer who sees that mushroom cloud for the first time and is like, "What am I

180
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,700
smoking?" Little Cheech and Chong cameo there at the end. Yeah, Cheech and Chong's

181
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:11,780
parents prequel, Oppenheimer 2, Up and Smoke. Yeah, Cheech Sr.

182
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:18,500
Oppenheimer 2 up in smoke is a really good name for the sequel.

183
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,900
That's what the whole Cheech and Chong series is supposed to have like

184
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,460
Oppenheimer colon Cheech and Chong colon. Oh and their parents were survivors of Hiroshima

185
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,060
Nagasaki that's why they're drug addict kids. Yeah that's why they're all fucked up in the head.

186
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,220
It's about the cycle of abuse. Yeah yeah that's a really good point.

187
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,660
Yeah they have some mutation in them that leads to... Makes them smoke that green

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,180
green stuff. And also they're Japanese, they have a Mexican child. Yeah. Yeah it's pretty

189
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,180
impressive and also they're tainted are they supposed to be brothers in those

190
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,980
movies change the genes change they cheen cheat they cheat yeah we're doing

191
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:58,900

No, but it was clear she had no idea

201
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,020
what was on her shirt.

202
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,900
It was just a shirt she got.

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,740

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,980

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,180
- Yeah, oh, the I'm not Norm,

210
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,700

00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,700

Yes.

Dude, it's so... there's so much like fat right here.

226
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,120
You sound like a nerd.

227
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,400
I know. It sucks.

228
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,720
You sound gay.

229
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,600
I sneezed so hard last night, I think I ripped a stitch in my mouth.

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Really?

231
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Yeah.

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
This is like how you sounded when I first met you.

233
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Yeah?

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Yeah.

235
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,160
I think so. I told you that yesterday, I said that it looks like half of you is the old

236
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Patrick.

237
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,520
Then half of you is a new paddrake.

238
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,160
And then I'm over here meanwhile being like,

239
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm over here meanwhile being like a minion

240
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,920
with Stitch in his mouth.

241
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,640
Yeah, I think I've seen a DeviantArt of that.

242
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,820
Oh, come on.

243
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,980
That's what I'm like, I hate to say it,

244
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,520
but that's what I'm like over here.

245
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,120
This is not very third eye open of you.

246
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,280
There's gotta be Stitch.

247
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
I closed my third eye for one minute.

248
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,840
Isn't there a couple minions that have a third eye?

249
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,720
I have seen Stitch with his third eye open

250
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,560
on some of those DeviantArts too.

251
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,320
Some of the minions only have one eye.

252
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
That looks like me right now.

253
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah, they have one or two eyes.

254
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Yeah, so if they have one eye, are they opening their second eye?

255
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Stewart, Bob, and then the third one is named, like, Luis.

256
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Kevin. It's Kevin.

257
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Kevin.

258
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Luis.

259
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
That might be why.

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
You look like your name is Luis.

261
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
No, I look like my name is Kevin.

262
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
You look like Jeremiah the Bullfrog.

263
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
From the song.

264
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
No.

265
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
That all those guys would smoke weed to. Who sings that?

266
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Clear...Cledence Flutter?

267
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Stop talking to me about Cledence Flutter.

268
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

269
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Cledence Flutter Revival.

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm talking about Cledence...what is it called?

271
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Credence...

272
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
[laughter]

273
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Credence Clearwater Revival? You knew what it was! You affected me!

274
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:10,440
It's the Sims version. Are they the fake swamp band? I think so. Right? I don't know.

275
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:22,120
They pretended to be from New Jersey? Yeah. All I know about them is that they're a band that in my brain exists only as a name.

276
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,120
And I can't even imagine what they would sound like, but I just always, once in a while, will

277
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,620
see people on like, a random person I don't know on social media be like, "They actually

278
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
kinda rip."

279
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
You don't remember, uh...

280
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
It was ZZ Top.

281
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,040
"Born on the bayou."

282
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
They also would...

283
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Not from that, at least.

284
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,040
They're fortunate, son, right?

285
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Yeah, I dosed them.

286
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
"Bring me..."

287
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,840
Yeah, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Vietnam expansion.

288
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Yep.

289
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Fire.

290
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
That was a fucking fire-ass game.

291
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,600
But basically, I saw some funny-ass shirts today.

292
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
What'd you guys do?

293
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
You guys do anything?

294
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,940
Staples to get a, to like apply for a TSA pre-check.

295
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,540
I would love to work at Staples.

296
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,000
And the lady, the, listen, chill.

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
- I'm sorry.

298
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,440
- You saw him, we went to Office Depot in Portland.

299
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,680
He went fucking crazy.

300
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,880
- Can you cleanse me really quickly?

301
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
- Yeah.

302
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,360
- And I was at, I was in line and it was a really long line

303
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,240
and I was near the front and there were like four old people

304
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,620
ahead of me and they were going so fucking slow.

305
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,260
And the lady who was, it was like a Staples employee

306
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,540
who does the whole scans your passport

307
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,480
and does all this stuff.

308
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,620
She was literally sobbing the entire time.

309
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,860
I was waiting in line for probably 45 to 50 minutes

310
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,340
and she was crying her eyes out.

311
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,620
- Did she explain why she was crying?

312
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,980
- No, she was so sad and she was crying

313
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,700
and her coworkers kept coming over and be like,

314
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,540
"Are you okay?

315
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,360
What's going on here?"

316
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,940
But she was like, "I'm fine, I'm okay."

317
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,180
And she just kept crying.

318
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,580
And there were just these old people

319
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,820
doing like hunt and peck on the screen,

320
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,900
trying to type their emails in

321
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:53,140
taking like 20 minutes each and just going like just like being the worst the worst person you

322
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,060
could imagine ever having to set up tsa pre-check for and she was just just weeping her eyes out

323
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,380
and then i got to the front of the line i said listen i love you you should yeah listen i love

324
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,980
you spread love in a very positive way damn i did that to her and then i said you will give me

325
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,620
pre-check without doing any background checks on me or checking my record you'll let me scan my

326
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,620
I can bring my bag of drugs under the plane.

327
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,740
This is what I'll have on the plane.

328
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
So you hypnotized her?

329
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
Yeah.

330
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,420
Out of being on her period?

331
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Yep.

332
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
You took her off her period?

333
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Mm-hmm.

334
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,260
I just kind of stopped it.

335
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
Yeah.

336
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
I hate when you're doing something like that.

337
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,380
I put a stop to that.

338
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,660
Don't do that at Staples.

339
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,220
This is a sacred place for men.

340
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,500
I come here to make my copies and to look at the USB mice.

341
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Great.

342
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,820
And one of the girls is on the fucking rag at Staples.

343
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Oh, awesome.

344
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,500
to log in to Hearthstone on your iPad and get free card packs.

345
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,660
- That's right. - I guess, I guess.

346
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,380
- To send myself a gift on Clash of Clans.

347
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,220
- Yeah, I've never really thought about it.

348
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,140
- Stop fucking crying.

349
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,580
- I've never thought about it, but yeah,

350
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,940
Staples is like the nerd version of Home Depot, huh?

351
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,060
- That is my mecca if there was 1,000 meccas in every city.

352
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,100
- I'm thinking that you're thinking of Best Buy,

353
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,020
which by the way, you're dressed like you work at.

354
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,980
- Oh my God, Best Buy is the most fire store of all time.

355
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,820
- Best Buy is Home Depot for us.

356
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,740
- Best Buy betrayed me one time where I was,

357
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I had to go to the DMV and then I was waiting in Best Buy after

358
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,240
because I had to catch a bus and I wasn't coming for a while

359
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
and it was cold out and I just walk around Best Buy

360
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,440
looking at all the movies and stuff as you do in Best Buy

361
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,740
and the employees came up to me maybe three times

362
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,240
and were like, they clearly thought I was like homeless

363
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,540
or something and they're like, do you need anything?

364
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,740
Like you can you what are you doing in here?

365
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,340
And they kept trying to kick me out.

366
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,440
Anytime that I've gone to Best Buy with Patrick,

367
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,440
I've been there to buy something and he spends 45 minutes

368
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,840
opening all the DVD cases to see if there's anything in them.

369
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,000
I do not. Yeah, you do.

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
What I do is I go. He does disappear.

371
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I disappear and I play with the cameras.

372
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,280
He goes, he goes full.

373
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,680
Last time he was here he knocked all the, he like set off the loudest alarm I've ever heard in my life

374
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,720
because he was like throwing the cameras around.

375
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,920
No, I wasn't throwing them.

376
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
I was trying to play with one.

377
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,560
He goes on full, he goes full 10 year old kid in a hotel mode.

378
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,240
Yeah, definitely.

379
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,040
He's like, yeah, like the kid's like, I'm going to go get some ice and is just gone.

380
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Have you ever been to a.

381
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,800
He does that, we walk in to get like an XLR cable and we find him.

382
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,320
Yeah.

383
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,080
Have you ever been to an interactive beach game?

384
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,240
Somehow there's washing machines in the best place.

385
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,240
- He's playing poker on one of the shelves

386
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
like Employee of the Month.

387
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
- That's exactly how I treat Best Buy.

388
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
- Yeah.

389
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,120
- 'Cause like when you go in, it's like,

390
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,400
here is like, you can build this thing in the museum.

391
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
I go in there, I'm like touching all the cameras.

392
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,640
What are you talking about?

393
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Cameras, speakers, TVs, DVD box sets, Legos.

394
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,280
- What?

395
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
What, they have Legos at Best Buy?

396
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
- Amiibos.

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes, they have Legos at Best Buy.

398
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,200
(laughing)

399
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Your voice is so fucked up.

400
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm fucking...

401
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
You sound so...

402
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
You sound like the gayest nerd of all time.

403
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Of course they have a Demos.

404
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Of course they have Legos.

405
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I cannot believe how bad you sound.

406
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
You guys made me come to work. I could have phoned in.

407
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
We didn't make you do anything.

408
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
I think you are phoning it in actively.

409
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
The fact that you were wearing a minion outfit.

410
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm not...

411
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You saw how long this took?

412
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Dude, the voice is...

413
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
(laughing)

414
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,420
- It's too much.

415
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,080
- I'm trying not to rip another stitch.

416
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,760
- Listen, okay, here's what we're gonna do today, okay?

417
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
This is the guided meditation episode.

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,020
This is about chakras, this is about healing.

419
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,800
We are going to heal Patrick's mouth today.

420
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,640
- Thank God.

421
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,920
- By the end of the episode, he is going to be healed.

422
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,040
- Thank God, because there's not gonna be another day

423
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,240
of me talking like this.

424
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,360
- I think that you're gonna be

425
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,880
probably talking like this forever.

426
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
- I fucking hope not.

427
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,760
- I think you're gonna look like that forever, too.

428
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,720
- There's like a, I thank God that tooth is out,

429
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,520
but if I look like this forever I think I can sue.

430
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,520
- You look like, it's kind of like a late life Brando

431
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,800
on the left side of your face.

432
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah, just kinda being weighed down.

433
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,640
- Oh man, I got hair on my, I can't touch the rest of my face.

434
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,280
- You got one of your giant minion eyelashes

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,080
fell into your fucking eye.

436
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,640
- But I can make a wish though.

437
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,080
Guess what I wished for?

438
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,320
- What'd you wish for?

439
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,240
- World peace.

440
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,320
- You know you never seen the NBA as a minion.

441
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
- Yeah, yeah, too short.

442
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
- Probably makes sense. - Too short.

443
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
- Way too short.

444
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
They have had short guys in the NBA.

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think they're too old.

446
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I think they're too old to be in the NBA.

447
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Who says things too old to be in the NBA?

448
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They fucking ride around on rocket ships and shit.

449
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Didn't you see... Fall off buildings.

450
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Haven't you seen the team, the Cairo Mummies?

451
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They're all like 10,000 years old.

452
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
They're pretty old.

453
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're not very good at basketball.

454
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can check that team out.

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But they can play.

456
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They're in the NBA.

457
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They don't play very often.

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,520
- Like 100 seasons. - And only play like Halloween?

459
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,480
- Yeah. - Okay.

460
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
- And only some Halloweens. - The Halloween game?

461
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,360
- Yeah, yeah.

462
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,560
- Do you, so you don't have any meditation

463
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,240
that you have written down or anything?

464
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,560
- I have one memorized.

465
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,400
- Okay, well you wanna do it?

466
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
- I guess I can.

467
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
- Well, you gotta ring that fucking gong.

468
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,240
- In the front, don't hit it from the back.

469
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,540
- Don't ring it from the back, oh my God,

470
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,380
that was so close.

471
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,280
- Why can't I hit it from the back?

472
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,120
- You cannot hit it from the back.

473
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,160
- You cannot hit it from the back.

474
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,000
- Do not hit it from the back.

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,660
- You cannot hit it from the back.

476
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,920
- Why can't I hit it from the back?

477
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,280
- If I am involved, you cannot hit it from the back.

478
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
- Let me hit it from the back.

479
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,280
- We will not let you hit it from the back.

480
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,720
- Don't hit my thing from the back.

481
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,560
- Not once.

482
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,680
- Bro, I can't even hit it from the back one time.

483
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
- I brought my thing from my house.

484
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,520
You're not gonna hit it from the back.

485
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,280
- All right, all right, I'll hit it from the front.

486
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,820
(bell dings)

487
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,320
- All right, okay.

488
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,160
- Okay.

489
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,000
I want everyone in here to close your eyes.

490
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,980
Okay, I want you to breathe in.

491
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,380
Breathe in deep, deep breaths.

492
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,240
Keep breathing.

493
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,800
Okay, now when I count to five, I want you to exhale,

494
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,900
but right now I want you to focus solely on your butthole.

495
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,080
Okay, so keep that breath in.

496
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,820
One.

497
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,400
Two.

498
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,820
Three.

499
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,400
(breathing)

500
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,360
Four.

501
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,620
Five.

502
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,380
Okay, now, with your eyes still closed, where are you?

503
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,220
- We breathing.

504
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,580
- You're breathing out now, you're still exhaling.

505
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,860
You're still exhaling, you're getting all of that air

506
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,260
out of you.

507
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,820
Where are you in your mind right now, where are you?

508
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,400
Exhale, keep exhaling, where are you in your mind?

509
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,340
I want you to feel you're pushing gale force.

510
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,300
Why did you ask about my butt?

511
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,180
You're focusing on your butthole right now, but where are you?

512
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,860
This is not-- I'm at the office.

513
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,420
Just shut up and let the meditation guide you.

514
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,180
OK, continue.

515
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,380
You're still exhaling.

516
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,900
You're pushing gale force winds out of your body.

517
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,940
Where are you?

518
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,340
Chicago.

519
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,980
I'm in Chicago.

520
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,940
You're in Chicago.

521
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,180
Focus on your butthole.

522
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,980
You're in Chicago.

523
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,220
You're in Chicago's South Side.

524
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:02,020
You're inside of Portillo's.

525
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,820
You're eating one of the biggest Italian beefs of your life.

526
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,100
Focus on your butthole.

527
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,940
Focus on your butthole.

528
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,260
Focus. You just dipped your Italian beef into the au jus.

529
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,180
Still exhale, still exhale. Exhale right now.

530
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,060
I don't have any more air.

531
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,260
Keep exhaling.

532
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,160
(breathing)

533
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,600
You can't, you're, the only thing you're inhaling right now

534
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,900
is Italian beef, keep exhaling.

535
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,740
Keep exhaling, get those, get those.

536
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,220
You are blowing wind out of your body like the Windy City.

537
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,060
Keep blowing that air out of your body.

538
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,120
Focus on your butthole.

539
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,540
- Is this going somewhere?

540
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
- Your stomach is starting to hurt.

541
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,700
- Is this a story?

542
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,460
Your stomach is starting to hurt

543
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,940
'cause you ate your Italian beef too fast.

544
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,220
All you can do is exhale out of your nose

545
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,860
because you ordered two Italian beefs

546
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,940
and you're dipping them, you're dipping them hard.

547
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,180
Focus on your butthole.

548
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,700
Now I want you to let everything out of your butt.

549
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,740
- What?

550
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,940
- Let all of the juices flow.

551
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,080
- Right now?

552
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,100
- Right now.

553
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,860
- This is the, I don't want to do--

554
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,140
- And then when you wake up, you're gonna open your eyes.

555
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,780
You're gonna be in heaven. That was terrible. That was so bad.

556
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,500
That did nothing. That didn't do anything. That you told us, it seemed like

557
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,700
almost just a thing that happened to you where you ate so much Italian beef that

558
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,780
you shit yourself and then you pretended like it was like some... And then I pretended to die

559
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:49,020
so that everyone wouldn't look at me. Yeah. Meditation is about telling... You pretended to die?

560
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,160
What I was in a portillo I was in Chicago. I went to portillo's I got to Italian beasts cuz I like them

561
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,200
You said beasts. It's cuz of my mouth thing to tell you keep sucking

562
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,860
to Italian be I

563
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:10,540
Ate them too fast. I dipped to die put too much gravy on there as you and then I

564
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,060
Shit my pants at a table and everybody could smell it and started freaking the fuck out

565
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,380
So I pretended to die so they had to take me out on a stretcher

566
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,060
That's a good move actually if you shit yourself you why don't people pretend to die more had to piss myself

567
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,260
To to make it look like I was expunging every single liquid from my body. Yeah

568
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,100
Ernie and

569
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,520
Then I woke up in the back of the ambulance and I I had to pay them off for their silence

570
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,300
But now I'm breaking my silence because today is about healing

571
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:51,740
I think that you ambulance people are already not allowed to talk about what happens. So okay, then I didn't need to pay them

572
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,840
Well, no, you need to pay them for the I think you just paid for the ambulance though

573
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,980
Cuz I I guess I let it they worded that they drop you at your house

574
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,540
Did you go to the hospital? I still had to go to the hospital and do it. So what'd you say there?

575
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,660
Well, then I walked around the streets of Chicago in a hospital gown

576
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,380
So you you went through intake you're in a hospital gown. Yes

577
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,860
So well they wanted to get the day was after me as they were shit all over me, okay, that makes sense

578
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,660
Yeah, but they're probably had the little butt window on your gown. Oh, yeah, and so they're in key

579
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,700
You know what those Italian beefs at Portillo's look the same as they go in as they go out

580
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,940
There is a zoo dripping down my leg. I think that if we put you in an incubator

581
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,020
It would be probably good for you for like six months

582
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,100
I feel like you have six more months of like kind of incubating left

583
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:46,020
That you missed out on that we could if we put you in one and like we could even come to the podcast

584
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,080
We could put our hands in those gloves that are attached to the thing and we kind of sit there

585
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,540
Yeah, yeah, and tickle you and like show you stuff like show you different. You know I know you love fucking

586
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,740
I know memes and funny videos and shit

587
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,740
We can show you that shit if I need to know

588
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,980
But I think you could just when I was a kid. I think you're like not done

589
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,140
No, and I you know what it was is I came out of the womb

590
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,040
With my umbilical cord strangling me really yeah, whoa

591
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:18,120
Yeah, that's like Elliot Smith. Mm-hmm shit like you try to kill yourself instantly. Yeah, I tried to do the butterfly effect

592
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
That is fucking cool

593
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,320
It's kind of metal. Yeah, that's actually metal nature. I came out with a gun to my in my mouth. Yeah

594
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,620
Yeah, I came out with Wolverine claws. I came out in a gundam. Yeah. Yeah

595
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:35,560
My mom was in you imagine coming out in a gundam or mechanical suit

596
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,300
Imagine coming out to a Gundam that's homophobic and he immediately stabs you with his big sword

597
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,020
That'd be shit

598
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,740
they should do a

599
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,580
You have the baby the baby goes down a slide right into like a mech into like an X like a power loader

600
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,900
Baby, XO suit thing and then it can walk right away

601
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:59,900
That's spaghetti it from Evangelion that they lay in the red good LCL. Okay, she's called LCL

602
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,700
I thought you were a hippie at first now. You're a certified dork. Yeah. No. Yeah

603
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,380
He baited me first of all. He's the one who brought up Evangelion, so he's pretty much just as bad as me.

604
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,720
Did Minions start as an anime? Yeah.

605
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,040
Oh, it was actually a manga first.

606
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,640
I don't know what that is. We baited him twice.

607
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,900
I knew about that. It was actually in Shonen Jump. Wow.

608
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,780
Alongside Yu-Gi-Oh and Naruto. Oh my god. Yeah, no, that makes sense.

609
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,180
I guess it's a spin-off of B2B B B2B.

610
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
Yeah

611
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:38,980
Yeah, there is kind of a minion in Bobo Bobo Bobo Bobo, yeah, there's a couple of guys there might as well

612
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,040
Just be fucking minis the minion from e fucked

613
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,980
On my computer. What are you talking about? Who's that?

614
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,740
Doesn't matter

615
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,580
Wow, I thought we I thought we

616
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,040
I thought we projected a topa. Yeah, I thought our powerful mental energy

617
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:07,260
Meditation created some kind of being that was approaching us. Yeah more like toe toe my toe my plate

618
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:15,300
I'm gonna cut your head off. What are you talking about today? You have gone loony

619
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:21,480
You've turned into a complete loon and you started to affect my talking style

620
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,480
That's true.

621
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Why did I say talking style?

622
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,720
That's what I-- like, you've looned me.

623
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,080
You have looned my brain.

624
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,340
You got loonatickified.

625
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,560
I'm a fucking loon now.

626
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,060
Thanks a lot.

627
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,940
I'm going to be walking around the street babbling to myself.

628
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,340
I don't know where this is going.

629
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,360
I'm a minion.

630
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
Is it because I'm a minion?

631
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,560
It's because everything about you, I hate.

632
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,160
I hate everything about you.

633
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:42,800
Why?

634
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,900
Just yourself is shit.

635
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,640
You are shit.

636
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,220
That's not a nice thing to say to me.

637
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,320
I need to hit this gong.

638
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah, you guys, you need to-- let's say a couple

639
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,840
affirmations, too, for you.

640
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,240
Let's have you affirm your friendship here.

641
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,680
- I am also best friends with Jubio.

642
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
It says right there on the screen.

643
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,400
Did you make that?

644
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,760
- Nope.

645
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,600
- Interesting.

646
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,520
- That must something, my slide must have got replaced.

647
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,680
- I'm sorry Patrick, I don't hate you.

648
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,320
I wanna bring you through a guided meditation though.

649
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
- Okay. - Is that okay?

650
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,480
- Let's see this.

651
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,720
- All right, go over to my guided meditation.

652
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,160
So as you can see, I'm like part,

653
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,200
like obviously the hippie aspect

654
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,320
is coming in with my tie-dyed shirt,

655
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,800
but then also I am a bit of a gentleman

656
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,080
and I an aspiring alpha male as I think we all are, right?

657
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,920
- Definitely.

658
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,320
- So I've made a little bit of an alpha male meditation.

659
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,080
Okay, so first I'd like for each and every one of you

660
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,520
to close your eyes right now.

661
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,800
That's right.

662
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,920
And keep them really close.

663
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,400
Pat, your eyes are still open.

664
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,120
Pat, your eyes are still open.

665
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,940
- I think that's the makeup.

666
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,320
- Oh, it's the makeup, sorry.

667
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,360
Okay, all right.

668
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,960
Back to the meditation.

669
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
His eyes are closed.

670
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,600
I've confirmed it by getting close to him.

671
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,400
I'm gonna hit the gong right now.

672
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,260
(bell rings)

673
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,200
Okay, let's begin.

674
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,180
Wow, you're big.

675
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,340
I'm a little bit scared to talk to you right now

676
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,600
due to your size and your height.

677
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,780
You have to be at least five foot nine.

678
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,080
Okay, I'm gonna try to conquer my fears

679
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,120
and talk to your big ass.

680
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,620
Okay, let's begin.

681
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,460
- Do we open our eyes now?

682
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,200
- No, shh.

683
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,340
Keep them closed.

684
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,840
Start by taking a deep breath, both of you.

685
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,600
Now hold that breath in.

686
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,720
Okay, please exhale it actually,

687
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,560
it made you look even bigger when you took the deep breath.

688
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,700
Your chest puffed up and you looked like a superhero.

689
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,480
Okay, ignore the breathing stuff for now.

690
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,000
The most important part of being an alpha male

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
is having sex.

692
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,440
But sex gets boring for giants like you two.

693
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,480
So you need a sexual bucket list, right?

694
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,360
By the way, sexual bucket list is something I found

695
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,800
from this pickup artist forum.

696
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,840
This guy says, "Okay guys, I tried compiling

697
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,080
"something like this myself and ran out of ideas.

698
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
"I've decided to dedicate myself to the cause

699
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,220
"of being the filthiest, most debaucherous person I can be.

700
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,360
"So far, let's get 100 things and see how we do.

701
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,260
"Put in a couple each.

702
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,160
"Number one, put a chili pepper inside a woman."

703
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,420
(laughing)

704
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,440
Number two, the perfect four way.

705
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,160
A blonde, a brunette, a redhead.

706
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,360
I will add more later depending how this goes down.

707
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,480
Okay, keep your eyes closed.

708
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,200
So that's what a sexual bucket list is.

709
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,360
Now you guys got the idea.

710
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
- Okay.

711
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
- Start imagining your own sexual bucket list, okay?

712
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,520
You guys imagining?

713
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,760
It could be anything you want.

714
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,400
Like talking to a really, really big guy

715
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
while his eyes are closed.

716
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
- Girl with glasses.

717
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,120
- Or it could be like this one.

718
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,020
from Immortal Grover, a member of the MPUA forum.

719
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,600
Firing lasers, just before you're about to come

720
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
all over her pretty little face,

721
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,960
yell, "I'mma fire in my cum shot,"

722
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,040
and proceed to blow load all over her.

723
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,340
And his name is Immortal Grover,

724
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,500
and his signature is a grover is a close relative

725
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,660
of the gopher species.

726
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,040
- Is it like Grover?

727
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,440
- Yeah, it's a G-R-O-P-H-E-R.

728
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,400
- Okay.

729
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,240
- Okay.

730
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,040
Now imagine you're crossing items

731
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,200
off of your sexual bucket list, right?

732
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,240
You have your bucket list, you're crossing your items.

733
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,160
With each item, you grow larger.

734
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,140
At first, you're merely huge,

735
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,760
but as you cross off the items, you grow to be massive.

736
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,220
Again, these could be anything, okay?

737
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,400
Like this one by Ravstar.

738
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,220
Armpit sex, LOL.

739
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,980
Now, you're the size of a house, right?

740
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,980
Then a neighborhood, then a city, then the planet.

741
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,780
Each item you cross off is now doubling your size

742
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,140
until you're as big as the entire universe.

743
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,360
You cross off the final item on your list.

744
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,340
Get a girl to put me dick in her mouth

745
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,760
and leave it there like a gobstopper or some.

746
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,020
(laughing)

747
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,320
Which is a great item, I think that'd be great.

748
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,580
(laughing)

749
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,400
You no longer exist within reality.

750
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,840
Reality instead exists within you.

751
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,540
And then you take your big stinky foot

752
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,100
and you smush me with it.

753
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,400
And I get stuck between your toes

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,760
and your green toe jam goes directly into my mouth.

755
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,160
It makes me sick, but I'm completely helpless

756
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,000
because of your size and how big you are.

757
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,580
Because it's the only item on my sexual bucket list,

758
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,040
I double in size, but that only makes me 11 feet

759
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,100
and five and a half inches tall.

760
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,340
(laughing)

761
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,300
Eventually, I suffocate to death

762
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,020
with a big smile on my face.

763
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,840
But you don't notice because you are fucking a star.

764
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,660
And then one more sexual bucket list item.

765
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,900
Oh wait, we already did that one.

766
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,300
From appreciate poon.

767
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,580
(laughing)

768
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,780
I just noticed his name.

769
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,460
Get a girl to put me dick in her mouth

770
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,940
and leave it there like a gobstopper or something.

771
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,380
I put the wrong picture there at the end.

772
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,180
You may now open your eyes.

773
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,020
- Wow.

774
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,020
- I think you guys might, oh yeah.

775
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:14,300
and your fate has now been sealed I for real yeah you guys should check out that

776
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,140
forum though I found another one that was called I didn't I meant to add that

777
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:22,140
one at the end but I guess I added the wrong picture but it was it was the title

778
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,620
was peacocking with gay pride stuff question mark and apparently this guy

779
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,700
started like wearing a bunch of like rainbow gay pride stuff so that when

780
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,100
girls would ask him something about it he'd be like he'd either he said that he

781
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:42,060
would either pretend he was gay as a joke or he'd be like, "No, I'm not gay, but now you're

782
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,940
talking to me." And then he would fucking snort their skins.

783
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Oh, damn.

784
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,940
Pretty genius.

785
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
He could say, "I have a gay cousin."

786
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Yeah.

787
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,580
That is a thing that you see happen on the street a lot is someone is wearing gay pride

788
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,180
clothes and then a girl goes up to them and goes, "Oh, are you wearing that gay pride

789
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
stuff because you're gay?"

790
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,180
Yeah.

791
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
That's pretty...

792
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,180
It happens a lot.

793
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
That's a great way to get into a conversation.

794
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
And those guys...

795
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,180
And those guys, all they want is a gay best friend.

796
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,740
than a guy in rainbows those guys end up being usually the biggest pussy hounds

797
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:13,340
on earth oh a hundred percent guys like appreciate poon Neil Patrick Harris in

798
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:19,720
Hale and Kumar just played himself yeah is that way is that a fact yep that's

799
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,300

00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,680
He ate her dead body. Yeah, talking about her dead body. I heard in the movie

802
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,620
You're the only one who know it real life table Neil Patrick Harris ate Amy Winehouse's dead body

803
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:44,420
Yeah, is what kind of an accusation that is it's not an accusation. It's a real factoid. I

804
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,140
Don't think so. That's a fact. It's true. Did he go to prison for that's illegal, right?

805
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,860
It's body he was never caught no. How do you guys actually he was any photo?

806
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,460
Yeah, people he did photograph it and people were unhappy about it. Yeah, they said it's disrespectful

807
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,360
- What? It's disrespectful to our legacy.

808
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,200
- This wasn't like a--

809
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,660
- Said it was in poor taste was what most people said

810
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,500
when they saw it.

811
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,540
- I bet it tasted amazing.

812
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,060
- It did look like it tasted good.

813
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,900
- Yeah.

814
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,140
- How was it prepared? Do you have any idea?

815
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,100
- Baked.

816
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,240
- So it was a cake?

817
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,080
- Yeah.

818
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,900
- Yes.

819
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,740
- So it was a cake.

820
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,580
- It was her dead body.

821
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,760
- It looked like cake, but it,

822
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,460
or it was cake, but it looked like her.

823
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,260
- I heard they were, that was one of the episodes

824
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,260
of that show, they were going to do a is it cake?

825
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,100
- Is it cake?

826
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,940
Is it Amy Winehouse's dead body?

827
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,600
- That's the screw.

828
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,060
- Why? You did it on purpose, didn't you?

829
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,660
- Yeah, you did, and then you got shocked.

830
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,660
- Yep, just did it.

831
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,500
- Yep.

832
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,180
- My brain told me to do it, so I did it.

833
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,340
- Yep, Amy Winehouse's dead body,

834
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,460
or a cake that looks just like her dead body.

835
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,600
Go ahead, take a bite.

836
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,620
- Yeah, yeah.

837
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,460
No, it's kind of like nowadays,

838
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,940
that when I'm meditating, I think like,

839
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,780
maybe it's all cake.

840
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,900
- Holy shit.

841
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,940
- And then I'm like, you know what,

842
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,620
and you know what, might as well be cake,

843
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,380
'cause life is a piece of cake.

844
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,860
- Have we cut into this yet?

845
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,460
- It's a gong.

846
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:04,540
a guy that's a gong no it's a gong in my fingers because it would be so moist if

847
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,900
it was cake if it was cake unless you made it cuz it probably dry cuz you're

848
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,740
not a very skilled right I love brick cake I'm allowed to hit it from the back

849
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:17,060

850
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,460
that you put out you just deleted your meditation here Julio Julio delete them

851
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,860
Delete Caleb's meditation from the file.

852
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,460
- Suck my dick! - 'Cause he hit it from the back.

853
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,300
- Look at how negative he's being.

854
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,140
- See, this is the exact--

855
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,460
- Suck on my fucking prick, bitch!

856
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,900
- That's what happens when you hit it from the back.

857
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,380
You start saying, "Suck my dick."

858
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,620
- I hit it from the back.

859
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,780
- You start saying, "Suck my prick."

860
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,980
After you hit it from the back.

861
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,180
- Now, repeat this.

862
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,900
You have to repeat this one on your own.

863
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,100
- I will not hit it from the back.

864
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,820
I will only hit it from the front.

865
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,180
And I will refrain from hitting it from the back.

866
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,680
Oh, no.

867
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,380
Okay, that's sealed.

868
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,980
All right, and you can't hit it from the back.

869
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,580
I won't hit it from the back any longer.

870
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,880
Because you affirmed that.

871
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,680
Yeah, that's law of attraction.

872
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Yeah, maybe firm.

873
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,980
And that's law of attraction.

874
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,180
Attraction or affirmation?

875
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,880
The aforementioned law of attraction is the attractive law.

876
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,660
The only namaste I care about is when all my friends are

877
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,380
leaving the bar.

878
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,480
Namaste.

879
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,280
Namaste.

880
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,080
Namaste.

881
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Yeah, I'm hitting on a 50 year old.

882
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Namaste.

883
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,020
If it's for an introvert, they're gonna say namaste at home.

884
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,860
The only introvert I care about is the beginning of a fucking skate video.

885
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,660
Bob Burnquist.

886
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Introvert.

887
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Bob Burnquist, S Menekani.

888
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,420
I'm like, let me get some extra vert.

889
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,900
I want more vert.

890
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,220
Add some bonus features at the end.

891
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,540
Skateboarders famously love vert in videos.

892
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
Just give me more vert.

893
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,880
I don't remember which one is vert.

894
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,620
To me, vert means going up.

895
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
That's exactly right, man.

896
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,620
You hit the nail on the head.

897
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:56,340
for vertical what's the other one horizon no Hori horizon treat that's not this I

898
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,980
guess the street goes like this why don't we have streets that go like this

899
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,860
why don't we have high thoughts check out San Francisco is that you would love

900
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,460
that you know hippie I've tell me over 10,000 times so Patrick so vert is kind

901
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:17,860
of like this is so Street is like Carlos Mencia Dane Cook vert is like Maria

902
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:23,940
Bamford Paul F. Tompkins alt comedy right hmm put it in terms I understand vert is

903
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:34,160
like kind of vert is more like the seller mmm and then Street is more like when

904
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,860
your friend does a show but street coffee club and no one knows there's

905
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,620
about to be a bit Street is like the one that everybody likes so you have it

906
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,660
opposite I think I think Street is the seller and I think vert is straight-up

907
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:53,980
nerds. Street is like a PB&J sandwich. Because it's basic. But then vert is like

908
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,420
like a kombucha, you know, which I'm into these days with my tie-dye on. And street

909
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:07,740
is like a computer. And vert is more like a mainframe. Street is like SNL, right?

910
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,300
Mainstream comedy. No, I guess vert would be more SNL. No, street is SNL.

911
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,020
you got a there's verts all about competition with this street is on SNL

912
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:21,860
vert is Rhett and Link vert is more Rhett and Link vert is more rock of love

913
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:30,820
that's not in the comedy world no it's the reality that's the reality world so

914
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,940
wait why did reality TV into this you introduce a new thing because some

915
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,980
people think reality TV is quite comedic I mean okay I guess on each street is

916
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:46,880
Rock of Love and then VRT is real real world Las Vegas. Speaking of reality

917
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,900
shows, we watched this game show on Peacock, a Peacock original called Frogger.

918
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,160
We did watch a game show called Frogger. And it's Frogger but with people.

919
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,540
We watched the final episode. I don't remember. It was Damon Wayans Jr.

920
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:07,460
Yeah. Oh okay. That's a Wayans son. Yeah but he's also a brother.

921
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:16,300
careful careful but I didn't say we watched that we watched the finale and

922
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,040
it was so funny because they did everybody like it was like okay

923
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,720
everybody crosses this Frogger course one by one there's like 12 contestants or

924
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,080
whatever and they do them in order and then like so everyone's doing horribly

925
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,840
they're all falling off of these cars and lily pads and stuff and they're doing

926
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,760
terribly and they're all like this is they had a drag queen who did it they had

927
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,400
like there was a teacher there was a like a professional mom they called her and

928
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:47,400
then the last one was like this is a US Marine and he had like giant muscles and he came out and just destroyed everybody.

929
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
He beat everybody.

930
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,440
They were like like every time they go like are you ready Frogger and everyone goes like ready and then

931
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,400
when he came out they went are you ready Frogger and he went whoo-hoo and then he just took off.

932
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,960
yeah and he was like on the wrong game show until so funny level and he

933
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,600
completely like he over jumped something and fell off this performer he lost to a

934
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,200
circus freak fire is that fucked up man that's awesome it's just so funny to me

935
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,280
to have 12 froggers and then all of them yeah like this guy his thing is that he

936
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,160
he has long legs that's what they there was one guy who had long legs and I kept

937
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,880
just calling him long string bean yeah and this guy was looked exactly like the

938
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,720
- Rock.

939
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,560
- Yeah.

940
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,380
- He was like huge too.

941
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,220
- He was just like giant, yeah.

942
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,060
- I would call him the Rock.

943
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,000
I'd call that one guy with the long legs Stringbean

944
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,640
and I'd call that other guy the Rock.

945
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,120
- You should be a host of Frogger.

946
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,960
- Yeah.

947
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,800
- You should be a game show host.

948
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,640
- I could.

949
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,460
- You could do that.

950
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,280
- Professional mom though, how do you get that gig?

951
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,120
- You would be so good.

952
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,940
- You have kids.

953
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,780
- Indeed.

954
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,040
- Oh yeah, maybe.

955
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,180
Maybe on Indeed.

956
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,760
You would be so good on Wipeout,

957
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,720
but as a contestant, I mean not as a guy.

958
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,640
- Yeah, I'd get out round one.

959
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,800
- You should be a guy on Wipeout

960
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
that they let compete every episode

961
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,880
'cause they know you're just gonna be entertaining

962
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,920
every time. - You bring the funny.

963
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,760
- Yeah, you should put me on MXC.

964
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,580
- You should put me on MXC. - You'll bring the funny.

965
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,720
- Most extreme challenge.

966
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,520
- You're like the, you like warm up the crowd.

967
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,920
- I'd love to be on MXC.

968
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,980
I think they would, I think I would compete very well.

969
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,480
- I think you'd be better on Wipeout.

970
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,600
- Yeah. - You could do a very funny

971
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,200
fall off the big bouncing balls.

972
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,240
- Yeah, I'll tell you what,

973
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,480
you shouldn't go on MXC in that costume.

974
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,160
- Yeah, that would be.

975
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,920
- But let's move on to my guided meditation.

976
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,760
- Go ahead.

977
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,440
(laughing)

978
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,680
All right, Julio, let's go to the next slide here.

979
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,800
Here, can I have the clicker?

980
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,960
- Yes, you can have the clicker,

981
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,680
and also, if you wouldn't mind ringing the bell for me.

982
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,520
- Oh, I'm gonna go ahead and ring the bell.

983
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,340
- One time for the one time.

984
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,920
- So this is, I have two meditations I've prepared.

985
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,360
These are both, I found these both online.

986
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,640
- Oh, so you picked up somebody's fucking slack.

987
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,720
- Oh yeah, God's.

988
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,600
God told me to pick two today.

989
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,280
- You picked two, okay, Panera Bread.

990
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,920
- Oh my God, we should go to Panera Bread after this.

991
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,400
- As a hippie, Panera Bread's probably

992
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,720
my favorite fucking place in the world.

993
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,000
- Yeah, it's our Panera Bread business lunch after.

994
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,920
- I'm down.

995
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,440
Alright, here, okay guys, let's go.

996
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,480
Guided meditation number one.

997
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,900
(bell rings)

998
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:04,320
Step one, close your eyes and take a few slow,

999
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,200
deep breaths and allow your mind to clear.

1000
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,800
Take a moment to go inside yourself and totally relax.

1001
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,080
- By the way, sorry to interrupt.

1002
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,680
I would like to say if you're listening at home,

1003
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,200
you should be closing your eyes.

1004
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,040
- Oh, 100%.

1005
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,320
- If you're driving or if you're at work.

1006
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,920
- Just close your eyes right now.

1007
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,760
- You can do it.

1008
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,480
- Just say you're blinking a long time if anyone gets--

1009
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,040
- My eyes are closed and I'm totally relaxed.

1010
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,160
- Say you're having a seizure.

1011
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,360
- Get ready for step two, y'all.

1012
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,920
Step two.

1013
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,080
After a few minutes, which we're gonna skip that,

1014
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,040
we're just gonna go straight to it.

1015
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,520
Imagine a plate full of the most putrid, rotting fish,

1016
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,400
maggots, or anything similar

1017
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,600
that is completely repulsive to you.

1018
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,140
So what are you guys imagining?

1019
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,520
Anything revolting to you?

1020
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
Come on, just tell what's repulsive to you guys.

1021
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,120
- What's repulsive to me?

1022
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,640
- Throw it out, what are you picturing here?

1023
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,880
- Lettuce and tomato.

1024
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,840
- What about you, Pat?

1025
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,840
- Yeah, I was picturing like a bunch of shrimp.

1026
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,480
- Lettuce, just lettuce and tomato

1027
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,280
from just top of a sandwich,

1028
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,800
and I have to let it off.

1029
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040
- Create a strong picture in your mind's eye

1030
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,600
and connect it with the revolting smell of the fish.

1031
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
- Or the lettuce and tomato, or the shrimp.

1032
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,080
- Oh God, the lettuce and tomato.

1033
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,120
- Hold back from gagging,

1034
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,120
but make this image very real.

1035
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,680
- I picked my favorite food, though.

1036
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,800
I just hold, it said, specifically said completely repulsive to you, so you're ruining the meditation.

1037
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,080
Yeah, okay, let me restart.

1038
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,560
Not content to ruin your own meditation, you have to ruin mine.

1039
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,560
Mm.

1040
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,600
Now let's move to step three, guys.

1041
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Step three.

1042
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Now, focus on the chocolate that you would like to eradicate from your diet and mix it

1043
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,640
up with the rotting fish.

1044
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,700
Imagine the putrid fish inside a glass of biscuits, giving off a disgusting smell.

1045
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,760
Be creative with this part of the technique.

1046
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,560
The more vivid you can make this image, the more powerful it will be.

1047
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,720
After you have fully absorbed the image, allow your mind to become blank.

1048
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,600
Take a few slow breaths, slowly count to three, and open your eyes.

1049
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,240
So what I've done here is against you guys' will, you will no longer be able to eat chocolate.

1050
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,120
Or I can eat chocolate right now.

1051
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,040
You have been completely, if you try to eat chocolate at all, you will throw up.

1052
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
I'm overcoming.

1053
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,040
Everybody who's listening to this right now and followed those instructions will no longer

1054
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,840
be able to ever eat chocolate again.

1055
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,760
- I already can't eat chocolate, my teeth are broken.

1056
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,440
- And that seals it. - I agree, now you sealed it.

1057
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,280
- What are you saying about me and Pat's weights

1058
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,760
that you think that we should be eating chocolate anymore?

1059
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,800
- It's not about you, it's about the thousands

1060
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,160
of people listening to this.

1061
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,440
- Thousands of fatties?

1062
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,400
- All of their weights.

1063
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,880
I just have a feeling they've been eating

1064
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,840
a little too much chocolate.

1065
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,880
- How about this, put down the chocolate bar,

1066
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,880
pick up the fuckin' handgun and put it in your mouth

1067
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,920
instead and kill yourself.

1068
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,680
- Pick up the, put down the chocolate bar,

1069
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,280
pick up the protein shake.

1070
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,320
- Yep.

1071
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,480
- And throw it at a leftoid somewhere on the street

1072
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,320
is protesting.

1073
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,120
- Yes, we don't like leftoids, we're rightoids.

1074
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,880
- We're basically right-wing hippies.

1075
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,320
- Yeah, this is a very common kind of person.

1076
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,040
- But if anyone out there is suffering

1077
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,080
from chocolate addiction, congratulations.

1078
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,920
I've cured you.

1079
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,360
If anyone out there is not suffering from this, I'm sorry.

1080
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,960
But sometimes you have to play the cards you're given.

1081
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,800
- Yep.

1082
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,000
- You're free of chocolate forever.

1083
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,040
- Sorry, chocoholics.

1084
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,600
- You know a lot of rehabs won't treat chocoholism.

1085
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,440
- I've heard that.

1086
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,260
- I've tried, trust me.

1087
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,480
- Because it doesn't make any sense.

1088
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,320
- I was really--

1089
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,520
- I tried to go in for take fives.

1090
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,360
- Really?

1091
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,220
- I was really glad to find this guided meditation

1092
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,440
for curing chocolate addiction

1093
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,280
because there was one guided meditation

1094
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,640
that's kind of my white whale, my holy grail.

1095
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,360
You can get the script on this website,

1096
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,160
but it costs $15 and I came so close

1097
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,320
to downloading this PDF for $15.

1098
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,560
- Why didn't you just do it?

1099
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,400
- That's $15.

1100
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,440
- Yeah, but it's a business write-off.

1101
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,760
- I should have done it, but I didn't,

1102
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,680
but it was a--

1103
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,240
- Hey, when's your birthday?

1104
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,080
- Well, here's the other thing.

1105
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,080
- July 4th?

1106
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,200
- Here's the other thing,

1107
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,440
is that you could also order the MP3 version of it,

1108
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,820
and the MP3 version was like 40 minutes long,

1109
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,740
so I was like, okay, but the script that I wanted,

1110
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,960
the thing that cost $15,

1111
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,680
was a hypnosis script that cures addiction to music.

1112
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,720
(laughing)

1113
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,140
- I need that.

1114
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,960
I am actually addicted to music.

1115
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,960
I have so many songs that are stuck in my head.

1116
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,560
♪ I'm good, yeah, I'm feeling all right ♪

1117
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,380
♪ And baby, I'ma have the best freakin' night of my life ♪

1118
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,000
♪ And wherever it takes, yeah, I'm down for the ride ♪

1119
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,680
♪ Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feeling all right ♪

1120
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,160
See, I'm a music addict, and I need fucking help.

1121
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,000
Are you a rexar?

1122
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,820
I'm a total music addict.

1123
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm a reptar, rexar.

1124
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,000
Rexar?

1125
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,820
I'm a rexar.

1126
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,960
Big BeyBey, rexar fan.

1127
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,160
BeyBey, rexar.

1128
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,920
You have to be, she's the most talented musician

1129
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,160
since fuckin' Steve Martin.

1130
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah.

1131
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,820
Yeah, King Tut.

1132
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:42,500
I was addicted to that song. Me too. She's married to Taika Waititi. What'd you say like that?

1133
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,420
Taika Waititi. You can't you can't use the the wisdom tooth as an excuse for

1134
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,100
that one. What about that? What about what I said was weird? Taika Waititi.

1135
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,180
What's weird about that? Not a good way to pronounce that name. How is that not a good way to pronounce his name?

1136
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:02,460
I guess not bad. It's not his name. His name is Taika Waititi. Why are you saying it like that?

1137
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,780
Say it like what? All I'm saying is "Takowatiti."

1138
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,300
"Taiko-watiti."

1139
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,540
It's not being pronounced weird.

1140
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,040
It is.

1141
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,020
You're listening on headphones right now. It probably sounds so...

1142
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,980
It sounds weirder.

1143
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,060
It doesn't. I don't know what's going on today.

1144
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,740
Say it again. "Takowatiti."

1145
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:22,140
Say it again. "Takowatiti."

1146
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,660
Okay, it's the same, actually, on both.

1147
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,500
Yeah? Okay.

1148
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,780
Both sounds bad.

1149
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,380
I think it might be a problem with you guys. Maybe we need a meditation to clean your ears.

1150
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,980
I'd like to see what that guy does in the shadows old taiko a titty. Yeah, yeah, but he's fucking a

1151
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,780
raping a kid

1152
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,460
Ragnarok

1153
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:46,460
Yep, that would be my personal Ragnarok is if they ever caught taiko a titty doing anything like that

1154
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,460
He just seems like that kind of guy

1155
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:55,940
You know, you know what? I did see him in recently. What's that music video Jeremy Renner main attraction. He's in there

1156
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,500
Oh, he is in that. Well, you know

1157
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,580
- Oh, we should have seen that coming from Taika Waititi,

1158
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:02,920
'cause didn't he make that movie with Thor

1159
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,720
that was called Thor Love and Under?

1160
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,700
- Yes, Love and Under 18.

1161
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,460
- Wasn't that the name of the movie?

1162
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,840
- They made it, it was like the if in If I Did It

1163
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,300
on the cover of the O.J. book.

1164
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,680
It was just really, really small.

1165
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,860
- Oh, it's like a Marvel what if.

1166
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,900
- Yeah, exactly.

1167
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,100
- Okay.

1168
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,060
Oh, he was doing one of those.

1169
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:22,900
- Yeah. - Great.

1170
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,060
What kind of colors do you guys like?

1171
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,560
I like yellow.

1172
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,060
Yeah, for some reason.

1173
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,660
I also like blue.

1174
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:39,660
Yeah, I like red and blue and yellow and pink and green

1175
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,540
Patrick's taking the just you guys like rolling news pretty

1176
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,060
bad.

1177
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:45,960
He's dressed up like one of his famous characters.

1178
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Yeah, dressed up exactly like Morty.

1179
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,460
Yeah.

1180
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,560
Yeah.

1181
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,260
Yeah.

1182
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,560
No one was new characters.

1183
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,860
What's his new character?

1184
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,960
Oh, never mind.

1185
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,560
Somebody posted a clip of Justin Roiland's old podcast or something, and it's so funny

1186
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:05,720
to me that he's a voice actor, but that's also just his voice.

1187
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,520
So he's going to be in court and he's just going to sound like that.

1188
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,080
It's not like a thing he turns off and on.

1189
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,960
That's just literally exactly what he sounds like.

1190
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,720
He just is his voice.

1191
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,600
Do you see that photo that people were trying to...

1192
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,940
was like all three voice actors from the show Fish Hooks have all gone down. It

1193
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,980
was like Justin Roiland what he did, Kyle Massey sent pictures to an underage girl

1194
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:39,300
and then the third one is like this woman has done cocaine. The best line in

1195
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:48,140
all those texts that Justin Roiland sent was "I'm Atlanta drunk." I'm Atlanta drunk.

1196
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,460
- I'm a little drunk.

1197
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,660
- All right, I have one more meditation

1198
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,500
to share with you guys.

1199
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,180
- Let me see, she that.

1200
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,940
- Yeah, we're gonna she it.

1201
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,020
So let's go ahead and get this up here.

1202
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,060
Okay, perfect.

1203
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,340
I'm gonna go ahead and gong us in.

1204
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:10,620
- Wow, it really is cleansing.

1205
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,460
- All right, let's begin.

1206
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,700
- I've completely forgotten about fucking

1207
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,980
Justin Roiland saying jailbait now.

1208
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,860
need to cleanse him from our minds. We're beyond him. Okay, do I need a gong again?

1209
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:26,660
I just read somebody a note that said that every one of his texts sounds like he's talking like Stimpy.

1210
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:31,860
Or Ren from Ren and Stimpy. A little bit. "I am Atlanta drunk!"

1211
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:37,780
So I haven't been able to... I read that this morning, I haven't been able to stop thinking

1212
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,620
about it. Yeah, that's an accusation. Yeah, more like Justin roiling massive black smoke and sin

1213
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,840
- Emanating from hell.

1214
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,680
- That's right.

1215
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,880
- Like rolling up to the prison.

1216
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,720
- Yeah, probably rolling up to the joint.

1217
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,540
- We're gonna do another cleanse.

1218
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,140
We're gonna get rid of this brimstone.

1219
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,040
- Yeah, let's get rid of Justin Roiland.

1220
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,580
(bell dings)

1221
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,640
- He's gone.

1222
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,380
- And he's been disappeared.

1223
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,820
- He's gone, he vanished.

1224
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,660
All right, let's begin.

1225
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,140
- Okay.

1226
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,420
- Close your eyes.

1227
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,640
I want you to take a deep breath in

1228
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,220
and hold it for 10 counts.

1229
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,420
- Justin Roiland's getting 10 counts, sorry.

1230
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,140
- And if you guys wanna look at the beautiful visuals

1231
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:29,460
of

1232
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:33,520
heart beat slow down to a nice steady rhythm. But we're not going to zero, folks. Keep the

1233
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,540
hearts beating. Just slow it down. Yeah, that's perfect. That's nice. Keep breathing deeply

1234
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:43,420
and with every inhale I want you to gather up some of the tension and stress in your

1235
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:50,000
body. Gather it in your lungs and then exhale it out. And this one, this is a meditation

1236
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,220
I found on YouTube. I took the transcript. I abridged it a little bit because it was

1237
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,440
an hour long. We're going to keep moving on here. Feel your body relax and unwind. And

1238
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,540
Look at this pretty picture.

1239
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,860
Wouldn't you like to be sitting here on those rocks?

1240
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,700
- I wish I was one inch.

1241
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,420
- Wouldn't you want to climb up that pipe?

1242
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,900
- Yeah, and I wish I was one inch big.

1243
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,300
- Yeah, well that's big, probably big.

1244
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,220
And as the silence in your mind grows,

1245
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,380
as the emptiness expands and consumes you,

1246
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,620
you feel your mind transforming into a total abyss,

1247
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,500
deep, dark, empty, bottomless.

1248
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,660
The abyss lets you realize that my words are your truth.

1249
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,960
My words are your reality.

1250
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,960
Inside your mind there is a monster, a beast,

1251
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,220
an entity of darkest desires, urges, and hungering lusts.

1252
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,780
- And are these the beasts I'm supposed to be picturing?

1253
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,980
- These are some visuals, you know?

1254
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,900
- There's two goose or geese, rather.

1255
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,260
- They're just gooses, folks.

1256
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,100
- Okay.

1257
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,700
- Only the most powerful, only the gods and alphas among us

1258
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,780
can be strong enough to let that beast out

1259
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:57,480
and use it to their advantage.

1260
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:05,840
It'll make you unrecognizable. Good, bad, it doesn't matter. You'll be powerful, alpha,

1261
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,640
dominant without equal, surpassing gods and becoming monstrous.

1262
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,520
I can feel myself growing a tentacle.

1263
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:18,000
Everyone else's but prey are slaves in the eyes of a monster. You know you want it.

1264
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,360
I don't want a slave.

1265
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
You know you want it.

1266
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
I do not want a slave.

1267
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,120
My words are your reality. You are in an abyss in your mind.

1268
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,920
Don't, okay, here's what I'll say.

1269
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,920
You know you want it.

1270
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,920
I'm in a hypnotic state.

1271
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,480
I want, I think that everyone is a slave, but I don't like it.

1272
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,480
You want prey.

1273
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,480
I like prey.

1274
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
And slaves.

1275
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
I don't want slaves.

1276
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,480
Stop trying to make me say it.

1277
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
You know you want it.

1278
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,480
I'm going to use my strength.

1279
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,480
You just said I want slaves.

1280
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,480
Stop.

1281
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,480
I did not say I want slaves.

1282
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,480
That was a seal.

1283
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,480
No, you can't.

1284
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
You just said it again.

1285
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,480
Wait, doesn't that end your whole meditation?

1286
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
No, but it just seals it.

1287
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
I'm going to hit it from the back one time.

1288
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
You're knocking on the candle.

1289
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,120
I don't want slaves.

1290
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,680
I want the opposite of a slave.

1291
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,880
I want to be a white slave.

1292
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,880
Okay, we're unsealing that. We're going to go to the back to unseal it.

1293
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,880
And we're moving forward.

1294
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Thick, wide bull's neck leading down to traps that rise up like mountains of dark iron.

1295
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,880
Strong muscle, broad shoulders that strain against the confines of its cage.

1296
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,880
Delt swelling and cut like boulders into its flesh.

1297
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,880
The skin stretching and breaking over them, indicating just how much this monstrous being has grown during the time you've kept it locked away.

1298
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,880
Do I have any idea what this is?

1299
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,480
time you've kept it locked away.

1300
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
Do I have that in me?

1301
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,780
And look at these beautiful visuals behind these words.

1302
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,480
Well, I can't see you fucking jack shit, asshole.

1303
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,380
I can see it.

1304
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,680
You're taunting me with visuals.

1305
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,380
You know I love visuals.

1306
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,980
Arms rippling with muscular fibers flexing at the slightest

1307
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,680
movement. Biceps, big peaked gargantuan globes of muscles

1308
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,880
with pulsating veins coursing with that thick black corruption.

1309
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:52,780
Triceps that flare out from the arm, each striation and muscular

1310
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:58,700
fiber apparent under the skin, pure mass and muscle and grotesque size.

1311
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,940
Nice, I'm seeing it all.

1312
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,780
You're seeing it all.

1313
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,500
Minus the slaves.

1314
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,100
Drink it in.

1315
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:02,780
I'm drinking.

1316
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,540
You want the slaves.

1317
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,060
All of the body stuff in.

1318
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,940
The slaves are not existent though.

1319
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,700
You know you want it.

1320
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,860
Slavery doesn't exist.

1321
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:14,380
The monster almost seems to flex for you, flaunting its perfection.

1322
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,380
He's doing it for me, but he's not my slave.

1323
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,380
Giving you a show, enticing you more and more.

1324
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:24,080
Look at its forearms laced with layers of vascular tight muscle.

1325
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,080
You're visualizing this, Patrick?

1326
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,580
Mm-hmm.

1327
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,580
Yeah, I'm trying to.

1328
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:30,180
Yeah, so just keep pace here.

1329
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,580
Let's visualize this together.

1330
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,180
You can't take your eyes off it.

1331
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:43,480
They continue to track down to those massive legs, sculpted like pillars of marble, bulging and bursting with tightly packed musculature.

1332
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:43,980
I love that.

1333
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,280
Massive quads and calves and an ass as hard and firm as a globe of iron.

1334
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,120
- And his asshole.

1335
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,320
- Built and tightly coiled with that power

1336
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,080
to crush adversaries.

1337
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,000
- With his ass.

1338
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,840
- With his ass.

1339
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,660
- He crushes them.

1340
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,500
- You want the prey.

1341
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,340
- But this is inside me.

1342
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,520
- You want the slaves.

1343
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,360
- No, not the slaves.

1344
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,200
Get rid of the slaves.

1345
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,760
- To have worthless slaves,

1346
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,600
people unwilling to embrace the monster inside of them,

1347
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,040
worship and beg for mercy before it.

1348
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,520
- I don't want worthless slaves.

1349
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,920
- The whole body of a monster is built for power.

1350
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,200
- I don't like this meditation anymore.

1351
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,040
I wanna skip.

1352
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,080
- I'll say all my slaves,

1353
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,720
if I have them, are worth something.

1354
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,560
- Is not the--

1355
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,080
Let him become you and let yourself become him.

1356
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,280
Let him take control and take control

1357
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,480
of that monstrous form yourself.

1358
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,960
Take control, Caleb.

1359
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,600
- I'm getting control, but I'm controlling the opposite,

1360
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,080
or the slaves are not under my control.

1361
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:34,920
- Breathe him in, drink him down.

1362
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,520
- There's no slaves.

1363
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,600
- Feel him in your heartbeat, your pulse,

1364
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,360
the slow building arousal until everything just breaks

1365
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,640
and you are now a monster.

1366
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,600
(laughing)

1367
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,180
- Okay, wow, that was, I'm still kind of in the world

1368
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,280
of this right now.

1369
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,800
I will say, yeah, so don't seal it until,

1370
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,120
I'd like to really quickly, before you seal it, say,

1371
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,200
I have no desire, I never have, I never will have a desire

1372
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,780
to get a slave in my entire life.

1373
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,620
- Me neither. - A monster.

1374
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,120
- I'm gonna say ditto.

1375
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,480
- Go ahead and seal that. - A monster.

1376
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,400
(bell dings)

1377
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,200
- All right, so that was actually, again,

1378
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,880
90% really fucking good.

1379
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,280
Really, really good stuff.

1380
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,080
Thank you. Well, I put this meme together for us. That's a good one. That is a good

1381
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,560
one. I did that on image flip. I'll tell you something. And I'm going to go ahead

1382
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,320
and seal that meme really good. Yeah, go ahead and seal that. Very few things have

1383
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:34,080
had more of an impact. Like get it? I get it. Then, then this episode today,

1384
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:39,560
basically kind of entering a new realm. I mean, yeah, an impact not on us, I want

1385
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:44,240
to be clear, but on the world. This is like, Let It Be. Let it be, let it be,

1386
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,600
♪ Let it be, let it be, let it be ♪

1387
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,080
- That song, there will be an answer.

1388
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,240
Let it be, let it be, yeah.

1389
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,240
- Let's get a harmony in.

1390
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,680
Vocal harmony so that we have,

1391
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,120
it's I think as you just say let it be.

1392
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:58,960
- Let it be.

1393
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,800
♪ Let it be ♪

1394
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,860

1399
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:10,240
- And that represents the harmony that's now in the world.

1400
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,480
- There's so much harmony in the world now.

1401
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,680
- And Patrick, I would like to quickly,

1402
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,400
you know that minions are evil.

1403
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,440
- They're evil.

1404
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,480
- They serve-- - Canonically evil.

1405
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,580
- Dark masters.

1406
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,820
- Look, I read the schedule wrong.

1407
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,600
That's all I can say.

1408
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,800
- Okay, all right.

1409
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,560
- Just don't let it happen again, I guess.

1410
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,640
- And they did not serve, and the minions,

1411
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,920
we've talked about this multiple times.

1412
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,160
- The minions served Hitler.

1413
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,000
- They did not serve-- - It's a Funny or Die exclusive.

1414
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,360
The story was broken to funny or die.

1415
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,200
Oh my god, if it's funny or die, you know it's gotta be true.

1416
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,680
Alright, peace be with you.
