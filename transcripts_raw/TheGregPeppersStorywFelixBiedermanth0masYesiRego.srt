1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Lying. Backstabbing. Arson. A fall from grace. A dark secret. A comedy scene torn

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,400
asunder. March 31st, 2020. There was one name on everyone's lips. Greg Peppers. The day

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,120
before, nobody had even heard of him. What drove this middling open mic

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,440
comedian to the top of Twitter's trending page alongside topics like Jason Lee and

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,700
Happy Birthday Kaden. Why do some claim he's the devil or El Diablo? What did he

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,080
do that dark winter's night? Before we answer any of those questions though we

7
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,880
have to tell the story from the beginning. But that's easier said than

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,360
than done. This is the Greg Pappas story.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:08,440
Welcome to a very special episode of podcast about list. Yeah very special

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:17,360
edition. Today we do a deep dive on the life and times and crimes. Yeah mostly

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,360
of Greg Peppers, one of the most notorious

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,800
Boston stand-up comedians of all time.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Yeah.

Yeah.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,940
Basically, we're just gonna tell you the story

18
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,800
as it stands now, everything's subject to change.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
We have--

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,760
That's the nature of journalism.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
We have a bunch of interviews

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,780
with some people from his life,

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,200
and some audio that's been recovered

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,040
from the scene and such and such.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
- We won't tell you what the scene is yet.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,880
- Yeah, you gotta listen to the end.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,700
- We'll get there.

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,640
- You gotta listen.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
- It's gonna be a wild ride.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,520
- So let's just start at the beginning, right?

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
- Yeah, childhood.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
- Greg's childhood.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,520
- Greg Peppers was born in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire,

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,440
to parents Mark Peppers and Nicolette Peppers-Rodmina.

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,640
Nobody is quite sure what year he was born,

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,600
and Greg, a pathological liar,

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,820
gives a different age every time he's asked, ranging anywhere from 50 to 70.

39
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,920
He has a younger brother, Walter "Brother" Peppers, but we'll talk more about him later.

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Greg Peppers had a tumultuous and interesting childhood that was pretty well documented

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,000
thanks to newspaper articles, neighborhood anecdotes, and his late mother's diary, which

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,040
we've gained access to.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,520
So let's talk about what Greg was like growing up.

44
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
What do you guys think about that?

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Yeah, um, what was Greg like growing up?

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,440
know he's a mysterious figure with a lot of our records from Greg or on Greg's

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,980
childhood come from posts that he made on the website ebaumsworld yeah the

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,800
early 2000s sort of a precursor to the chive mm-hmm he had a lot of he also had

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,240
a he had a very very well documented very like he updated it often it was a

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,420
Geocities website that he had. It was actually dedicated to the

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,620
character Tifa Lockhart from Final Fantasy 7. It was called

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,800
gregpeppers.tifalockhartboobs.sunsetstrip.geocities.com.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,440
Yeah, he has a lot of posts on there that are really enlightening as to his state

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,720
of mind growing up. Yeah, it's really interesting kind of combing through his

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,520
web history because much like Adolf Hitler he was an artist before anything

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,840
else and it turns out we've discovered that he was actually the guy who made

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,960
the realistic Homer Simpson picture. Oh wow. Well actually I didn't see that.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Oh yeah my team of sleuths discovered that and he actually he was he served as

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,720
the inspiration for the realistic Marge Simpson picture. I walked around his

60
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,480
neighborhood in Hampton Beach just to kind of get a feel for like where he was

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,040
living and I talked to some families and I met this guy who knew him growing up, this

62
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,080
guy Tyler Abu Dhabi.

63
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,440
And he had some really interesting stories to tell about the games they used to play.

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,240
They used to play this game called Find the Guy.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Yeah.

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Find the Guy.

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
What did they...

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Find the Guy?

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,200
No, I have no idea what that is.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,960
I actually went to Hampton Beach a lot as a child.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,480
I think the guy that they're talking about is, well as you know, Hampton Beach, 311 does

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
come around there a lot.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,460
They do play a lot of shows on Hampton Beach.

74
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,920
I think the guy that they're talking about is actually the bassist from 311, Peanut.

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
It is.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,320
That actually is what Tyler at Bobby told me.

77
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Okay.

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
All right.

79
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Wow.

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
Yeah.

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
They would run around and try to find Peanut.

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,680
When they found him, they went, "There's the guy."

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,920
And you don't even want to guess what happened next.

84
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah, you could tell who Peanut was by his tattoos.

85
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,160
He had a very, on his calf, he has a very large tattoo of Mr. Peanut, the planter's peanut.

86
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Wow.

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Yeah, it's actually, it's very detailed.

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,280
It's actually more detailed than, I think he actually used an older image.

89
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Wait, so is that where Greg Peppers got the idea for his Fry Guy tattoo on his leg?

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,480
The McDonald's Fry Guy, do you think?

91
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Maybe inspired by Peanut?

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Oh my god.

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,760
Oh, I thought it was Frylock from Oppertine Hunger Force.

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Oh, okay.

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,880
He has Fry Guy on one leg and Frylock on the other.

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
He has one of the McDonald's.

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,960
And he has Fry from Futurama on his chest, I think.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,200
He has a lot of tattoos of just various people named Fry on his body.

99
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,880
very strange very strange very strange man yeah I know we're sort of putting

100
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,080
together the puzzle of his life yeah no that's that's the thing about this guy

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,320
you you start like talking about him you start to asking people about his life

102
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,420
you can just kind of like piece together other things about something that I

103
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:19,000
found really interesting was through sort of contacting his old classmates and

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,920
and just old school friends I found out that you remember those books sideways

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,480
stories from Wayside School. Yeah. Uh-huh. So it turns out Greg Peppers went to

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,600
the Wayside School. Oh my god. Oh wow. Yeah, the one with the missing

107
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,880
11th floor. Yeah. And they had the teacher that turned the kids into

108
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,640
apples. Yeah, the teacher that turned the kids into apples. Mrs. Gorf. Yeah, it's again just sort of

109
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,080
like I think when you're talking about these

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:57,440
sort of criminal entities like the Menendez brothers or Casey Anthony or

111
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,360
Greg Peppers you you you start to sort of I don't want to say empathize but the

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,960
more that you learn about where they came from yeah the more you can understand

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,840
sort of how the math adds up absolutely okay okay here's a guy went to wayside

114
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,040
school you know here's a guy who his first crush was Nala from the Lion King

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,520
and here's a guy whose second crush was the girl hyena from the Lion King and

116
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,160
maybe that's why he ended up you know the way he did. Yeah no I mean actually you

117
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,360
can draw a really clear line like you look at like oh he went to a sideways

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,400
school and that could be a big reason for his infamously sideways penis that

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,480
yeah many people do talk about. Yeah his penis is like a burrito taped to a

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,960
And I actually I actually I learned a lot through his chatter bait that he

121
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,640
Actually, he what he does is he takes a magnet and he puts it into the neomodium magnet

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,320
And he puts it into the in his meatus and he actually takes another stronger magnet and puts it at the bottom

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,720
Towards his kneecaps and he just kind of yeah, he lets it hangs. He lets it hang and he comes that way

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,160
It's he's really a fascinating guy. Yeah. He's also a bit of an amateur scientist. Yeah

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,300
Yeah, he loves chemicals and magnets and materials

126
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:25,140
Yeah, Greg Peppers and his dark material. Yes. I think I actually have a line here from his mother's diary right here

127
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Oh, oh, yeah

128
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,880
Mother's diary it was actually it was at a it was at a Salvation Army. Yeah strange

129
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,920
Yeah, yeah, it was in it was in an old an old box for some Jordan 11 space jams

130
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:45,580
Yeah, and they were behind the counter. We were just trying to buy a pair of Jordan 11 space. Yeah. Yeah the originals

131
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,300
So yeah, I do have a line

132
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Kind of that refers to his his addiction to science

133
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,540
And I mean I figure I I don't really know what her voice would have sounded like but I can do as faithful a recreation

134
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,540
As possible I suppose

135
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,260
Yeah

136
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,620
Greg was playing with his science set today

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,660
That kid is such a fucking freak. I hate him so much

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,100
So that kind of is provides a little background maybe to

139
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,260
Uh-huh. Yeah again again. It's it's it's making me feel you know

140
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,920
I do sort of empathize with him. You know you yeah, you think that you can't empathize with somebody this like

141
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,700
You know just just this is just abjectly evil

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,940
But his his mother goes on to say um

143
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:42,000
Today he mixed together some strange chemical that filled the entire house with a green cloud and when I woke up it was the next week

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,380
That's pretty good a pretty interesting event

145
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,820
He actually came up he it's one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in modern history

146
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,060
But it was wrongly attributed to a different scientist, but he actually came up with the big green cloud

147
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,220
Yeah, and you know I I do

148
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,100
I do think that, I don't know if you guys,

149
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,680
I mean, I don't know how many mics you guys went to with him,

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,100
but he did say that he invented the big green cloud

151
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,640
to me in passing, and I just, I kind of wrote it off

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,080
as just another one of his lies.

153
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,120
I do think, I think he had a bit about that on stage.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,640
He did, his big green cloud bit.

155
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
Yeah.

156
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
Yeah, but he did it in the context of, you know,

157
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,780
slipping a big green cloud into a woman's drink.

158
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,800
So it's much--

159
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
Which was what he was trying to invent.

160
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,240
Which is what he was trying, he successfully,

161
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,040
little did he know there's tons of sort of medical uses

162
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
for the big green cloud as an anesthetic.

163
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,580
He, again, everything that he does, he uses it for evil.

164
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,920
What's happening forum?

165
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,520
Probably get his dad on the line.

166
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,340
Oh yeah.

167
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,360
Yeah, we should probably call, I mean, we have,

168
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,880
his dad's been on the call the whole time.

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,200
His dad's basically just been waiting to talk.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Oh yeah.

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Cameron is he had to leave to go

172
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,680
watch a movie but

173
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,240
Mr. Mr. Peppers, is that you - are we correct? Are you on the line? Colleen Peppers? Is that you? Hello? Yeah, that's me

174
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,160
Colleen what am I reading? Am I saying that correctly or is it Colin? It's more as a Colleen. It's more. It's mark

175
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,840
Okay, then. Okay. So great. Yeah. Wow. Yeah another one of another one of Greg's lies

176
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,360
Well, you know, that's just kind of how the boy was in many ways

177
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,800
Can I ask you one question just right off the top?

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,840
Caleb and I Caleb Cameron and I

179
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:39,600
We all thought he was somewhere between the ages of 60 to 85

180
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,680
I do can you yeah, can you clarify his exact age? Oh Greg? Oh, let's see. He was born in

181
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,380
1994 so that would make 94

182
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,720
2694 we're talking about

183
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,160
we're talking about Greg Peppers in Boston?

184
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,700
Greg Peppers who fought-

185
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Hampton Beach?

186
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes, Greg Peppers from Hampton Beach who fought in Desert Storm.

187
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
26 years old.

188
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
20- holy shit.

189
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
So he's 26 years old?

190
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
He's an old looking little boy.

191
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,520
Does he have mesothelioma? What the fuck is wrong with him?

192
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,520
He just looks like that. I don't know what to tell you guys.

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Is it something he does with his hair?

194
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,020
I don't think he does anything with his hair. I don't think he's touched his hair his entire life.

195
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Is it like a Benjamin Button type thing?

196
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,020
But with a horn he looks like Steve Bannon.

197
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Oh, Steve Bannon. Now there's a real gentleman.

198
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Oh, you're a big Steve Bannon fan?

199
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
No, I just think he's a real gentleman.

200
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,520
You just think he's a good guy?

201
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,020
No, just a gentleman.

202
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,020
So he's not a good guy, but he's a gentleman.

203
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,420
He has manners. I understand that. He does just know how to wear a suit.

204
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,340
He knows what he's doing, but only in a gentleman, in a manner, in an etiquette fashion.

205
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,540
So can you tell us a little bit about what was it like having Greg in the home growing up?

206
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,220
Well, it was taxing.

207
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:17,560
Absolutely, it was very taxing. He was always doing his experiments. I remember there was this one thing he did where he actually created this

208
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,580
just gigantic green cloud that

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:28,940
Seemed to all the green cloud. Okay. Okay. You guys have heard of the green cloud. Oh, he's told us. He's told us. Yeah

210
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,980
Yeah, he's never stopped talking about it. Oh, yeah

211
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,580
My mental faculties never returned to what they were before the day that he created that green cloud

212
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,260
So did you did you sound like this before the green cloud? No, I used to say where are you from?

213
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm from Hampton Beach. I was born in the same hospital as Greg

214
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Really? Because you sound like you're from whatever house Hank Hill grew up in.

215
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah.

216
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah, that was the Green Cloud. I was actually watching King of the Hill when the cloud hit me and it kind of melded

217
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,040
our brains together. My brain into a cartoon's brain, in a way.

218
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,920
Gotcha, okay. So that's why you have

219
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,540
what I would describe as medically Hank Hill characteristics.

220
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,140
Hank Syndrome. It's a documented kind of condition.

221
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,140
So I was the first and second case.

222
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,460
Oh, it happened again?

223
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,460
They cured it?

224
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,300
They cured it and it happened again?

225
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,860
It happened again and it kind of layered on top of the first time.

226
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,300
So the first Hank Syndrome compounded with the second.

227
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,620
The first one made me sound like Hank Hill and the second one made me look like a cartoon

228
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,620
now.

229
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,840
I don't have my video on because I'm two dimensional.

230
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,180
Because you'd need a piece of paper.

231
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,460
I'd need a piece of paper.

232
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,540
So you need a piece of paper behind you to be visible or else you're sort of in a flat

233
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,300
world plane?

234
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,700
You're kind of like Flat Stanley.

235
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
That's true.

236
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Is what I'm getting.

237
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
No.

238
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
No.

239
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
You're nothing like Flat Stanley.

240
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,580
No, because Flat Stanley has photos of him.

241
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,660
Flat Stanley is a book and cartoons are different from books, yes.

242
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
That's correct.

243
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,620
I feel like we're getting a little off topic.

244
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,260
We told you to talk about Greg.

245
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,860
Yeah, we talked about Greg and Greg's comedy career.

246
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,780
Now, did he do, so you hear stories about Jim Carrey,

247
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,940
you hear stories about Andy Dick growing up

248
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,900
in their house as children, and they would do,

249
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,260
they would do just crazy, crazy things.

250
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,220
Did Greg, what did Greg do as a child?

251
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,740
What was Greg's thing?

252
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,740
- Oh, well, his main comedic styling, I suppose,

253
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,980
was flatulence in a--

254
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,860
- Oh, yeah, oh, that makes sense.

255
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,340
That is definitely consistent with what we've learned about him.

256
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,860
He would do this thing where he would run into your bedroom, or at least my bedroom, I don't

257
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,260
know about you guys, but he would fart on you and you would actually fall right the

258
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
hell over.

259
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,380
But yeah, he would do the fart.

260
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,100
You know, he did this one prank where he would go down to the kitchen in the middle of the

261
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,260
night and he would open up the refrigerator, he would fart into the refrigerator and close

262
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,080
it, trapping the fart.

263
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,120
So when you woke up in the morning to get breakfast, you would open the refrigerator, the fart

264
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,040
would fly out, hit you.

265
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Oh wow.

266
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,440
It would fly out, I've heard of this, it flies out like Slimer from Ghostbusters and it attacks

267
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
you.

268
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,200
Yeah, so I have one question for you.

269
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,240
Do you, I don't know exactly how to put this Mr. Peppers.

270
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,280
And again, this is your son, if you feel uncomfortable at any questions that we're asking.

271
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Naturally, naturally.

272
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,280
But do you love Greg?

273
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:48,440
- Oh God, I would have to say no,

274
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,840
not at all, not even a little bit.

275
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,640
I mean, I really just--

276
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,480
- Thank God.

277
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,320
- The question there--

278
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,880
- Oh my God, wow.

279
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,720
- The only reason--

280
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,960
- I have been walking on eggshells.

281
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,440
- The only reason I hesitated with answering that one,

282
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,920
yeah, I just didn't know whether how,

283
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,880
I felt like I should pause at least a little bit before saying no.

284
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Yeah, of course.

285
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Yeah, it's radio.

286
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
You gotta ham it up a little bit.

287
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Yeah, exactly.

288
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,200
Well, Mr. Peppers, it's been a pleasure talking to you.

289
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
Yeah, thank you so much.

290
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,360
Thank you so much for calling in.

291
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Absolutely.

292
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,120
I would take any opportunity I could get to slander that awful...

293
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,080
You can call him a monkey.

294
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,680
All right, well, thank you again.

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,640
Thank you so much, Mr. Peppers.

296
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,280
Talk to you next time.

297
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,120
Will do, boys.

298
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,640
So that was that was that was mr. Peppers mark peppers mr. Mark peppers

299
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,020
Hey guys, I just finished watching the Lord of the Rings

300
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,680
extended

301
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,080
Fellowship of the ring. What did I miss? Hey?

302
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,040
Okay, it turns out his name was not Colleen peppers. Like we thought what was it? I told you was Colin dude

303
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
No, it was actually just mark. Oh

304
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:08,360
Yeah, yeah, I think it was maybe it was a Gaelic spelling or something. Yeah. Oh, you know those Irish. They're crazy

305
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,520
Yeah, they always fuck it up. What's happening for him? He also claimed that he was radicalized on the side of

306
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,040
Nikola Tesla against Thomas Edison without ever having read the oatmeal

307
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,200
Really? Wow. Yeah, that's impressive. I mean that's the mark of a true scientist

308
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,720
He claimed to have independently come to that point of view without ever having read the oatmeal

309
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,580
Yeah, I heard he knew all about the different color spectrums that a mantis shrimp was able to see

310
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,960
Mm-hmm, and he without even reading a single webcomic in his life

311
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,560
And I heard he could also make snarky jokes about the periodic table without even looking at XKCD

312
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,120
I heard I heard that he knew that George Bush loved oil before Rita ever reading a power-up comic

313
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:03,020
Yeah, and I heard he knew who spongebob was without watching the show and that's one that really blew my knee actually

314
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,600
He told me that he knew about six

315
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,860
Retards who were secret geniuses without having ever read crack calm

316
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:20,220
Really yeah, yeah

317
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,920
He independently came up with a list of six and he never, he said he didn't.

318
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:37,960
I said crack.com and he said I was always more of a Mad Magazine guy.

319
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,600
In addition to live interviews with people close to the situation, we've also acquired

320
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,040
witness testimony from two local comedians.

321
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Thomas O'Shea.

322
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,040
My name's Tom O'Shea, I'm a Boston comedian.

323
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,540
And an unnamed female comedian.

324
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,540
My name is Jessie Rego and I am a former Boston comic.

325
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Their stories help us piece together what it was like to perform alongside Greg in the Boston comedy scene.

326
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:16,540
So I used to host this women's night called Hilarious.

327
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:24,140
I host an open mic every Wednesdays, Mouya burgers, fries and shakes, maybe you've heard

328
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,500
of it, I don't know, you know, not a big deal, kind of a big deal, I didn't say it, you said

329
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,540
it, that type of stuff.

330
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,160
It was only supposed to be women comedians, but Greg showed up and watched all of the comedians

331
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,820
with binoculars.

332
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:47,340
At some point during the mic, he took out a laser pointer and started drawing figure eights

333
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,980
on my chest while I was performing.

334
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,060
In the middle of my set, he just starts pointing a laser pointer directly in my eye and starts

335
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,020
shouting like, "Time's up, time's up."

336
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,280
Like he's fucking Harvey Weinstein shit or whatever.

337
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,600
When I was about to introduce the last comedian of the night, Greg rushed the stage.

338
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,520
he runs on stage in the middle of my set

339
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,320
and he grabs the microphone and starts doing his fucking act

340
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,860
grabbed the microphone, said "school sucks"

341
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,700
and to top it all off, the cherry on the fucking sundae

342
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,160
is that I'm standing there and he's doing his act

343
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,920
and as he's doing it, he rips fucking ass

344
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,000
right in my face, it was so fucking hot, I like fell over

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,420
then farted on me and I fell over

346
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't know if he shot at himself, like put a little poo-poo in there

347
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,000
and you know, honestly, like part of me was fucking rip shit

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,160
because I was there to work out some new killer,

349
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,200
you know, child support bits about my fucking bitch wife.

350
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,960
And I got fucking upstage, but,

351
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,560
you know, if I'm being completely truthful,

352
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,940
Peppa's fucking killed that night.

353
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,240
People were fucking falling out of their chairs, laughing.

354
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,520
Every single fucking person there was dying.

355
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,760
Greg killed that night.

356
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:16,060
And I didn't.

357
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,560
So we actually have on the line right now.

358
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,440
Hey, I gotta go.

359
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,280
I gotta go to the movies real quick.

360
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
I was in the middle of announcing.

361
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
All right.

362
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
No, I know.

363
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
I know.

364
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I'm sorry.

365
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
I just I really got to go to the movies.

366
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
What do you want movies?

367
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,120
I mean, we're on like, the beach movie.

368
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
The beach movie.

369
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I'm going to go to the beach movie.

370
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
I'm going to go to the movie.

371
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Alright, bye Pat.

372
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
See you man.

373
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I hate Patrick.

374
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,560
So yeah, on the line right now we have Greg Pepper's high school metal shop teacher.

375
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,760
I believe his name was, what was it again?

376
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,880
My name is Daniel Delesbo.

377
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Daniel Delesbo.

378
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
How you doing Daniel?

379
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,160
How you doing Mr. Delesbo?

380
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm doing pretty good, how are you doing?

381
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Pretty good.

382
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Yeah, so what years of school were you Greg's teacher?

383
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,240
I was Greg's teacher for one month.

384
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,760
He had to take him out of my classroom.

385
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,240
He was very, very disruptive.

386
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,240
On the first day of class, he took a piece of rebar

387
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,440
and he hit a Chinese kid in the head with it.

388
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,040
And it was very bad.

389
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Wow, interesting.

390
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
- You said, what kind of class was this again?

391
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,540
- This was a metals class.

392
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,560
- Metal, metals.

393
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,620
So it was a metals class? - Metalurgy.

394
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,080
- Metalurgy class. - Metal shop.

395
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,160
- It was like wood shop, but with metal.

396
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
- So you guys, do you make,

397
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,840
what kind of stuff do you make in this class?

398
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,280
- You know, we do a lot of iron casts.

399
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,880
We do our, well, aluminum casts.

400
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
- What was your experience with Greg?

401
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
What, first day of class,

402
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,920
what was your first impression of Greg?

403
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,680
- I already told you, first day of class,

404
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,880
Greg hit that kid over the head with a piece of rebar.

405
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah, Chinese kid.

406
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,360
Yeah, he hit the only, the school's only Chinese kid.

407
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,320
And what was that child's name?

408
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,680
His name was Michael Kwan.

409
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,120
Second day of class, so I mean, right off the bat,

410
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,960
Greg showed me that he was not mature enough

411
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,920
to be in the class, but you know, I told,

412
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,400
I said, I'm gonna give this kid a second chance.

413
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,200
Second day of class, Greg pulls out

414
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,040
a big piece of sheet metal,

415
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,240
And I see him, he's got one of those big Sharpies,

416
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,220
he's pulling it out, and he's drawing what looks like

417
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,880
the Buster Sword from Final Fantasy VII.

418
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,040
- I know it well.

419
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,620
- Yeah, and so he took a Sharpie, drew a Buster Sword

420
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,380
out of a piece of 24 by 24 sheet metal, cut it out,

421
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,220
and well, I mean, it wasn't sharp enough, thank God,

422
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,740
but he did poke my ass with it,

423
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,020
and it did break skin.

424
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,860
- Oh my God.

425
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,500
- So Greg in your class, he made a big sword

426
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,780
and he poked your ass with it?

427
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,380
- Greg poked my ass with a big sword

428
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,180
and to this day, feels like I got two assholes.

429
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,980
- My God, interesting.

430
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,140
- He went up on me like they did to Gaddafi.

431
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,780
- So he Moammar Gaddafi'd you?

432
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,460
- Yeah, he was watching a lot of Tosh.0 at the time

433
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,380
and he did do the Daniel Tosh viral Gaddafi prank.

434
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,540
- Yeah.

435
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,380
Just a terrible, terrible child.

436
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,640
I did tell him his mom should have aborted him

437
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,220
and I did get in a lot of trouble for that,

438
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,460
but just the worst student I've ever had.

439
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,380
- The teacher said his mom should have had an abortion?

440
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,460
- Mm-hmm, he would storm into the classroom

441
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,220
like his name was El Nino while he was hanging out

442
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,260
drinking in the back of his El Camino.

443
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,880
That's what he did.

444
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,500
- And this is when he was a kid?

445
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,460
- This is when he was 14.

446
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,300
- Interesting.

447
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,940
- He was a skid.

448
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,020
No one in the class knew his name until day two.

449
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,020
- Till day two?

450
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,860
- Uh-huh.

451
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,620
- We got, we're getting reports.

452
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,020
Hold on, I'm getting a report in my earpiece right now

453
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,720
that he actually crashed his own house party

454
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,040
because nobody came.

455
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
- Oh my God.

456
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,720
- Is that true?

457
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,380
Is that a true, does that sound like him?

458
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,580
- I'm one of the teachers at the school, I can't confirm,

459
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,820
but that sounds like him.

460
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,300
That sounds like some nerd shit he would do.

461
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,140
- Yeah.

462
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,840
- And look, I love all my students.

463
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,840
- Just the one student I've never been able to connect with

464
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,640
was Greg Peppers.

465
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,520
- Did you ever, did you punish him?

466
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,200
- I believe I did.

467
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
- Was this at the Wayside School?

468
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,560
- This was at the Wayside School, yes.

469
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,120
- And corporal punishment is allowed at Wayside School?

470
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,640
- It was allowed, I did punish him by welding the zipper

471
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,120
on his pants shut so he couldn't go pee in the bathroom.

472
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,560
- Well, yeah, I suppose he could still go pee.

473
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,200
- Oh, he could pee in his pants, that's what he could do.

474
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,840
- So what was the last straw?

475
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,600
What you said, he was in your class for a month.

476
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,280
- You know, first month of class,

477
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
everything's going fine and we had the hangups

478
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,120
the first two days.

479
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,560
The first two days were a mess, I'll say that.

480
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,440
I'll say that, the first two days were a mess.

481
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,340
- And it was fine after that?

482
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,600
- Fine after that until day--

483
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
- Smooth sailing.

484
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,600
- Day 29.

485
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,320
Day 29.

486
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,160
- What month was this?

487
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,320
- This was February.

488
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,560
- February.

489
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,400
- February, okay.

490
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,720
And you know, day 29, Greg,

491
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,280
I finally see what he's been working on.

492
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,960
And it is an aluminum cast sculpture

493
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,880
of him fucking my wife.

494
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,760
Wow.

495
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,580
Mm-hmm.

496
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,240
I don't know where he found a photo of my wife.

497
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,120
And that's a large, was it life-size?

498
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,640
It was life-size and I did respect it.

499
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,120
However, you do not use my tools

500
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,880
to fuck my wife in metal.

501
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,520
I mean, do you ever think that maybe he didn't,

502
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,660
Maybe it wasn't from a photo that he got the reference?

503
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,520
No.

504
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,360
Oh, okay. Did you ever think

505
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,420
that maybe Greg became all too familiar

506
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,000
with your wife's body and maybe he didn't even need a cast?

507
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I mean, it wouldn't surprise me at this point in my life.

508
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,880
It wouldn't surprise,

509
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,000
are you and your wife still together?

510
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,200
Yeah, I don't know where she is.

511
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,540
You're together but you don't know where she is?

512
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,040
Nope.

513
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,320
Okay.

514
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,980
Legally, we're together.

515
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,240
Yeah, but she's been gone for how long now?

516
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,760
Uhhhh...

517
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,980
Three hours.

518
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,340
She's been gone...

519
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:26,840
Oh, okay.

520
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,460
She's been gone for three hours.

521
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,960
Yeah.

522
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,260
And you don't...

523
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,060
And you're not sure that she'll ever come back?

524
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,960
No.

525
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,520
What was the last thing she said before she left?

526
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,820
I'm going to the store.

527
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,800
Oh, okay.

528
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,000
It has been three hours.

529
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,300
How far away is the store?

530
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,140
About 20 minutes.

531
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,000
okay i think you have reason to believe that she might be gone for i mean you

532
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,680
know

533
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,200
well

534
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,320
uh...

535
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,640
she's back

536
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,800
uh...

537
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,640
i don't think i don't know happy for him and those of those one

538
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,240
as close you must last year why if did the another and i was here could you

539
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,920
call it a real quick and ask if she ever are the came in time it with great

540
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,840
answers and i really don't know

541
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,600
now when she gets back from the store she needs

542
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
she needs to glide down for at least

543
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,760
three hours. Can you wake her? Why? Does she have some sort of medical condition?

544
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,040
Let's just talk about Greg. When is the last time you saw Greg?

545
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,360
Day before graduation and he handed me an envelope

546
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,200
I said "Fuck you" and I've never said that to a student before

547
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,120
but I looked him in the eyes I put my finger in his chest and I

548
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,280
poked harder than I've ever poked and I said "Fuck you Greg Peppers"

549
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,880
and I took the envelope out of his hand and I left it in my desk drawer and I

550
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,560
I haven't opened it since.

551
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,080
You wanna pull that out for us?

552
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,320
Alright, I'm gonna open it right now.

553
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Oh!

554
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Jesus.

555
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,820
What is it?

556
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,560
It's a picture of a horse's ass.

557
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Fuck.

558
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,520
And he's fucking the horse's ass.

559
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Greg is?

560
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,880
Greg is having sex with the horse's ass?

561
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,480
Greg gave you a picture of him fucking a horse's ass?

562
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Jesus.

563
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
It's my wife's mare!

564
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
So you, okay, so you have a horse.

565
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,400
- There's a photo of Greg Peppers fucking my wife's mare.

566
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,240
- Wow.

567
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,360
- Do you still have this horse?

568
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,880
- Yeah, it's in the garage.

569
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,980
- What are you gonna do with it?

570
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,480
- It's in the garage?

571
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
- Uh-huh.

572
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,520
- Why?

573
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,360
- It's in the garage.

574
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,480
- Is it okay in there?

575
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
- Yeah, I live in a condo.

576
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,040
I can't, I don't have the proper stable.

577
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,480
- We don't, so one last question.

578
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,040
Ed, do you, has, I don't really know how to put this

579
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,000
without kind of leading you to the answer that I want.

580
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,440
Has Greg ever made you fall over?

581
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,000
- Oh boy.

582
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,400
Okay, so I think there's something I didn't wanna talk about

583
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
but I mean, it did happen,

584
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,600
so I feel I should, feel as though I should talk about it.

585
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,640
- Please do, yeah.

586
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,280
- He took the welding torch

587
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,160
and he held it up to his hind end

588
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,240
and he let out a fart so, so big.

589
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,960
Knocked me over and that's why I don't have eyebrows.

590
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,760
- All right, thank you, Mr. DeLesbo.

591
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,600
- Thank you, Mr. DeLesbo.

592
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
- Thank you so much for your time.

593
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,560
Hey guys, I just got back from the beach movie.

594
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Oh man, how was it?

595
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,520
Was that a 17 minute movie?

596
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,480
So how'd the call with the gym teacher or whatever go?

597
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,800
I think Greg fucked his wife.

598
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,200
And his wife's horse.

599
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,160
And his horse lives in a garage?

600
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
That's crazy.

601
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,960
That's a triple whammy if you ask me.

602
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,360
Fucked his wife, fucked his wife's horse, and the horse lives in a garage.

603
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,880
Yeah where's the wife live?

604
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
The garage.

605
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,880
The garage?

606
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,600
The wife lives in the stable.

607
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
- Whoa, yeah, that's how it should work.

608
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,960
My wife's in the stable, my horse is in the garage.

609
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,600
- The garage, and I'm in the living room,

610
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
and I got a 50 inch curved TV,

611
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,440
and I'm watching Family Guy.

612
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,160
- I'm in the living room, I'm watching Wheel of Fortune,

613
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,000
and I'm yelling the answers out to myself.

614
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
- And I'm grilling in the living room.

615
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
- I brought my George Foreman into the living room

616
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,840
just so I could feel.

617
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,440
- And I'm fishing in the damn bathtub.

618
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,200
- Just so I could touch some hot meat.

619
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,480
- I got a grill chimney full of hot charcoals,

620
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,760
and i'm throwing it on my wife's rug and i'm coughing and the room is filling with smoke

621
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,560
and i'm passing out.

622
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,840
okay so this is actually really exciting we sent a letter by snail mail to uh...

623
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,920
walter brother peppers, greg pepper's brother who i believe has been living off the

624
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,600
grid for quite a while and nobody's really been able to get in contact with

625
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,280
him but we got him to respond to this letter and we got a... he actually

626
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,720
used his personal tape recorder and sent us a tape of like a statement. yeah i heard

627
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,240
I heard that Walter Brother Peppers is living in the charred remains of Gigi Island's home

628
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,520
in Littleton, New Hampshire.

629
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,520
That's also what I heard and that's where I sent the letter to contact him.

630
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,160
Yeah, it was mostly just a guess and then we got something back.

631
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,560
I mean, am I crazy or is that like the wettest envelope you've ever touched?

632
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,920
It was yellow and it was wet.

633
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,760
It smells like a marker.

634
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
But it wasn't like, it was too viscous to be piss.

635
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,560
Yeah, no, it's some substance.

636
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,560
I don't know.

637
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,000
Might have been polenta.

638
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Alright, well let's pop this bad boy in and see what Brother Peppers has to say.

639
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:16,280
I remember the first time I saw my brother, Greg Peppers.

640
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,040
I was a baby, as was he.

641
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,480
I looked at him, he was breakdancing.

642
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,560
I said, "Damn, this white boy crazy as hell."

643
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:37,640
And I'll never forget that one time when that one crazy white boy killed a Chinese dude with a brick.

644
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:47,960
Yeah, I remember the day like it was yesterday. We were walking through the town looking for a bite.

645
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:55,640
For all my other folks not familiar with the term, by that I mean we were looking for a restaurant

646
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
at which we could obtain a meal.

647
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,640
Now Greg Peppers ain't eat his meals like a regular motherfucker, no.

648
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,920
He'd go,

649
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,720
and he'd eat the whole goddamn meal

650
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,780
with a loaded pistol.

651
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,860
He'd pull the pistol out,

652
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,440
he'd sprinkle some,

653
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,440
you know, some ground beef, things of that nature,

654
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,280
on the pistol,

655
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,000
and then he'd suck the tip of the pistol like a penis.

656
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,920
And that's just the type of motherfucker he was.

657
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,880
But anyway,

658
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,300
we were at this restaurant.

659
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,560
This Chinese restaurant,

660
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,640
to be specific.

661
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,840
Not related to the

662
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,120
story at hand,

663
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,680
it just happened to be a Chinese restaurant.

664
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,160
And this motherfucker Greg

665
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,640
happened to be

666
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,560
eating a meal

667
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,720
In his standard fashion, he was sucking the noodles off a pistol like it was a grown man's

668
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,360
penis.

669
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,320
And this dude came up to him, who happened to be Chinese.

670
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,640
Now did he work there?

671
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,160
That's not something you can assume from the given story.

672
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,040
There's a lot of ways to look at it.

673
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,240
He said he said to Greg and I am quoting him here. I'm not using any sort of accent

674
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,140
He said to Greg peppers. He said

675
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:38,400
And that motherfucking Greg, you know, he wasn't gonna take no disrespect like that

676
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,360
You know Greg came through with that pistol and I'm not talking about the one he sucked off like a penis for all his meals

677
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:55,720
Nah, he came through with that shoddy too and he pulled it out and in the stock of it. What did he have?

678
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,160
but a brick

679
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
signed by none other than Mark Wahlberg

680
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:09,080
He pulled that motherfucker out and he just started bashing and bashing and he fucking he kept bashing and bashing

681
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:16,880
BASHING AND BASHING AND THERE WAS FUCKING BUD EVERYWHERE YOU CAN SEE IT ALL OVER THE FUCKING RESTAURANT

682
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:24,080
AND EVERYBODY SCREAMING EVERYBODY SCREAMING OH NO NO YOU GOTTA STOP HIM YOU GOTTA STOP HIM YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN

683
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN

684
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:33,340
And I let it happen. That's my brother. I'm not gonna stop him. But anyway, so he finished his meal, right?

685
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,080
And I'm looking I'm waiting for the police to come right now. I'm saying red peppers

686
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,080
What are we gonna do?

687
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,080
And then he farted on me and I fell over.

688
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,840
Okay I don't know what the fuck that was about.

689
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Yeah that um.

690
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm almost certain that was not, that guy had no relation to Greg.

691
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Yeah I think that.

692
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,200
I think he read the letter and then just kind of.

693
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,760
Kind of made something up.

694
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Yeah.

695
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,680
Fuck that I feel really stupid for playing that on the show. That was kind of me too. I'm not sure I want to associate with

696
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,440
Geez, yeah, I'm bummed that we're recording this whole thing live. Yeah. Yeah

697
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,040
So we can't make any edits. Yeah, there's no way

698
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,680
Yeah, it's like Jimmy. Um, yeah, you know, I'm actually I think I'm gonna send an anonymous tip to the police about that guy's cabin

699
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,520
I just what are you even gonna say? I just say there's a I don't know. I'm gonna send them that say

700
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,420
- Hey, a guy was extremely weird.

701
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,060
- Tell them that that's Gigi Allen's old house.

702
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,460
They'll get over there with the friggin' hazmat team.

703
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,980
- Yeah, they'll go Waco on Gigi Allen's old house.

704
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,580
- They'll go scrub that shit, all the poop off the walls.

705
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,980
- Yeah, I'm gonna have the ATF go Waco on Gigi Allen's widow.

706
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,700
- They're gonna send a damn ATAT.

707
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,540
- Yeah.

708
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,220
- They're gonna send the--

709
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,340
- They're gonna send Judge Dredd and Robocop

710
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,980
joined at the hip baby.

711
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,000
- They're gonna send-- - Siamese robots.

712
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,020
- They're gonna send a tank man

713
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,600
from the Tiananmen Square massacre

714
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,440
because he's the only thing stronger than a tank.

715
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,280
- Yeah, he-- - Have you guys ever

716
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,020
been to his apartment?

717
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,820
- He has this apartment in East Boston.

718
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,940
- Or had.

719
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,420
- He had this apartment. - Yeah, had.

720
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,420
- Yeah, yeah, it was underneath a Mexican grocery store

721
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,460
And I go in one day because he was buying weed for me

722
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,100
'cause he's very easy to rip off.

723
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,740
And I asked if I could use his bathroom

724
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,620
and I went into the bathroom and I lifted the toilet seat

725
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,100
and it was a full koi pond

726
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,960
in the toilet bowl.

727
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,660
- And did you go? - Really?

728
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,540
Yeah, what happened?

729
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,340
- Yeah, I went in, yeah.

730
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,980
Where else am I supposed to go?

731
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,280
I mean you could have got you want me to go in the sink. There was another toy pond in the sink and the bathtub I

732
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,360
Can't had he had that many. How can he afford? I mean and then when I walked out I said hey I was like hey

733
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,540
From what I remember he worked at Subway. I don't know how he could afford that many koi fish. I'm sure they just swam up

734
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,980
Yeah, well, that's possible

735
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,120
Yeah, and then I sold him a gram for

736
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,460
$260 oh that was the best. I mean the best thing I ever did was I sold

737
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,460
one Adderall pill to him for $300.

738
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,780
- Yeah, yeah.

739
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,220
I remember he came up to me at a mic and he was like,

740
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,020
"I'm about to fucking crush tonight."

741
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,900
And I was like, "Why?"

742
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,380
And he was like, "Have you seen Limitless?"

743
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,420
And I said, "No."

744
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,500
And he was like, "Okay, that makes this

745
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,740
"really hard to explain then."

746
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,420
And then he walked away and he just ate shit on stage.

747
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,460
- Yeah, I sold him, I picked grass off the ground

748
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,500
and he was standing right next to me, he saw me do it

749
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,540
and he bought it off me for $500.

750
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,380
- Damn. - Wow.

751
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
- Told him it was a joint, I didn't even put it in anything,

752
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,820
it was literally just blades of grass

753
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,460
in the palm of my hand.

754
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
He tried to smoke it. - I talked to one

755
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,780
of his childhood friends and he said that he,

756
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,980
when they would walk around their neighborhood,

757
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,460
he was the kid who would always eat the berries

758
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,700
that nobody knew what they were

759
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,540
that were growing on bushes and stuff.

760
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,860
- I mean, that's a scientist behavior.

761
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,700
You know, you have to investigate and stuff.

762
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,820
- You're right, I guess he is, he's testing the hypothesis,

763
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,060
are, will these berries kill me?

764
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,060
I did one time, I sold him an ounce of nutmeg

765
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,260
rolled in a post-it note.

766
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,540
What did you say it was?

767
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,420
Oh, I told him straight up,

768
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,260
it's just nutmeg in a post-it note.

769
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,500
(laughing)

770
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,380
How much did he pay for it?

771
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,720
He paid 250 bucks.

772
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,580
So now on the line we have, I believe,

773
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,860
Greg's old coworker from Subway, where he used to work.

774
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,180
Wait, wait, before we interview this guy,

775
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,060
I gotta pop out, I just, I'm gonna go see a movie.

776
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,900
Oh, what movie?

777
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,740
Okay, man, what movie?

778
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,820
Where he's dancing.

779
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,260
I'm gonna go see, "Hateful Eight,"

780
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,220
but just the first part.

781
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,740
Just the first half?

782
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,540
Yeah, just the first part before the intermission.

783
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,380
I think that's like--

784
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,340
But it does have the, we're gonna watch the first part

785
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,100
and then have the intermission and then leave.

786
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,940
- Okay. - Yeah.

787
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,380
- Oh, okay. - That sounds good to me.

788
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,620
- All right, bye you guys.

789
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,460
- Have fun, man. - All right, yeah.

790
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,620
See you in a bit.

791
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,100
Yeah, so we have Danny from Subway.

792
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,700
- Hey! - Oh, hey, Danny.

793
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,140
- This is the Subway at,

794
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,560
which Subway did you work at with Greg?

795
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,700
- We worked at the Subway on Tremont Street.

796
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,100
Come give us a visit.

797
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,120
- Okay, so when did Greg Pepper start working

798
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,600
at Subway with you, Danny?

799
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,820
Probably about a year and a half ago.

800
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,260
He said that he worked at Subway for 20 years.

801
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,380
Yeah, he told me he'd been working at Subway for 50 years.

802
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,220
Oh no, no, no.

803
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,780
He worked there for six months tops.

804
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,660
Really?

805
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,980
Yeah, see I was his assistant manager

806
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,380
and we had this total bitch of a manager, Carly.

807
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:14,820
She was a real bitch about when we would bring home

808
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,760
the ingredients, she would get real mad.

809
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,580
And she just got fed up with him.

810
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,080
Uh-huh.

811
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,820
Yeah, she always had it out for Greg because he could never remember what BMT stood for.

812
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,760
Really?

813
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,260
Yeah, he-

814
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,880
What does- what does BMT stand for?

815
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
Bacon...

816
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,360
Um...

817
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,220
Meat...

818
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,340
Okay.

819
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,780
And turkey.

820
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah.

821
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,780
Yeah.

822
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,460
That sounds delicious.

823
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,280
But he would tell-

824
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,440
Oh, that sounds very good.

825
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,300
He would sometimes just tell people it was what you call the guys in the ambulance.

826
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,420
Oh, okay.

827
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,980
Didn't people wouldn't order it after he told them that?

828
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,340
Well he would say it was named after them because they were the real heroes of the world.

829
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Oh, okay.

830
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Yeah.

831
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay.

832
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Uh huh.

833
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,100
How was it working with him?

834
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,260
Honestly he was like the perfect guy for me to work with because he loved having a good

835
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,260
time.

836
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,260
Yeah.

837
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,700
Yeah, like sometimes we would put all the ham on our face,

838
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,980
uh, like that one episode of, uh, The Office.

839
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,040
Uh-huh.

840
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,700
With Dwight.

841
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,480
And we would do that.

842
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,340
I remember that one.

843
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:29,840
Yeah, and we would do that.

844
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,440
I remember that episode with Dwight.

845
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,740
Yeah, and we would do that Dwight face to each other.

846
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,580
That's pretty cool.

847
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,080
Sounds pretty fun.

848
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,940
We thought it was pretty funny.

849
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,100
So, Greg, uh, how did Greg interact with, uh, how was he with customers?

850
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,940
He was incredible with customers.

851
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,580
He was like the king.

852
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,080
Really?

853
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,260
Yeah, he was like the king of movie trivia.

854
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Yeah?

855
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:58,780
Yeah, the customers would try to order, you know, like Italian herbs and cheese with tuna

856
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,460
and he would be like, "Did you know that one of the midgets from Wizard of Oz killed themselves

857
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
on set?"

858
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
Wow.

859
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,540
And I would be in the back trying to toast the bread and I would get so distracted by

860
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,620
his facts that I couldn't even toast it anymore.

861
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620
You couldn't toast it?

862
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,900
No, I'd get so distracted.

863
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,660
Like I was saying, he was a great employee in my opinion.

864
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,580
Obviously Carly disagreed.

865
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,220
But he always- Who's Carly?

866
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,220
Carly was our manager.

867
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,220
Go further into Carly.

868
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:32,900
Carly was your manager, but specifically what about Carly was so bad?

869
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,000
She was mostly just like a stupid bitch.

870
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,940
The only cool thing is she had some really cool tattoos.

871
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,620
She had on her back, she had sophisticated ignorance written in cursive on her back,

872
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,260
which I thought was pretty cool.

873
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
- When did you see her back?

874
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,620
- When I had sex with her doggie style in the ass.

875
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,500
- Oh, cool.

876
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,620
Good for you, man. - Congrats, man.

877
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

878
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,060
- We were together for a little bit.

879
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,460
It's not a humongous deal,

880
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,980
but we had sex a humongous amount of times.

881
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:06,200
- Did you ever put your dick in a bread roll

882
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,820
and give it to her as a sub?

883
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,660
- That was basically all we did.

884
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,860
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

885
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:13,220
And I started calling her my girlfriend from that,

886
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,740
but she said that I was just the meat

887
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,840
between the buns on her sandwiches.

888
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,920
- That sucks, man, I'm sorry.

889
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,860
- Yeah, it was one of the most heartbreaking things ever,

890
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,280
and that's why I appreciated Greg so much,

891
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,880
because he was there for me in that trying time.

892
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,640
- Is there any reason why Greg stopped working at the subway?

893
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,640
- Yeah, apparently he gave away over $25,000 in BLTs

894
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,560
to uh... to uh... boston police department

895
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,080
yet but when he got fired he was really torn up and uh... he can't he said hey

896
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,300
come over man like we got a

897
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:56,600
like i'm i can't be alone right now and maybe i'll do something insane

898
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,760
and i was like him and for sure so i brought like my fifteen favorite dvds i

899
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,640
have burned on my favorite clips of dennis miller

900
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,120
and i came over his house and i've pop those things in the p_s_ three that we

901
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,200
only use for dvds

902
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,780
and we watched those things and we howled at the moon.

903
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,400
- You howled at the moon?

904
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,720
- Yeah, 'cause we was laughing so hard.

905
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,400
- You and Greg are big Dennis Miller fans.

906
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,240
I think Greg was heavily--

907
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,340
- Dennis Miller is the king!

908
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,360
- I think Greg was heavily influenced

909
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,280
by Dennis Miller and his comedy.

910
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,200
- Yeah, did you ever see Greg do comedy?

911
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,600
- Did you ever do mics with Greg?

912
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,180
- I mean, I knew he was a funny guy,

913
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,880
but I honestly never knew he did comedy 'til right now.

914
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:38,960
- Really? - Oh.

915
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,220
Although I guess that makes sense,

916
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,280
'cause he did try to start an open mic

917
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,800
in the subway that we worked at.

918
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,640
- Really?

919
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,460
- Yeah, he tried--

920
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,760
- Was it just comedy, or was it comedy and music?

921
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,120
- It was comedy, music.

922
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,000
He said that it was comedy, music,

923
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,120
and wet t-shirt contests.

924
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,160
- And how did it go?

925
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Did people come?

926
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,760
- No, not the people he wanted.

927
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,240
It was mostly comedians and musicians.

928
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,820
He called it the Pepperthon.

929
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,640
Yeah.

930
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,200
and what not brought the open what why did you stop doing it

931
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,200
uh... because one time

932
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,900
uh... uh...

933
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,200
somebody got stuck in the bread

934
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,120
that's i'm so sorry

935
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,800
it's ok he died

936
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,480
he died instantly

937
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,540
he died instantly oh man he died instantly his name is terrible

938
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,720
he was a comedian uh...

939
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,480
i believe his name was josh goldstein

940
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,600
That's terrible for him. RIP Josh Goldstein.

941
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,760
He was so small, he was only six inches,

942
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,360
so he fit in half of one of our loafs.

943
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,200
Oh, okay.

944
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,020
When was the last time you saw Greg?

945
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,600
I saw Greg at a Third Eye Blind concert

946
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,720
at the TD Garden about six weeks ago.

947
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,380
Uh-huh, oh, six weeks ago, that recent.

948
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,960
Yeah, and I was on Molly,

949
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,440
and he was on hamburgers and we just,

950
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,840
it just was not a vibe that mixed.

951
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,520
- From your, I mean, not to pull from,

952
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,520
you know, your online, I'm sorry if that's private,

953
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,480
but it says here on a post you made on your Facebook story,

954
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,200
it says here, "Yo, I'm at TD Garden,

955
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,080
"I'm in the bathroom, I'm sucking Greg Pepper's dick.

956
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,740
"This shit's crazy."

957
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:41,020
Uh, I wish you would step back, hashtag I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend.

958
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,420
And then it says sincerely Danny Delicious.

959
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,060
Yeah, who is Danny, are you Danny Delicious?

960
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,980
Is that like your alter ego?

961
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,780
Is that your gay alter ego?

962
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,980
No I have no idea who, I've never heard of a Danny.

963
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,980
Your name is Danny.

964
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,780
It could have been a different Danny.

965
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:06,020
There's a million, I think I've looked at the facts and there's a million Dannys.

966
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,500
This was on your account.

967
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,260
Yeah, Danny, I'm looking right here.

968
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,260
There's a picture of you smiling.

969
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,520
Is it possible that I had maybe shared the post?

970
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,020
Because I thought it was so funny to imagine two men having sex.

971
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:28,800
It is a photo of you and all 1.6 inches of Greg's penis in your mouth.

972
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,800
four inches I mean one point I mean whatever it's you know whatever it looks

973
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,080
like I guess um what's that oh there's a guy there's a guy over here who needs me

974
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,440

978
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Oh okay.

979
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Alright.

Go have fun Danny Delicious.

982
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Thanks Danny Delicious.

983
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,600
I can't wait.

984
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,200
Thanks for talking to me about what was his name again?

985
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,880
Thanks for your time man.

986
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
Girl Peppers.

987
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,880
Greg Peppers.

988
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:12,880
It was good talking about.

989
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
How's Greg Peppers?

990
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,880
He was your co-worker.

991
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,880
You said he was your best friend.

992
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
You sucked his dick dude.

993
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,880
Yeah Greg Peppers.

994
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,880
It was good to talk to guys about him.

995
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
Did something happen to your head?

996
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,880
What happened when you were talking to him?

997
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,880
I was talking to him.

998
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,580
Your head what happened what happened between you and great? Why did you?

999
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:34,620
Nothing happened. No, he didn't pay me in nachos to suck his dick at the third eye blonde concert

1000
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:40,260
That doesn't make any sense. Do you sound crazy sounding you sound I guess you're right man

1001
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,220
I guess that's a good boy. Now if you excuse me, I have to go

1002
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,480
Suck these two women's pussies off. All right, man

1003
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,960
Thank you. I'll see you at subway

1004
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:59,040
That is not my name and what's your last name Danny?

1005
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,120
this

1006
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,120
DeSantis

1007
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,880
Okay, Danny DeSantis

1008
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,240
Cuban oh

1009
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,760
American is good for me

1010
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:18,840
Actually, I have you know, it's not my name is not Danny delicious. Does that sound like a Cuban last name to you? Yeah

1011
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,640
Alright, Cubanos are very delicious to me.

1012
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,080
Okay, this has been a joke.

1013
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,000
And you two should be ashamed of what you're doing to these people.

1014
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,640
I'm sorry, listen, I'm sorry.

1015
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,080
We may have pushed you a little too hard.

1016
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:42,320
I was told that you guys were making a Happy Birthday Greg Peppers audio file to send to

1017
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,800
him and you wanted to interview me about it.

1018
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Is that what Caleb told you?

1019
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Yeah, that's what we're doing.

1020
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
Huh?

1021
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,520
happy birthday thing? Caleb told me you guys were gonna put a bunch of a bunch

1022
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,920
of clips of his friends saying happy birthday. Well why didn't you say happy

1023
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:04,200
birthday? I was gonna wait till the end. Duh! I thought you maybe you guys wanted

1024
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,160

1025
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:14,520

1026
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:21,520

1027
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:36,720
Greg. Cha cha cha. I'm gonna have to restart now. Just get out of here man. Go. Happy birthday

1028
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
Greg Peppers!

1029
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Pat, can we kick this guy off the call please?

1030
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Yeah, you're out.

1031
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Can you go to another Third Eye Blind concert sometime?

1032
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Oh, thank God he's gone.

1033
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Oh, Kalo's back.

1034
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
Oh my God, dude.

1035
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
Sometimes I forget how good the first part of that movie is.

1036
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,680
And you were seeing that on 70mm at the Quiznos Ample Theater?

1037
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Yeah, I saw it in Smell-O-Vision.

1038
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
Oh!

1039
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:22,680
a

1041
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,680
I don't think he did.

1042
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
I think he did.

1043
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,680
I just have a picture of it on Facebook.

1044
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,680
Yeah, I mean, who knows?

1045
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Under his stage name, Danny Delicious.

1046
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,680
People know how to do a lot of stuff on Photoshop now.

1047
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:47,680
You know, I was a pretty big fan of Greg's.

1048
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,680
But that all changed when I booked him on the St. Patrick's Day show.

1049
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,680
He's set at the last Milias show?

1050
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,680
Where do I even begin with that?

1051
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,680
Straight up, I have no idea why Tom booked him.

1052
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,680
Greg has a real unique way of doing comedy.

1053
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,680
He's absolutely fucking hysterical.

1054
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,680
And basically all he does is he farts on you and you fall over.

1055
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,680
Some people hate it, some people love it.

1056
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,680
I think it's genius.

1057
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,680
When I got to the venue, there were like 10 people with signs protesting against Greg being on the show.

1058
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:35,680
I think I remember Patrick Dorn being there, and I might be remembering this wrong, but I'm pretty sure he was wearing a diaper.

1059
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,680
Okay, alright, uh, I can explain that. I had a thing going on with my stomach that I-

1060
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,680
Okay, I don't care at all. I don't care at all.

1061
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
No, no, no, we're not-

1062
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
We're playing the clip.

1063
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,180
No, no, the point is you wore a diaper.

1064
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,180
I didn't.

1065
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,680
Okay, Jesse, continue.

1066
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,180
Anyway, so Greg is bombing, and I mean fucking bombing.

1067
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,680
Like, worse than I've seen him bomb.

1068
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,180
And it was like, he was up on stage, doing his material.

1069
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,680
His usual shit.

1070
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,680
Some puns, some limericks, some songs, some props.

1071
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
Classic Peppas.

1072
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,680
And it... it wasn't going too great.

1073
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,280
I don't think I can ever remember a time when that room was that quiet. Like ever.

1074
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,640
And then...

1075
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,040
And then Greg decided to pull out his secret weapon.

1076
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:34,160
So he decides he's gonna do the closer early. So he gets up on the stool and he's trying to sit on

1077
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,440
it like a baby in a changing station but he can't support his weight and he just keeps falling over

1078
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,160
and over and over.

1079
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:50,440
And that's when it happened.

1080
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:56,120
And just like Obama said, if you like your health care, you can keep it.

1081
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,200
Oh, what?

1082
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,200
That's not fucking funny to you.

1083
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
That's not funny to you.

1084
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,680
I don't I don't know what to do then.

1085
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,720
I don't know what to fucking.

1086
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,040
All right, you know what?

1087
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,040
You know what?

1088
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,100
That you know what I can I you guys don't think I'm funny

1089
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,280
Don't hear something that'll get you laughing. All right. Let me just get up

1090
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:34,220
And that's the only audio that was recovered from that night

1091
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:41,400
When his set wasn't going his way, Greg Peppers lit one of his patented farts on fire with an Eric Cartman Zippo lighter that had been

1092
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,400
illegally modified to produce a larger flame.

1093
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Because he had already been farting throughout the night, the basement was so saturated with methane that the flame instantly caused a massive explosion.

1094
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,400
Greg's fart-splosion killed two and injured 27.

1095
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,400
It completely destroyed Moo-Yah Burgers and Fries, turning a cultural landmark into a vacant lot strewn with debris and limbs.

1096
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,080
To put it simply, he farted on the building and it fell over.

1097
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,200
Many are calling this event the Boston Marathon Bombing.

1098
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,800
Some say this name has already been taken and to pick another one.

1099
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,400
But we here at Podcast About Lists believe in calling it like it is.

1100
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,000
And that night was a marathon of mayhem.

1101
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Greg's body was never recovered from the wreckage.

1102
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
And the police believe he is still at large.

1103
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
*sad music*

1104
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
He went up on me like, uh, like they did to Gaddafi.

1105
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
He just looks like that, I don't know what to tell you guys.

1106
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah, he was like the king of movie trivia.

1107
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
*gibberish*

1108
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
One time he did a set where he literally just ripped off old Carlos Mencia material

1109
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and everyone was confused because he kept calling himself a cholo?

1110
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
If you're pissing people off, that means you're probably doing something right.

1111
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think Eminem said that.

1112
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So there it is, the story of Greg Peppers.

1113
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,360
A whirlwind of laughter, tears, noxious fumes, and childhood neglect.

1114
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,000
There were those who adored Greg Peppers and there were those who despised him.

1115
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,480
But everyone could agree he made a lasting impact on the faces of both the Boston comedy

1116
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,560
scene and the many victims who perished in the basement of that Moya Burger and Fries.

1117
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,000
While many came forward with their stories, there are undoubtedly millions of others affected

1118
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,600
by his crimes and his farts.

1119
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,980
If you have a story to share about Greg Peppers, please reach out to us.

1120
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,720
If you have any information regarding the whereabouts of Greg Peppers, please reach out to the police

1121
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,360
at their Greg Peppers hotline, 213-458-8170.

1122
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,720
Remember, no story truly ever ends, and Greg Peppers is still out there, somewhere, farting

1123
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,560
on people and making them fall over.

1124
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,080
Maybe one day, you'll find yourself waiting in line in subway, confused about what BMT

1125
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
stands for.

1126
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:26,120
And maybe you'll get an unmistakable whiff of Greg's scent, a highly potent cocktail

1127
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,880
of seafood, baby powder, and the inside of a DVD case.

1128
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,720
Maybe he'll be standing right there, behind the register.

1129
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:41,360
And maybe, just maybe, he'll fart on you.

1130
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,160
And you'll fall over.

1131
