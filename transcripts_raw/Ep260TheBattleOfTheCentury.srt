1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
*Badass music*

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,320
Okay, play it. Hit play. Hit play already.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
And turn it up a little.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,680
On the video.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, that's good.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,320
Wait...

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,560
Hamburgers!

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,520
Hot dogs!

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,100
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,920
- Guys.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,480
- It's the most important battle of the century.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,440
- Welcome to the battle of the century.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
- Hamburger.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
- Versus.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,940
- Hot dog.

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,280
- In one corner.

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,120
- Hamburger.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,940
- In the other.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,840
- Hot dog.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,320
- Battling each other, the eternal battle.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,540
- To the death.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,320
- The clash of the Titans.

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,100
Whoever wins, we lose.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,480
With these two foos, these foos are going to have to choose.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,800
Between the twos.

26
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,640
Between these two foos.

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,080
Of whose we'll lose.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Yep.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
And who will lose?

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,240
Who knows?

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,880
Probably yous.

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
But yous will soon.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
That's what we're here to dissood.

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,000
We will dissood yous.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,880
On the news.

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,080
Welcome everybody to the news.

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,320
And this is the news.

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
But yeah, basically, we've been hyping this up for a while, guys.

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Okay, you can cut this.

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
We have two pages of...

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Oh, we have notes.

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,480
Notes of things that we have to go over.

44
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
Here's how this shit's gonna work.

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
These are two...

46
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,440
There's a list of things that we gotta say.

47
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,280
Yeah, and we'll get into it soon enough, but basically, it's gonna be the hot dogs versus

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
the hamburgers.

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Can I just get a real quick hot dog hamburger?

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Oh, yeah.

51
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Hot dog.

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Hamburger.

53
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,080
we have our beautiful announcer here, five or higher, and we are going to be grading

54
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,840
every single...

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
That's what this is for.

56
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,520
We're going to be giving points, head to head battle.

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Your job is giving points.

58
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah, I'm going to be the point master. Thank you. And we're going to figure out basically

59
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,480
which is better, hot dog versus hamburger. This is a debate as old as time itself.

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,500
Yeah, and we're here to solve it once and for all today, because this is one of those

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,940
things that this is kids in the schoolyard who would win who would every

62
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,420
I remember what was a their top five of the variants of the real quickly as the

63
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,740
judges. I feel like we need to give a little bit of a background back story on

64
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,420
our experience with hamburger hot dog. Yeah, who wait who remembers which one

65
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,140
they first? I think I hate a hot dog first. I'm not sure which one I you know

66
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,220
I probably would have to wager hot dog, but I have a pretty interesting history

67
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,180
period between this to I would say yeah. Really, I have a pretty strong bias

68
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,260
that I can't. I can't hide it. It will be revealed. I got to throw it out.

69
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,660
Go. I got to, you know, just disclaimer. Yeah. Well, what I remember is

70
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,340
important. One of my earliest hot dog memories. I remember eating a hot dog at

71
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,860
somebody's house, my mom's friend's house or something like that, and what

72
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,860
did I do with that hot dog? But I threw it all up. When I saw pieces of my hot

73
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,380
dog in my throw up and after that, I would not eat hot dogs for years after

74
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,460
that when I was a little one, and I also I also have a pretty strong history that

75
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm sure you folks are aware of with the noble hamburger and the cheeseburger,

76
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,700
the burger fest, the burger fest is a family tradition of mine that has started

77
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,520
that started pretty soon after my parents divorce three years ago, a

78
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,160
burger fest, which is a great way to cope. If you're a man going through a

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,620
messy divorce with children, a great way to bring them all together, yeah,

80
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,820
burger, burger, burger, now and now that's a good point. I'm going to go

81
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,160
and you know I'm going to word the first point to burger because guys I would

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,180
argue well that you couldn't make a hot dog fest.

83
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,520
I mean if you have you ever heard of a sausage fest yeah, one point to each. Oh

84
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,080
my God, one point to each is nice. That's a good way to start it off. I

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,820
think all right, I'm liking your point. Drawing technique point technique is

86
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,820
amazing. You've given hot dog to L

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,880
hot dog and L. It's hard to why don't we move it? No, because in this camera

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,700
don't see it. Stop. All right. All right. I'm going to focus up now. I'm going to

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,360
stop fucking around. Yeah, I'm not going to have fun anymore. I know this isn't

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,340
fun. This shit isn't supposed to be fun. It is not fun at all. Listen, listen,

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,560
listen journalism. I exactly I disclosed I disclosed who I'm in the pocket of and

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to be fair, but I need you guys to tell me your personal histories

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,620
to with hamburger and with hot dog. Well, I'm going to stay completely neutral on

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,240
the two. I'm going to say my first memory with I think the first memory I

95
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:51,240
remember is the shadow of a hot dog poking out in my bedroom when I was a kid. I saw

96
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,760
the shadow of a hot dog on the wall and it was kind of like a Batman type moment.

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
A cum moment?

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
No, cum to Jesus.

99
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Are you saying you got molested?

100
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,280
No, I'm not saying I got molested. I'm saying I saw the shadow of a hot dog like Batman

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,520
seeing a shadow of a bat.

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Are you saying shadow the hedgehog?

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Wow, did he see the full bat? I don't know. I thought he saw the shadow of a bat on the moon.

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,520
No, he got attacked by bats. So you got attacked by a hot dog?

105
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,520
No, I was attacked by burgers, but I saw the shadow of a hot dog that saved me.

106
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,520
And there's nothing about molestation in this.

107
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Why are you bringing up molesting on the hamburger vs. hot dog debate?

108
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Well, you brought up the shadow of a hot dog on your bedroom wall as a child.

109
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Yeah, which kind of makes it... it feels like that's what you're getting at.

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,520
And the way you were kind of laughing when you were saying it, it seemed like you were trying to...

111
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh, no, I was imagining a hot dog style Batman. But what is the

112
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,280
shadow?

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,360
Shadow is because Batman is a different hero. That's a shadow is Batman. Also,

114
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,000
what do you you're saying? Like you like you bats are a bat man. What do

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,280
you say? A shadow is a man of the night. Is that what you just said?

116
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,960
Just move on. I just we're not going to get anywhere at all. We're not

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,600
even going to get anywhere. This actually makes the most sense to me is

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,040
what I was trying to say is what makes the most sense to you. This what you're

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,600
trying to say is that a hot a hot dog as Batman on a plate you're making no sense

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,800
you're something is something I feel like I just went crazy trying to puzzle

121
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,760
out. Can you answer? Did you actually say a hot dog or a shadow is the Batman of

122
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
the night or did I

123
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,780
falling asleep? I heard that to a shadow. I believe that I invented that in my

124
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,720
head. Shadow is the Batman of the night. I don't know what I said. All I know is

125
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,860
that now we're here.

126
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:45,740
Okay, you are you have something so wrong with you that it need we need more

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,500
research to figure this out. Okay, so my

128
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,700
hot

129
00:06:50,700 --> 00:07:00,460
is guys. I ate a hot dog. First, I ate a hamburger, not until I was probably

130
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,460
seventeen years old. I ate veggie burgers. Here's what I used to eat.

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh my God, that's... I ate veggie burgers.

132
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:17,160
Yep. I ate veggie burgers and I ate... My dad used to make... He used to grill

133
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,740
pieces of pineapple and put that on a bun for me.

134
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,060
Interesting. Try to trick me.

135
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,060
That's a different... Thinking it's a hamburger. Is that a new kind of...

136
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,100
I eat my God damn fruit. I hate fruit. Is that a new kind of contender,

137
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,740
pineapple on a bun. We'll worry about that later. No, that's like it's like a

138
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,260
Hawaiian trick. So that's a type of a trick. They do yeah, it's a trick. They

139
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,420
do

140
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,980
burger. That's like in the UK. When they say you want a burger chicken burger,

141
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,100
yeah, I got fucked me up man. That completely ruined you. I think she

142
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,700
lightning at them. Yeah, she's like a chicken burger. Yeah, what the fuck you

143
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,420
know? I think every every every announcer should have to do this before

144
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,700
any type of fight or match. They should have to see what their favorite team is.

145
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,840
what happened, what they thought about the exact for the entire life yeah,

146
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,920
both judges and announcers should have to disclose their you know. I guess

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,020
while I'm thinking about it, I do I feel like I kind of made my bias seem to

148
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,560
swing pretty strongly towards hamburgers, but I will say I've made infinitely more

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,340
hot dogs for myself than I ever have

150
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,540
so

151
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,560
I may seem pretty biased toward hamburgers, but I also do I do fuck

152
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,140
with the hot dog, heavy, the hot dogs. I just cleared up my ears from air hot

153
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,540
dogs,

154
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,120
heavy.

155
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,180
All right, so

156
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,860
let's jump right in here, as you can see before us, we have wow,

157
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,780
before we have hamburger and we have hot dog.

158
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,420
Now, what's the first thing here? The first question

159
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Would aliens like it?

160
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Oh my God!

161
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,420
Wait, I think we're going to go in the other order.

162
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Wait, we're going actual alphabetical?

163
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
We're going in alphabetical. He's going reverse alphabetical.

164
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,420
That's what we agreed on.

165
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Also, I don't see that anywhere in the list. I don't know what you're talking about.

166
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,420
That's in there. It's just...

167
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Go alphabetical. We'll tackle that one later.

168
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,620
Okay, what's the first question? The first question about hamburger and hot dog.

169
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,420
What is their artistic potential?

170
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:34,700
Yep, artistic potential. So let's explain what that means. Guys, to an artist,

171
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,300
you might think an artist would look at this and say, "Well, this is how I

172
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,900
would create my art." An artist would look at this and say, "This is bullshit."

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,940
this is the subject of my next work. Yes, I'm going to make this Expo marker.

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,060
I'm going to make this or a paintbrush. I will build a paintbrush out of

175
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,100
hamburgers and hot dogs. Exactly. Which one will be my chosen tool? Which of

176
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,900
these will be the chisel with which I chisel? Okay. Or, for example, maybe are

177
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,260
there any famous works of art or paintings that feature a hot dog or a

178
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,340
hamburger and which are, have the better works of, the better opus? What I want

179
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:17,380
say now for artistic potential, I thought of this question as what can you like, which

180
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,780
one would be easier to use as a tool to make art? So my bias is leaning towards hot dog

181
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,820
because think about it, you could dip this in ink and then draw with the hot dog.

182
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,260
Uh huh, like a pen.

183
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,420
Like a pen. You could use the hot dog like a pen and then the bun as a piece of paper.

184
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,260
paper. It would just be a very wide. Yeah, which people do art with wide

185
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,840
nibs. I guess you're right. It's been done. It's been done by so many famous

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,240
artists. Well, here's my thing about burgers, though.

187
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,260
They got ketchup on them. Take the bun off.

188
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,380
It has a built in ink. It has built in. So yeah, I guess it's its own ink

189
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,900
pit. Well, in terms of using them as an artistic tool, maybe I would give it

190
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,400
to hot dogs, but when I'm thinking about famous paintings, famous artists, I

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,360
I do think that maybe the highest profile art that you could argue that a

192
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,300
hamburger might be present in is I feel like I'm at the museum all the time.

193
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,340
You know, yeah, of course, I'm always walking around and there's one artist

194
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,680
who I always look at her paintings. I'm always seeing a hamburger and that's

195
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Georgia O'keeffe.

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,260
I feel like she's always painting things that look like hamburgers,

197
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,720
especially these hamburgers. Yeah, I mean look at this. Look at this. This

198
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,700
looks like a Georgia O'keeffe. Yeah,

199
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,180
this is exactly how how Georgia O'Keeffe's work looks. We get a punch

200
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,640
in on that and I guess I'm afraid I can't. I can't think of you what it

201
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,660
really it would be like you know Georgia O'Keeffe. She it's like you took a

202
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,360
hamburger, but you didn't want to eat the bun, but you also didn't want to

203
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,260
rip the bun off. So you kind of fold just hold it back a little bit, a

204
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,780
little bit of the bun back

205
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,480
just like that kind of and maybe we move the pickle to be

206
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,140
up there right and it's something like that.

207
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,180
this thing like that. So this is the kind of burger that she's eating.

208
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,700
She's like a

209
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,900
that's a

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:19,600
yeah, you know what I mean? That's classic Americana. I can't help myself.

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,620
Oh, my God, no, okay, that looks the most like a Georgia O'Keeffe. Now, oh,

212
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,280
my God, that is good. Yeah,

213
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,540
I want one so bad me too. I'm home, but I have to wait. I have to wait till

214
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,840
to end when we decide the winner to some of the questions where you actually

215
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,380
need to eat them and so jumping ahead. So I think because of the Georgia O'Keefe

216
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,740
point,

217
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,380
my argument is we give this point to hamburger. Hamburger wins. Agreed? Wow!

218
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,420
I think I would agree with that. I agree with that as well. Hamburger wins.

219
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,480
What's the next topic? Bun type.

220
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,660
Alright, so far we have

221
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,360
hot dog one, hamburger eleven.

222
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,140
Those are Tally Marks, Caleb, that's two.

223
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,020
You call me Tally what now?

224
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,060
Tally Mark was my neighbor growing up. You better shut your mouth.

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,420
Bun type, I mean this one's cut and dry,

226
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,140
like the buns themselves, cut and dry. Yeah, I'm going to have to give this to

227
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,140
hot dog personally, because hot dog has somewhat, somehow hot dog has more bun,

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,180
that I mind the bun less. There's more bun on a hot dog. Also, hamburger buns

229
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,020
could also be used for chicken sandwiches, regular. It's not a

230
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,580
PB and J, PB and J. I've only made a PB and J and a hot dog bun four

231
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,020
times. This has been my speaking of canvas. This is my canvas for a peanut

232
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,400
butter and jelly. The hot dog bun is a genius

233
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,920
business move because you're never going to buy a hot dog bun and say maybe

234
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,360
I should put chicken or exactly salad. Exactly. I'm surprised these because

235
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,920
okay, so I bought these hot dogs and I bought these hot dog buns and they were

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,760
different brands and I was at the store and I was like why the fuck would they

237
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,480
not just sell these two together in a combo pack and shit they should the dog

238
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,880
in the bone, the dog in the bun yeah, why the hell side of the bug and sell

239
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,460
them out of a restaurant or what the hell's going on with you buy a package

240
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,780
of six hot dogs you buy a package of a buns what the fuck well, that's why I

241
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,160
was I was avoiding that by get I got eight dogs and eight buns y'all that's a

242
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,560
genius way to avoid it is by picking the pack. I think the right amount yeah,

243
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,580
epic. So it's kind of my that's a little bit of a food hack. Yeah, life hack for

244
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,820
you. All right, so hot dog wins that one. You think hot dog wins that one? We're

245
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,620
giving it to hot dog. We are giving it to hot dog. Unless you have you have

246
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,420
evidence against

247
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,580
hamburger buns or evidence supporting hamburger. I don't have a I don't know.

248
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,940
I yeah, a hamburger bun. It's just a bun. It's not even a it's not you could

249
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,940
not even iconic as a as a no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

250
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,060
It's a roll, really.

251
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
It, yeah.

252
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
Hot dog wins.

253
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,300
So that's it's two and two right?

254
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
It's neck and neck already.

255
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
All tied up.

256
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,340
Holy fucking shit.

257
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
It's already so contentious.

258
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,740
Wait, what the hell's gonna happen next?

259
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,540
What can, what can happen next is the age old question.

260
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,860
Can you draw it fast?

261
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,580
Can you draw it fast?

262
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,580
Um.

263
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Hamburger.

264
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,860
Hot dog.

265
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I think hot dog wins this. Yeah. Well, let's see. Let me see. I'll demonstrate.

266
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,360
Try both. Here, take out your stopwatch. You know your stopwatch? Yes. Actually,

267
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,700
Julio, you have a stopwatch, right? No, no, you time it. I do. I do have a

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,260
stopwatch actually. Hold up. Hold up. Okay. I wish you had a pocket watch on

269
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,380
the chain right now. Me too. Tell me when to start and I'll count it down.

270
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,780
I'm gonna do hot dog first. Okay. Okay. Ready? Three, two, one.

271
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,780
one

272
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,260
okay. That was two point four one seconds.

273
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,420
All right ready. Oh, I forgot the bun. That's okay. That's

274
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,140
together. We'll add them together. All right ready. Yeah, three two one

275
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:10,020
done. Okay, so total is about five seconds. Yeah, let's shave off like a

276
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,340
couple of milliseconds.

277
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,520
I did as I was just a hot dog and just the bun. It was that simple. All right,

278
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,780
let's do burger. All right, ready, ready three two one. Okay, so let's start with

279
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,680
this top button

280
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,520
and you can't forget right that says to me. See you cannot forget. Here come the

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,900
sesame seeds. There's millions of these. So then first layer. How do you build a

282
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,020
first layer is going to be always lettuce? You

283
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,620
let us is coming in. Okay, that's good. That looks good man, and then we're

284
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,160
to do a big, big beefy beefsteak tomato. Yes. Here comes the little edges of the

285
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:53,040
stripes on the tomato. Tomato stripes. Yeah. And the red onion. We're going to put two pickles.

286
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah. Pickles are going to go up there. A couple of seeds on there. Yeah.

287
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,840
A couple of sesame seeds on the pickle. And here's a couple of onions. Oh,

288
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,800
there's an onion. Red onion. Red onion. Red onion. The piece de resistance.

289
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,840
The burger bun. Oh, and that's a bun. And that's bigger than the bun.

290
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
the

291
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,640
Patty

292
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,840
where's the burger?

293
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,040
Where's the

294
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
big

295
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,540
okay,

296
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,940
okay. So this button I'll turn this into it. We don't wait. Big Mac.

297
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,700
no it's a big, big style. It's big style, so put another put the patty

298
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,420
underneath, then the patty goes under here and what's on the patty,

299
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:48,540
beautiful brown char and what else is on the patty? Sesame seeds. Here comes

300
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,900
some sesame seeds and then what I win the sauce. Oh, what kind of sauce

301
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,820
secret and then here's the bottom bun. Yes, all right, stop the time one

302
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,420
minute and thirty eight seconds

303
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,980
hot dog, hot dog wins this by country mile guy.

304
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeah,

305
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,620
that was a flawless victory. Let me erase these as beautiful as they are. I

306
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,400
can't believe I forgot to draw the damn

307
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:24,740
you know. Maybe if you hadn't forgot the bottom bun, hamburger could have won.

308
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,540
It would have been at least a little. It would have been close. Yeah, I hate

309
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,580
This next category has subcategories.

310
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,580
So, can you feed it to a baby?

311
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Hamburger, no. Hot dog, if you cut it up into maybe an octopus shape.

312
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
But you shouldn't.

313
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
You shouldn't really feed it.

314
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,580
It's not shouldn't, it's can.

315
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Yeah.

316
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Can, so this goes to hot dog.

317
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Okay.

318
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Hot dog wins.

319
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,780
Can you feed it to an animal? I think both of them get a point.

320
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,020
Yeah, we'll do that.

321
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,580
Hamburger. Hot dog. Hamburger. Hot dog. Wins. Hamburger. Wins. Hot dog. Wins.

322
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,100
God, this smell is really getting to me.

323
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,420
Me too.

324
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,260
All right. I want all this food.

325
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,620
Can you feed it to an old geezer on life support?

326
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,500
On life support? I don't think either of them would probably get it,

327
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
but definitely not hot dogs. That'd be a choking hazard.

328
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,780
Yeah. Hamburger.

329
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,740
How would a hot dog be a choking hazard and a hamburger wouldn't?

330
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,180
Because it's a little stiffer.

331
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,980
you can grind them up though with a mortar and pestle.

332
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,380
If you grind up fucking anything with a molcajete, it doesn't matter.

333
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,540
That's true. Thank you for saying molcajete.

334
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,860
If you put anything into a motherfucking molcajete, then yeah, it doesn't matter.

335
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,220
As long as you season it well with rice and salt.

336
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,980
This one is a stalemate.

337
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,460
What did he say?

338
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,340
This one is a stalemate.

339
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,460
He said thank you for representing Spanish culture.

340
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:42,940
Oh, okay.

341
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,340
Mm-hmm.

342
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:43,500
Yeah.

343
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
That guy said molcajete.

344
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,060
This one is a stalemate, I think, the old geezer on life support.

345
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,260
I don't have a button for stalemate.

346
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,340
Well, I'm going to give both of them zero points for that one.

347
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,060
Yeah. All right.

348
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,520
Oh, I actually have something that I could put for that.

349
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,020
That's got to hurt

350
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,340
because it would kill the guy.

351
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,460
It was like no points.

352
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,700
Yeah.

353
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,180
Oh, that's got to hurt.

354
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,940
You think that's the hamburger would be like this?

355
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,500
You'd be like, that's got to hurt.

356
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,980
And then the hot dog would be like this hot dog.

357
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,540
And wait, then they could do this.

358
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,820
No, we had that hamburger, that hamburger, man.

359
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,340
That's making it look sexual.

360
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,900
OK,

361
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,900
it's not flawless.

362
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,500
flawless, not flawless. I can tell you that. Oh, my God, I'm drooling.

363
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,740
Oh,

364
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,780
so hungry. All right, I got so hungry when I sat down here. The next one, you

365
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,700
know what I could get the microwave. Can we just really for just a second for

366
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,320
just a second guys? It'll blow the circuit for just a second. Can we

367
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,180
appreciate that? We officially have the best job in the world

368
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:50,100
sitting in front of four or eight beautiful hot dogs and six beautiful

369
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,680
hamburgers. Oh sitting here getting a rate and review and talk about this.

370
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,320
This is a guy's paradise. Yeah, a male cast about list wins yeah and we are

371
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,760
win

372
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,840
this next one. Here is color

373
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,280
press wrong button

374
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,400
press on button inside water. My mouth press on button.

375
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,880
I think that I'm going to give this to the color of a burger is so much more

376
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
appetizing them. The color of a hot dog. Black don't crack man.

377
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,380
What? Black don't crack. What are you saying? Hamburgers are black.

378
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,760
Alright, they're kind of more brown, but... What? They're black as night.

379
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,440
Hamburger. Hamburger wins. I want to throw a... Maybe this will come up

380
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,000
later. You're giving it to hamburger? Hamburger wins. Give it to hamburger

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,120
with an asterisk because they're... I don't have a button for asterisk. Well,

382
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,100
that doesn't really matter. You can give it to hamburger with an asterisk

383
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,240
because I'm going to I'm going to throw a wrench in it a little bit later

384
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,400
when we get to the oh, I think I get to the arms. Well, let's oh, let's not

385
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,500
spoil anything. Okay, all right, number

386
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,860
the next one is condiments.

387
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:10,100
Ketchup.

388
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,740
Sexy

389
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay, so

390
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,740
ketchup ketchup ketchup.

391
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,240
Oh man, they both can have ketchup. Yeah, and by the way, we're on another

392
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,940
from Chicago. If you're from Chicago hot dog and we're on an entire another

393
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,840
level y'all

394
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,840
and other podcasts. I'm telling you

395
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,180
ketchup. That's right. Yeah, nobody's debating hot dogs. Not a single not a

396
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,780
single. No, but you listen to this one and you're like hot dog. Yeah, because

397
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,960
It's such a great episode. I'm so excited. All right. So I guess they have the same condiments.

398
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,960
They're the same. I guess that's another stalemate. Well, well, because that's the thing. Some

399
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,300
people believe that a that a hot dog should never have ketchup. Speaking of your microphone,

400
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,400
some people believe that a hot dog should never have ketchup. Not like that. I just

401
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,880
think that maybe there are some differences. Like, for example, what what's I list the

402
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,660
ingredients of a Chicago dog right now. What's that? I was going to that was going to go

403
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,260
go for condiments. The only thing color was going to that. So you look at a

404
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,400
burger, right? You see the stack of color, you see a Chicago dog, you see the

405
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,980
stack of colors. That's what the asterisk was going to be for.

406
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,580
Okay, I don't know. I don't know why you'd, why are you?

407
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,980
Chicago dog has a lot of color on it, but a lot of condiments as well. It has

408
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,620
neon green relish. Chicago dogs. Okay. So, would you ever put relish on a

409
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,100
hamburger? Yeah, sometimes. I don't know if I've ever had relish on a hamburger.

410
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,380
I have it, it's not good. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

411
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,180
you have not had relish on a hamburger, but you've had

412
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:05,460
McDonald's secret sauce and In-N-Out secret sauce on a hamburger, which I

413
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,340
think both of them have relish in. They have pickles chopped up. Really? Which

414
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,900
is what relish is. Ketchup. Yeah. I didn't know that.

415
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,940
Playing what? Ketchup.

416
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,740
For the sake of never hearing that again, I think that we... This has to

417
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,940
be a tie. This is a tie yeah that's fine with me. Was that you was that your

418
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:30,020
feelings getting hurt because I said I didn't want to hear the catch up anymore.

419
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,180
That's why I said that's going to hurt. No, I just was playing different sounds

420
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,820
okay, pressing random buttons. Next one is

421
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,260
craziness. Oh wait shit.

422
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,660
This keeps happening. This is an honest

423
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,620
playing this flat. I'm not doing it to be funny. I have two pages. I'm flipping

424
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,360
between here. I'm getting confused. I put the splat on the arrow

425
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,660
craziness. I just have to switch quickly craziness, craziness.

426
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,460
I'm going to get okay. So here's what I'm thinking with this. Have you guys

427
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,060
ever seen these fucking burgers where they're so insane you they have eggs on

428
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,260
the burger right through it. This is this is this is a burger.

429
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,660
Not even they literally make burgers in restaurants where you cut it. It

430
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,460
explodes yeah yeah and a bear on top of it. They put no under it ain't

431
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,860
doing that with the hot dog. The craziest hot dog you could ever see is

432
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,420
this hot dog is extra long yeah. Oh look. We made a long. Yeah, it's long

433
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,700
hamburger wins long. Oh yeah, shut up. Come try our long hot dog. Yeah,

434
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,980
they have pink hamburgers.

435
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,380
There's a flaw. That's right for him.

436
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:42,700
All right, hamburger. What's next next is customization.

437
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,100
I feel like we almost just did that one. We just that's kind of the same.

438
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,800
These are maybe we can skip that one and go to the next one. One of the

439
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,700
top customization options would have to be

440
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:01,020
how much, what shape you put it in. If you do a smiley, what ketchup brand you

441
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,540
guys like?

442
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,860
I'm not a huge ketchup fan. If I can be honest, I don't like ketchup that much.

443
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,020
I use I use Heinz, but there's this new one that I got that it's called the

444
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,060
primal kitchen and it's pretty good.

445
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Primal kitchen? Oh shit, does it have like no oil in it or some shit?

446
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Yeah, yeah it's one of those.

447
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
I bet it's so good.

448
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
I think I find it in my house probably.

449
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
I like nice ass ketchup. Dude, that makes sense.

450
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
I get this one ketchup called like Sir Kingsley

451
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,060
or some shit. I want to make my own ketchup at home.

452
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I never use ketchup so when I buy it.

453
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Sir Kensington. That's what it is, Sir Kensington.

454
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I know exactly the one. It's good as fuck.

455
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
Uh huh. It's actually good as fuck.

456
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
They have a spicy one. Uh, alright.

457
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
So this next topic.

458
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,320
ready for this title card. Yeah, you really need to be on this title card

459
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,240
really. This one, this one is, this is the most important one, I would say.

460
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,540
Does it look like a turd?

461
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:57,380
Okay, so

462
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,340
this might seem so cut and dry. Yeah, but, but, part which part of the pun,

463
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:11,020
but oh, but well that's good and pardon the bun yeah, but my buns part of my

464
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,460
buns

465
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,820
you might think a way to figure they put their inside wait hold on they're both

466
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,420
between buns hold up they both oh my God listen. Oh shit, a burger may look

467
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,820
like a turd like it look you know what it looks like it looks like a texture

468
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:30,940
pack for a in a video. You actually you wrapped it around the turd texture on

469
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,060
to a frisbee. Yeah

470
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,900
yeah exactly a turd texture got loaded onto a frisbee in a gary's mod server

471
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,580
yeah but guys this one over here this hot dog

472
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,620
somebody accidentally put a frisbee texture on a turd to a to a blind to a

473
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,540
color blind man. This is a turd guy color blind person. I'm holding a turd

474
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,300
in my finger right now. Yeah, this is as close to a turd as you can legally

475
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,940
went to your eyes on the street holding especially especially maybe if you well,

476
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,480
what do you guys think if you have more turdy, if you grill it or you boil it

477
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,420
definitely the color for grill, but I don't know how many of my turds have

478
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,060
grill marks that are dark only on certain you know, you know what the

479
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,120
best the number one way to make it look like a turd microwave it and it gets

480
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,180
those bubbles. We have a microwave stop trying to get us to use the microwave

481
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:24,040
man and stop. This is a very smelly meat that you're what am I doing? I'm doing

482
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,140
what you're doing with the pen dog.

483
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:32,020
We've given this to hot dog. What way is it a point if it does look like a turd

484
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:38,760
our point of it's a point. If it looks like a turn, okay, so yeah, what are we

485
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,220
at here? Oh, we'll wait till the end of Canada. We'll wait till the end of

486
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,440
Canada. I like the number. Ali marks go past five. Oh my God, my fingers. I'm

487
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,200
just doing is doing risk free style on it. I'm just messing around.

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,580
I forget I forgot how to do that. Yeah, I forgot that you're supposed to. Well,

489
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,180
that's fine. Yeah, we'll worry about it when it comes to the next one. I'll

490
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,160
start crossing them. Now that's a good point. Next one is ease of access.

491
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,520
So this means how easy it is to get a hot dog. I mean in the streets of New

492
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,720
York, it depends where you are, depends where you are, but you can get in

493
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,960
Times Square. You can get a hot dog pretty much anywhere, but now with food

494
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,520
trucks,

495
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,760
you can get a burger. Listen, listen, I'm not I'm not with the fucking hipster

496
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,880
New York food cart, food truck bullshit. Yeah, I'm part of America, blue collar

497
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,500
grew up in a computer family. Yeah, we were out in the circuit board farms.

498
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,300
Yeah, every damn day, farming, just trying to try to make ends meet, trying

499
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,260
to make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars last a month. Yeah, it's hard.

500
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,300
It's really hard days. And let me tell you a working man. It's easy to make a

501
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,620
hot dog, but if you're talking about going out and getting one, it's a

502
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,500
hamburger all the way. Yeah, not a lot of restaurants have a hot dog on the

503
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,160
than you know. You are not going to get a hot dog in somewhere the salt in the

504
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,920
earth kind of town like Cambridge mass. No shot man. You no way, no how not even

505
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,980
at tasty burger or move. Yeah, straight out of straight out of kindle

506
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,960
motherfucking square.

507
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,980
You're going to get a motherfucking. I think you're getting anything but

508
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,200
clover foods. I'm kind of nice as oh fancy hot dog. No, you're getting a

509
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,800
burger, but my mom sat me to sat me and my my twelve siblings down on the table

510
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
and said times are hard today. Yeah today

511
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,540
times are hard today. They're going to be okay tomorrow, but today it's tough

512
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,300
and all I have for you guys. I was able to go to the Alamo draft house and I

513
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,820
got you some to go or got some to go orders from there, and that's all we

514
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,920
have to eat for and so that's all we have to eat for a couple hours.

515
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,580
Pace yourself. This is all we have for just a few hours. Some of these we can

516
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,780
really save the toothpicks. Yes, please save the please kids save the toothpicks,

517
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,660
because we need those to do a group gold

518
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,860
so we're giving this to hamburger

519
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,960
wins. Why don't you tell count him up right now and then start cross? Don't

520
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,460
worry about the the counting. He's got it under control. I trust him. Okay,

521
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,640
he's got the you you you you keep your eyes on your page here. All right, well

522
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,780
the next one we all got we all have a job today. I'm sounds. This is why I

523
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,700
feel so good today, because I have a purpose and guys we are thirty minutes

524
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,840
mean this is going to be the longest episode we've ever done. It can't be

525
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,420
because I have somewhere to be. He has to go get ink on his body. That's true.

526
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,020
Ease of access. That is what we just did. It was the one we just did. Now

527
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,100
easiness to make.

528
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,220
Where did I go? Okay. I think this is a clear. Yeah, this is pretty. This is

529
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,140
clearly hot dog because so these hamburgers, I know they look homemade,

530
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,380
but I didn't make these guys. What? These came from McDonald's. Another bite.

531
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,780
Can I have one? Yeah.

532
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,980
time to eat

533
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,480
time to eat hamburger

534
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,080
flawless victory.

535
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,780
All right,

536
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,680
so

537
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,780
he's just to make a good hamburger is so hard to hamburger is so hard to make

538
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,680
that. I just I was like I'm not doing that shit.

539
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,280
So I made so I made the hot dogs. You buy the hot dog. You buy the bun. You

540
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,680
put the bun in the hot things to buy. It's only just a cold dog.

541
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:30,520
They didn't know that. They didn't know that. That's gotta hurt. Yeah, that hurt. That hurt.

542
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,200
So we're going to give this to Hot Dog. Hot Dog wins. Alright, now I'm learning about

543
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,680
tally marks. You do one across the corner like so. Good job. And there we are. Thank

544
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,720
you work. All right, next

545
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,400
exchange rate.

546
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,880
So how many hamburgers before we eat? How many hot dogs before we ate these?

547
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,440
Right? How many were there in the there's Okay, so there's six. There's

548
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,360
eight hot dogs.

549
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,160
And if these if the scales are even well, if they were even they're

550
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,120
definitely I dropped my

551
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,720
I throw some burger on the list.

552
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,720
If this these were supposed to be even scales, right?

553
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,320
I mean, I don't think they're hot.

554
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,620
They were supposed to say this burger didn't want to spend more

555
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,820
than $30 on the I don't think that I don't think they were

556
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,520
okay. Wait

557
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,920
in terms of maybe we already have this on here,

558
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,420
but in terms of

559
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,020
exchange rate,

560
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,320
I will say these hot dogs hot dog and bun

561
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,520
cost $8

562
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,720
for eight of them.

563
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,120
So that's a dollar each

564
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,300
These hamburgers, which I got them delivered because I'm too far away from

565
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,960
McDonald's, but if I didn't get them delivered...

566
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,220
I could have gotten picked them up.

567
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,680
The total would have been $3.29 per.

568
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,440
So in a money sense, it's three hot dogs per hamburger, a little over three

569
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,500
hot dogs. But in terms of how many of these hot dogs,

570
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,740
if it was a school lunch situation... So wait, if it's three hot dogs per

571
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,300
hamburger does that mean that I would even say that that even beyond money

572
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,700
that holds up to I'm going to eat one hamburger but I'll eat two or three

573
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,420
hot dogs.

574
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,460
Yeah, maybe not these specific hamburger.

575
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,900
Yeah, does that what we're supposed to say for exchange? So who wins this one?

576
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:26,900
hamburger, it's worth more. Okay. That's what I was asking. Yeah, higher value.

577
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,300
Yeah.

578
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,580
All right, we're gonna go.

579
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,420
Alright, the next one is fan base.

580
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:41,500
So we've all been in this situation with some shit like Odd Future where you're like, "Wait,

581
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:47,620
they make the funniest, dopest fucking rap in the world, but these fans are cringe gay

582
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,780
guys that wear pink."

583
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,860
So that's what I wanted to get at with this.

584
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Who has the...

585
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,740
Also like just to give another example, for example, Rick and Morty, I have a lot of fans

586
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,620
that think the show is funny that are just wanting to laugh and like watch TV and laugh

587
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,620
at cartoons.

588
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,500
And they don't care about the deeper meaning.

589
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,860
The deeper voices on the show and what they say.

590
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,380
For example, Rake.

591
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
They only care about the high pitched voices.

592
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,700
So who do you think has the more chill fan base?

593
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Probably hot dogs.

594
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Probably hot dogs, right?

595
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,060
Hot dog because burgers, burger fans are going out to different restaurants and they're like,

596
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,860
oh my God, you have the biggest burger and I had to try it.

597
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,860
There's no such thing as a hot dog challenge.

598
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,740
Yeah, there isn't.

599
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,740
They don't do that.

600
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,180
People don't do hot dog challenges.

601
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,900
There's no restaurant on earth where it's...

602
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
What do you do?

603
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
Burger challenge.

604
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
People do.

605
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
People eat big burgers all the time.

606
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,340
Nobody's eating 50, 60 hot dogs.

607
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Right.

608
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
That would never happen.

609
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,220
So with that alone, I think that the burger fan base is more cringe, but I think that the

610
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,820
hot dog fan base can be maybe a little more. They're more game. Keep me annoying. They're

611
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,200
more maybe I like talking about hot dogs all the damn time and they think they're special

612
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,440
for liking hot dogs. Plus they're like what like you like that's an entry like a Chicago

613
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,220
dog. That's an entry level. Oh, you never had a Chicago dog. Oh, you never had one. Oh,

614
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,780
Lowkey just remembered that there is literally a fucking contest where they eat like

615
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,500
60 fucking hot dogs

616
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:32,100
Yeah, because of because of that because I fucking hate that that 4th of July bullshit so much that it's going to burn

617
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,140
I think it's going to burn

618
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,860
I feel like burger has a better fan base just because of that that one and burgers are not taken up

619
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:43,740
the one the one day a year where we get to celebrate our beautiful nation.

620
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,740
That's what you mentioned is burgers on hot dogs and hot dogs on hamburger

621
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,860
hot burgers. Wait, wait, actually you have final say on this. I do think

622
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,900
you're okay. That is your birthday happens on your birthday. It is your

623
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,580
birthday, so you do get. I think it's a class on fourth of July. The hot dog

624
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,020
eating contest. I'm not so much a fan of, but

625
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,500
you eat both a hamburger and a hot dog on fourth of July. That's pretty

626
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,100
classic or as some would say you eat a hot dog on hamburger and a hamburger on

627
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,820
hot dog day.

628
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,460
Yeah, so I just said I think I maybe said something a little more

629
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,300
sophisticated. Okay, really? Yeah, maybe a little more eloquent than that, but

630
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,420
you know I personally if it's just coming down to fan bases yeah and I'm

631
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,660
leaving my birthday out of it.

632
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,700
I my vote. I think that hamburger

633
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,820
has the cringer fan base. If it's about cringiness, if it's based on cringiness,

634
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,980
but I think it's based on based on. I think hot dog fan hot dog fan base is

635
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,740
more based,

636
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,560
not saying hot dog. So who's the winner is what we're asking. I think I'll give

637
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,060
it to I think I'll give it to hot dog. All right, yeah, hot dog wins. All right,

638
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,780
what's next flavor? Okay, we already just tasted them, so we're in a perfect

639
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,300
place to

640
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,040
to talk about the flavor. We tasted one of them. You know what's really good?

641
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,060
Yeah, all right, Caleb. Hey, Caleb,

642
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,340
give me the

643
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,640
cold

644
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,220
hot. Why me? He's the one who likes nasty stuff. No, go ahead and eat it.

645
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,420
You're the flavor. Oh my God, it actually smells. It smells like how's the legs on

646
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,540
just eat it sideways like pretend it's a burger and eat it sideways.

647
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,820
Oh, it does it actually does have legs. Yeah, it's really sticking to the side

648
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:33,780
and the terror terror to our I mean it doesn't taste bad. It's a hot dog dog. It

649
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:40,100
tastes like cold fat. Yeah, it is better when you cook it, but you have to you

650
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,380
can eat a hot dog cold,

651
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,740
which is interesting. Okay, isn't it funny? It's hot in the name. Yeah,

652
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,860
that's rather. So basically, basically the what it boils down to is pigs

653
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,140
versus cows. Yeah, I don't like boiled hot dogs either though. Okay, then

654
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,180
that trash. But if you had a boiled burger, would you like that? Dude, that

655
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
Actually that tastes like a fucking tire.

656
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,220
Yeah, I think it goes to burger.

657
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
It has like an awful chemical aftertaste.

658
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Which hot dogs did you buy?

659
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
Sabret.

660
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Yeah, that's the problem.

661
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,220
You gotta cook those ones.

662
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
You gotta cook all of them, they're fucking hot dogs.

663
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Those ones taste good when they're cooked.

664
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,220
Don't even red me up.

665
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
Don't even red me. It's pink bro.

666
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,220
Don't pink me.

667
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,220
You fucking pinked me.

668
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
Alright, this one's to burger.

669
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,540
Now we will get into the future one thousand years from now.

670
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,000
Wow!

671
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,820
What are these two things? Because guys, there's been a hundred years of

672
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:46,060
discovery doing the hamburgers and hot dogs. No more ketchup. No more ketchup in

673
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:51,460
the future. No, no, no, no. Where will we- will we even recognize this shit? I

674
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,020
bet that they- I bet that- All Tomorrow's style. What are these going to look

675
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,780
like? Yeah, I've got something to say.

676
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,020
that I think that in the future hot dog and you and listen when you I think

677
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,520
that one of these will have a square shape and it's going to be hot dogs.

678
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,580
Who's

679
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:17,960
just gurgled me that hot dog is sitting well and my throat made it. I think that

680
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,280
we will see square hot dogs in the future. You can't even barely find these

681
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,920
on Google nowadays. It looks like you're talking about like square like a

682
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,920
Japanese watermelon. I don't even know what it could possibly mean, but a

683
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,420
hamburger is a classic shape right, but and people do squared hamburgers here.

684
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,820
Wendy people do hamburgers yeah, there's already square hamburgers you're right,

685
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,460
so I feel like it's gonna take us a thousand years to get this square hot

686
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,740
dog. That's crazy. I think you know what I think is going to become the standard

687
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:50,040
in a well. This is more. This is all this is kind of a subjective question. I

688
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,360
don't matter. These are all subjective questions. What do you mean this one?

689
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,380
that we're judging. Well, this one specifically is like we don't have

690
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,340
enough. Let him say what he said. Thanks. Sorry. What I think is you

691
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,620
want to get look up some facts right now. Can you look up what a hot dog

692
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,700
will look like in the future? Go future 1000 years and maybe we'll get

693
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,820
future future hot dog. Well, actually, I do this might be helpful if we

694
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,340
see what it's going to look like

695
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,780
three hot dogs, three ways. Okay, what the hell? What the hell is it?

696
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,740
Turned into a cake, some kind of squeezed hot dog. It's a green hot

697
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:24,380
dog. It's a green springy hot dog. Oh my God, it looks like a coiled snake.

698
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,180
Here's what I think is the future of hot dog and people have already caught on

699
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,180
to this, but it's not the norm and I think a thousand years from now will be

700
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,980
the norm of butterflied hot dog. Oh, when you cut it in half and put it on

701
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,340
the grill, yes, a hot burger. Why is the hot burger not a more popular thing

702
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,860
outside of my dad's house? I don't know. It's good as fuck in my dad's house.

703
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:45,420
It's one of the most popular foods that is a mad that and sourdough toast.

704
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,180
There was a lot of food like that growing up where they were kind of my

705
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,020
foods and they never really popped off for the rest of the world. Yeah,

706
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,560
what's it called frosted mini wheat, frosted mini puffins,

707
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,980
pop in a butter puff. Oh my God, I loved peanut butter, but our puffins with

708
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,460
soy milk. All right, well, we're getting out of you're getting out of that.

709
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,660
You're getting off topic. Oh yeah, you're right. What will a hamburger look

710
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,860
like? Hamburg up future hamburger,

711
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,380
and book up a future ham

712
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,580
from the creamery

713
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,660
future burger. Okay, we'll be a city. Okay, this will be called

714
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,100
hamburger. Clearly wins. Yeah, yeah, hamburger. Hamburger is

715
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,460
gonna become a city based on. Yeah, right next getting sick

716
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:36,100
from it with a question mark. So I already shared my story. I

717
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,500
think you're more likely to get feel sick from a hot dog than a

718
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,460
ham. We have an event with you. You got sick

719
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,500
just now. I didn't get sick. I gargled sick. You gargled gargling is sickness.

720
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,020
No, it's not. I think that

721
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:57,900
when it comes, I think hot dogs are more likely to make you sick. I think I

722
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,620
agree, but

723
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,260
could be

724
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,580
it could be cooked rare. You're so right. That's what I was about to say.

725
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,340
Maybe you're so right. Yeah, you could literally get food.

726
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:15,140
I just connected this. I never connected this board. This is probably why

727
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,580
because a hamburger can be pink in the middle and that pinkness can make you

728
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,660
sick. Yes, a hot dog is all pink. She it's only to pay, but it's they

729
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,500
probably make it from the pink from the burger when it's not cooked enough.

730
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,260
Yeah, my God,

731
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,020
by God,

732
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,940
that's you've made a discovery.

733
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,200
So who wins did something about

734
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,100
this is a hamburger and a hot dog at noon on a work day is really making me

735
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,240
feel fucking crazy. Yeah, I have I have so many coming on so many meat

736
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,640
chemicals are blasting. All right, let's call it. Let's call it a draw.

737
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,880
Let's call it a draw. Move forward. Move forward. Go a little. We will

738
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
move on to gift ability.

739
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,680
What would you rather receive as a gift? A dog? All right.

740
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,380
That was too quick.

741
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:09,520
Hand feel. Now this one is subjective. There's an asterisk next to it

742
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,980
for some reason. Don't remember why. Let's see. Here, wait. Close your eyes and see if

743
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,720
you can tell which one is which. See, okay, you can tell a hot dog. That's actually perfect

744
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,140
because you can tell a hot dog is a hot dog. This could be a chicken sandwich. That could

745
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,220
be literally anything. Or just a bun. It could be a hockey puck that was in the microwave

746
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:34,100
for a few minutes and melted. Yeah. Okay, hot dog wins. Hot dog definitely has the iconic

747
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:38,200
Hand feel history history. All right.

748
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,400
So they both came out at the same time. That's a draw. No, wait, that's not. No,

749
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,080
no, we can dig into this one. Okay, so hamburgers were made at that one

750
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,400
fucking place in

751
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,240
Hamburg all, but no, it's not. It's not from Hamburg Germany. No, they're not

752
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,000
from Germany. Hamburgers are from there's this one

753
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,080
place in I think Albany or some shit. Oh, is it in? You mean

754
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Connecticut, Connecticut, where they put them in the broiler. Yes, yes, and they

755
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
boil them. They broil them. They don't boil them. They broil them. They have

756
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,800
these like 120 year old. Okay, it actually came from hamburger Charlie in

757
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,840
Wisconsin and go back one page. It says that a history of the burger says from

758
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:26,280
ancient Rome 18 60s versus 18 85. So I guess hot dog wins because that one

759
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,800
first hamburger came from ancient Rome. What's the title of the article? A

760
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,560
the history of the burger from ancient Rome to the well, but they're just

761
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,040
they're just saying that they made a meat sandwich. The burger that we know

762
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,080
today, okay, is the that's the signifier here. Did you guys watch the founder?

763
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,800
No, this was a good movie. Okay, next is holiday variants. Hamburger wins.

764
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,680
Okay, holiday.

765
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,920
Yeah, put a tally up for hot dog

766
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,920
holiday variants. Santa Claus burger. Yeah, we all know the Santa Claus burger

767
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:05,520
when you use ketchup as the red on his suit. I will say you could draw stuff

768
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,120
with the ketchup more easily on a hamburger. Yes, a hot dog itself is

769
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,520
almost a holiday variant. We've all had a Valentine's Day hot dog.

770
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:19,020
Hot dog. Valentine's dog. I've had a hot dog on every holiday except for

771
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,320
Christmas. I think the holiday of burgers is burger fest. Yeah, that's

772
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,520
true. There is a holiday already. All right. All right. Give it burger

773
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,880
hamburger wins. All right, these two I think can coincide with each other. How fun is it

774
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:42,560
to eat and how often can you eat it?

775
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,560
I could honestly eat a hamburger probably every day. Yeah, 100%.

776
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,120
Hot dog every week. But what is more fun?

777
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:57,120
You can go through a phase of eating hot dogs really often, but if you don't stop, if the

778
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,280
if the phase doesn't go away, you'll die. There's also the thing about a

779
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,560
hamburger is like you can eat one that's like fully loaded on a bun and shit,

780
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,920
but then if you wanna eat something a little healthier, you make it at home,

781
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,800
you do like a lean ground beef, you put it on... Don't even, don't even talk

782
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,200
about the lettuce wrap. No, no, leave the lettuce wrap. Leave the lettuce wrap

783
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,320
at home. No, no, no, no. I like this. I do this a lot. Don't even. Sometimes,

784
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,040
you know what I do? I make a... You guys are gonna think this is gross.

785
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,040
I make a burger, I put it on some white rice, I... That's Hawaiian or Filipino

786
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,500
I boil some broccoli, I put some sour cream on the burger and I put some hot sauce.

787
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,500
This is not...

788
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
That's strange, man.

789
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,500
That is strange.

790
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,500
It's really good.

791
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
And salt.

792
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
Oh, you put salt in it?

793
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,860
I was thinking we were talking about a burger joy from Jollibee.

794
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,860
No way.

795
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Yeah.

796
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,860
Burger on rice with sour cream and pepper sauce.

797
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
Burger on rice.

798
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,860
Yo, let me get a burger over rice.

799
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,860
Yo, Oc, let me get a burger over rice.

800
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,860

801
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,860
Burger over rights.

00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,860
You guys, this next one is actually...

804
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:51,860
Wait, who won that?

805
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,660
burger over rights. Burger over rights, please. You guys, this next one is

806
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,580
actually... Wait, who won that? Me with my delicious recipe. Hamburger wins.

807
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,820
Hamburger wins because you can eat it often and it's more fun to eat.

808
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,620
Nice. Good one. Thank you. You guys, this next one is ingredients.

809
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,980
Are we saying ingredients?

810
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,100
Hot dog... This is different for toppings. This is ingredients. Yeah. I

811
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,240
I guess toppings is the same. No, no, no, because the ingredients okay, so

812
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,920
here's let me let me let me let me throw this out. Let me throw this out a

813
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,680
burger. You look at them. You think maybe they have the same amount of

814
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,560
ingredients. Hamburger is the patty and the bun. Just the two ingredients. The

815
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,400
hot dogs ingredients are the hot dog and the bun. That's the two ingredients,

816
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,360
but the ingredients that go into a hot dog. There are millions of different

817
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,960
parts of the body of the animal. That is so true. You and I see an

818
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,760
ingredients list for hot dog foot leg arm hand brain asshole intestinal lining

819
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,560
plastic plastic plastic of the pig's plastic nitrites nitrites, which I still

820
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,080
don't murder and murder. It would mostly say beef lean and fat yeah lean beef and

821
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,200
fat beef. Yeah, I'm going to agree to agree. There's a little ingredients in

822
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,760
the patty hot dog wins hot dog has millions of ingredients, but you guys

823
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,080
This is the most difficult question yet.

824
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
Okay.

825
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Likeability.

826
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,080
I mean, well, hold on.

827
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Like which one's more charming?

828
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,080
Look up, look up dancing burger versus dancing, because the dancing hot dog is very famous.

829
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,080
We don't need to watch a video to decide.

830
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,080
No, no.

831
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,080
But just I need to see what a dancing burger would look like.

832
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,080
Pick it up and show them.

833
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,080
Okay, wait a minute.

834
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,080
This is easy to figure out.

835
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,080
Oh, you know what I'm thinking of actually?

836
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
Okay, so there's the dancing hot dog, right?

837
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:46,880
right. But there's the fortnight fortnight dancing hot dog. But then there is the

838
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,380
better off dead hamburger scene where the burgers play guitar.

839
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:56,280
Well, this is I'm not talking you're getting into the you're going like a

840
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,880
yeah, you're looking at the next one, which is oh my God movie role. I'm

841
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,880
sorry. Like ability is so here's here's my argument for for burger. Okay with a

842
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,780
hot dog. You can stand him up right and go like hey, I'm hot dog, right? But it

843
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,980
It doesn't look like his mouth is moving. This motherfucker, he can say, he can come here.

844
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,380
Hamburger. Hamburger. He can say his name. Look at that. Hamburger. Hamburger. Time to

845
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:24,700
eat. Hamburger. Time to eat it, Caleb. Ketchup. I know, I'm full. I'm so full. Alright, well

846
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:31,540
I guess in terms of likeability. A hot dog looks like a fucking cock. And if you like

847
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:36,660
that, that's okay. If you like that, you like that, but for me, I don't like that shit. Keep

848
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:41,660
put away. All right. Well, I guess we are going to want one of those on my body. A

849
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,460
draw here because this is too hard. This is the crux of the whole argument.

850
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,060
Yeah, I guess the crux of the whole battle.

851
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:55,260
I was thinking about actually Julio is a tiebreaker Julio. I just thought of a

852
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,260
joke. Say it.

853
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,460
You heard of this this shit called shoegaze, right? This this yeah,

854
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,460
guitars. Yeah. What's that? What? What? Patrick says it was fucking kids.

855
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,860
flawless victory.

856
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,140
Shoo, gays.

857
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,860
You're gay, son.

858
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,660
Oh, okay.

859
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,300
I'm shoo.

860
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,740
Like, shoo! Get out of here!

861
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,140
Yeah.

862
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:13,460
Okay.

863
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
Ha! Gays! Shoo!

864
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,700
You guys like my joke?

865
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,180
Mm.

866
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,540
Flawless victory.

867
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,420
I thought so, too.

868
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,380
All right, this next one, I kind of jumped ahead, got ahead of myself.

869
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,420
Movie roles.

870
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,620
Movie roles. Okay, so what I want you to do right now, Julio--

871
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:30,420
Have you guys seen the Seth Rogen hot dog movie?

872
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,260
What I want you to look up right now--

873
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:32,980
Hot dog.

874
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:37,120
there this one might end in a stalemate two tabs open I need you to look up

875
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:45,600

878
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:07,400

879
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,400

882
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,260
Do you think he likes

883
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:32,120
should I do that?

884
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,860
You be mad at me. We say we're doing something. It's very important. It's

885
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,340
very important to urgent

886
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:45,140
nine one one. Okay, let's see if she responds

887
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,780
urgent

888
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:56,020
wait nine one one. Do you think sorry to bother you sorry to bother you, but but

889
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,380
we've been talking about hamburgers and hamburgers and about hot dogs and about

890
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,580
hot dogs, and we noticed that Kenan Thompson is in a movie about both and we

891
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:13,120
noticed that Kenan Thompson is in a movie about both. So we need someone to

892
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,080
tell about both

893
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,020
hamburgers versus hot dogs. Is it hamburgers and then a different one

894
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,800
movie about each yeah is in one movie one movie? Well, they're making aren't

895
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,060
they making a legacy sequel to good burger? Do you think so? Question

896
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,600
question is do you what question is what does he like more hamburgers or hot

897
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,420
dogs? You think he likes hamburgers

898
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:40,540
or hot dogs more okay hamburger, and this will be a five pointer. Yeah, this

899
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,480
will be when we get the answer. This will be five points. So she ain't going

900
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,200
respond to that shit. I'm going to be honest with you. And the next time I see

901
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:52,360
her, she's going to say, I totally I'm sorry, I forgot to respond to your

902
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,060
question about if Kenan Thompson likes hamburgers or hot dogs more. I thought

903
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,780
that was an immediate response. Me too. I got so excited. No, it's Mike.

904
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:06,920
Anyway, what's next? Musicality, which you guys,

906
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,140

908
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,320

909
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,360
need to know it's a it's a simple question. It's a simple question. She

910
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,580

911
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,560

916
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:51,360
I feel like I've seen him eat a hamburger before no cap. Thank you

00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,760
thank you so much.

918
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:02,600
There we go okay, so that's five points for hamburgers. Hamburger wins. Oh, it

919
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,120
says he eats McDonald's all the time.

920
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,120
All right,

921
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,200
but never hot.

922
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,380
Okay. All right. So we did for the money and good burger. He did for the love

923
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,420
and maybe for the free hamburgers. Yeah. All right. That's five points. That's

924
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,340
fucking five points. That's five points for burgers. Crazy. And you guys with

925
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,660
this next song from Patrick door and music,

926
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,300
we'll see who wins.

927
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,840
Oh, 'cause it's musicality. Yeah.

928
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:46,380
Is it on? It's on. Ow. Sorry. Alright, go ahead. Talk your shit.

929
00:55:46,380 --> 00:56:05,380
I messed that up. Wait. Is this like a song inspired by? This is a song inspired by burgers.

930
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:16,880
he

931
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,960
turned the drums off. That's why it doesn't sound like okay. He doesn't

932
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,180
know how to leave the drums on ready.

933
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:53,000
He was eating and breathing and listening to his music

934
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:01,500
And just when he got hungry, somebody turned around and told me, "Sell me all your burgers, white boy!"

935
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Eat that fuckin' burger right!

936
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,000
Eat that fuckin' burger, white boy!

937
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,500
Eat 14 burgers and you'll go to the fuckin' hospital and die!

938
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Okay, now do "Hot Dog."

939
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
See, this is the hardest part.

940
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
So what's the hot dog stand?

941
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,500
This is the hot dog song I guess. What is it? You guess?

942
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Woah!

943
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:33,500
Hot dog. Hot dog. Hot dog. Stop. Hot dog.

944
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,500
I don't know this song. I can't sing this one.

945
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Okay.

946
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Wait, dude, kiss me.

947
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Dude, kiss me, dude.

948
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,500
(music)

949
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,500
This is derailed the whole show. I have to stop.

950
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
You have to stop.

951
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,500
I thought that "Eat That Fuckin' Burger, White Boy" was gonna be...

952
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,500
I think that "Burgers" wins though, because we did more of a song about burgers.

953
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Well, we were gonna sing it...

954
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Eat me, between the two big white buns.

955
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,500
Eat me, with ketchup and some sauce.

956
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:24,460
boss eat me eat my meaty skin. I want you to see your mouth and then go in my

957
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,700

959
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:44,860
[MUSIC]

960
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,220
Eat me between the two big white buns.

961
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,940
Eat me and all my meaty skin.

962
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:03,060
Eat me with some ketchup and we'll put the sauces then I'll go right in.

963
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,340
Oh, eat me.

964
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,340
I don't know the intro. I don't know the other part.

965
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,860
Well, fuck you.

966
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,060
Which one was a better song?

967
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,180
Then hamburgers wins.

968
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,180
Which one was a better song?

969
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:17,980
better easily the hamburger. So okay, don't like just me. Okay, this guy

970
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,540
doesn't know. I like the drums. I got no rhythm on the second one here.

971
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,420
You think I don't have you think I know it's going away. It's you think I

972
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,580
don't have rhythm. What's that?

973
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,180
Are you gonna

974
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:38,180
Cameron? You gotta sing a song about hot dogs now to see that would change.

975
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,180
Why did you have a song?

976
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,680
What? I didn't know we were preparing songs.

977
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,880
But how do you have one?

978
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,680
We had a whole thing about musicality.

979
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
Oh, this is you. Oh, turn that off.

980
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,780
Okay, we've spent way too much time on music, guys.

981
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,880
Yeah, it's...

982
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,680
We need to go rapid fire.

983
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,180
Yeah.

984
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:56,080
I want to put it...

985
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,480
And we can't do rock or rap.

986
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,880
No, no.

987
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,880
We just did music.

988
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,080
No, we just did music.

989
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,080
Let's go smell.

990
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,480
Okay.

991
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,580
Well, right off the bat,

992
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
hot dogs had the worst smell.

993
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:12,700
and the burgers actually that smelled give me that smell again. This is a bad

994
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,180
smell.

995
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:18,900
This is can I smell the burger real quick? That one smells like a car over

996
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,340
here. They both smell very vehicular.

997
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:29,180
Oh wow, this one smells that burger and specific does not smell like food. This

998
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,500
smells like bad food, but that really is I'm bringing be a bring bring brought

999
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,300
back to the days of smelling DVD cases and Patrick's basement with the smell

1000
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:44,800
of that. Oh my God, smells plastic, smell plastic because of let me think about

1001
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,340
again. Give me one of those, so I think maybe these maybe each burger smells

1002
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,440
different, though maybe it's like a fingerprint. This one smells like fruit.

1003
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,160
Oh, my goodness, it's a

1004
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,880
little bit like fruit. This one smells like jelly.

1005
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,660
maybe it's the ketchup. Oh, my God, no, you need the you need the onion side.

1006
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah,

1007
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,220
I'd actually I like that smell. It smells like a burn on you. I just smelled

1008
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,340
wasn't so bad. Yeah. When I smell it close burgers is burgers is all up for

1009
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:23,320
debate. When I open it, I'm liking it a little more, but what else? Well, let

1010
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,620
me you need to let me see because you know, I smell under where the hot dog

1011
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,700
that's what I was about to do. Yeah, I was about to maybe take this out.

1012
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,700
it's

1013
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,740
the

1014
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,620
bun that smells like food.

1015
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:46,420
Oh, yeah,

1016
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,220
bun smells more like a hot dog than the hot dog smells like a hot. This smells

1017
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,980
like something that a hot dog from the bun all along. This is what you need to

1018
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,620
be put. This smells like something you put your car. This this is smells like a

1019
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,520
- That's what a hot dog smells like.

1020
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,000
- Wait, wait, we've cracked--

1021
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,520
- Did we just discover something that--

1022
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,360
- That hot dogs don't smell like?

1023
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,680
- Nobody's ever realized?

1024
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,520
- The bun.

1025
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,360
(laughing)

1026
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,000
- The smell of a hot dog is a bun?

1027
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,840
- The bun is the smell--

1028
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,760
- Oh, that is awful.

1029
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,320
- From which the hot dog dwells.

1030
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,080
- That really smells so much like--

1031
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,360
- The bun is the smell from which the hot dog dwells.

1032
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,280
- This is an easy--

1033
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,440
- That's such an easy burger.

1034
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,800
- Hamburger wins flawless victory.

1035
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,640
- All right.

1036
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,680
- That's gotta hurt.

1037
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,880
We'll go with stackability.

1038
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,480
Well, I mean the hot dogs are stacked pretty well.

1039
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,080
Well, but you have to pyramid those or you have to jenga them.

1040
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,080
Looks cooler though.

1041
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,180
Looks cooler.

1042
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,480
That one hot dog wins.

1043
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,780
All right, we'll give that to hot dog.

1044
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,280
Yeah.

1045
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Hot dog wins.

1046
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,780
Now, this is interesting.

1047
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,680
This is...

1048
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,180
I feel like we can go through all the rest of them.

1049
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
I feel like we...

1050
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,780
All right, we're good.

1051
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:48,380
And Julio, get ready.

1052
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,880
Get ready to pull those title cards up.

1053
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,280
Yep.

1054
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,780
So after stackability, we have taste.

1055
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,280
Taste.

1056
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,080
I liked the taste of the burger better. I did not even taste the hot dog because

1057
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:03,280
of the anticipation of how it might taste. Yes. You got to taste. I think

1058
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,040
you both need to taste it. All right. Here, little lady in the trampit. I'd

1059
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,920
rather not do that with that one. Just eat your own, man.

1060
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,760
Tastes like a hot dog. I think those that taste disgusting.

1061
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,680
Disgusting. It would taste good cooked.

1062
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,800
Yeah, they're gross. Okay, so burger wins. And we all ate a whole burger and

1063
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:29,240
I liked it yeah. I devoured it all right. If I put this down, it'll break. I

1064
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,980
don't even want to have the rest of my bite that I'm it's in my mouth guys

1065
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,740
burgers in a massive lead right now. I'm going to

1066
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:41,400
temperature and hotness. I mean so I was cold what's in front of us today. I

1067
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,720
think there's but normally I think that hot dogs might be on average hotter

1068
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,400
than the name. It's in the name. I got to give they call it a

1069
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,980
dog

1070
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,840
hot dog. All right, so time of day,

1071
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:03,160
you have to eat them both at lunchtime or dinner. You can eat a

1072
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:07,040
burger for dinner, but you can eat a hot dog at 3 PM.

1073
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:13,460
Hot dog is definitely afternoon. I've had a breakfast burger. Yeah, but a

1074
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,280
burger also can't really be a snack in the way that a hot

1075
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,560
dog has the potential to be snackable. That's true. So, hot dog really

1076
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,700
is all day. Yeah, except I probably you know I wouldn't eat one is at breakfast,

1077
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,260
but I'm sure there are people who do it and they brag about it. People do that in

1078
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,700
different countries, I think, or different states. I tried to make a

1079
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,220
breakfast hot dog one time and it was the worst decision I've ever made. You put

1080
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,200
egg on a hot dog?

1081
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:41,240
Was it breakfast sausage in a brioche bun with scrambled egg? So not a hot dog at

1082
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,320
all. Yeah, I guess you're right. That's a breakfast sausage. Breakfast brat.

1083
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,200
a piece of shit. I'm just an inventor. You're a piece of shit. I'm an inventor. So we're

1084
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:57,200
giving that to a hot dog as you can eat it at any time? Yes. Utility. Hot dog, hamburger,

1085
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:04,200
hot wings. Utility, I don't get that question. Value. Okay, so this is a hard one. Because...

1086
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,120
Well we kind of did that with the exchange rate. We said exchange rate, but I don't know...

1087
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:15,120
So you are getting three hot dogs. Three and one third hot dogs for the price of one fucking

1088
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:22,120
but okay that's true. You say bun? But. Bun. Bud. Bund. Bund. Bund. Listen. Welt. Welt.

1089
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,560
I have a bund. You're starting with a situation, let me tell you something, you're starting

1090
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:32,120
with a situation where you have some money and you have no food. Obviously maybe you

1091
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,400
go for the hot dog because you can buy more of them. But imagine this situation that you

1092
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,300
are the type of guy where in your house you have hundreds and hundreds of food items and

1093
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:47,460
no money. You're going to want to have the hamburgers because you can sell

1094
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:53,220
them for a higher price. Yes, I because they're worth more. Yes, okay. Farmer

1095
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:57,940
or a minor and you're gathering hamburgers from your environment. So

1096
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,740
which way you're saying is better value. I'm saying I'm saying it depends on

1097
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:05,140
which side of the question you look at it from because if you if you're I

1098
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,660
would say the hamburgers higher of course higher value. That's almost

1099
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:12,100
empirically true right, but maybe that maybe if you're okay, if you're a poor

1100
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:17,600
a peasant, he said empirically he that one point for Cameron, one point for

1101
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,320
Cameron, right down Cameron, give him a point.

1102
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,160
The

1103
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:26,300
you maybe you're on it's on both. You know you're a poor peasant. The hot dog

1104
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,600
is going to be supreme because of the lower value. Yes, but you're a rich

1105
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,140
farmer or rich food maker. So you're just saying that this is a wash. I'm

1106
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:40,440
just saying it that our perspective in this world matters. Wow, okay, another

1107
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,320
point for Cameron.

1108
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,020
Yeah, I mean

1109
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:50,420
the next one is actually one of the most important questions. Yeah,

1110
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:52,020
vegetability.

1111
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:59,020
So, which one is better in a vegetable version? I have extensive experience

1112
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,420
with this, but I will say it's a little dated. I have some experience

1113
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,020
with this, too. I have some experience with it. I actually have some

1114
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,320
recent experience with this. For me, let me go first because I've been

1115
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,620
in this vegetable game the longest. When I was a kid, didn't eat meat,

1116
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:18,820
I would eat Bocca burgers and smart dogs and smart dogs were fucking disgusting.

1117
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,140
I'd eat them all the time. I would cover them in every condiment possible.

1118
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:27,780
That's still what they're working with. Yes. Bocca burgers were the vegan ones

1119
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,580
and they were okay. They were honestly pretty comfortable with this. But now there's a

1120
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,260
million different types of vegetable burgers. I've had impossible, I've had beyond. I never

1121
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:39,140
had either of those. They're dreaming up new ways to make the vegetable look like a meat.

1122
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:44,980
Yeah, you want to you want a veggie hot dog. It's still smart dogs. Yes, to this

1123
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:49,260
day. It's still like light light light smart dogs. Smart dogs are fucking

1124
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:53,580
hair. So bad. I feel like I feel like this is barely even meat. This has to be

1125
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:59,060
the easiest fucking thing to hold on. Hold on. Hold up. Hold up. Here's here

1126
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:01,580
is a here is a huge

1127
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,740
disqualifier for hot dogs. Vegetability

1128
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,580
right? Smart dogs, we've been talking about light life smart dogs.

1129
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:15,980
Main ingredient, vital wheat gluten.

1130
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:21,100
Seitan is bread, barely vegetable.

1131
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,220
So you're saying that you're basically eating two buns?

1132
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,020
You are eating a bun in between two buns.

1133
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:28,820
Damn.

1134
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,380
That would honestly probably, I'd rather eat a bun between two buns than a motherfucking smart dog.

1135
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:33,380
Hamburger wins.

1136
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,140
Hey, I wish it was going to burger, man.

1137
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,900
And I haven't even had that new shit.

1138
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:41,300
I even had that new shit, but I still like Boca Burgers more than I like that shit.

1139
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,800
And the final question.

1140
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,900
Well, there's two here, so which one are you saying?

1141
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,180
Well, Julio said he can't find the thing for that.

1142
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,580
Well, we have to do the last one.

1143
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,580
Okay.

1144
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,580
We have to do that last one.

1145
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,540
Alright, then we will do, this is the penultimate thing.

1146
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:00,460
Okay, penultimate doesn't usually need an intro.

1147
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:01,460
Weirdness.

1148
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,460
Weirdness.

1149
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:08,920
this. So this is if you were going to the North Sentinel Island and you showed

1150
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,260
them

1151
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,760
this.

1152
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,720
If you... Okay, so you're in a kayak, right? You're trying to spread the word

1153
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,440
of Jesus Christ and you're running at the North Sentinel, the North Sentinel

1154
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,960
tribe like this. You jengaed that hot dog so well. Thank you. You're walking

1155
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,160
up like this, right? Which would they understand? You're getting blasted.

1156
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,040
Which are they killing? Which side of you is getting blasted with arrows

1157
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,280
corners. Is it this side or this side? This side because it's spear

1158
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,180
shaped. Which one looks more alien to you? The hot dog is

1159
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:40,380
shaped like a spear, right? So they would see that and say, "Oh,

1160
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:42,280
he's coming." But this is shaped like a sphere. The hot dog is...

1161
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,980
The sphere is a shield. If you come with just a shield, you're

1162
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,980
like, "I'm trying to protect myself." Do I look like a tarot

1163
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,680
card when I do this? Yes. You do. That would be an incredible

1164
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,880
tarot card, the chef.

1165
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:58,080
Look to the side like that. Here's another direction to come

1166
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,600
like the weirdness question. Okay, maybe less about how weird they look, but I

1167
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,120
feel like don't you into the mic just lean back. Why did you eat that?

1168
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:10,000
The I feel like the hot dog is built for the human hand.

1169
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,800
It's ergonomically designed to rest in your hand like that the hamburger you're

1170
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,720
either balancing it on your why does this size feel so perfect or you're to

1171
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:23,120
handing it wait this half hot dog size. Why does that feel so perfect to my

1172
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,480
hand?

1173
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,400
Why did you do that? Yeah? Why does this feel? I

1174
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:26,900
is it

1175
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,940
exact it's like it was built for your hand. That's what I'm saying it's like

1176
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,720
your hand was built for that that

1177
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,500
to your wife. No it's perfect. It's like it was God's plan.

1178
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:42,380
I feel like the hot dog is more natural in that sense

1179
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,520
you're. I feel like you're more likely to find so yeah God dude

1180
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,920
Jesus

1181
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,980
Oh my God, you can wrinkle a hot dog. I think you're more likely to find...

1182
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,300
I think that if you went out into nature, into an undiscovered, undocumented

1183
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,900
jungle, you'd be a thousand times more likely to find a plant that looks like

1184
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,220
a hot dog than a plant that looks like a hamburger. Oh my God,

1185
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:13,380
what's that thing in the pond? A cat tail. A cat tail. Nature's hot dog.

1186
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:17,140
There's no burger plant. There's no burger plant. No, no, no.

1187
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:23,020
I don't think I've ever made a laugh like that before.

1188
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:28,540
I don't know what that was. All right, so we're giving this one to the

1189
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:31,680
hamburger. The hamburger is weirder. Or no, we're giving the point to the

1190
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,940
hot dog. Hot dog is less weird. Yeah.

1191
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:42,180
The very last one, guys. Very last. Which we actually started with. We

1192
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:47,040
kinda started with. Guys, would aliens like this shit? Is there

1193
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:53,300
visual evidence of maybe an alien eating a hot dog? I had slime sex

1194
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,300
with a green alien.

1195
01:11:54,300 --> 01:12:00,780
That's all we had to do.

1196
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,780
All right.

1197
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,780
All right.

1198
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,380
I had slime sex with a green

1199
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,380
alien.

1200
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:11,140
You say I had slime ketchup.

1201
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,340
I had slime ketchup.

1202
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:15,700
Oh, actually sounds pretty good.

1203
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,740
Oh, I had ketchup.

1204
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,460
I had hamburger.

1205
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,980
He's a hot dog.

1206
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,860
I'm flawless. Ketchup is going to be a tough one. Okay,

1207
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,380
flawless

1208
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,540
flawless

1209
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,580
flawless

1210
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:37,740
wow okay. What an alien like I mean I feel like that's the same thing as

1211
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:43,020
look at that. Okay, this alien, this this alien is yearning for this burger.

1212
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:47,460
Yeah, he loves the burger. Yeah, burger has more for an alien to study. Yes,

1213
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:50,420
true alien analyzing. You can't

1214
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:55,180
The hot dog, the alien, if you look at the back of this hot dog picture, the

1215
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,600
alien doesn't even care to analyze it. He's like, "Yep, this is going straight

1216
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,300
in my mouth. I'm eating this." He's screaming at it. He doesn't even care.

1217
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:06,200
This one, he's tapping the glass. "Reveal your secrets to me, hamburger.

1218
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,540
What's that yellow stuff on top of the burger? It's so steady." How does he

1219
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:09,980
talk this so well?

1220
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,540
He'd say that. He'd say what? He'd say,

1221
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:17,340
"Ugh." Yeah. This is how an alien speaks. Yeah. Can you give me that voice?

1222
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:20,700
So who are we giving this one to, guys? I think it's going to burger. It's

1223
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,980
gotta be burger, right? All right.

1224
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:22,980
Hamburger.

1225
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:23,980
Well,

1226
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:24,980
ah!

1227
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:30,180
Guys, that is the last category.

1228
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:31,900
And it goes to hamburger.

1229
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,020
We will be tallying these up now.

1230
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,980
Go ahead and tally them up.

1231
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,980
Count out loud.

1232
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,500
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three.

1233
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,500
For burger.

1234
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Twenty-three for burger.

1235
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Hamburger.

1236
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,500
Versus five, ten, fifteen, eighteen.

1237
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,500
Hot dog.

1238
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,700
eighteen for hot dog and for Cameron one to

1239
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:58,620
two for Cameron. So so even if some you might be saying

1240
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:03,340
it's a two it's a two part. What about Thompson? What if Cameron split the vote?

1241
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:09,500
What well, well, Kenan Thompson is literally what gave the five person lead.

1242
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,060
It was he was he was the he was the swing.

1243
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,980
If it wasn't for Kenan,

1244
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:22,220
Sarah didn't text me back and let me know. Yeah, it would have been a

1245
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:27,100
complete tie. That's insane. Oh my God. This was really it all came down to the

1246
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,260
wire. She said, Are you guys on crack or on podcast?

1247
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:36,660
We are on podcast and show her the results. Oh yeah. Hold on. Yeah, I gotta

1248
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:38,980
send her a picture. Yeah. Send Sarah the results of the

1249
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:44,460
hamburger versus hot dog debate. So yeah, I guess I'd like to close it out

1250
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,420
here with a little speech on the winner.

1251
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:55,640
So everybody we've tallied up the votes. As you can see, hamburger got twenty

1252
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,780
three and hot dog got eighteen and ketchup, which kind of sounds like

1253
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:06,660
Cameron got two and well, maybe Keenan. Yeah, Keenan got five.

1254
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:09,920
I had slime six

1255
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:16,760
And I'd love to give the win here to Burger.

1256
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:26,560
But you know, the truth is that when a hamburger and a hot dog fight, it's us who are the winners.

1257
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,560
Oh, wow.

1258
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,280
Oh my God, a ribbon for me?

1259
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,280
Holy crap.

1260
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,280
That completely is not sticky at all because I believe that these are actually maybe 25

1261
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,280
years old.

1262
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,280
Well...

1263
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:42,160
But I've gotten ourselves some winner ribbons because we kind of won today, guys.

1264
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:45,200
we got to eat hamburger guys. We got to eat hot dogs and we got to hear a

1265
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,560
beautiful song played by our friend. I'm not eating another one. I'm

1266
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,900
so full. I couldn't eat another bite, unless you guys want to get lunch. I

1267
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,920
would love to get lunch. All right, well, that concludes the battle of the

01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,120
Featuring Kenan Thompson because we did get breaking information about the one and only

1289
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,120
Kenan.

1290
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,120
Yeah.

1291
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
Alright.

1292
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,120
Bye guys.

1293
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,120
Bye bye.

1294
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,200
(static)

1295
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,320
- Do they have a little Ben in London?

1296
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,600
- It does piss me off that they name clocks over there.

1297
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,080
What kind of backwards bullshit is that?

1298
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,760
- We don't even have the name of a clock.

1299
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,360
- Clock maybe Bernice.

1300
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,040
- Well what the fuck is this then, huh?

1301
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:18,880
What's this, Xavier?

1302
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,720
- That's 101.

1303
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,540
- Caleb?

1304
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,380
What's this Caleb?

1305
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,220
Little Caleb?

1306
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,040
Hello little Caleb.

1307
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,880
(laughing)

1308
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,720
- Hi.

1309
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,680
- What's this then, Watchie?

1310
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:27,940
(laughing)

1311
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:31,040
- Oh yeah, that's Big Ben, so what is this?

1312
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:31,880
Fucking Watchie?

1313
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,560
Hey, I'm Wachi!

1314
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,600
Hello, Wachi!

1315
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,640
Oh, hi Wachi!

1316
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,140
Hi!

1317
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,800
I never noticed you before, Wachi!

1318
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:43,240
Oh, I was doing that being alone, traveling to London and doing that on like a tour.

1319
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:43,880
Yeah.

1320
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,080
It's like 20 tours.

1321
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,760
And here is Big Ben.

1322
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,640
At the front.

1323
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,600
Yes, you're at the front.

1324
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,080
Yeah.

1325
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,040
Oh, that's Big Ben.

1326
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,080
So if that's Big Ben, what's this?

1327
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,560
Wachi?

1328
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,520
Hey, I'm Wachi!

1329
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,560
This tour's boring!

1330
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,680
The tour just continues.

1331
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,160
Wachi!

1332
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,440
Can we go underground?

1333
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,280
Wachi, that is, that is, oh, you're so rude, Wachi!

1334
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,160
Oh, and who's this?

1335
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,160
Yes.

1336
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,160
I know she's beautiful girl.

1337
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,160
Oh, who's that?

1338
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:08,600
Is that Mickey Mouse on your watch?

1339
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,640
Sorry lady, it looks like our watches are in love.

1340
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,280
I guess I'm going to have to go home with you.

1341
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,280
I didn't book a hotel.

1342
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:20,920
Wait, it's almost like we're like in-laws now because our watches fell in love.

1343
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,920
Yours is kind of more the strong silent type.

1344
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,480
I can't get watchy to shut the hell up.

1345
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,480
Somebody's talking to you.

1346
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,800
They're asking you at one of the restaurants, what would you like to eat?

1347
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,400
And then Wachee starts ordering, you have to cover him up real fast.

1348
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:33,900
Uh oh.

1349
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,400
Uh oh.

1350
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,900
Um, he did not say the A5 Wagyu.

1351
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,900
Wachee does, yeah.

1352
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,600
Oh, Wachee, that's market price, Wachee!

1353
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:41,400
What are you doing?

1354
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:41,900
Come on!

1355
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,900
I'm with the lobster!

1356
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:43,900
Live a little!

1357
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,400
Shut up, Wachee!

1358
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:45,900
Okay.

1359
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:47,900
Wachee, we are not getting the surf and turf.

1360
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,900
What? You get the turf!

1361
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,900
I'll eat the surf!

1362
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,900
[laughter]

1363
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:54,400
Wachee, shut up, Wachee!

1364
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,900
You're ruining this day!

1365
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,400
The waiter's like, "What are you doing?"

1366
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,400
And you're like, "Oh, it's Wachee."

1367
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,900
Like, if that's Big Ben, then what's this?

1368
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:10,780
this video.

1369
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,700
