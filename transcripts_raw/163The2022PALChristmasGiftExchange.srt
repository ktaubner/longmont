00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,720
Don't even get me started on those.

43
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,320
They should be--

44
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,920

45
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920

49
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,520

Chuck Wadlow yeah

84
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,140
I was thinking about that guy Robert Wadlow

85
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,920
And I saw a picture a family photo of him

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,820
And it was like him and his dad and stuff and his dad's like 510 that was a man how fucking pissed off

87
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,880
Would you be if your son was not just taller than you, but he's the tallest guy who ever lived

88
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,120
He's 10 feet tall. Yeah, and you were like and you're like that. Yeah, you're like will you do your chores, please?

89
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,480
Your son is the number one tallest guy to ever live and you're the

90
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,080
152nd best bank teller. Yeah

91
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,900
He had a he was tall because of like a pituitary gland problem, too

92
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,280
So it's like I think he was just like that for no just like imagine being his father and it's like I remember reading that

93
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,280
In the in the Ripley's believe it or not

94
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,780
And he was this tall for absolutely no reason.

95
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,280
But imagine being like his dad.

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,780
And he reached this height for no reason.

97
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,660
His dad and just being like, you can't even claim like that, like when your dad gets proud

98
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,780
of how broad your shoulders are.

99
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Yeah.

100
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,640
Your dad's like, "Oh, you're going to be a great linebacker when you get older."

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
When was he alive?

102
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
2003.

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Just finally died.

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,000
Because I think there's, he, I feel like, can you Google that?

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,300
I was I read this book about guys who are born with like just either really tall or really

107
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,620
small or with extra limbs and yeah, and joined twins and stuff like that.

108
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,920
And it was like freaks there.

109
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
It was their call.

110
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,380
Well, they're called they call them monsters in the book.

111
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,340
They're like scientifically when a when a man is is born and he's three feet tall.

112
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,900
That's a monster.

113
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,020
And it was all this stuff about like, yes, we call them monsters.

114
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,340
It's from was from it's from the UK.

115
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,820
And I was like, it's like an old book.

116
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,820
it has like old drawings of like... Click Robert Wadlow. Yeah, just go to Robert Wadlow.

117
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,140
It's down there. And just see when he lived. Yeah. Okay, now scroll past this,

118
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,020
please. Can you... Come on. You are... Okay, to 1940. Yeah. So yeah, I was

119
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,140
reading this book and I was like, "This is a pretty old book. Like, it's about these

120
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,740
people being born in the 1800s. Obviously not from the 1800s, but you know, it must

121
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,700
be pretty old because it's saying that if you're born with an extra arm, you are

122
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,740
scientifically a monster." And I looked at the... I looked in the inside the cover to

123
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,420
you and his friends from 1960. Oh my God. I think those guys were writing a book for like,

124
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,180
he was like a, and he was like, he was like a director of a museum. Like he was like an

125
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,620
academic. Well, if he was a director of a museum, he's trying to like get people to

126
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,940
go. He was like a part of like a, he was like a surgical, he was like a surgeon or something.

127
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,100
Like he was like, he was a real doctor. He was at the surgery museum. Yeah. It was the

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,540
surgery museum. The museum of surgery. Um, you, they were still doing like lobotomies

129
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,760
and stuff in the 60s. Yeah, they gave one to Rosemary Kennedy. Oh yeah. I think so. But

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,340
she got a street named after her in Boston, the worst street ever, the Big Dig Street.

131
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,700
So that's pretty cool. So that's worth it, I would say. They're also doing, still doing

132
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,580
lobotomies now, but through a different method. Nowadays, they do it through TV news. That's

133
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:34,020
true. They do it through TikTok and Fortnite. Yeah. And TV news. And this mumble rap. Yeah.

134
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,860
Yeah, I don't even want to say what rap is an acronym for hey who's coming to Christmas listen

135
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,560
Anybody's invited to my Christmas except for a fucking mumble rapper. Yeah, right

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
They're gonna walk out say hey there partner. I'm Caleb Pitts very nice to meet you welcome to my home. They go

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,700
Yeah, we don't be caroling and they're going like

138
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Or they'll do ad-libs let it snow this mumble. No

139
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,860
Mumble rap should be called mumble crap. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and it should actually be called mumble core

140
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,960
And I'll say every kind of movie and I know about back

141
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:14,100
And I celebrate their deaths when they die the mumbo rappers. I celebrate I'm dancing on a I'm dancing on a building in, New Jersey

142
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,860
I have you know in a movie. I know in a war movie when they have those guys

143
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,020
Which one who were the dancing guys and there was no head say go ahead. What do you think?

144
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,900
What do you think they were who do you think could have been dancers? Yeah, they were rock stars

145
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,320
Yeah, when I'm up there. It's a rocker day. It was the jabberwockies

146
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,360
You know and people said jabberwockies dancing on 9/11. It's like they dance every day. They're not gonna stop just because it's fucking 9/11

147
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,680
In a war movie when they have the like map and they have all the little figurines for the different

148
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Oh, yeah, and they like push them around with a thing. I have that I have every mumble rapper

149
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,680
On a map of the US and I every time one does I push it off the edge. Yes

150
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,380
And I move my little piece to come up behind them a lot of the time. Yeah, it's cool that that was like a

151
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,660
Way to strategize they still do that. Yeah, they still do that. Yeah, it's just computer programs now. I guess that's true. They call

152
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:14,780
It's called Civ 6 yeah, it's basically that's all like the civilization games is is that fucking well

153
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,260
That's a little map that they had in dr.

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,820
It went from if you think about it

155
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,100
They went from you used to used to control your soldiers through several settlers of Catan and nowadays

156
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,060
It's like battlefield 2 yeah, they upgraded the technology flying these drones, and it's like you're playing

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,260
Titanfall - yeah, you're right. It's mostly two games. Yeah, you're a sequels. Yeah

158
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,700
Thinking about maybe asking Santa for

162
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,880
So they open the bed. You know what I'm gonna say all these mumbo wrappers are probably asking Xanta for a gat

163
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:10,700
Okay, yeah, yeah, that's all right. Yeah, Xanthia asking Xanta Xanta fucking

00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,820
You're gonna make butter now.

188
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,660
- 100%. - And butter has

189
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,220
just as much effect, if not more, than lean.

190
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,820
- Oh, way more! (laughing)

191
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,860
- The lipids?

192
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,740
- Yeah, and it affects your physiology.

193
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,620
- The fatty acids?

194
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,460
It's good for you.

195
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,280
- Yeah, butter is very good for you.

196
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,580
- And it tastes damn better than lean, too.

197
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,060
That purple crap, I hate the shit.

198
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,480
- Tell you what there, mumble rapper Juice WRLD,

199
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,580
if you were on a ketogenic diet, you could still be alive.

200
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,660
- Speaking of rap.

201
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,820
- I would like to move Juice WRLD to an orchard

202
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
so he could truly experience a juice world.

203
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,500
- Yeah, hey juice world, go home.

204
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,660
- Or maybe a Jamba Juice.

205
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,860
- Juice world, go home.

206
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,100
To juice world.

207
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,860
Get out of my world.

208
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,700
Earth.

209
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,140
- Speaking of rap, you guys remember when

210
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,900
they changed doing your mom

211
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,460
from doing your mom to stalking your mom

212
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,340
'cause there was a copyright dispute over doing your mom?

213
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,580
- These days, I think that Congress should make a song

214
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,140
called Doing the Nation

215
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,900
because of how much they're fucking us every day

216
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
with the legislative decision.

217
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
- The IRS is doing your taxes.

218
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
No, you're doing your taxes.

219
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
They're doing your bank account.

220
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
They did my bank account this morning.

221
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
They're doing your bank account.

222
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
They're trying to do mine, but I'm not letting them.

223
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
It's crazy that they can hack your shit.

224
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
It's a pretty dangerous way to live.

225
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,300
It's cool that if you try to do a payment plan, you cannot change it unless you call them and cry.

226
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
That's easy. You're an actor. Cry.

227
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
That's true.

228
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I don't like talking to people on the phone, though.

229
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I hate it. I have so much anxiety about it.

230
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,000
I just think they're nothing to me.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah.

232
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They can't hear me because I'm going like...

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I think they're all trying to steal my stuff.

235
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Yeah.

236
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,600
Yeah.

237
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
They can never hear me because I'm going like...

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,100
You know what I do?

239
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
You know what I do every time I pick up the phone?

240
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,600
I go home.

241
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,100
What?

242
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,600
I say, because I don't want them to steal my stuff, I say, "Send me an email."

243
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Yes.

244
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,400
"If you know who I am and you're calling me, send me an email. I'll just go on your website and see it."

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,900
Come on.

246
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,600
And they go, "Okay," because they're never trying to steal my stuff.

247
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Yeah, that's true.

248
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
But then I don't have to talk to them.

249
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
That's my email face.

250
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,100
That's it.

251
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,380
I really want to get into a...

252
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,380
Means I love it.

253
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
That's your email face?

254
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,380
That's your email face.

255
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,380
I don't know what that means.

256
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
That's your female face.

257
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Oh yeah, true.

258
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Cumshot face.

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
Cumshot, yeah.

260
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
O-face.

261
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
Receiving cumshot.

262
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
Email.

263
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Electronic mail.

264
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
He is an electronic mail.

265
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Receiving another mail.

266
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
Oh, a cumshot from an electronic mail.

267
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
Yeah, well no, to...

268
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
So a robotic mail.

269
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
No, you're an electronic mail and you're receiving a cumshot from a normal mail.

270
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,380
Receiving, downloading cumshot into throat.

271
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
Receiving cumshot.

272
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Blast.

273
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
You'd be like this.

274
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
You'd be like this.

275
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
You'd be like this.

276
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
You'd be like this.

277
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
You'd be like this.

278
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,580
- You'd be like this, you'd be like,

279
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,920
downloading cock into throat,

280
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,140
uploading cock out of throat,

281
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,340
downloading cock into throat,

282
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,420
and you'd probably do that 100 to 200 times.

283
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,580
- And then make him cum.

284
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,420
- Yeah.

285
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,420
- Yeah.

286
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,740
- And then you say, "Digesting semen."

287
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,020
- That's what I do.

288
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,220
- A little progress bar on his belly.

289
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,060
- Ding!

290
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,880
- And you can hear it going,

291
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,720
(imitates gurgling)

292
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,540
- And then maybe like an easy bake oven,

293
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,380
like baked good comes out.

294
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,340
- A baby comes out.

295
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,180
- Yeah.

296
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,000
- Yeah.

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,940
- I need a coffee.

298
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
We have coffee in the pot.

299
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,780
- I'll make you a coffee, yeah.

300
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,600
- Okay.

301
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,440
- I'm gonna make you a coffee.

302
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,160
You you um

303
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Will you get me a cup of water?

304
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,760
Yeah, anybody else want anything? What do you guys want? Do you want some ceviche or something? Yeah, that would be great

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,900
Well, you just stood up would love ceviche ceviche would actually be splendid would be busing right now. Oh you fucking offered it

306
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,400
Okay, he's being a total cock. I got a I think I'm gonna do like one of these uh

307
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,880
Things are you just die all of your clothes black? What's what do you mean one of those things?

308
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,780
There's like all these videos I've been seeing they'll show up on Instagram reels and it's like all their clothes

309
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,680
Yeah, it's like they get like one of those big sterilite tubs

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,020
Plays that like do you wanna are you gonna play music while you die your clothes? Yeah, I'm gonna do that

311
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,240
It's gonna be a video of me dying all my clothes black and then posting the results

312
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,680
Okay, there's I can guess what the results might be. I think they might be black clothes. I think it might be

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,160
These jeans I wash these jeans. I think I accidentally washed them in hot water

314
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,260
Man, I hate to interrupt what if you guys had your own podcast would definitely be probably the greatest podcast of all time

315
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,780
I was just filling time. I did not care about what I was saying the whole that's what a podcast is is filling time

316
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,120
No, everything that we've said up until this point has been

317
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,840
Beautiful sentences see I was sitting in there, and I was talking to myself like I'm such a machine

318
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,680
I couldn't even stop I was like you guys are saying ceviche I walked in there

319
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,420
I imagine putting ceviche in that sink and trying to make it in there. Yeah. Yeah, I'm the sink in the sink

320
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,960
Well, I was that's almost as interesting as dying your clothes black. It's way more interesting

321
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:08,080
You already have black clothes first of all dumbass your entire clothes are black look everything you have on is black

322
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,000
I know that he would he would he would accidentally fall into the tub of die

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah, I know and he would not die a single article of clothing. I would turn gray

324
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,960
He would fall in and his skin would absorb every last drop of the time.

325
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
And he'd be like, "Oh no, I can't do this. I can't tie my clothes anymore."

326
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,960
No, I ain't touching you. No. If you fall into a thing of black dye, I am not publicly wringing you out in front of everybody.

327
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Why not?

328
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Because I don't want to be associated with you in that way.

329
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
He's wringing me!

330
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
You wouldn't even do it for a good friend?

331
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
You wouldn't do it outside in front of everyone? You wouldn't wring him out by the neck?

332
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,680
No, you just, yeah, you take one side and you take the other and then you twist in opposite

333
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
ways to get all that dye out.

334
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Patrick doing his racial color humor again.

335
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
What do you mean?

336
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,240
No, it's not racial at all.

337
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,840
This is not racial at all.

338
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
This is about an imagination.

339
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,320
You know what's not racial to cover yourself in black dye?

340
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,880
You know what Christmas is about for me?

341
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
It's different.

342
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,080
Christmas is about love, family, cookies, values, sag-nod, values, morals, ethics, logos, pathos,

343
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,640
Patrick it's Patrick it calendar he flips it over to December he says hmm I wonder

344
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,480
what kind of racist jokes I could do every single day of this month it's not

345
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
true one I don't have a calendar yes he probably has a bad you don't know how to

346
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
use a calendar no I know how to use a digital calendar I have one you can't

347
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,240
read one bro I have one waking up every morning and looking at it looking at the

348
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,120
wall next to his bed and going I can't understand what day it is at all cuz he

349
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
bought a colander actually you know what I do there is a calendar it's metal

350
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,480
There is a calendar in my kitchen, but it's from the former tenant and it's all in German

351
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,820
You should still be able to understand it. I do I understand well sequential months

352
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,380
I remember the I remember the German fucking I don't think you need to it's all numbers

353
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,460
And then you should be able to know if you are looking at the calendar to find out what month it is

354
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,580
I think there's you have a bigger problem. Yeah true donor stock. I know it's the 12th today, but what a month

355
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,360
Guys, we should do a calendar.

356
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,760
We should. Maybe with funny pictures on each month?

357
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,160
Funny ass photos of us for a calendar.

358
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,920
That's not so bad an idea.

359
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,760
I bet we could make a billion dollars.

360
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,880
Yeah, it's pretty much the same.

361
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,160
I forgot.

362
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,720
It's called calendar, well it's got a K.

363
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,720
January, February.

364
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,680
What months are these?

365
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,720
January, February, March, March.

366
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,520
Oktober, Dezember. They have a cooler, honestly this is just a cooler spelling.

367
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,960
Bro, March is called Mars.

368
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Of course, wait, of course it's October.

369
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:42,960
August, October, I remember December as date-cember.

370
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Oh, and I wouldn't even understand what I was looking at because it says calendar.

371
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Yeah, and C, you see the two D's there.

372
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
No, not C, K.

373
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
No, no, no.

374
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
No, K.

375
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Sontag, Montag, Donnerstag, Midwach.

376
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Mid what? Oh my god, what's this? Pull this up.

377
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:11,000
up is a news article. Oh wow on CNN. Whoa. This is huge. Christmas will be tomorrow this year.

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,160
Official. Wow that's huge news. I didn't even realize. Barbara Starr the Pentagon reporter.

379
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,520
All that shit with Santa Claus must have been kinda. Leading up to this. Yeah. They changed

380
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,800
the Christmas date. Yeah. To tomorrow. Wait what's tomorrow? The 25th. Of Christmas month?

381
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,680
- Yeah, December, of Dezember.

382
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,560
- Oh, Dezember.

383
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,400
- Yeah.

384
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,960
- Dezember!

385
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
- Stop doing that, man.

386
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,880
- Yeah, you don't like that.

387
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
- But today's Christmas Eve,

388
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,640
and because it's Christmas Eve,

389
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,120
everyone knows the Christmas Eve tradition

390
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,680
is to open all of your presents and stockings.

391
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,360
- The ones from your friends, yes.

392
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
The ones from Santa, you save 'til the next day.

393
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,600
- Sure, okay.

394
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,800
- We can agree on that.

395
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,480
- But also, I'm gonna be real with y'all,

396
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,120
the Santa shit is a little bit more personal,

397
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
and I don't really wanna publicly be opening

398
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,920
- I'm really into sharing that.

399
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,760
- My standard Claus gifts.

400
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,360
- And I saw something this morning

401
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,080
when I came into the office that I don't know

402
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,920
if you guys saw.

403
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,240
- And what was that?

404
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,080
- I saw--

405
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,440
- You sound like Tiny Tim.

406
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,280
- No.

407
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,040
- I did see something pretty exciting.

408
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
- What'd you see?

409
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,400
- And this is huge.

410
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,560
- Okay, we'll just spit it out, maybe.

411
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,960
- It's actually rather small.

412
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,520
- All right, well just, can you talk please?

413
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,600
Tell me what it is.

414
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
- I saw an elf.

415
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,060
- No way.

416
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,900
- Yeah, right.

417
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,740
- And you will not guess what he was doing.

418
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,320
- Do we have a video of the elf?

419
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
- Nope.

420
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
- We have cameras all around the office.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,720
Elves cannot be taken video of.

422
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
For real?

423
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
That's a fucking lie.

424
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Well you shouldn't.

425
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
It's not nice.

426
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Well yeah, that's true.

427
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,040
Wait, so what happened with the elf?

428
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Who was the elf?

429
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
What was he doing?

430
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
The elf was an elf.

431
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Yeah, but what was his name?

432
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,320
I didn't ask his name, I just saw him.

433
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
I didn't speak to him.

434
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
I was a little starstruck.

435
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Any elf?

436
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,280
He's not even a famous elf and you're starstruck?

437
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Every elf is famous.

438
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
What are you talking about?

439
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Humanity is more famous than elves.

440
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Humans are more famous than elves.

441
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
What are you talking about?

442
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
What kind of Christmas blasphemy bullshit is this?

443
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Wait a minute, I saw...

444
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,960
Look, look, look, Jimmy, I'll pull up the security cam.

445
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Oh wow.

446
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,200
That is right outside.

447
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Is this the elf you saw?

448
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Nope.

449
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
No, okay.

450
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,400
This is a different elf.

451
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,960
That's a weird elf that I don't like.

452
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,420
I'm not a fan of him.

453
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,240
But I will tell you what I saw the elf doing when I came in.

454
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
What's that?

455
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,640
He was putting toys in our stockings.

456
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
No fucking way.

457
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,480
I am deadly fucking serious.

458
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Okay, stockings that have been here all of Christmas December.

459
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,560
Did you hear that noise when he put-

460
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,000
- Hold on, do that again. - Whoa.

461
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Holy.

462
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,160
- There is something in there.

463
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
- All right, well let's check these out.

464
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
- Whoa, there's one in mine too.

465
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
- Okay, wait, maybe there's something in mine.

466
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
I really hope there is.

467
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,480
- Let's all pull it out at the same time.

468
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,440
- Mine is stuck.

469
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,380
- Well, I guess you don't get it.

470
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,840
- That was a very-- - It's a different noise.

471
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,520
- That was a weak-ass fuckin' drop.

472
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,360
All right, ready? - Okay.

473
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,800
- Three, two, one. - Two, one.

474
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,640
- Oh my God.

475
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
Wow. I got Max Pro Contact Cleaner.

476
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,700
And I got... Oh, we got Blow Off.

477
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
We got Blow Off Duster.

478
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,360
Oh my God. And look at that guy.

479
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,960
Look at this little guy. This is awesome.

480
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,000
I got a different one. I got Contact Cleaner for circuit boards,

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,520
power tools, batteries, and electric repair. He's spraying what anatomically should be his penis.

482
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,280
Or his lap. Yeah, you're right.

483
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,360
More his lap.

484
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,440
Wait, there's more shit in here.

485
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,520
There's something else. Let's go one by one on this one.

486
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,360
I mean, come on. Here, I'll go first.

487
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,160
You go first.

488
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,880
What did you get?

489
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,040
What is that?

490
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,160
- It's a paint your own wind chime.

491
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,240
- You got a paint your own wind chime?

492
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
- Of a unicorn.

493
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,900
- Wow.

494
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,740
- For ages three and up.

495
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,680
Unicorn paint brush and paint brush included.

496
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
- And check out what I got.

497
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,080
Smile factory.

498
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,880
- You got a smile factory?

499
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,200
- You know, you could be the foreman at the smile factory.

500
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,880
- You kind of are a smile factory for me.

501
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,840
- You have such a joyous fucking smile on you.

502
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,500
- Yeah, you're always making me smile.

503
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,840
You're kind of manufacturing smiles for me.

504
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,680
- And let's blow that away.

505
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
Oh, it got all wet.

506
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,920
Okay, let's see what I got here.

507
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,620
Oh my god.

508
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,220

Which dinosaur do you think made it?

519
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,520
That's what it says on the back.

It's got a perfect nail and hair set,

626
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140

627
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
"There's hair chalk!"

628
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140

633
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,800
Chuck has a what does it say on the back here? It says it has titanium

634
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,300
Titanium dioxide

635
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:16,660
Titanium all in it's very strong titanium and the nail polish has aluminum and this comes with six hair chalk to glitter nail polish one

636
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Toe separator one nail file and one rope go ahead

637
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,380

638
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,500
- What's the rope for?

639
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,100
- Go ahead and put some of that chalk in your hair.

640
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,020
I wanna see what colors that you can come up with.

641
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,140
- Oh, you should give yourself one colored bang.

642
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,260
- 'Cause Cameron, you're just so creative,

643
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,100
and I wanna see what you will do with something like this.

644
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,540
Oh my God, it looks so much fun.

645
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Guys, I'm-- - I like how it's like

646
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,440
this kind of opaque plastic.

647
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,620
- Oh, look at that.

648
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,180
There's glitter everywhere.

649
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Which hair color are you gonna put in?

650
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Pink.

651
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
He's gonna put pink in his hair.

652
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
He's putting pink in his hair.

653
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Real men wear pink in their hair.

654
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
As chalk from the nail and hair combination.

655
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
How do I use this? I think you just rub it in.

656
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Do I just hold it with my hands?

657
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Maybe there's something in here. What's this?

658
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
That is a kind of monkey.

659
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Let's see, does it open?

660
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Not for use in eyes area.

661
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,260
That's lip balm.

662
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
And it tastes like green apple

663
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,020
Really how does that feel?

664
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,400
Dry and waxy yeah, all right. We'll just apply all your fingers should

665
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,220
Apply the hair chalk with those those digits chalky. I would hope so it's damn chalk

666
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,140
Let's get now put on your bang. No no no we need it. Oh

667
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,380

titanium dioxide in there? I can't smell it but I can feel it in my nose. Yeah.

671

You need more. You need much much more. You need a lot more. Yeah. And look you're getting it

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,980
Nail polish yeah, you're right. What's this last one here? Huh? Who's that -?

679
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,380

681
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,500
Caleb

682
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:10,220
Okay, it appears. I got this for myself because I was so jealous of you guys having fucking awesome gifts from my mind

683
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,020
Because I guess your gifts are gonna be crap so I got myself a little something

684
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:40,540
Wow

685
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:46,540
playset. That's incredible. I need you to put on this mask right away. Trust me. That's why I got it.

686
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:56,540
There's so much badass crap in here. There's this mask, first of all, which doesn't have a way to go on your head.

687
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:05,540
Just hold it up. Looks good. Actually, we want this. That looks good. You could tuck it into the brim of your hat.

688
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540
Oh, I could.

689
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,700
Here, now hold your mic.

690
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Hold on, hold on. You hold my mic.

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
There's nothing I can do with that.

693
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
I got a walkie-talkie.

694
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860

That's a cool watch, too.

699
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Yeah, it doesn't look big enough.

700

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
It smells like bod black.

742
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100

What does it say? What does it say? I can't read it.

773
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,600
I made you a self-portrait on a t-shirt that you can wear.

774
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,100

I've never had a friendship like ours, and you are my fucking best-ass friend.

777
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,000
Why don't you put that shirt on right now?

778
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,800
It's going on my ass right fucking now.

779
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
On your ass.

780
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,520

782
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,080
How did you make this?

783
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080

Christmas is so nice this year.

That's so pretty!

791
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,780
It's pretty, I would say it's pretty accurate.

792
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,780
You could also go to a punk rock show with that

793
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,280
and people would be like, "This guy is hardcore, he has a DIY shirt."

794
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
True.

795
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
And then you'd be like, "It's actually not hardcore, it's lovely."

796
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Yeah.

797
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,780
Because my friend made it.

798
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,780
But I also keep it a little bit classy by bringing my collar out of it.

799

830
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Holy fucking shit.

831
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,540
What does it say?

832
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,540
It says magic

833
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,540
display

834
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,540
It says magic display

835
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,540
You can make it say whatever you want

836
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,540
There's an app you can download

837
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
to make it say whatever you like

838
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Oh my god! This is incredible

839
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,540
I know you've always wanted a hat

840
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,540
that says magic display

841
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,540
So I got you one that not only says that

842
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,540
but it moves around on the hat

843
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
And you can make it say magic display in different colors

844
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,500
- Yeah.

845
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,340
- Well, I don't think that's possible.

846
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,820
- Look at this accessory on the back.

847
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
- I think it's only blue.

848
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,980
- Okay, well, it's a very cool gift regardless.

849
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,180
(laughing)

850
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,220
- And I thought you would like that

851
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,900
'cause I know you're a fan of hats.

852
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,740
And I thought maybe you'd like a--

853
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,540
- Yeah, I mean, you know I'm a fashion guy.

854
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,380
Look at this shirt that I made.

855
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,780
- And this is a fascist guy.

856
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,020
(laughing)

857
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:53,020
So, I do, there's one more gift to give out.

858
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,980
- Give it to me.

859
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
- I'm not gonna give it to you if you do that.

860
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,980
You are coding this hat. I think that's how you get the app.

861
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Oh, okay. This is so much fun to hold a gun to people's heads.

862
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,980
So here, Caleb, here is a gift.

863
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Check out this bag, everybody. The golden reindeer. Somebody mic me.

864
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,980
That is the most golden-est reindeer I've ever seen. Alright guys, this is the last gift, right?

865
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,980
The last gift. Yeah, I'm very excited. And I think you're going to like this one a lot, Caleb. I tailored it to your interests.

866
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,480
So go ahead and unfold that and hold it up.

867
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Oh, it looks like it got glitter all over it.

868
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Holy shit, what the hell is this?

869
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,480
I'm getting the coolest fucking outfit of all time today!

870
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,980
Oh my god, it's a badass fucking hoodie that says "Hip Hop" on it!

871
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
This thing's going on too!

872
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
Oh wow.

873
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
From a punker to a rapper.

874
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
Throw that thing on, dude.

875
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,980
And doesn't the texture feel incredible?

876
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Oh my god, it's comfortable.

877
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,740
You look incredible.

878
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,120
And turn around and show the back of it, Caleb.

879
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,360
It's exactly the same.

880
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,240
[LAUGHTER]

881
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,160
Wow, dude.

882
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,960
Yeah, I thought you might really like that.

883
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
Thank you so much.

884
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,560
Merry Christmas.

885
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,920
Merry Christmas, guys.

886
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,520
This has got to be our best Christmas yet.

887
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,840
It has been so far.

888
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
Wait, this is a-- oh my god, I got a badge as well.

889

We're gonna have to go to the Christmas emergency room.

906
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,180
Definitely.

907
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,780
We didn't just get gifts for each other.

908
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,200
We actually got a gift for our listeners,

909
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,620
which is a podcast episode.

910
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,700
We did, yeah.

911
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,380
We just did about 20 minutes of opening gifts for ourselves.

912
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,620
Wait, can you get a punch in on this?

913
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,940
I think I changed my display.

914
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,140
What does it say?

915
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,320
S rocks.

916
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,420
It's supposed to, wait.

917
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,340
Oh, oh!

918
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh, Chrisma!

919
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,620
Chrisma.

920
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,740
Chrisma?

921
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,580
S rocks.

922
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,660
(laughing)

923
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,300
Wow, I'm so glad you're having fun with your hat, Patrick.

924
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
Yeah.

925
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,060
So I actually have prepared, as some people

926
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,180
may remember, that we've done, we've looked at a website before that had some

927
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,100
interesting information about Santa Claus.

928
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,700
And what would that be?

929
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,180
And that website was Mystic Investigations.

930
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:37,460
Yes.

931
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,660
And it was when we learned about Santa Claus and the anti-claws and all this stuff.

932
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,700
I'll say it. One of the all time best.

933
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,260
One of the greatest websites I've ever loved.

934
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,020
Yes.

935
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,540
And I have prepared

936
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:55,060
a few just a few tidbits from this from mystic investigations that i want to

937
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,840
share with you guys uh...

938
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,600
and you know i uh... you guys have never seen the website for cousin we did it

939
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,340

940
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,940
well i'm mesmerized

941
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,980

942
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,020
right now i like that

943
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,660
the

944
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,940
- No, I think, you see Pat, I think,

945
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,160
I've been thinking that you should have,

946
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,000
- What? - Should wear your hat

947
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,540
in like a hip hop sideways style.

948
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,720
I've been thinking that lately for no reason, yeah.

949
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,860
- Or maybe wear it like this.

950
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,700
That's a cool way to wear a hat.

951
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,620
- That's a cool way to wear a hat.

952
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,860
(laughing)

953
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:36,540
- Wait, hold on.

954
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, I didn't, it didn't say the full thing.

955
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,420
I'm sorry, hold on, let me fix it real quick.

956
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,420
- Okay, what is it?

957
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,080
- No.

958
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,440
- Don't do that. - It should be fixed now.

959
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,360
- Don't do that to us.

960
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,400
Yep, it says the same thing.

961
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
(laughing)

962
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,280
- I guess it's not working.

963
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,320
- You hit the character limit.

964
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,720
You can't call both of us a pedo.

965
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,520
- Oh, something's happening.

966
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
- Now it's just point and hit.

967
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,160
(laughing)

968
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,080
- This is truly most the incredible hat ever.

969
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,160
- I'm gonna have to agree.

970
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,760
- Yeah. - Yeah.

971
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,300
So yeah, I have some stuff from the Mystic Christmas blog.

972
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,480
So let's take a look at what's going on here.

973
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,320
First of all, Disney's Frozen Queen Elsa is real

974
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,320
and she knows Jack Frost.

975
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,580
(laughter)

976
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,740
- It really startled you?

977
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
- Oh God, no!

978
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,900
China's grenade perfume is hitting me.

979
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,740
(laughter)

980
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,560
Oh my God.

981
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,060
- In fact though, she's not just real,

982
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,180
but when we go forward here,

983
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,520
Snow Queen Elsa has met Keanu Reeves.

984
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,280
On December 26th, 2015, Elsa appeared at the North Pole

985
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,760
and met fellow immortal, the actor Keanu Reeves.

986
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,200
He was visiting there for the first time

987
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,980
since the 21st century let him discover

988
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,540
the most enchanted avenues of the supernatural world.

989
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,340
Keanu really hit it off with Elsa.

990
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,300
Some think Santa invited Reeves to the North Pole

991
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,120
just to set him up with Elsa.

992
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,080
They began dating and are often considered

993
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,160
the premier couple of love when they visit.

994
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,040
Their relationship has endured despite them

995
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,080
often being apart.

996
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,080
Keanu travels to Arendelle between film projects

997
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,360
and his own supernatural slaying activities.

998
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,880
Elsa goes to his home in California

999
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,520
when her busy schedule allows for it.

1000
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,760
- Oh my God.

1001
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,600
- Did you guys know this?

1002
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,520
I didn't realize Keanu Reeves is straight up clapping Elsa's fucking butt cheeks.

1003
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,020
Yeah, in the North Pole too.

1004
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,420
Yeah, and sometimes in California.

1005
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,220
They must be doing it to keep warm.

1006
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,820
Yeah, I guess so.

1007
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,020
You think Keanu Reeves is like a real warm cock?

1008
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,020
Yeah.

1009
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
Oh, I didn't know that.

1010
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,020
He does.

1011
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,020
Yeah, and her pussy gets cold?

1012
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Her pussy is frozen.

1013
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,740
Oh, wait, why does she want to keep warm?

1014
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,740
She's a fucking snow-ass bitch.

1015
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,100
Yeah, she likes the frozen, I mean the cold.

1016
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100
You're making shit up.

1017
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
I'm making shit up.

1018
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
They're doing it to keep cold

1019
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,800
Yana Reeves is trying to keep cold my dick is way too hot my balls are on fucking fire

1020
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,380
Elsa you need to cool them off with your complete icy hole yeah, it's true John wick more like hot dick

1021
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,880
Yeah for yeah, or and no they were four inches. Okay. I think Keanu Reeves has a big cock whoa

1022
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,540
What's happened to my hat?

1023
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,100
Hacked by Jubio. Oh my god. It was hacked great. That's great. All right. Let's go next here

1024
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:15,500
Elsa and Keanu Reeves update the happy couple was seen on Valentine's Day 2016 at Elsa's ice castle in northern Norway

1025
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:22,040
Oh, there's I'm so that's Elsa by various members of the supernatural community. She's looking a bit on the elderly yeah

1026
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,620
Yeah, kind of I mean listen, and this is one year from the last one Wow

1027
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,140
Gilf status a little bit yeah

1028
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,100
grandma I

1029
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,620
Love frozen mm-hmm

1030
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:43,220
That's me telling my grandma that I love bro. Dude that movie is fire. Should I say ice it is yeah ice cold movies ice

1031
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:48,620
Ice ice cold. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Let's go forward here. What so here's something I found article

1032
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,660
I found on mystic investigations that actually I did not expect this is not the way I expected this website to go, okay

1033
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:59,820
What does Santa Claus look like is Santa Claus white and we have a picture of Santa Claus and let's go next here

1034
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,220
Technically is not white if one is talking about having classically Nordic features Santa Claus is Greek and as an olive completion

1035
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,560
Common among those of Mediterranean descent he actually lies somewhere in between white and black

1036
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,080
at least

1037
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,600
At least that's what his human half displays as he is half angel as well

1038
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,540
He has emerald green eyes that glow a bright white when activating his various angelic powers if you look closely

1039
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,200
You can actually see even brighter white specks flying about his eyes like that of a snow globe

1040
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,940
This is not seen among other demi angels and is most likely the spirit of Christmas flowing through him

1041
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,060
And this we can skip over the rest of this and go to the next one here

1042
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:41,680
The whole impetus of this article is reading this article and that was a link and I clicked on that link and it was this

1043
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,140
Well Santa Claus cannot be a white man anymore. It's time to give st. Nick his long overdue makeover. Oh, yeah, click right there

1044
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,800
He's a black man. Yeah, so let's go forward here

1045
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,680
The whole impetus of this article is reading this article which appears to be another politically correct fueled race obsessed

1046
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:02,600
Diatribe against the traditions of Christmas the author of the article wants the white Santa to become a black penguin

1047
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,940
Santa could indeed turn himself into a penguin, but why the hell would he however he loves penguins and adopted some from the South Pole

1048
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,140
They waddle about the quaint cobblestone streets of North Pole village with glee at Christmas time

1049
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,860
He actually does put little Santa hats on them. It's beyond adorable

1050
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:21,140
It seems like Xavier kind of got off topic there by the end of that. Yeah. Yeah, I do really well

1051
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,100
Yeah, but they want to turn Santa to a black penguin is one being like

1052
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,100
Santa needs to be not a white guy, but a penguin.

1053
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,940
- Yeah.

1054
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,380
- That's what they think is like the, like...

1055
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,740
- Man, I'm sick of these white Santas.

1056
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,700
He should be a penguin.

1057
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,540
- Yeah.

1058
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,300
- And we go forward here, I think,

1059
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,420
yeah, Xavier gets back on topic here.

1060
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,260
Maybe the author of the black Santa penguin article

1061
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,460
can't grasp that fake Santas are generally white

1062
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,400
because the majority populace, at least in the US,

1063
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,860
is white in appearance for now.

1064
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,140
This is reflected in his image being used in various venues

1065
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,300
in his portrayal in films.

1066
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,340
If the majority was black, then most of the Santas

1067
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,220
probably be black as well. Santa Claus loves people of all races and he approves of fake

1068
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,100
Santas of all races. Fake Santas? Of all races. Who wish to spread the spirit of Christmas

1069
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,380
since Saint Nick himself can't be in every mall in the world. Although he does make it

1070
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,540
to some and if it's in a nation of mostly one race he has been known to change his appearance

1071
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,080
to that race so as not to stand out in a crowd. Clearly he would look out of place in China

1072
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,900
or Africa. If your kid has ever seemed totally enchanted and beyond happy after visiting

1073
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,500
a mall Santa then odds are it was the real Santa Claus.

1074
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,380
- Yeah, Santa does a great job blending in

1075
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,500
with the big red outfit, the Santa hat,

1076
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,980
the reindeer and the sleigh.

1077
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,220
As long as he matches the race of the majority

1078
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,900
of the people in whatever country he's in.

1079
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,100
- He pulls up the statistics on his phone.

1080
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,740
- Yeah, and he goes, "Oh, goddamn,

1081
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,740
"looks like I'm fucking Dominican today."

1082
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,580
(laughing)

1083
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:45,260
- He has to choose before he goes out.

1084
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,740
I'm so distracted by the fucking,

1085
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,580
I'm making it say so much funny stuff.

1086
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,260
- What did you make it say this time?

1087
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,900
I think you have to pick one for the rest of it.

1088
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,240
- Yeah, you have to stop. - And then we can stop.

1089
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,420
- We'll take this, we'll take Santa Claus.

1090
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,500
- Santa Claus. - We'll take Santa Claus.

1091
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,060
- Yeah. - Okay.

1092
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,900
- Let me make it snow.

1093
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,500
- You can make it snow? - Watch.

1094
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,420
- Wow, this is cool. - Wait, what?

1095
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,020
- You suck. - Oh.

1096
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,100
- There we go.

1097
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,020
- It's still not snowing. - Okay, this is awesome.

1098
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,460
- Oh, there it is. - There it goes, all right.

1099
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,020
- Wow. - Santa Cole.

1100
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,100
- Santa Cole. - And then it's gonna say

1101
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:13,940
- And it's gonna say - Ows.

1102
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,860
- Ows. - Yeah, all right,

1103
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,740
I guess I'll just. - Okay, phone away.

1104
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,780
- Okay. - Now this is an ad

1105
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,200
that I saw at the bottom of this page

1106
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,560
that really made me laugh.

1107
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,160
(laughing)

1108
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,000
It is a direct screenshot from the website.

1109
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,120
It's cut off a little there, but it just says ad,

1110
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,200
and it has a picture of a Christmas train.

1111
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,120
- Did you click on the ad?

1112
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,280
- I did click on it, and you go next.

1113
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,480
It's a goosh lighted Christmas snow globe lantern,

1114
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,240
four snowman families singing under a tree,

1115
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,920
and musical decoration with battery operated

1116
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,460
LED water glittering music playing

1117
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,280
with six hour timer Christmas home decor.

1118
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,000
- So you didn't get one for me?

1119
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,080
- This was expensive.

1120
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,440
- Oh, eh.

1121
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,040
- And I only saw it today.

1122
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,880
- Oh, eh, damn.

1123
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,720
- Yeah.

1124
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,920
I wish I had this. Maybe we can all go in on one for the office. I'm down. How much is it?

1125
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,280
I don't remember, but I think it was 50 bucks. We'll pick one up next time we're at Goosh.

1126
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,320
I'm always at Goosh. Goosh does make good-ass lighted Christmas snow globe lanterns. Good,

1127
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,800
awesome, awesome Santa hat. Everybody knows Goosh's reputation. I cannot believe how good

1128
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,600
our outfits are. I know. Our fits are cray. I have multiple layers, you look cray cray

1129
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,960
- I'm Cray AF, and you look like a fly ass motherfucker.

1130
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,000
- Yeah, you do.

1131
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
- Sorry, oh, that's just my clothes talking.

1132
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,920
(imitates a bird)

1133
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,280
All right, let's continue now.

1134
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,640
- I've been trying to bring back Cray,

1135
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,880
just saying something is Cray.

1136
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,720
- That shit Cray?

1137
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,280
- No, not saying that shit Cray,

1138
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,720
I'm saying like, yeah, that's Cray.

1139
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,960
- That is pretty Cray.

1140
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,240
- Yeah, that's a Cray ass thing you wanna do.

1141
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,080
- There's nothing--

1142
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,800
- What'd you say, that's a Cray ass thing you wanna do?

1143
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,280
- You wanna do?

1144
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,160
- Wanna do.

1145
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,120
- You wanna do?

1146
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,040
- Yeah, you wanna do.

1147
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,640
- You are cray, bro, you are acting cray today.

1148
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,480
- What?

1149
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,340
- Stop acting sassy with your tag, please.

1150
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,180
Continue the slideshow.

1151
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,560
- Okay, next.

1152
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,560
This is another section of the website that I discovered,

1153
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,960
and this is called North Pole City.

1154
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,640
♪ North Pole City, please go easy on me ♪

1155
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,560
- And something that you will see on the next--

1156
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,480
- That's good.

1157
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,760
- Something you'll see on the next few screenshots

1158
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,040
of North Pole City is it's very hard to get screenshots--

1159
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,840
- Oh, okay, go back here for a second, please.

1160
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,840
I'll tell you when to go to the next one.

1161
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,080
(laughing)

1162
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,120
It's very hard to get screenshots of this website

1163
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,420
because these, you can see at the bottom,

1164
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,200
see that present and that sleigh and stuff?

1165
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,160
These are things that move across the screen constantly.

1166
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,100
Those lights at the top, those are always there,

1167
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,640
no matter where you scroll.

1168
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,000
And also you'll see little snowflakes,

1169
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,240
those are constantly falling across the screen.

1170
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,440
So they have like three layers of stuff

1171
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,400
that move around across the website.

1172
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,200
And now we can go forward a slide here.

1173
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,920
And this is Santa's elves.

1174
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,760
- Wow.

1175
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,600
- That's one of them right there.

1176
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,400
- I gotta say, if elves are that small

1177
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,160
and they have children motor skills,

1178
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,840
they're not very effective probably.

1179
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,680
- No.

1180
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,520
- You probably need a lot of them.

1181
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,800
- Well you'd think like, you know,

1182
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,560
maybe that like some years you get a bad gift, right?

1183
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,640
- It's probably one of the elves

1184
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,460
fucking up their baby. - Oh this shit is probably

1185
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,720
made by a terrible elf.

1186
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,200
- A baby elf. - It really is a fucker.

1187
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,240
- Whoa, don't point that at that elf.

1188
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,080
- Stop.

1189
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,280
- That's not right.

1190
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,900
Don't do that.

1191
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,220
Leave him alone.

1192
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,380
And I put it sideways.

1193
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,940
No, I put it sideways.

1194
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:21,540
And I hold this straight.

1195
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,740
Normal, not sideways.

1196
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,740
And I got...

1197
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:30,140
That's not computer duster.

1198
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,980
That's liquid.

1199
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,800
This is liquid.

1200
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,380
This is like Windex you just spray it into your face.

1201
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,220
What, spray it in your mouth?

1202
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,500
I thought that was the duster.

1203
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,880
It's contact cleaner.

1204
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,900
This is like poison.

1205
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,100
- Well, at the end of the episode,

1206
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,860
we will call Poison Control.

1207
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,220
(laughing)

1208
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,700
- Okay, next slide here.

1209
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,740
Here's a list of Santa's elves.

1210
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,580

00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,780

1212
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,780

- Chief what, Caleb?

1220
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,580
He's the nogger of the eggs, he nogs all the eggs up.

1221
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,620
Eggy Elf is involved in all egg-related endeavors.

1222
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,220
Oh my gosh!

1223
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,060
Look a few above Eggnog, or one above Eggnog Elf here.

1224
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,540
Cameron Elf, in charge of dolls and toys that come to life

1225
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,260
within the magical confines of NPC.

1226
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,300
North Pole City!

1227
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,180

- And Iggy Elf manages the Internet Cafe.

1242
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,660
- Wait, Abe Elf?

00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,580
but yeah, it's also Santa Claus and the elves.

1247
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,420
- And it's secret.

1248
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,580

1249
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580

00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,740
the free Wi-Fi internet at North Pole City.

1252
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,260
You telling me they got fucking,

1253
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,580
they got fiber over there in North Pole City?

1254
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,300
- We don't have it in New York City, Dan.

1255
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,900
- Well, so they have Gerbert Elf, second youngest elf,

1256
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,940
aka the Peppermint Ice Cream Bandit, apprentice in training.

1257
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,780
- Whoa. - Oh my God.

1258
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,520
- And then they also have Baby Elf, the youngest elf.

1259
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,820
Newborn elves are named Baby until eventually given a name.

1260
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,860
- Oh, okay, that's kind of interesting.

1261
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,160
Bonnie Elf, the lifeguard who watches the water.

1262
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,220

00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,220

manager of Ernie Elf's Enchanted Emporium.

1265
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,620
- I wanna go.

1266
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,740
- This, there's, that's also fewer elves

1267
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,540
I would expect yeah, it's really not that many for a whole city. There's not humans up there really yeah

1268
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:47,620
I mean you really you really need to Wi-Fi elves yeah to internet elves and to egg elves

1269
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:52,340
And I think maybe you could get rid of the peppermint ice cream bandit. He seems like a maybe a negative elf

1270
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:59,540
Fraggle elf yeah known to run mystic investigations when the team is vacationing at North Pole City. His name is fraggle

1271
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:04,180
Yeah, and is he is he part fraggle? I don't know what the hell you're on about fraggle like a

1272
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:09,000

1275
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,420
I know what you guys are thinking. There's something missing from this list of elves and that is next slide

1276
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,820
And it was not what I was thinking human elves whoa

1277
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,620
next slide please

1278
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,300
There is a non-supernatural adult human chosen every 12 years

1279
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,860
So you can see the snowflakes are blocking up for the words here

1280
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,800
Who has a hundred percent complete belief in Santa Claus along with a total infusion of Christmas spirit within them for those in the paranormal?

1281
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,280
No, it is too easy to have such belief and mo

1282
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,620
Of course most children believe as well

1283
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:54,780
It is truly something special for an average adult to have the spirit of Christmas dwelled deeply within them all year round with an unshakable

1284
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,780
Belief in Father Christmas when such a person is found Santa Claus reveals himself to the lucky individual and they are whisked away to North

1285
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,880
Pole City to become a human elf in a special ceremony. Human elves are granted immortality

1286
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,880
as long as they stay within the walls of North Pole City most of the time. They also gain

1287
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,100
elfin powers. Whoa! So you can become a human elf if you believe in Santa enough. I wanna

1288
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,480

00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,940
- And that is what a human elf is.

1320
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,820
- Wow.

1321
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,980
- That's what human elves do.

1322
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,580
- I think I'd like to become one and become--

1323
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,420
- Yeah, me too. - I would like to become

1324
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:18,860
a human elf as well. - I don't think I would like

1325
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,420
to become deaf all that badly.

1326
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,900
- No, but there is something else that we could become,

1327
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,100
and I'm not sure if it's the next slide,

1328
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,140
but it's coming up, so keep that in your mind.

1329
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,020
And let's go next, it is the next thing.

1330
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,980
So we have an events calendar here.

1331
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:32,820
- Oh shit.

1332
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,660
- This is what's happening this December.

1333
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,480
- Of course. - North Pole City.

1334
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,060
- We have Christmas Eve, we have Christmas.

1335
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,700
On the 23rd, you'll notice there's anti-clause repentance.

1336
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,100
So that's the day you're supposed to repent

1337
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,940
for the sins of anti-clause.

1338
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,780
- So we were supposed to do that last night.

1339
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,620
- So we should have done that yesterday.

1340
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,700
- Wait, I have to repent for anti-clause's fucking bullshit,

1341
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,940
or he's repenting for himself?

1342
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,780
- It's unclear.

1343
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,100
- I think you repent so that he doesn't get you.

1344
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,300
- Hurt me. - Yeah.

1345
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,280
- But the reason that I put this calendar here,

1346
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,500
six days away, everybody, the Claws Awards.

1347
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,340
- No way.

1348
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,740
- The Claws Awards held in North Pole City.

1349
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,700
- I want to be nominated, and not only that--

1350
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
- I think that maybe we could have a chance

1351
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,780
because of all this Christmas cheer we just spread today.

1352
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,020
- Oh, 100 P.

1353
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,300
- I spread contact cleaner to my chin.

1354
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,640
- Exactly.

1355
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,640
He spread that.

1356
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,020
He spread hat all across his head.

1357
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:24,140
Yeah, yeah, wait a minute. You spread the folds of your brain smooth and wide. I have an amazing idea for what I can put on this

1358
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,860
Which um, which awards you think we would be we'd be eligible for?

1359
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:35,400
Maybe most holly and most jolly. Most holly and most jolly. Dual awards. Most cheer spreading. Best three friends to give presents each other

1360
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:41,360
Oh for sure. Yeah, that's an issue and greatest three friends is definitely up there. Yeah sure. Best picture?

1361
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,520
His best hat that says Christmas cheer, but does it in a reverse? Chris just says Chris. Yeah

1362
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Chris. Chris. Chris.

1363
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,520
Cheer. Chris. I think I could win a

1364
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,520
Chris award too. Yeah? From Chris? From Chris. Wait a minute. I don't think there is a Chris award.

1365
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:02,520
You can play music off of this thing? No, oh wait. Wait.

1366
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,520
Oh my god. It does sound bars.

1367
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,520
Whoa! Holy fucking shit. And this song is beautiful.

1368
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,520
This is the best hat I've

1369
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:22,120
ever seen in my fucking life. Was this $600? Yeah. Wow. How much was this? A gift giver

1370
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,800
never tells. Oh my god. A gift giver never tells. Look at this one. At what? It's the

1371
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:34,440
same. That just says "Krisma." Okay, wait. Oh, what is that? Who the fuck is that? I don't

1372
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:41,600
know. I'm fucking terrified. What is that? Ow. Sorry. Dollars! Dollars! I like those.

1373
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
I like those.

1374
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,000
Dollars!

1375
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Woah.

1376
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Okay.

1377
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Alright, back to the sludge.

1378
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,600
That's the last slide I believe, I think.

1379
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,600
Oh my god.

1380
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Wait, wait, oh my god!

1381
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
This is like a...

1382
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:58,600
We are getting a fucking Claus award.

1383
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,600
I'm smelling a Cla-

01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,600
We are totally getting a Claus award.

1385
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,600
I'm smelling a Claus-y right now.

1386
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,600
I'm smelling computer duster.

1387
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,600
Still?

1388
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,600

(Christmas music)

1394
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,460
- That's not a Christmas gift.

1395
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,340
- All right, can we clear off the middle of this here?

1396
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,580
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, what's up?

1397
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,820
Why do you need this clear?

1398
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,180
- I have a special surprise.

1399
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,220
- A special surprise, a Christmas surprise?

1400
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,940
- Well, more of a Christmas Eve surprise.

1401
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,880
And so, something that you guys may remember,

1402
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,700
may or may not remember, long time fans.

1403
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,540
The first episode ever of Podcasts Without Lists

1404
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,680
came out on Christmas Eve, 2018.

1405
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,780
Which I have no idea why we did that.

1406
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,460
- Wow. - What reason?

1407
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:54,340
- We have to be the biggest geniuses of all time.

1408
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,940
There's not a better time to start a podcast.

1409
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,420
- No, who wants to listen to a,

1410
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,820
well there's no better time to listen

1411
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,940
to a first episode of a podcast.

1412
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,780
- 100%.

1413
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,900
- On Christmas Eve.

1414
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,820
- That means that this is canonically a Christmas podcast.

1415
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,260
- It is. - There's no doubt.

1416
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,540
- We are the diehard of podcasts.

1417
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,460
- Here, I want you to hold my microphone for me,

1418
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,500
for God's sake.

1419
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,940
Please. - This is crap.

1420
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,620
- Please hold it. - He's being a crap face.

1421
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,160
- Because today, you're so bad at holding this.

1422
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,740
Hold it up where I can talk, thank you.

1423
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,340
Because today is, okay, all right, this is awesome.

1424
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,180
Today is not only Christmas Eve, okay?

1425
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,680
- That's not the only holiday.

1426
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:39,500
- Oh my God, Baby Fud's birthday!

1427
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,780
- Today is Baby Fud's fourth birthday.

1428
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:44,740
- Wow. - Everybody.

1429
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,580
- Oh my God, he's so cute.

1430
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,420
- Look at him.

1431
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,820
- And of course, I--

1432
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,620
- I'll hold him up for you.

1433
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,060
- What are you doing, Pat?

1434
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,540
I was adjusting the mic. - I don't know what to do.

1435
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,380
- You just hold it.

1436
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,540
It's the same as holding it for yourself.

1437
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,380
Please.

1438
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,340
- No, I'll hold Fudd here.

1439
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,140
And I actually got Fudd something special from all of us.

1440
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:06,420
- Oh my God.

1441
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,260
- Yup.

1442
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,080
- What is it?

1443
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,380
- I will give you the honor of opening it for him, Caleb.

1444
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,460
- It says, "To Fudd, from PAL."

1445
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,100
And you guys know what that stands for.

1446
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,260
- Podcast about Liz.

1447
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,140
- Caleb, yeah, okay.

1448
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,580
- Fudd, you're getting a fourth birthday present.

1449
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,900
- Oh.

1450
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,940
- I thought he was finally mature enough to own one of these.

1451
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,020
- He can finally be trusted with a power outlet.

1452
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,900
His very first extension cord.

1453
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,820
- Ah, all right.

1454
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,420
- Guys, I really am so excited.

1455
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,420
- Well, let's plug him in.

1456
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,240
- Go ahead.

1457
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:40,300
- This is gonna be awesome for him.

1458
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,100
- Let me get it plugged in down here.

1459
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,220
Okay.

01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,980
