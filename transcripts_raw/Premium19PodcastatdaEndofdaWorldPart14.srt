Caleb was just talking about how his whole thing on Twitter is pretending to be black.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
No, I was saying- We were talking about Patrick.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,300
Patrick, honestly, was literally saying that one of those guys who's a white guy pretending to be black is one of his favorite Twitter users.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,300
I didn't say he was one of my favorites.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
He said "Deebo is pretty funny."

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
What do you think is funny about him?

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
Is it the way he talks?

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
There is the old, like his Brailed account.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
I don't know what that is.

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
The Brailed parody that he has.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300

What?

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
We should say we're starting a marathon.

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,340
new style. So we were gonna do the same thing for our brother's birthdays. Yeah

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,500
which are only two weeks apart or a week apart. But you weren't gonna go to

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
Vegas. I wasn't gonna go to Vegas. No but you were gonna go to a casino.

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,180
Your brother's 21st? Yeah. Yeah that's what you gotta do. You gotta take him

83
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,780
somewhere. You gotta put him in a pool and make him pee in it. Yeah my mom just

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,700
had him at the restaurant she works at last night she just kept giving him free

85
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,820
drinks your mom had him at a restaurant last night last night and he turns one

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,120
he'll he's in dog years double dog years double double double dog it'd be triple

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,980
dog years no wait cuz if it was that's what I yeah when I was trying to get

88
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:38,540
laid as a baby how old are you I'd say I'm dumb 18 and double dog years

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Yeah.

90
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,420
And then she always fell for it.

91
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Yeah.

92
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,620
So you'd be two or two and a half.

93
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,100
Two and three quarters.

94
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,660
I was too young to do the math.

95
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
Yeah.

96
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Yeah.

97
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,660
I probably was off by a little bit.

98
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm actually a thousand years old.

99
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm actually a vampire.

100
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
He was actually 19.

101
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah.

102
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
I was actually 19.

103
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
In dog years, I'm 18.

104
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Dogs, yeah.

105
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,660
Dogs are always 18.

106
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
You subtract one year.

107
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,780
Because if a dog was the size of a person, they'd probably have health problems.

108
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,020
If a dog turned 18, you could finally have sex with it.

109
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
But they never will.

110
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
That's the thing about them.

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
That's why you can't.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,060
That was like one of my first stand-up jokes I did.

113
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,380
It was like the reason you can't fuck a dog is because they don't live to 18.

114
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,780
Not very funny.

115
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Kind of like...

116
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,140
Well, yeah, because then you start to picture what that dog would look like and it's just

117
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,700
got like a milky white eye.

118
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,580
Yeah, it has like, you know, it has like eye boogers that are like dripping off of its

119
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,580
face.

120
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Yeah.

121
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
And it's got like a...

122
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
You know when dog...

123
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,580
Just a broken leg.

124
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,300
that old homeless guys beards get where it starts it grows out so much that it's discolored at the end

125
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,700
it's like they've been dipping it in with the homeless guy in front of 7-eleven it's because

126
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,380
he keeps drinking dr pepper and like accidentally dipping it in the big gulp but with a dog they

127
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,900
have no excuse yeah you ever google it's because they're rolling around in their shit ugliest dog

128
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,900
ever you ever google i feel like i've googled that so many times oh yeah when i was in when i was in

129
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,580

130
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,300
eyes. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of. That's what it would look like. What's that kind of

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:15,540
dog called? It's called like a zyko. It's called a Zion dog. Zion? Yeah. With an X? No, with

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
This one.

135
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Yeah.

136
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,660
I have seen that.

137
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,940
This is what a dog would look like.

138
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,740
I saw that shit on E-Bombs World.

139
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Yeah, man.

140
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
E-Bombs World used to rock.

141
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,900
You know there were certain games that had boobs in it?

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
Frank's Adventure.

143
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,900
On E-Bombs World?

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Yeah.

145
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
No, I didn't know that.

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,620
Frank's Adventure and then the volleyball game if you put a hack in.

147
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,500
If you play, there's one game, I don't know if I, I think I just found it because I was

148
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,580
trying to download the Sims on my parents computer but I looked up it was called

149
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,340
the Sims day and night I think I played it on ebombs world. You make them go woohoo? No. Oh.

150
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,460
But there it was very strange though because there was a thing where you go to

151
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,340
a club and then you can like take a girl home with you and then it just shows you

152
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,220
like a picture of a real naked woman and it seemed it looked like it was

153
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,340
revenge porn honestly and I said I that I played that when I was nine and I didn't

154
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,940
understand but now that I'm thinking about it that's fucked up thanks for

155
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,580
clarifying mm-hmm yeah you're not so much porn the the Sims day and night gets

156
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,660
four stars for me because four out of a possible five got one star for revenge

157
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:49,420
porn. You piece of shit. I used to, uh, E-Bombs World was like where I lost my virginity.

158
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,380
That was like the only website I went on for so long. Yeah. Yeah. I would do, I would do

159
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,100
remember Virtual Buddy. What is it? Why was it as a kid I was just obsessed with hurting

160
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,420
dynamite. Yeah. So many games. Yeah. Games where I just was like, this is the bloodiest

161
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,780
game ever and yeah I would google crap most gory game yeah Madness Combat no

162
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,420
never play that one no that was very gory like it was like it was a Rayman style

163
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,980
the figures and then they like no you can shoot their hands off yeah that's

164
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,940

- I don't get sick, but when I do,

241
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
- Yeah.

243
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,480
But when I do get sick, it beats the shit out of me.

244
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,200
I was already having problems with my heartburn shit and my acid reflux.

245
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Yeah, my mind.

246
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,120
Yeah, your mind has been really low.

247
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,200
But I threw up just straight orange bile.

248
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:26,720
And then like, anytime I drank water yesterday, I literally missed, I was sleeping here, I

249
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,040
got up and then like that I've puked all over there but it was just straight I

250
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,000
just threw up straight water it was all clear it doesn't surprise me that you

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,720
don't get sick much because you are so full of like chemicals and just like

252
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,360
random like shit preservative yeah I feel like you have like you have like a

253
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,600
halo like over shield yeah you have enough like aspartame in your blood that

254
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,200
any yeah any bacteria that gets in there just instantly like you got past the

255
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,400
point with aspartame where it's possible for you to get cancer with it because

256
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,720
cancer cells will be eaten alive by aspartame. Is there aspartame in this?

257
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:09,760
Yeah dude. No. Yeah, you didn't know monster energy ultra? No, I thought it didn't have

258
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,960
aspartame that's why I drink it. I mean there's no there's definitely, if there's

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,120
not aspartame, there's something else. There's probably something in here that's worse but it's not aspartame.

260
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,120
aspartame. This is my first time. It's chloroform. Whatever it is. Yeah, it's, it's, yeah Patrick

261
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
you have like formaldehyde in your veins. Yeah, you have like, you probably have, of

262
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,000
any of us, you have the most calcified pineal gland. If you tried to, if you tried to donate

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,200
blood it would just kill all the doctors in the room. That's not true, I've donated

264
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,000
blood a few times. Really, but you're gay. Yeah, they wouldn't let you. You don't gotta

265
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,160
tell them. Don't ask, don't tell. That's the policy with blood and the military. Don't

271
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
Christ, P.I.D. is gonna kill us. He's coughing. I can't believe we're sitting here. This is

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
such a bad idea. It's insane. For me this is like my only source of income now though.

273

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:25,040
came out this week more like yeah and all the people go buck wild my mom sends

324
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,520
be a clip of it the next day. That's just her filming the TV with her phone. I heard nowadays

325
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,560
they're calling Mitch McConnell Donald Trump. Rich McConnell? Yeah. Because he's so rich

326
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:42,200
with lies. He's rich with sin. Yeah. Isn't that a little... Your body is completely rich

327
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,440
with sin. And then... Oh yeah that was a Jordan sketch, it's a funny one. I heard about that

328
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,480
before I went to Emerson and then... How? I don't remember. I think I was... I don't

329
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I don't think it got popular online.

330
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
No, someone told me at a party that I was at at Suffolk.

331
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Oh, yeah.

332
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
And then I was like, "Oh, that's pretty funny."

333
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I don't even remember what the onus of the sketch was.

334
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
It's just a...

335
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
The onus?

336
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
Not the onus, the...

337
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
What the hell is an onus?

338
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
An onus is like a burden.

339
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
But, yeah, it's just...

340
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I'm here to call out Caleb producing, pretending to use big words.

341
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
That is the wrong one.

342
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Colin Jost is in a time loop and he can't...

343
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,240
I heard that was actually the bifurcation of the sketch. I believe actually the dichotomy of the yeah

344
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,680
I don't know what either does mean. That was the dichotomy of the sketches hegemony. Yeah. Yeah, that's total that the sketches oligarchy

345
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,200
Was kind of about what if Colin Jost was it was kind of a Dadaist look at yeah

346
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,560
What was the point of the sketch? Oh, it's a Colin Jost is stuck in a time loop. He can't

347
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,600
because he

348
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
He's stuck in a time loop because he tells jokes so bad that

349
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,080
I don't remember. Nice. That was probably the worst 30 seconds in the history of this podcast.

350
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,880
He can't figure out how to tell jokes. All he knows how to do is say jokes in a - all he knows

351
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
how to do is say things in different tones of voice. Oh, okay. Now I remember it. Yeah, yeah.

352
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't think I was at Emerson yet, but I think somebody showed that to me. Yeah.

353
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,520
That's - and I had to - I think that was one where Jordan just started with a funny name for a sketch

354
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,000
and then worked backwards. Yeah. Yeah, because Infinite Jost is pretty good.

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,280
Yeah. It's about as good of a... I didn't know that was CCC until the other day,

356
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,400
and then I was like, oh, it's crazy that that's the first thing I knew about, and then I got into it.

357
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
And you got in, and now you... And now I'm out of it.

358
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,160
And now you're out of it again. Yeah, man, you guys are...

359
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,360
Well, you will graduate. You'll never go to college again. And Patrick will die very soon.

360
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,040
I probably will fail the online semester. I can't do online classes, dude.

361
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,540
Yeah.

362
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I'm already, I'm fucked, I think.

363
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,340
People who don't know that all the, all classes are cancelled and online.

364
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,840
Yeah, for people who don't know that.

365
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
I mean, there's actually a virus going around.

366
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
If anyone gets their news from us,

367
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
the only people who listen to this are the German Big Brother cats.

368
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
In most other states, they aren't doing that yet.

369
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I think it's pretty big news, though.

370
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Yeah, but...

371
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,840
The school I go to is, uh, the campus is closed for the rest of the semester.

372
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,880
- You're such a fucking retard.

373
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
- What?

374
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,540
- Anyway.

375
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,380
- Who is?

376
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,220
- You.

377
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,040
- Why?

378
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
- 'Cause you're gonna fail your classes.

379
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,720
- Yeah, I probably will.

380
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,540
- Yeah.

381
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,400
- Yeah, it pretty much just puts my life off track.

382
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,440
- Yeah.

383
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,540
- Won't get a job.

384
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,980
- Now you're not gonna become the CEO anymore.

385
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,060
- Yeah.

386
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,900
- I mean, I'm kinda screwed.

387
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,420
- I'm gonna be the CEO of this podcast, dude.

388
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,980
- Yeah, you're a head honcho.

389
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,820
- I am.

390
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
- You do wear the headphones.

391
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
- Yeah, I wear the, I own the fucking equipment.

392
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,140
If you guys ever are too mean to me,

393
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,520
the podcast is over.

394
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
- Well, that's true.

395
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,220
I'm putting my foot down right now.

396
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
You just cut all the cords.

397
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Yeah, one sip of Red Bull and that's my ultimatum.

398
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,220
Alright.

Oh, thank you.

429
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,460
it more like this on Pinterest. Can you look up boobs on Pinterest?

430
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:43,700
These ones? That's too hard to read. How about this? What do boys even find attractive about

431
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,700
boobs? They are literally a ball of fat on a girl's chest. Like if you can love me for

432
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,060
the fat on my chest, why can't you love me for the fat on my stomach, you piece of shit?

433
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,380
This is one of Caleb's posts on Pinterest. No, no. I actually had a Pinterest for a while.

434
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,380
You had a Pinterest? Yeah, I would put together, this was back when I was gardening and I would

435
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,780
put together photos of gardening. I have an old Pinterest if you guys want to try and find

436
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:14,380
it. Let's go. I don't know what kind of stuff did you pin. I think it's just like art. I

437
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,740
had one fan on Pinterest who would always DM me. I think it's like art and then like cyberpunk

438
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,780
drawings. It's just like gay shit like that. It's aesthetic. Check, read this one. Caleb.

439
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,660
It's got a call from Full Sail University again.

440
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,660
Nice, dude.

441
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,260
You should've, next time they call, pick up.

442
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,900
Talk to them on the phone.

443
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:42,940
I requested information in 2014 and I, in 2016 when they kept calling me when I was in community

444
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,120
college, I told them to take me off their list.

445
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,340
Now in 2020, apparently they're just going back through and they keep fucking calling

446
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,340
me.

447
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,700
So I gotta pick up one of these times and say I told you motherfuckers to take me out here.

448
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,020
No, pick up and we'll talk to them if they call during the pod.

449
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,220
You stupid four-four-

450
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,720
Can you call them back?

451
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
No, I'm not calling them back.

452
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,520
Do what I do with Capital One and just answer and talk like a baby.

453
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah?

454
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Yeah.

455
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,520
[unintelligible]

456
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Sir, your account is six months past due.

457
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,520
[unintelligible]

458
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
And then I just hang up.

459
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
[unintelligible]

460
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,020
Yeah.

461
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,520
[unintelligible]

462
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Caleb, read this one.

463
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I talk... no.

464
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Go ahead, read it.

465
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
We each read one.

466
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
You have to read this one.

467
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,080
I'll just say, this whole thing is in quotes.

468
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
It's not.

469
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
It's right there.

470
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
It's in quotes.

471
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,680
As I read it, as it passes through my mouth, it's in quotes.

472
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
It's in quotes.

473
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Okay, go ahead, read it.

474
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,440
I talk about wanting a boyfriend, but I don't even know what I'd do with one.

475
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Like what do you do?

476
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,660
Just kiss him and then leave him alone in a corner?

477
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,820
How often does he eat?

478
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,420
And that's a quote from Caleb. No,

479
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:59,940
yeah, we're putting that up as a clip with the episode. No. Yeah.

480
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:09,020
Shit. Oh my God, dude. This monster energy is making me dude on my brain.

481
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,740
So I feel like for like a week and a half now I've been just every night

482
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,060
getting really fucked up and then smoking a lot of weed out of this

483
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,220
Android charger weed cart. Yeah, that thing's awesome. It's I mean, it's made me like noticeably

484
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,020
stupider. Yeah. In the past. That's why I stopped smoking weed. It really it does. If

485
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,940
I if I smoke more than like once a week, I can feel like I like I just fuck up like I

486
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:43,420
can't say words. I forget stuff. And I'm worse at at games. I'm way worse at games. You know,

487
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,940
My reaction time is slow.

488
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
After I lost that pen before...

489
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,820
Also I think the pen is a part of it, because that's not like good...

490
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,020
Yeah, dude, I'm still so mad I lost that. I feel so bad.

491
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,820
In New York?

492
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,420
No, I lost it on the way to New York.

493
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,060
Oh, you're right, yeah.

494
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,500
Because my fucking stupid denim jacket had a hole in the pocket.

495
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,860
Your denim jacket's cool.

496
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,620
Yeah, it's a cool jacket, but that fucking pocket design is stupid as shit.

497
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,140
Oh yeah, I should have brought my pen.

498
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,060
Damn, I would have given it to you, but I don't have it with me.

499
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,940
Damn.

500
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,300
We should do an episode where we all smoke weed.

501
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm afraid of smoking.

502
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,460
We've done that before. I mean, I've done it.

503
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,340
I've never done that.

504
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:17,820
I've gotten way too high before.

505
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,140
I don't think I've recorded high on this. I would not be useful.

506
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,340
I'd suck so bad.

507
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,740
There's so many episodes where I've just fucked up just the momentum of the show.

508
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,700
Because you were high?

509
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,380
Yeah. Because I got high.

510
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:38,140
Oh, nice. Yeah, I don't know. If I smoke, I can't do anything but just watch a funny viddy

511
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,340
and then freak out.

512
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,140
If I smoked weed right now I would be like, "Oh my God, there's something wrong with my

513
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
lungs.

514
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
I have the disease.

515
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,620
I'm killing my family right now."

516
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,660
See, I stopped freaking out because this past week I've just been overloading myself with

517
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
it.

518
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,780
And yeah, it only makes me stupid now.

519
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
I don't even like it.

520
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,940
It's just like if my brain is running too fast, I'm like, "I'll smoke this.

521
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,220
I'll watch a video where a guy eats the oldest can of beans and then I'll fucking fall asleep."

522
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,540
You saw me in New York, I did have...

523
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
You went bugged.

524
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,660
Yeah, well I was already drunk, I was fine, but like...

525
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
So I was on the...

526
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,940
I had the allergic reaction of the Prilosec, did I tell you about that?

527
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
No.

528
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,060
I had all the rash and shit.

529
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,760
So that was making my heart rate go up, and then I smoked weed, and then that made me

530
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,580
have like a full blown panic attack in New York.

531
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Nice.

532
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,900
And then I was just sitting in the crowd.

533
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,860
I looked like a fucking ghost.

534
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,460
I looked in the bathroom, I looked like a ghost.

535
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
You did not look like a ghost, you looked like Patrick.

536
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,020
I was wearing your sheet. Oh, yeah. I

537
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:49,700
Was sitting on that couch I thank God they had a couch at the pit pit is such a stupid

538
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,620
Venue the way that they have that they have a couch in the front

539
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:59,580
It's it's a terrible venue for stand-up comedy and then there's like I don't know if you guys saw there's on the right side of the

540
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,420
Stage there's like eight other chairs. Yeah. Yeah, that was so weird people if somebody sat there

541
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:10,780
they just have to walk like right next to whoever's on stage. Yeah. It's just a stupid place. But I,

542
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,940
yeah, thank God they had that couch there otherwise I'd just sit in a chair.

543
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,020
Yeah, we haven't done an episode since we went to New York. Yeah. Has it been that long? Yeah.

544
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,900
It's true. Cheese Louise, man. Cheese me. Cheese me right in. We can talk about New York.

545
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,780
I mean, it's already gone from my mind. I don't even remember. Well, we had the vlog,

546
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,700
but I mean, it was mostly just clips of us walking. Yeah, people saw the vlog. Yeah. Yeah,

547
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,060
we went to a vice land office. I'm glad I didn't. I think we should do quarantine vlogs. I think we

548
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,140
we should uh I'm glad I didn't record anything while I was freaking out cuz it

549
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:46,420
would have just been me like looking at like oh my god yeah Patrick Patrick was

550
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:51,760
Patrick was a huge baby yeah yeah I was me and me and cam we swagged out we

551
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,660
wouldn't stay with our shout out to patches yeah he will patches is the man

552
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:05,220
We were so much it was like 2 in the morning. We were Brooklyn and we were like we need it

553
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:12,620
We need to stay somewhere. Yeah, and everything fell through everyone was supposed to stay with fell asleep. Yeah, it's fucked up

554
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,820
I say was Zoe. Yeah a very cool bathroom. I

555
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:21,060
You're like a guy who likes mention yeah, you've mentioned that bathroom like 20 days

556
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,180
They had like seashells and mermaids and shit on the wall. I don't want to think about that one

557
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,760
Up on the wall pretty sure look it should look like I was in the ocean

558
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,900
It should look like the bathroom you would I'm a dummy you liked feeling like you're in the ocean cuz you like to poop in the

559
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,580
Ocean when you go to the one of the hardest time

560
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,100
So what her lash goes into the ocean and tries to poop in the ocean, but he's wearing his swim trunk

561
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,620
So it just gets caught in the netting and he comes back out and he's like looking smug like nobody

562
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,100
So nobody knows that I just sat in the ocean, but it's so what one of the so what one of the fucking funniest things?

563
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,500
I've ever experienced with me and my younger brother. We were swimming and we were like 14 and 12 maybe and

564
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,940
I was just like, "Yeah, that was your heights."

565
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah, we were 14 and 12 feet tall, bitch.

566
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
We were like...

567
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
That's too tall.

568
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
You look like an idiot.

569
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,740
No, you look like an idiot right now.

570
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
You have no shoes on.

571
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
You look like a hobbit.

572
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,740
It's my house.

573
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,740
Can you put some shoes on?

574
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,740
You look like a hobbit that they choose.

575
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
It's my house.

576
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
Can you put some damn shoes on?

577
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
No.

578
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
You look like the fat hobbit.

579
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
The fat hobbit.

580
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,740
Like, yeah, like the fat Jewish.

581
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
Yeah.

582
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,740
Yeah, that's you.

583
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,380
Yeah, that's because it's just the word fat in my race.

584
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,580
Yeah, yeah, but me and my brother we were in the ocean. We're swimming and I was

585
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,860
like fuck I have to shit so bad and he was like yeah man me too and then I just

586
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:45,140
saw his eyes go like like crazy for a minute and yeah and I was like ha ha ha

587
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,780
he's pretending to shit in the ocean and I was like nice and he was like yeah

588
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:54,340
Yeah, pretty funny and then between the two of us a piece of shit floating.

589
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:07,740
I was like screaming laughing and just running out of the ocean as fast as I

590
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,700
could because I was like the entire thing is broken. Yeah, he pooped in the ocean.

591
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,780
You guys ever wonder as a kid like if lightning struck the ocean it would kill

592
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:25,420
all the fish? How does that not happen? I don't really know why. I mean I know I can't go that

593
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:30,780
far. But like I always got, I was always like what if lightning strikes like near me? Yeah,

594
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,820
what if it strikes like 10 miles away? I wonder how far it can go. It goes one inch.

595
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,700
Oh well that's fine. Yeah. You're probably good then. Yeah. I was pretty scared of getting struck

596
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,380
by lightning growing up because there's a lot of thunderstorms and like hurricanes in North Carolina.

597
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:49,020
you know ball lightning that shit's crazy yeah the stuff that comes out of dr

598
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,020
strange's hands it's like balls of like electricity they don't know what causes

599
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,940
it but they just like float like a long they just move for it and they can like

600
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,860
go through doors and shit what's like super rare have you not heard of this

601
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,140
no it's but people thought it was ghosts ball lightning yeah i knew a guy that

602
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,740
got struck by lightning okay tell that story while i find this there's this kid

603
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,220
i played baseball with hey no i was pretty good friends with his name bruce

604
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,620
And his dad got struck by-- or no, his dad saw a guy get struck by lightning. That's the--

605
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,680
Yeah.

606
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,640
Whoa.

607
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,660
His dad saw a guy on a golf course get struck by lightning.

608
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,780
Did that guy die?

609
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,500
I think so.

610
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,300
I always loved-- I always kind of wanted to get struck by lightning because you get a really cool scar.

611
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,800
Yeah.

612
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,420
You know? Like an unmistakable scar.

613
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,420
So if you had rubber boots, you know.

614
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,620
What do you mean? Is that what you get the scar from?

615
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,260
Saves you.

616
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,060
It save-- saves you?

617
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,700
Saves you.

618
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,540
I don't think it saves you if you have rubber boots.

619
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,540
No, no, if it depends on where the lightning strikes you.

620
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,180
If the lightning strikes your boots, you're shit safe.

621
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,780
Yeah, I guess.

622
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,700
But I think, wouldn't that kill you because the current can't like move

623
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,260
down into the ground if you are wearing rubber boots?

624
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,940
No.

625
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,820
I thought that was like how people don't die from lightning,

626
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,580
is if they're like touching something that the electricity can move through.

627
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,060
Well, wouldn't the rubber be a ground also?

628
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,580
I don't know.

629
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
I don't know how electricity works.

630
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,580
No, I think rubber, you can't be grounded through rubber.

631
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
Ball lightning is uh...

632
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Oh, you're gonna be grounded.

633
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
I think leather soles is how you don't die from lightning.

634
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
Oh, you're getting grounded today.

635
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
I'm gonna ground you buddy.

636
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
Honestly, when we're talking about shoes, I wish you would have any kind of shoe on, Patrick.

637
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Why?

638
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Because you have the worst, most disgusting feet.

639
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
Your feet look like the nasty patty from Spongebob.

640
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
They don't look like the nasty patty.

641
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
They look so much like that. You have green pustules.

642
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I don't have green pustule.

643
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Where do you do it?

644
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
Where?

645
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Everywhere.

646
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
That's your noise.

647
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
Yeah, when somebody...

648
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
That's Yoshi's noise, that is not my noise.

649
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
You're Yoshi, dude.

650
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Did one of you shit your pants?

651
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
No.

652
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
Not me.

653
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Something smells like a... you ever have a sweet diarrhea?

654
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I think one of the cats might have farted in their sleep.

655
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,580
Because if you're the only person that's smelling it and they're right there...

656
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Because I'm wearing your cat's like a face mask.

657
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Yeah.

658
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,580
With their ass.

659
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Yeah, no, no, no.

660
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,580
I'm not wearing your cat's face mask.

661
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,580
I'm wearing your cat's face mask.

662
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,580
I'm wearing your cat's face mask.

663
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,580
I'm wearing your cat's face mask.

664
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,320
because if you're the only person that's smelling it and they're right there

665
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,340
because I'm wearing your cats like a fat like a face mask mm-hmm yeah with their

666
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:15,900
no Yoda in Yoda one of my farts dude. Yoda farts.

667
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,460
Ball lightning. Yeah so it can vary from pea size to septic. It can vary from pea size

668
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,420
there's like one video I think they can vary from pea size it can vary from pea

669
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:40,500
size to it can vary from pea size to several meters pad you want to you want

670
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:48,100
to weigh in on that several meters in diameter said be and it can like fly

671
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,500
around and it's like very rare some people say it explodes and some people

672
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,540
say it passes through stuff and some people say it like burns through stuff

673
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,340
Sounds to me like a lie.

674
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,940
Yeah, it sounds made up, like Cameron made this up and wrote this whole Wikipedia bitch.

675
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,340
I did while you guys were talking.

676
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Yeah, you did.

677
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,580
You're a really fast typer.

678
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,420
Let's see, they don't know what causes it.

679
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,660
A globular bolt.

680
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,440
Let's see if this Snopes video is real.

681
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
This one's false.

682
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,720
Alright, I don't know how to find the real video because the top video is from the Path

683
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,300
of Exile wiki.

684
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,420
They don't know what causes it, but it is a known phenomenon.

685
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
Yeah.

686
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,780
they've been doing studies on it, it said on Wikipedia.

687
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,380
Nice.

688
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,820
They have proposed a number of hypotheses.

689
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Yeah, it says an optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball lightning

690
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,840
event was published in January 2014 and included a video at a high frame rate.

691
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,340
Let's see if we can find this video.

692
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,780
Damn, they got that shit at 144 FPS.

693
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,940
What came first?

694
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,620
Whoa, they got a mouse lightning, look at that thing.

695
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,700
What?

696
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,100
I don't know how to find the video.

697
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,580
Just look up ball of lightning.

698
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,380
I'm done with you Patrick.

699
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,140
Look up coolest kinds of lightning.

700
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,900
Coolest guy shooting lightning out of his finger.

701
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
That would be Superman.

702
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,740
Superman doesn't have lightning abilities.

703
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,480
My Superman does.

704
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
My Superman?

705
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
Yep.

706
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Wait, your husband?

707
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Yep.

708
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
He's my Superman.

709
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
He's my rock.

710
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
I bet he is man.

711
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,080
Are you excited for just the next fucking 15 years of Pete Buttigieg and his husband?

712
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
Fucking on stage.

713
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,320
Can you see that picture of him where he didn't floss?

714
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Yeah dude.

715
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,840
I've never seen, I mean I have some pretty big gaps in my-

716
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,120
Yeah I'm not one to talk.

717
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
I have some pretty big gaps in my teeth.

718
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,720
Just funny to take, like if I take a picture and you can see I didn't floss I won't post

719
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
it, I'll delete it.

720
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
I check.

721
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,400
I've got some pretty big gaps, I don't need to floss, but I've never seen that shit build

722
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
up.

723
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,960
Yeah, it was a really gross scene.

724
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,920
He had like British peasant teeth.

725
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,340
- Oh yeah, I do.

726
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,180

- You have rice teeth, dude.

728
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,640

00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,200
- Dude, my fucking, I got some--

00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,960
- You're such a fucked up little freak.

732
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
- Little goblin, dude.

733
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,280
- You're just hard to look at, man.

734
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,000
You have those fucking crazy teeth,

735
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
those horrible feet.

736
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,280
- My teeth are gonna, once I get--

737
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,080
- You bleed green 'cause you drink so much monster energy.

738
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,440
- Once I get the pod money and I get my veneers.

739
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,160
- Mm, yeah, when we finally, when we hit like--

740
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,720
- 350.

741
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,320
- When we hit 350, what are we doing

742
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,200
with the what does everybody do with their cut like a heist movie? Probably

743
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,040
like food. I'm gonna get I'm gonna get like I'm gonna get hair plugs that are

744
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:44,360
like it's like afro hair. Just like mixed in. Yeah on top of your current hair. Just a few like parts that are really puffy.

745
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,720
Yeah just see I just want to see what it'll look like. I'm gonna get a snake eye on my

746
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,000
forehead yeah well real like it's all yeah well an actual one school I've been

747
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,960
looking at on the snake fangs on my fingers from this account called you a

748
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,480
freak and a snake tongue I'm you know where from this Instagram account called

749
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,200
the Istanbul hairline and it's just like some Turkish hair transplant doctor and

750
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,640
he posts like pictures of like the follicular like transplants don't pour

751
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,200
Red Bull but he posts videos of like the follicle transplants and dude it just

752
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,000
looks like they took a bunch of rice. Oh dude it looks fucked up.

753
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,400
Yeah that was I think the first time I've ever like thrown up from

754
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,120
looking at something. Yeah when I was like 13 that someone posted a picture of

755
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,440
like a hair transplant on 4chan and then I saw it and I went into

756
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,120
the bathroom and just threw up. So the first like six months your hair looks

757
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,440
your head just looks like fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like Tobias Fienke. It

758
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,800
looks like Tobias Fienke. No, it looks worse than that. Honestly, that

759
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,820
was like a palatable TV version. Yeah. Because every single one of them scabs

760
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,120
up. Yeah. And it gets all white. Yeah. And it looks like maggots in your head.

761
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,680
Yeah. That's pretty sick. Yeah. And then, but then all of them fall off. Yeah. I used to,

762
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,880
I used to save that to my phone. Your hairs fall off? Yeah. And then you look like Steve Carell. I saved

763
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,640
that to my little flip up phone and I used to send it to people when I was mad at them.

764
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:24,880
That's like I have a video of a picture on my phone of like an open penis surgery.

765
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,280
That sucks dude.

766
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,880
If somebody like air drops me a gay picture or something on the train I just immediately

767
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,360
air drop it back with that picture and it's really funny because they just instantly like

768
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,480
turn off air drop.

769
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,720
It's really funny.

770
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,920
can look at that photo and not have like an involuntary reaction so you know

771
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,680
exactly yeah exactly like ah somewhere on the train someone goes like ah or just

772
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,360
like gets closer to their phone and then really far away yeah there I can't really

773
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,960
write to somebody at the all troop show yeah I kept air I think it was someone

774
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,240
in Durban I just kept air dropping them a photo while the show was going on what

775
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,840
photo. I just remember they were I realized they were in front of me

776
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,480
because I looked down and I just saw him just going like... The screenshot I always

777
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,880
send is it's funny to me but it's less shocking is just the it's the screenshot

778
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,760
in the middle of the chimp rapes frog video where the chimp is on the ground

779
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,440
it's like the third stage of the video and he's jacking off with the frog yeah yeah

780
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,360
That's a good one to use. Or the pig with poop on his balls.

781
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,280
Yeah. That's a goldie.

782
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,440
It's so funny.

783
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,520
I have loved that photo for like 10 years.

784
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,720
Do you remember the Wolverine towel gif?

785
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,200
Wolverine towel gif? No.

786
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,680
Look up Wolverine towel gif.

787
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,640
Is it gross?

788
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
No, it's not gross, but it's really funny.

789
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,680
All right.

790
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,240
I used to send it to people in high school. I got into a fight with someone in high school

791
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,120
online and then I just sent it to them. I just kept sending it to them.

792
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
You got into a flame war?

793
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Yeah.

794
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,680
I made fun of some kid for hitting his girlfriend.

795
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,120
Which one is it?

796
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,400
It's an animated GIF.

797
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,720
Okay, well which one is it?

798
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
What does it look like?

799
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
There it is.

800
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
This?

801
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Oh yeah, I know this I think.

802
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I have not seen this.

803
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,320
It's probably that one.

804
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
This?

805
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Yeah.

806
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Yeah.

807
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
But there's a towel that's supposed to fall off.

808
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Yeah, he drops the towel.

809
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Yeah, I know.

810
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
I know what you're...

811
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,880
I've seen this before.

812
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
They don't have the right version of it.

813
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,600
Hey wait what about the one next to it? This doesn't say animated GIF you

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,160
that are animated. Press the GIF button up top. What GIF button? Where? They got a GIF button.

820
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,280
Yeah. Charlie Sheen gave them all a charity. I think it's really fucked up. Me too. Because

822
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,040
the news is pre-skewered. Feels like news is pre-roasted. And it feels like comedy is the

823
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,960
news now but it feels like the new kind of way for me don't move away move back

824
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,920
yeah you're like holding holding is right now to not like pigpin at all you are

828
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Little tiny things with huge fat wings. You know like how an undead dragon looks? Yeah.

829
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,760
It's like that but a sperm. Is that a ninja red bull? I don't know, I just picked out a

830
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,720
red bull. Caleb told me it was a normal one. It is normal. Yeah, no, that's a ninja edition.

831
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,480
It's ninja edition. Don't touch my red bull. I love touching it. We're going to call him

832
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,860
Cameron Blevins now. That'd be cool I'm into it. No it's not a ninja version it's it's a

833
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:21,880
USA basketball. Oh RIP. What do you mean RIP? Basketball's over. NBA is cancelled.

834
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,340
Because of Gobert. Well sort of. It's actually because of two Emerson kids. Yeah.

835
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,300
Yeah because they the Jazz practiced at the Emerson gym yeah with like four days

836
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,860
before with two kids who tested positive and yeah so. There were two kids at

837
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,100
- Was Emerson the test positive?

838
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,940
- Yeah, we were on the basketball team.

839
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,980
- What the fuck, of course the fucking basketball team

840
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,100
would have it too. - My alma mater

841
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,780
is responsible for,

842
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,700
one of the only things that if I'm stuck in my house

843
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,700
all day I like doing, it's just gone.

844
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,180
- Emerson kind of ruins everything.

845
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,220
- Yeah, it ruins everything it touches.

846
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,700
- The entire entertainment industry is just Emerson grads

847
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,020
and then some people from UCLA.

848
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,120
- Yeah, well that's more like the film industry,

849
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,180
like the TV. - It's NYU.

850
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:16,180
Yeah, like all the entry level jobs in entertainment

851
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,980
is just populated by NYU, UC, and Emerson grads

852
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,060
who all just fucking suck at their jobs.

853
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,780
- Yeah, it's just like Emerson people,

854
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,020
like half of all TV writers are probably Emerson grads

855
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,960
and that's why you get shows like fucking

856
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,860
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and shit.

857
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,700
- Yeah.

858
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,720
- I don't know, I heard that show's pretty good,

859
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,020
but it's all a musical.

860
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:36,860
- No, it's not good. - Yeah.

861
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,820
I've heard it's good from Emerson people so it's like yeah so it's not fucking

862
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,540
yeah no man I mean every TV show it's like oh we're gonna we're actually

863
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:51,180
rebooting all in the family but they're queer now I think we need the only step

864
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:57,820
we took to make it woke we need another way races but he's trained yeah that's

865
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,300
the only step we took and it's the same show they just say he's trans at the

866
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,740
beginning there's a message just so you know yeah he's trans but he's not out he

867
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,900
comes out on like a red curtains red curtains open at the beginning of the

868
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,180
show he's passing just so you know Archie Bunker is passing yeah he but he

869
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,340
is trans yeah and then they just play an old clip yeah yeah but they're just like

870
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,740
just remember that Archie is trans now yeah and he says black people shouldn't

871
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,180
be on TV and you're like well this is genius

872
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,980
the Jeffersons yeah let's think about it yeah yeah hey Archie let's sit down for a while

873
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:37,580
is it Rob Reiner? It could be dysphoric right now. Rob Reiner played the son on the original show?

874
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:43,500
No it was um it was it was you no yeah it was you no just Rob Reiner had that thing did you

875
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,540

876
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:54,140

878
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,580

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,900
who Carl Reiner yeah he's like 98 years old yeah he should not be alive

880

881
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,060

885
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,220
they're too old to even have sex with each other but they're not gay enough to

886
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,780

00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,060

you can't get laid whenever you want by your mom's friends and you get halo 3

905
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,700
come on dude that's easy I'll take that over my shitty life anytime yeah they

906
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,680
should be like like a blank check esque movie where it's just about a kid growing

907
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,900
up yeah yeah it's just like by the way that happens in the movie yeah but I

908
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,540
mean a movie that's just about that yeah just about that one scene there's no

909
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,060
scene there's it's it's that scene right but it's the extended uncut edition how

910
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,140
How long, how many years until people re-watch Big and they're like, "He fucks a-"

911
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,740
I think it's gonna- Some open mic comedians done that.

912
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,740
Really?

913
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,740
For sure.

914
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,740
I mean, I think- No, but like until- I'm saying until there's

915
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,740
a Vulture article.

916
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,460
I think the past- The next few weeks we're gonna see a bunch

917
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,300
of shit canceled and people sit down and actually watch a bunch of stuff.

918
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,300
Yeah.

919
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,980
I think a bunch of people are gonna freak- 'Cause everyone's gonna go crazy in their house

920
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,140
and everybody's also gonna be watching like every movie.

921
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,140
Right.

922
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,700
And then we're gonna see a bunch of people going crazy over random movies that came out

923
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,700
like years ago.

924
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,700
Yes.

925
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,620
they'll be like he fucks a human woman he uses a piano that's too big and he

926
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:14,420
literally POC is Zoltar has a piano is way too big okay this is just sitting

927
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,580
unrealistic expectations for pianos plus he has kimonos virus and he's out in

928
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:25,300
public and I know the movie is called big but pick one big thing for the movie

929
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:31,660
you can't have a big piano and a big guy it makes no sense oh yeah cuz Tom Hanks

930
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,300
says go imagine like people try to cancel him while he's in because a big while

931
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,980
he's yeah trying to survive from Corona yeah and now he's trying he's struggling

932
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,940
to survive right now yeah no they're not not just shoveling money into his butt

933
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:51,340
and that's how you hear it he's in Australia raping children yeah he's

934
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,300

(laughter)

947
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Yeah, he thinks he's one of them.

948
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,340

Yeah, dude.

952
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,340
Damn, Chet Hanks is so awesome.

953
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,340
He's so, I love that he did that fucking video shirtless, dude.

00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,340
Yeah, so funny.

955
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
Oh my god.

956
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:58,340
And he's got the, you were saying like those fucking, those QAnon people think he's a pedophile.

957
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:04,580
Well yeah, he has the Illuminati pyramid on his chest, tatted.

958
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,580
That's a common stupid guy thing.

959
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
Of course, yeah.

960
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:13,420
And on his back though, he has spirals that everyone is saying is the Nambla sign.

961
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,420
That's so funny.

962
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,820
That's just a common stupid guy tattoo.

963
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:21,020
How many stupid guys like that do you think get labeled pedophiles by the QAnon people?

964
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:25,900
I highly recommend everybody, when you're stuck inside in quarantine, get into QAnon.

00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:30,100
Oh yeah, no, go on to make a Twitter. I'm serious. So make a Twitter all this is

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,200
insane right now. They're flipping the fuck out. Like this is the best time

972
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:54,500
to look at their shit. I would say it's so fun. I like 7% believe in QAnon.

973
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Yeah, no, there's definitely stuff that brings up this like...

974
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:02,000
There's really weird, like, synchronizations between, like, what that guy posts and what actually happens.

975
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,700
You can't, I mean, the whole Pizzagate thing, I did get drunk one time and say this at Muya's to us,

976
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,900
to the people after the "You're Gonna Love Yourself" shoot. I was like, "Yeah, some of Pizzagate is real."

977
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,400
Pizzagate's absolutely real.

978
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
Yeah, that one's real. That one for sure is real.

979
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,200
The only example I could think of up top was just like, just look at every old Shirley Temple movie.

980
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:28,440
yeah just like yeah so insane yeah yeah what if we had a baby dress up like a

981
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,600
whore yeah exactly that was the whole thing it was just weird old men being

982
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,280
it was like the biggest movie we're gonna make her a star yeah yeah what do

983
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:45,480
you think what do you think what well you think the animal crackers in the soup

984
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,040
represent why do you think people like animal crossing bats in the soup that's

985
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,520
That's what this has all been about, Shirley Temple and the Corona virus.

986
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,520
Oh, I'm yeah.

987
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,520

989
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
This is Dennis Miller.

990
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,880
I'm feeling like Shirley Temple at the Crystal Ball right now.

991
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,560
Dennis Miller having a stroke in the middle of his show, but people still think he's just

992
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
doing one of his jokes.

993
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,560
I'm a doctor.

994
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560

1025
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,260
so much as microwave shit at home when I was a kid because I remember growing up

1026
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:57,220
the microwave was just another TV. Do you remember, is it a good idea to microwave this?

1027
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,540
Yeah dude, that shit was awesome. Do you remember the one where they

1028
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,540
microwaved the airbag? No. And it opened up inside the microwave and the microwave

1029
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:09,300
just disappeared because it just blew, it just like flew off camera so fast that

1030
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,540
it literally just like vanished. Do you remember when they microwaved the microwave? No.

1031
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,020
No. That was a good one. I think there was one where they microwaved dynamite like outside.

1032
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:22,060
Yeah, I love that show dude. That was a YouTube show. Is it still up on YouTube?
