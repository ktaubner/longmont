1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,560
It seems we've forgotten where we came from. It seems that we've also blown up to a proportion

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,100
where we get fancy water sent to us now. You know when people on mic do a, they open a

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,100
beer. Yes, I'm very familiar. I'm sure you're familiar.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,100
Wow.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,140
There's a crack on this.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,700
Icelandic glacial water, natural spring water from Iceland.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,100
Yeah, we basically got sent an entire case of this by somebody on Instagram.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,660
So and no, it's not like how you might get a case sent to you through a transaction.

9
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,380
We did not win some kind of, we did not win a water sweepstakes and get a one month supply

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,380
of water.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
No, we didn't.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,380
We kind of won a water sweepstakes.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,380
by being famous artists.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,380
We're completely famous actors now.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,380
No, not actors.

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,380
Celebs.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Celebs.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,380
Celebs who have radio host.

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,380
Yeah, water sent to them.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,380
Listen to this.

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Over 5,000 years ago, long before the first humans reached remote Iceland,

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,380
a massive volcanic eruption created a unique underground spring

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,380
complete with its own natural filtration system, pristine lava rock.

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,380
Now known as the Ulfhus Spring, this is the origin of Icelandic glacial TM

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,100
TM the natural spring water which is the source of an epic life and you know

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,500
this tastes like what is that last part mean pure which is the source of an epic

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,520
life water is a source of an epic life and y'all I'm halfway through this thing

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,980
we're a minute into the episode no this expired addicted this expired in June 23rd

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,820
1907 what no way water doesn't expect wait really where does it say that no it

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,020
actually expires on the 1st of June 2025 but above that it does say June 23rd

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,340
1907. Well, that's the date that the spring was discovered. Probably. But it's printed

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,820
like an expiration date. And you know what? This is just the tip of the iceberg. Wow. We

33
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,900
are going to sell out like crazy now. All different types of waters. If you work for

34
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,500
a company and you want to send us crap, anything for free, we will endorse it. We will supply

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,580
of anything. I don't care if your CEO was racial or something. We already got roaded

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,860
out with all sorts of road equipment. Now we have Icelandic water. What's next? Clothes.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,460
If somebody works for jewelry, if somebody works for Audemars Piguet, if somebody works

38
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,180
for Audemars Piguet, if somebody works for Audemars Piguet, it's a company that makes

39
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,500
watches. All of Mars Pikmin. That's what I was thinking. You were saying if somebody

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:54,380
works for Patek Philippe, if somebody works for Rolex, ice me out dog. Trax NYC. I'll

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:01,140
wear whatever. I'll wear girl stuff. I'll wear wigs. I'll wear a complete girl dress

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,860
and say this fits men really well. I'll make it seem like I'm giving a measured and honest

43
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,580
review by at the beginning saying, "though it's not without its flaws," but then I'll

44
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:22,580
do

45
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,580
What happened with him? I saw that he confided in XQC, which why would you do that?

46
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:36,580
He, a woman accused his company of making her cut her own leg off so she could go home from work early.

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,580
What?

48
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,580
Or something.

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,580
(Laughter)

50
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
I think she, I think that's...

51
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
What?

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:54,260
I guess the work, I mean we have a pretty grinding work environment that I think is pretty hard

53
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,180
to escape. We all get pretty caught up in it. Anybody who joins who wasn't here from

54
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,220
the beginning kind of gets chewed up and spit out. But I think they took it to another level

55
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,020
and they were having these long, long hours and nobody could get any time off and she

56
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,860
wanted to leave work and so she tried to cut her leg off.

57
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,180
In the bathroom or outside?

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,520
I don't know where, but then she was like, did she have a desk?

59
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,220
How are you going to, it's just tech reviews.

60
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Right?

61
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,420
Buddy, somebody doesn't know what goes into YouTube.

62
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Yeah.

63
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,240
You do not realize there's editing and filming as well.

64
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:31,400
Most of these popular YouTubers have teams of up to 150 people that are working on their

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,960
different videos in different types of ways.

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,480
I think that this is an amazing opportunity for, there's a vacuum.

67
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,760
There's a spot.

68
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,140
a spot in tech review YouTube that maybe we might be able to sneak ourselves into.

69
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
The Logitech...

70
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,680
Yeah, okay, give us an example of a tech review.

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,920
So what is the exact model number of this?

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I think I need to...

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
This is a wireless presenter.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
A Logitech wireless presenter...

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
What is it?

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,240
No, that's the laser.

77
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,040
So far you will lose all...

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
That's okay, but there's a lot of editing that could be done.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
You don't even know which way...

80
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Well, yeah, a new word did appear.

81
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,920
The Logitech R400 is a sleek, tiny little device that comes with a laser pointer.

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
If it's switched on.

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
If it's switched on.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
But you didn't even say what it does.

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,680
The laser pointer can be used when it's turned on.

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,460
And a laser pointer that can be used when it's turned on.

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,360
And you can do funny things like this with it.

88
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
You can put a crosshair on my head.

89
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,800
See, I would go more like, "Oh."

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,320
Apple has done it again with their wired headphones.

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:44,660
They have included a lightning jack that only works on iPhone plus two little earbuds on

92
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,860
the side that fit perfectly in your ears if they're big enough.

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,540
They also have this little switch here that controls volumes but doubles as a microphone.

94
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,020
Overall, I give this five stars out of five.

95
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,820
Apple, please send us more products to review.

96
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Okay, you can't be going around doling out five-star reviews.

97
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,380
And you can't say, "Please give me more products for me to review for free."

98
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,940
No, you have to do something like this, right?

99
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,940
Okay, expert, why don't you show me how to do it?

100
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,140
Expert. It's funny you say expert because here I have an Expo marker,

101
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,620
the only marker for experts.

102
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,700
Now, this is a marker that does two functions.

103
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,260
It's a combination of dry erase and you can use it as a chisel,

104
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,100
as you can see is labeled on its sleek, colorful chassis here.

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
It's also a low odor marker, so if you have issues...

106
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,020
Use it as a chisel.

107
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,140
It's chisel right here and it has an image of a chisel.

108
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,680
So I actually did try using it as a chisel and it worked pretty well on sand and air.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:50,780
This marker also conforms to ASTM D4236 and it's from the USA.

110
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Made in America.

111
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,100
Now let's test it out.

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
That's the straightest line I've ever seen.

113
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,660
And I was trying to draw a circle.

114
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,780
It straightens the line when you draw it.

115
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,040
Wow. We could even do stuff other than tech. We could do...

116
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Like markers?

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,880
We could do... No, that's tech. I guess this is technology too.

118
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
This is technology.

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Guys...

120
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Everything's technology.

121
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Next time you're outside and you want to shit your pants when you're in the bathroom at

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,960
the gym, you need to grab yourself a Zen 3, the chill flavor, a slight hint of menthol.

123
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,700
Guys, you can collect, track, and redeem at zen.com/rewards.

124
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,160
And this one expired in January.

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,180
- That expired?

126
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,520
- Yep.

127
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,200
06 Jan, 2023.

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
Did not get this from a smoke shop, got this from a deli.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,320
And it seems that this one was best.

130
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,120
- I put that in my mouth.

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,400
- I got spit for this.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,120
Wait, this is so good, I can only imagine how good it was

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,080
before January 6, 2023.

134
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, and there is a January 6, 2020.

135
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,720
Wait, January 6?

136
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,260
Yeah.

137
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,120
Well, I think that a lot of people,

138
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,420
a lot of people should have expired.

139
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
That a lot of people should have been.

140
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,220
They should have just killed them.

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,220
Yeah, a lot of people

142
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,460
should have taken some of these and chilled.

143
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,060
Yeah.

144
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,260
Oh, that's actually really smart.

145
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,440
That everybody who was at January 6

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
was all hopped up on cigarettes and cigars.

147
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,240
Yeah, they should have chilled out with Zin-Chill.

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,940
They should have put a Zin in their mouth

149
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,700
and Ashley Babbitt would still be alive

150
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,940
She had a protective zen layer that blocked all bullets from entering her entire body.

151
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,660
She would have lived to be over 40 years old.

152
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
I can guarantee that.

153
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:40,260
Now, I put one of these in my mouth before we recorded just because I saw that Caleb

154
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,140
had them and I said, "Give me that."

155
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,460
And honestly, I did Candyman.

156
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,820
You have a case of the gimme's.

157
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,860
And I'm going to be honest, I was not ready.

158
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,360
was not ready for the amount of nicotine

159
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
that's in my system.

160
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
I knew that this was going to happen

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,860
because last time you talked about having one of these

162
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,360
you said that this exact thing happened.

163
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,860
Yeah.

164
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,360
And you kind of left it to me.

165
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Well, the last time that I took one of these

166
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,860
I was very drunk.

167
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
Right.

168
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
And now you're not very,

169
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,360
well, maybe you might be drunk on

170
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,860
delicious Icelandic water.

171
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,360
Can I tell you guys some scary stuff

172
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
that's been happening in my life?

173
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Where do I put this?

174
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm done.

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
It goes in the can.

176
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
It goes in the can of C4 performance energy.

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
The only energy with a...

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,680
Have you guys ever gotten a voicemail on your phone without having a missed call?

179
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,840
Nobody called you but a voicemail disappears on your phone?

180
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Fuck no, I haven't had that happen.

181
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,480
That happened to me this morning and it was completely in Chinese.

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,720
Wow.

183
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,280
The voicemail.

184
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Do you have Google Voice on your phone?

185
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,400
No, I don't think so.

186
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
You got hacked into by...

187
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
It just went right into my voicemail.

188
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,760
Wow.

189
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Automatic.

190
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,160
A Chinese white hat hacker?

191
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah, I mean, I don't know what it said because I can't speak Chinese.

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,960
Oh, I actually don't know if he was a white hat or a black hat.

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,680
Why don't you play it and then somebody who listens can translate.

194
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
I could play it.

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,140
Yeah.

196
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,840
I mean, I don't know if any people out here know.

197
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,400
That would be even scarier if you play it now and it's in English.

198
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,920
Oh my god, I can't even imagine.

199
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,760
All right, here's what I got this morning at 11.03am.

200
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,600
Is this the speaker or not?

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
I think you're...

202
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:24,300
Maybe they said you won something.

203
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,520
Wait, so you got this voicemail and you did not get a phone call?

204
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
No, no phone call.

205
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Are you familiar?

206
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Unable to transcribe this message.

207
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,160
Are you familiar with a movie called The Grudge?

209
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes.

210
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
It's not a Chinese movie.

211
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
It's a Japanese movie.

212
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Japanese movie.

213
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
Well, they kind of sent it.

214
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,380
But here's, this is the second, this is the second thing that's happened.

215
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,320
The first thing that happened, and listen, people aren't, people maybe are going to be

216
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
skeptical on this.

217
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I'm ready to be, I'm ready for people to attack me.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Okay.

219
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Because I know that this is also the type of thing people like this do, to discredit

220
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,360
people like me when they say things like this.

221
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Survivors.

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,600
But I know for a fact that the TSA went through my bag when I went on the airplane.

223
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,540
And when they go through your bag, they're supposed to put in a thing in your bag that

224
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,620
says "We went through your bag," but they didn't.

225
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,420
Wait, how do you know they went through your bag?

226
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,840
Because I have a duffel bag that has clips.

227
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,520
It has a zipper, and then it's got clips all the way around.

228
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,960
And whenever I check it, I put all the clips on.

229
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,900
And when I got my bag back from baggage claim, all the clips were off.

230
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,120
Maybe they just took the clips off.

231
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,240
No, they wouldn't have done that because that would have made it a hazard to have in the

232
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,160
airplane because the clips would fly around.

233
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Yeah, I guess that's true.

234
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
Were your things out of order?

235
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,840
No, because they weren't folded or anything.

236
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,560
They were just in there.

237
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Okay.

238
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
So there wasn't really a way to tell.

239
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,200
So there's no way to tell.

240
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
But it was just clothed.

241
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,000
So they probably were pretty mad when they discovered that I wasn't.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,760
So my phone was not in my checked bag.

243
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,080
No.

244
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,240
Interesting.

245
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,640
Yeah.

246
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,920
It's maybe, I mean, maybe you forgot about it and it actually was and they

247
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,280
planted the voice mail on it.

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
And they put it into my pocket.

249
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,240
You put your phone in your pocket.

250
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,400
Yeah.

251
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,080
But anyway, the reason...

252
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
And you're playing with someone else's phone on the plane.

253
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,120
Listen, I'm saying this stuff because things like these, they always come in

254
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
threes and that's two.

255
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,400
So if I'm gone soon or I get put somewhere or someone that you can't contact me, something

256
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
happened.

257
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
It was the third thing.

258
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,560
Well, I feel like kind of the water appearing at our door might be the third thing.

259
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,960
That was somebody messaged us.

260
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Patrick's doing.

261
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,480
It didn't really disappear.

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,240
Does everything come in threes or is it just bad stuff?

263
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
All types of things.

264
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Anything that you...

265
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,920
Sneezes, deaths in the families, courses of a meal, meals of a day.

266
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Oh, true.

267
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
between meals and after dinner.

268
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,640
- How many almonds you can eat without getting full?

269
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
- Yeah.

270
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,300
- Three almonds?

271
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,140
- Three times.

272
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,960
- They fill me up.

273
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,680
- You eat three and then you wait a little bit

274
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,740
and then you eat three more.

275
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,720
- I bought a lottery scratcher ticket on the way here.

276
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,640
- Oh, and you put three numbers in.

277
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,320
- And I scratched off three times three numbers.

278
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,160
- Yeah.

279
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,760
- 'Cause there was nine total numbers

280
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,360
and I didn't get a single thing.

281
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,160
I did not get a single fucking thing.

282
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,720
- That's true, yeah, bad things come in threes.

283
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,480
- So that could be the third thing.

284
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
- Well, it happened to you.

285
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
- Yeah.

286
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
But if I had won millions of dollars, you know, I would have given you some.

287
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,600
That would have been the third thing for me.

288
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,100
That would have been...

289
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I would have given you money.

290
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
That I didn't win it.

291
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,600
I don't think you would be in here right now if you won a million dollars.

292
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
You'd go away.

293
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,100
You would go away instantly.

294
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,600
No, no. I've thought about this a lot.

295
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,100
Here's what I would do.

296
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
If I ever win a lottery...

297
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,100
There'd be a cloud of dust that we see and it's the shape of your outline.

298
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Just because you have money doesn't mean you run fast.

299
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
If I had...

300
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,100
If you... you would run to go cash that thing out.

301
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't think you can do that. If I think you go to the guy, I mean, you go to the

302
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,600
convenience store,

303
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,700
a billion dollars. I think if I won the lottery, I would not tell anybody, maybe

304
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,700
not even my wife, and I would just start blessing everybody in my life to an

305
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,500
amazing degree. You don't tell anybody. I would hire an actor to play a

306
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,600
billionaire guy who would set he who would give us an email, right? And he'd

307
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,480
like I should have expected you would do something so Nathan Fielder esque. No, I

308
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,000
should have expected an old comedian like you would be running a kind of the

309
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,720
rehearsal type scheme. If you're in the lottery, more and more I'm trying to

310
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
okay, well, you just got cut out. The billionaire guy is just gonna say, I

311
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,400
think this is the I really like Patrick and Caleb and I do not like Cameron at

312
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,400
all. And I'd like to give you guys $100 million. But I would put you both on

313
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,320
payroll, you both be my assistants, you'd be my chain carrier and you'd be my

314
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
you'd warm up my chains before I put them on.

315
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,820
Chains?

316
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
My chains, my jewelry.

317
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,320
Yeah, okay.

318
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,820
You'd hold them and you'd warm them up on your body so they're not cold when they hit my body.

319
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,320
So I get to wear them?

320
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,820
You know what I would do?

321
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
You get to wear them but not publicly.

322
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,320
So I get to wear them?

323
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Not publicly. You can only wear them in.

324
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Well, it's warmer outside than inside.

325
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
You can only wear them in your house.

326
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,820
Right now.

327
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,320
See, this is why I hired you.

328
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Because you're so smart.

329
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,820
But also I'd keep you in a sauna 24 hours a day so that the chains get really, really hot.

330
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
You know what actually the warmest place is?

331
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,320
What?

332
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
It's on stage at a rock concert.

333
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,820
Yeah.

334
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,820
So I think I'm going to have to go do that wearing your chain with KISS, with those loud lights and those bright speakers.

335
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820
I guess yeah, you could do that. Anything in the interest of keeping the chains warm is fine by me.

336
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Going off of your idea of hiring a billionaire guy, right?

337
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
Well, it's just an actor.

338
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Well, okay, you're hiring an actor to play a billionaire guy.

339
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Carlos Large.

340
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,820
What I would do, Carlos Large is a good name. What I would do...

341
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,820
Melvin Dollar.

342
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,820
(laughs)

343
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
You get an email from Melvin Dollar?

344
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Melvin DeNiro.

345
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
Oh, that'd be good. Melvin DeNiro.

346
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,460
So instead of that, maybe I would stage a situation, right?

347
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,260
So it's like, okay, we're going to go to this restaurant at this time of day.

348
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
It's going to be me and my two friends.

349
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,260
This is what you would do?

350
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,140
So you need to sit there at this restaurant within, I don't lie, we can see you.

351
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
You need to choke on your food.

352
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,340
I'm going to get up. I'm going to give you the Heimlich.

353
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,820
I'm going to get all the food out of you.

354
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,500
and then you're gonna say, "Thank you for saving my life.

355
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,100
Here's one million dollars."

356
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,340
So everyone thinks that I'm a hero and now I also get a million dollars for my heroism.

357
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,740
Okay, so then we get it in its double...

358
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,740
I feel like saving somebody from choking is not an act of heroism that will be remembered for that.

359
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,740
Yeah, but the millionaire gives me one million dollars and that would be the thing.

360
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,460
It would be more impressive to win the lottery.

361
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,060
It would be more impressive that I save this guy's life so good that he gives me a million

362
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
dollars.

363
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
How much money do you need to end world hunger?

364
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Probably not that much.

365
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Probably not that much.

366
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
It's like 20 bucks I think.

367
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,260
Fucking Elon has enough to do it.

368
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
And guess what he's doing?

369
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,740
Playing on his damn phone.

370
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,100
Well he is writing some jokes on his phone.

371
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,140
He is taking that sink in, or letting that sink in.

372
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,140
What?

373
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
He let that sink in.

374
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Oh.

375
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
Oh I see now.

376
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:53,700
And that was funny as fuck. If you want to come on the show and let us sink into our studio.

377
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:00,900
That would be funny as fuck. But I do think that there is a way to make all of your friends

378
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,460
heroes like if you win the lottery, most people disappear. Most people you'll never hear from

379
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,820
again. They move to Singapore or some place where they don't have to pay taxes on it.

380
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Yeah.

381
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,940
Like Eduardo Savarin.

382
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:23,200
But I think you have an opportunity to make everybody around you, I mean basically make

383
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,900
them heroes to the entire world.

384
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,740
But it's got to be more than choking.

385
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,300
You need to do like a...

386
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,380
Choking on a peanut that he's allergic to.

387
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,740
So you give him a lot of it and then stab him with an epi pen.

388
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Choking is not...

389
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Nobody cares about choking.

390
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,340
Nobody's amazed that somebody survived choking.

391
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,180
Okay, bringing a dead billionaire back to life and he gives you a million dollars.

392
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,580
but why are you choking it on the floor in the restaurant? Bring somebody back to

393
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,620
life. Yes, you would be famous. You brought somebody back to life, bringing

394
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,220
them back to life through prayer. You're swinging too wildly here, though.

395
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,020
That's over the line. You're gonna... How is this over the line? I'm bringing

396
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,980
a millionaire back to life through prayer. If you bring somebody back to life,

397
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,980
they're going to study you like an alien. You're never gonna know a moment

398
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,900
of peace. You need somewhere in between those two goal posts. That's called

399
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,340
celebrity status. If you want your friends to be famous, you have to do

400
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,580
stuff like, one of your friends needs to be a nine-toe mom, one more than

401
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:17,800
to mom. We need to create a nine to mom. You need to do a real balloon boy where he's actually

402
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:25,220
in the balloon. Yeah, you need to do a chocolate rain, a golden radio voice homeless guy. Like

403
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,780
this is how people get famous. Now. Nobody is is famous for doing Schindler's List stuff

404
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,520
anymore that happens every day or the what do you mean like saving a bunch of people

405
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,320
that doesn't know nobody gets famous for saving people's lives anymore. Nobody gives a fuck

406
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,400
about lives, lives don't matter. You need to be or you need to knock out Francis Ngannou.

407
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,520
The only guy that I know who's from the MMA, UFC. The only guy I can think of famously

408
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,280
who saved any lives at any time in the past 30 or 40 years is that kid who saved his sister

409
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,880
from a pitbull who you see on Facebook every time you open Facebook. No, I've never seen

410
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,160
that. And he has his face all fucked up. It's the little penguin Pokemon. Oh, those are scary.

411
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,680
I wouldn't want to fuck with a Pokemon at all.

412
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
No.

413
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,480
It saves his sister from a Pokemon attack.

414
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,160
So that's another, or you could create a real Pokemon.

415
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
You could become a meme.

416
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,880
You could do some kind of, well that's already what I was saying, you could become a meme.

417
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,680
Like that guy from the Amberlamps video, remember that?

418
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,320
The old guy that just beat up a black guy and everyone was like, he's a hero.

419
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,880
Amberlamps, you'd be that guy.

420
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,280
You'd be, what's his name?

421
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,700
If I won the lottery, I would build a Coliseum in the desert.

422
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,080
Would you make people fight in it?

423
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,240
No, I would live there.

424
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I would have amazing concerts.

425
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
You'd live in a Coliseum?

426
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
It's open air.

427
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,780
Yeah, well there's parts of it that are inside.

428
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
You'd live in a fortified Coliseum?

429
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Barely.

430
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Well, I'm building it.

431
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
I can put in whatever I want.

432
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
I'm not going to do an exact replica of the Coliseum.

433
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm going to build a Coliseum.

434
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,780
What is the Coliseum for a reason?

435
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,780
Well, it's the one because it's that one.

436
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Why would you want to live in a Coliseum?

437
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
This would not be a good place to live.

438
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,780
Again, another thing, another great place to put a real life Pokemon.

439
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,120
a coliseum. Yeah.

440
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,920
Yeah.

441
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,780
And have them battle it out.

442
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,720
I wished for Pokemon to become real on every

443
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,180
birthday candle and fortune cookie for my entire life.

444
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,360
I wish that I had code name kid next door in my backyard.

445
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,620
And I wished that this one tree stump that was in my backyard would turn into an elevator.

446
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,560
The tube elevator specifically.

447
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,300
And I would be sucked into it through drama.

448
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,700
Does anyone have a tube elevator in real life?

449
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,000
I want to go in a tube elevator.

450
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
Like one, not one with angles I don't believe.

451
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:30,900
No.

452
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,480
They can do one that goes straight up and down.

453
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,480
straight up and down yeah but do they? There's some hotels that have them. Really? Is that

454
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,480
true? The glass tubes? Yeah see right there vacuum elevator. Vacuum sucks you up. Yeah

455
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,520
it does. Is that Dr. Oz in that fourth one? I would not trust this shit. I almost don't

456
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,200
trust elevators to begin with. I don't trust elevators at all. I am anti elevator, anti

457
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,240
escalator. That is not Dr. Oz. How are you anti escalator? I hate escalators even more

458
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,680
than elevators. My cousin got afraid of escalators. Do you walk around in flippy flops all day?

459
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:09,160
No. What about long gowns? No. Well then why are you scared? Because if you fall in you

460
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,400
will get ground up by gears. What's his name? If you fall down. One of the stairs or some

461
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,120
of the stairs disappear. The bass player from Anal Cunt was doing elevator pranks, killed

462
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,000
himself that way, or escalator pranks. He killed himself on an escalator. I didn't even

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,520
know people could die on an escalator. He was holding onto the side of it at this mall

464
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I know the video of the escalator collapsing and the guy gets ground up.

465
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
This happened in Boston fairly recently. I don't think anybody actually died.

466
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,520
If somebody gets caught, say it's an escalator going up or down.

467
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I've heard of that.

468
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:50,520
If someone gets caught at the bottom, then everyone else is going to bunch up and they're all going to get pushed down

469
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,520
and get fucked up and hurt by the thing moving.

470
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
If you're going up, everyone will fall down.

471
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
In Boston that happened.

472
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Where in Boston?

473
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
In an escalator.

474
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
In the Prudential?

475
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
I don't know.

476
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,520
I don't remember.

477
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
Why did you just guess the Prudential?

478
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,480
He just wants to prove he knows a building in Boston.

479
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,680
No, I just want to know about escalators.

480
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
You don't know anything.

481
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
You don't...

482
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,800
My Uncle Jimmy was an elevator repairman and my cousin James got afraid of, he got scared

483
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,520
of the escalator at the Museum of Science and when I was a kid I thought that was why.

484
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,360
I thought that he didn't want to betray his father.

485
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Wow, that's actually cool. That would have been cool.

486
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
That's sweet.

487
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
Yeah, no, he was just like young.

488
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,120
I think somebody's selling drugs outside of my apartment.

489
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Yeah.

490
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,680
I saw an old, old man and a young, young man sitting on the bench right outside my apartment.

491
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
There's a bench right up front.

492
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
It could be father and son.

493
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,880
But a third man of an age in between the two men came by and sat down and the young man

494
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,640
reached into a plastic grocery bag, brought something out, and slid it very slyly, breaking

495
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
bad into me.

496
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
Was it drugs?

497
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,280
I have to assume it was drugs or a rare baseball card.

498
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,360
It could be a rare baseball card.

499
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,720
And they looked at me, and I broke eye contact, and then I've been scared for two days that

500
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,960
they're going to try to kill me.

501
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
No.

502
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Because I know.

503
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
They don't know that you know.

504
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,920
I mean, I was walking around, I was acting really weird.

505
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,120
You had your newspaper and a camera.

506
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,040
Let me rewind time for you. Here's how you should have handled that. You see him slipping

507
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,920
the thing into his bag. You in your brain, you know you've just seen a drug deal. Maybe

508
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,360
you're going to get killed for knowing what's going on here. So here's what you say. You

509
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,820
look at these guys on the bench. Here's what you say. "Geez, you guys are always sitting

510
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,120
here doing completely nothing. Why don't you find a hobby? You're not even doing anything.

511
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,920
You're just sitting there." Get a job, you lazy bones. "Exactly. You haven't even moved

512
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,960
in the past 10 minutes. You've been sitting completely still there doing nothing." You've

513
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,500
been sitting here for hours talking to your friends, giving them gifts.

514
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,600
Stop loitering. No, not... No, no, no, no.

515
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,460
So now you're gonna give... That's what I'm saying. Doing completely nothing.

516
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,740
Why don't you at least give... Yeah, you should say, "Why don't you take

517
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,900
up a hobby like drug dealing or something?"

518
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,920
I wish you guys would sell fucking drugs 'cause at least I could buy

519
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,020
some. Yeah. Yeah, they know that you don't know that they're doing anything.

520
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,420
That's how you repair the thing is like, "If you're selling drugs,

521
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,220
I would like some." Right. I think you're not dealing drugs, so you

522
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,280
shouldn't kill me, but if you were, I would be okay with me.

523
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,220
That's what I was wondering. Is it better if they think that I'm a

524
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,640
police officer because I kind of have a police officer's head and

525
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
build? Or is it better if they think that I'm just a just a

526
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,560
waste? OID? Yeah, because who are they least? Who are they

527
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,400
less likely to kill? Probably a cop? No, but a cop would is

528
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
there is their real enemy? Yeah, me. I could also be a waste or

529
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
a drug addict. I think they would probably prefer a waste

530
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,080
enjoyed. Yeah, but they also would kill him if they had to. This is a this is a blade

531
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,280
that I've been I've been teetering on. I just don't know which side to go on. I don't know

532
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,680
if I just start dressing like a cop when I leave my house. Start. You think I dress like

533
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,960
a cop? Like a undercover cop right now with the Dankirk shirt that I stole from Patrick

534
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,560
that I got a coffee stain on, don't tell them.

535
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
I see it. I saw it. I noticed it.

536
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I don't know what that is.

537
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Is this your skin?

538
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Hey, I'm looking for some drugs.

539
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
This is a piece of Caleb's skin.

540
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
No, that's a pepita.

541
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
That's a pepita that I was eating earlier.

542
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
It got stuck to my shirt.

543
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
That's from his head.

544
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
It's lizard skin.

545
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
It's literally a pumpkin seed skin.

546
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
The heat is making him shed.

547
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,360
I don't wait. You think that I look like an undercover cop

548
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,560
with this hat on?

549
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:40,060
You think this Bud Light snapback makes me look like an undercover cop?

550
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,660
Hey buddy, let's drink some beers and some brown paper bags.

551
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,260
What's up?

552
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,560
Or not, actually, let's not use the brown paper bags.

553
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,060
Let's drink them and expose the label.

554
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,160
Let's drink beers out in the open.

555
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,260
Yo, y'all wanna hop this turnstile and come watch a Matt Rife video with me?

556
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,360
I think I would be an amazing undercover police officer.

557
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,660
Yeah.

558
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,160
'cause I think I am very, I'd be good with disguises.

559
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,260
- Maybe.

560
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,560
- But they would never put me on any big case.

561
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,400
They'd put me on parking and stuff.

562
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,080
- No, they would know you from your videos.

563
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,720
- You'd be a desk jockey.

564
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,440
- They would see guys who were getting caught

565
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,720
by undercover cops are like,

566
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,000
"Damn, Caleb, when's that new video dropping?"

567
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
- No, they would not care about my videos.

568
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,840
- "When's that new Twitter video dropping, Caleb?"

569
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,600
(laughing)

570
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,400
You haven't posted one in a minute.

571
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
- They would not do that.

572
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
and then I would say, "Check my TikTok, y'all." You'd be arresting a guy and he'd

573
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,420
be like, "I put new ones on my TikTok, y'all." You'd be arresting a guy and he'd

574
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,280
be like, "I'm gonna fucking kill you. Yo, wait."

575
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,200
No, you would not say, "Yo, wait." I need to point at you. And he'd be like,

576
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,680
"Everyone, come here. Yo, he loves eating shit."

577
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,400
Every day I am punished for being an artist.

578
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,280
Every day my friends punish me. Oh, you wish. We all are. Notice how we never

579
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
go, "Oh, man.

580
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,840
Patrick, you're so...

581
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
What's a video you've made?

582
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,240
None of them have been good.

583
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Bingo.

584
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,840
See, that's the difference.

585
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:10,240
They might go, "Oh, Patrick, you did a stand-up thing with an alert in it."

586
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,880
And they go, "Remember that?"

587
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
No.

588
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
No one remembers that.

589
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
No.

590
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,920
My videos, hundreds of billions, literally legend forever.

591
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Know your meme status.

592
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,640
Know your meme status.

593
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,000
I don't think I have a know your meme page, but I could.

594
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't have one.

595
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm sure you do. No, no, Caleb. It's know your meme right now. I don't have one.

596
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,160
Why are you going to Google? I would

597
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,000
I would bet ten dollars. I don't have one.

598
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I might be referenced. No, I bet you as a person don't have a page, but

599
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I bet that your memes do. There's no know your meme, y'all.

600
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,800
What? Somebody posted one of my videos

601
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:04,120
retard in it? What is this? What is okay buddy retard? It's a little kids subreddit. Oh okay

602
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,200
for memes. Well okay so I don't have a know your meme page so you guys just got destroyed.

603
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,160
Maybe but maybe I could be. Why does it say Caleb Pitts the 1975? What did you do with

604
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
the 1975.

605
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:22,700
Caleb Pitts of the 1975.

606
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,120
That's not me.

607
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
No, that's you.

608
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,720
That is your from your appearance on

609
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Raisin Man Arena.

610
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,040
Oh, OK.

611
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah. Yeah, that probably.

612
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,900
There's our friend Ben Loftus.

613
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,920
This is awesome, guys.

614
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,080
Yeah, I think we can.

615
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,160
Yeah, I think you could have stopped this.

616
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,680
Maybe we're done looking at all these

617
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
pictures.

618
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, well.

619
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
We will find your know your meme page.

620
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't have one, bro.

621
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You might have one.

622
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
No, I do not. I haven't, I seldom made it to that. That is truly a mortal status.

623
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah, that is truly a mortal status.

624
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you get a know your meme page.

625
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Didn't you get a know your meme?

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I did get know your meme for Great Peppers.

627
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Whoa!

628
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Real ones remember that.

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Damn.

630
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah.

631
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That's actually fire.

632
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
One result. Jingling keys.

633
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And it's about the Tim Pool thing again, huh?

634
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,840
again huh? Oh look at you! See that's what people if you were an undercover cop people

635
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,840
would be like wait. I'd be good at it because I know the streets. I know you're not a cop

636
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:28,720
you hated on Tim Pooles. There's no way you're a police officer. You were shitting on him.

637
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,040
They wouldn't put me on undercover duty as a cop because I would be too obviously a cop

638
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,240
just from looking at me people would know. That's true because you got that mustache.

639
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,520
Yeah I got that look I wear those type of clothes. You do dress like a cop more than

640
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,000
any of us three. And when I see crime I go...

641
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,120
Just like a cop does. You could probably be a cop in New York City. Cops in New York City

642
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:57,540
are all built like Oompa Loompas. Yeah. You're saying he's built like an Oompa Loompa? You're

643
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,280
saying he's short and round? No, I'm saying they can be. You're saying Cameron is short

644
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,800
and stout? I don't think I've ever seen a cop that looks like me. I've never seen representation

645
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,040
I've seen a million cops that look like me.

646
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,400
I, have I ever told you the time, like when I was like 16 years old.

647
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,240
It's because guys who look like me become actors.

648
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,800
There's a lot of guys that look like me.

649
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,160
This is a beat cop over here.

650
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm a beat cop police chief.

651
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
You look like a police chief.

652
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
You know what I could actually be?

653
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,600
I could actually be a detective.

654
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
You could definitely be a detective.

655
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,880
Yeah, I could see you in a trench coat.

656
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
Maybe a detective for cybercrimes.

657
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,400
There was, there was this, uh, there was this like student, it wasn't the resource officer,

658
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,600
He was like the detective that was assigned to the school for some reason.

659
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,440
He was trying to make sure that kids weren't dealing...

660
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
He was a school detective?

661
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,680
Dude, it was so weird.

662
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
He worked for the...

663
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,200
You did not go to a normal school, man.

664
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
No, I did not.

665
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
But, like, they had nothing to do...

666
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,080
You don't dismiss a school police officer.

667
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
My hometown had a SWAT team...

668
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,920
I feel like it was a normal school police officer.

669
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,840
Well, no, he was saying that he would walk around in a fucking trench coat and everyone

670
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
knew he was a cop.

671
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,080
but he was there. It wasn't a detective. Did he have a magnifying glass on some

672
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,440
days?

673
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,480
On some days, he had to use a detective. Yeah, I don't believe he would hang out

674
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,960
with the resource officer. He would hang out with the resource officer and he

675
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,080
had a like a full like tan trench coat. A fashion. That's what you're describing.

676
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,880
Maybe that's what I don't think a detective wears a tan trench coat. No,

677
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,880
No, they don't. A detective is just a piece of clothing.

678
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,880
You're thinking like L.A. Noire. A detective is just a higher level cop.

679
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,880
The school, my hometown had a SWAT team because the airport in Manchester,

680
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,880
New Hampshire was technically in Londonderry.

681
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,880
So they had a huge police budget.

682
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,880
So there was cops right next to the police station.

683
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,880
They had enough of a police budget to do period accurate costumes for the cops?

684
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
I wonder why this guy would walk around the school in a trench coat. He probably just wore that.

685
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,840
Cops are weird. They like to wear strange clothes. No, because my uncle knew of him.

686
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,680
He thought he looked cool. He did look cool. He knew of him. And then they found a bunch of blood

687
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:17,520
in the parking lot in front of the- hold on, hold on. They found a bunch of blood in the parking lot

688
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,320
of this plaza that they had, the pizza place everyone went to, Prosciutto's Pizza. They found

689
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,440
a bunch of blood and the detective went on a full investigation. He was like, "We are

690
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,980
not ruling out homicide. There's no way that this is like... Somebody was shot here." And

691
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:43,980
I think he was on the news in his little trench coat, fully created this fake homicide investigation

692
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,700
because somebody hit a deer and it ran in the woods and died.

693
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
This was animal blood.

694
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,400
This was animal blood. And he immediately...

695
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
So whatever. So this was...

696
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,880
immediately went for fucking like this. This was a detective who came to your

697
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,220
school to investigate something. I think that there was this was not a school

698
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,520
detective. This was kids selling drugs and he was in the school sometimes as a

699
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,040
detective. This was a detective who was at your school. It's not your school

700
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,920
detective. No, I think that my wording there was very bad, but he would chill

701
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,840
in the school sometimes and so I thought he was a school detective. Investigating

702
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,920
stuff. I don't think he was chilling there. He was he was dude, cause he wasn't doing

703
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,620
shit. He was just standing there thinking detectives get paid. He's probably reasoning.

704
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,600
He's reasoning. He's probably reasoning. He's probably deducting stuff. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

705
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,540
But that fucking that deer thing was so crazy. Did he ever like say what's up to you and

706
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:41,200
be like, he never, he didn't talk to me. He was afraid of me. But he wasn't afraid of you.

707
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,520
No detective would be afraid of you. You were the most easily detected person. That's so

708
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
So funny to show up in a big...

709
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Why is he wearing the detective thing?

710
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Why is he wearing a detective outfit?

711
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Again, bro.

712
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
It's the same reason that

713
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
any person wears a trench coat.

714
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Because they think for some reason

715
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,520
that they look cool doing it.

716
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,520
Well, I thought he maybe could have been a school shooter.

717
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,520
It's the same reason a firefighter wears...

718
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
An old school shooter with a badge.

719
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
He shows up in the trench coat and is like, "Man..."

720
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
It's the same reason a firefighter wears

721
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
that big hat

722
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,000
hat and all that reflective stuff. They don't need that. They don't need that. Farmer doesn't

723
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,760
need that. A farmer could dress in full fucking V-Loan and it would make no difference to the

724
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,460
vegetable. The vegetable is going to come out still bright orange. People with different

725
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,920
jobs dress like that so that children see them and know what job they are. It's to help

726
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:40,880
civilization. Exactly. It's rich and scary. Yeah. I guess, I mean, if he didn't want us

727
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,020
to know he was a detective, we knew immediately.

728
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,520
Because everybody looks the same.

729
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,280
All people look, I cannot tell the difference between any two people.

730
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,160
Unless they have different clothes on, then I might be able to say what job they have.

731
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,660
Yeah.

732
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,900
So that's why I knew that these guys were drug dealers.

733
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,500
One of them was wearing Crocs, the other one was wearing like slacks and like nice dress shoes.

734
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah.

735
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, he's the dealer.

736
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,500
What is the only...

737
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,000
The two tights.

738
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,500
These two...

739
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,000
He's the kingpin.

740
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,500
He's wearing loafers.

741
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,000
Exactly.

742
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,500
That's what I was saying.

743
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,300
I was like, this has to be deeper than just a normal coroner deal.

744
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,600
This is mafia.

745
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,240
Because otherwise, why would a schlubby guy in a Rick and Morty shirt and Crocs be hanging

746
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,400
out with this Don Dada?

747
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,280
Well, you live near a pizza place, right?

748
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
That could be he could be.

749
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,680
I've always wanted to stumble into a mafia thing and then get away.

750
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,680
I've been thinking about it so much.

751
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,280
There's a pork store down the street.

752
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,560
I want to go into a store and see a bunch of guys in suits and be like, "Whoa, sorry!"

753
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
and walk out.

754
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,480
There's a pork store down the street that's never, I've never seen it open.

755
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,680
I always thought it was just always closed. Today, I saw two guys unpack or

756
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,340
like putting giant boxes into a van out of the pork store and the pork store had

757
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,220
like lights on and stuff. I was like, wait, these guys are moving something

758
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,880
other than a dead animal. Yeah, there's a pizza place over and if I was a police

759
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,480
officer, I would have said, guys, I'm getting a box cutter. I'm opening these

760
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,140
boxes. I'm putting you on citizens arrest. There's a pizza place that way

761
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,340
that always has, they always have folding tables outside with a ton of guys just

762
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,780
sitting there hanging out. Yeah. And I, that's always my imagination. I always

763
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,460
like, Oh, I think I know the one you're talking about. Yeah. I always, I think

764
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:18,140
it's just a family who lives there, but I always look at them like I want it to

765
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,180
be a different type of family. Any, any, like if a bunch of old white guys are

766
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,220
are hanging out and they all have really tiny tucked in white t-shirts. Yeah.

767
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,780
It's the mafia. Yeah. They're all in weird lounge wear. I've also, I've

768
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,780
I looked it up. There is an active Polish mafia in Bridgewood, Queens.

769
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Oh yeah.

770
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,280
That's so swag dude.

771
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,780
And we might be stumbling into their crosshairs.

772
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Somebody that I know lives close enough to the office.

773
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
You?

774
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
No.

775
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Oh.

776
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,780
There's somebody that I know that lives close to the office.

777
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,780
When we were first moving in and shit, they live across the street or something.

778
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,340
I think they would see us going in and out all the time.

779
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,340
And they were like, "What the fuck is going on?"

780
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
They thought that we were...

781
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,420
Because the gate is closed sometimes, the gate is open.

782
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh.

783
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
It was like this whole...

784
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,700
I talked to them, they were like, "Oh, so you live around here, blah, blah, blah."

785
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,580
I was like, "Oh yeah, our studio is over there."

786
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,300
They're like, "Oh my God, that's you guys."

787
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,820
They thought that we were mobbed up.

788
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,300
I thought somebody was going...

789
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,420
I thought that it was like fucking mafia or some shit.

790
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,460
I do always think it's funny to imagine,

791
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,160
especially when I come in here just to do like,

792
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
not even to record, but just to like grab something

793
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,000
or do something.

794
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,080
I have just people who live here.

795
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,760
It must be very funny to see someone opening the gate

796
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,560
and going in for 30 minutes and then coming in

797
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,200
and like locking everything up with bed locks.

798
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,260
- I think, I do think the day is coming

799
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,240
where we get a knock on that door right over there

800
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,800
and an old, old man says,

801
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,240
this is a pretty rough and tumble dangerous neighborhood.

802
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,080
You need protection.

803
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,900
- You need protection.

804
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,740
- Yeah.

805
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,940
to shell out probably some of these waters. I would be like, "Oh, that's kind of nice,

806
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,620
but no, thank you." No, actually, no, Tai Chi. Yeah, I think we're going to be okay.

807
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah. We have the locks on the door. We have the prop gun that we have. See, I would love

808
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:11,180
to put that in somebody's face, jam the stick in someone's face, up the pole. Yeah. I want

809
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,780
to up the pole into a Polish guy's face and say, "Get the f..." Up the pole is a... What

810
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:23,620
does that mean? It means put the blicky in their face. Because, buddy, where I'm from,

811
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:32,420
does not mean gun. Does it mean penis? Peca. What? Peca. Sucking on a pole? Sucking on

812
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:42,300
some pole. Sucking on pole. That's what you think. If you go up the pole, you zesty. You

813
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,740
think it's zesty to go up the pole. But we should do some decoy stuff in here because

814
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,240
I don't want people to automatically know exactly what this is. So we should have

815
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,900
that big sticker on the window. We should have like a big with our logo.

816
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,800
We should have like a brewers vat. Yeah. You know, so it makes it look like we're

817
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,940
maybe right. Something that from outside looks completely illegal. Yeah. Yeah.

818
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,000
Something that a moonshine still. Yeah. That's what we should have in here. We

819
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,260
should have a full moonshine still. Something to draw even way more

820
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,920
attention. Yeah. Yeah. Or we should put the word for sale on the door. I do want

821
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,760
to put a I think that this might draw suspicion put in a sticker on it and it

822
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,640
would stop people from walking in that says not open to the public yeah that

823
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,840
would be exclusive as fuck yeah oh yeah easy or be ready to present your

824
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:37,320
credentials yeah yeah members only yeah there's a supper club yes members only

825
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,760
supper club that's the other reason why there's definitely mafia yeah yeah what

826
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,640
need a members only club buddy? What is it? Is it ROTC? Can I become a member? I've never

827
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:55,140
felt more FOMO in my entire life than when I walk by a members club or like a supper

828
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,860
club or like a members only bar or something like that and I see somebody walking out and

829
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,500
I see just the I see the crack of the door. I see the velvet. I see steamed hams of old

830
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,660
guys hanging out and I'm like, oh I need to go in. I want to be there. I want to be there

831
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,660
I want to be in there so fucking bad.

832
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,660
I want to be their gopher.

833
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,660
I want them to...

834
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,660
I need you to buy me a pack of fucking misty lights.

835
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,660
I need to be fucking wedding crashers in there.

836
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
I need you to buy me unfiltered cigarettes.

837
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Go get 'em, boy.

838
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,660
I need to try and juggle two different guys who I'm telling each of them that I'm there as a guest of the other guy.

839
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,660
Do you think that we could blend in?

840
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
You keep changing your outfits in the bathroom?

841
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Oh my god.

842
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,660
The thing is, I would probably let three white guys in.

843
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,660
Yeah, that's a good point.

844
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
I think that's the whole point of those members only thing.

845
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:42,200
only thing. I don't want to say what it is or what it's called because I might get assassinated.

846
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,780
It's right by my house, but there's one that I want us all to join. Yeah, I'll join one.

847
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,740
Yeah. Is it? Is it? Okay, it's not that close to my house. I'll say what it is. It's the

848
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:59,660
Italian Americans Club. No, they had one of those in in one of those water towns. I want

849
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,260
I want to get into a, what do they call it?

850
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:06,660
This one is called the Soccer and Folklore Club.

851
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Whoa!

852
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,660
And I've seen the door open one time and it's a bar.

853
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,660
Yeah.

854
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,660
But it's a members only.

855
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,660
It's a bar where they have soccer and they talk about that course.

856
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
It looks like a VFW inside.

857
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,660
I want to go to, I've never been to a VFW.

858
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
We should go to a VFW.

859
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Can you get into one?

860
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
There's one in Londonderry that I used to go to.

861
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Don't you have to be a veteran of a foreign war?

862
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:28,660
I don't know, I think because my grandpa was a veteran of a foreign war.

863
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:36,840
in the meme wars of 2016. Walking in with a meme war veteran hat, trying to talk to some

864
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,820
fucking decrepit old man who has Agent Orange burns all over his face. Oh man, I want to

865
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:49,980
belong to something. Is that what Agent Orange does? It burns you. It sticks to your skin

866
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,940
and burns you. And if you have kids it makes them odd. Yeah, it makes them orange. That's

867
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
That's why they call it Agent Orange.

868
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Oh, that makes sense.

869
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,140
And they call it Agent because it was secret.

870
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
Yeah.

871
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,780
I think there's a members only club down the street that I saw on the way walking over

872
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,780
here today.

873
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,820
I'd never noticed it before.

874
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,940
And it has an Italiano flag on it.

875
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,500
So I think I might be able to get into that one.

876
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
Also the door was open.

877
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
It was just wide open.

878
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,140
They leave it open to air out.

879
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,100
We should apply to every single one in the area.

880
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
I need to get into a members only.

881
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,580
Can you just apply?

882
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,700
We could just turn this into a members only club.

883
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
Yeah.

884
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Yeah.

885
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
A speakeasy.

886
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,300
But a speakeasy, like, we could go to jail for being a speakeasy.

887
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
No, because it's donation based.

888
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,540
Is that true?

889
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,440
You can just say that we're an art gallery and you are donating and the donation gets

890
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
you a free beer.

891
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Oh, okay.

892
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Pretty smart.

893
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
We could do that.

894
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Yeah.

895
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,480
What would our art be, though?

896
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,800
I mean, I could make some stuff.

897
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,320
This is a good piece of art right here.

898
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Photoshop.

899
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Right behind us.

900
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
No, you can't do Photoshop art.

901
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
We don't do that new age bullshit.

902
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,320
but it could be new age bullshit so that the cops can't figure that shit out.

903
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,320
We're looking to bring a pinch of the old world across the pond.

904
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,320
So we have to learn like renaissance paintings and stuff?

905
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Yes.

906
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
Yeah?

907
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
Yeah.

908
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
I watched a video the other day.

909
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Or at the very least get some.

910
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Okay.

911
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
They're pretty expensive man.

912
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,320
I didn't say buy some, but I won't put any more details into the recording.

913
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,320
There's a video that I saw yesterday of a bunch of people, speaking of the old world,

914
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,120
the old world, a bunch of people in Ireland walking down the street and they get asked

915
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,640
if they know how to speak Irish and then they start speaking Irish. That is not a human language.

916
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,000
Crazy language. Unfair, I guess I have it. Why do they speak that? That means man and

917
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:47,880
woman. They have it. Unfair, I guess I have it. Unfair and a woman. August is and. So

918
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,240
So fair August fair would be man and man.

919
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,720
Is that where fairy comes from?

920
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,760
Maybe as a homophobic slur?

921
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,840
I think fairy is fair folk, right?

922
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,360
Yeah, but I mean like fairy like, oh, he's a bit of a fairy.

923
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
He's a manny.

924
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I don't know.

925
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,360
You have to ask the Irish.

926
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,640
Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask the Irish.

927
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,760
But no wonder they can't stop fighting each other up there.

928
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,320
Yeah, it's on every sign they have it.

929
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,680
have it's like bilingual. So they have yeah.

930
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,400
Is there any people who don't speak English and they only speak Irish?

931
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,880
No, the last of those people I think are dead, but there are people who speak Irish as a first

932
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,640
language or I yeah it's everyone in Ireland is taught Irish in school I guess and then

933
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,360
it's I think there was a population of people who only spoke Irish and there might be like

934
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,320
a couple left but I think for the most part everyone speaks English now.

935
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,080
I really hate heritage.

936
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,360
Yeah.

937
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,560
I think that nobody needs to have any heritage at all.

938
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,920
And we just need to have a full reset.

939
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,600
So that's basically how it is now.

940
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,400
That's what I mean. I think it's pretty good right now.

941
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:53,880
Yeah.

942
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,200
The fuck are you doing on there?

943
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,280
Sorry.

944
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,680
You just Patrick'd.

945
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,960
I did. He was flashing these.

946
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,200
So yeah, my peripherals.

947
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,920
You know, he didn't even mention it.

948
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,640
Patrick.

949
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,960
Okay.

950
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,120
And I didn't look at it.

951
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,800
He didn't even notice it.

952
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,560
But yeah, I think that everybody, and it doesn't have to be English, but everybody should just

953
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,560
be speaking one language.

954
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,560
That's barren.

955
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Because where is, yes.

956
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,320
I think we should go back to the Adamic tongue.

957
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
What's that?

958
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,640
The pre-Tower of Babel language of God.

959
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,640
What is that?

960
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,640
How do you speak it?

961
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,640
It's lost.

962
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
Nobody knows.

963
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
It's lost.

964
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
Mormonism says it's going to come back.

965
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
Yeah.

966
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
We just need to reverse.

967
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
They also say that everyone gets their own planet.

968
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,240
Yeah, well, they also say, well, only the men.

969
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,480
also say that if you wear a special Mormon underwear, you're protected from gunshots

970
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
and car crashes.

971
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
That's true.

972
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,040
To be fair, I've never heard of a Mormon being shot to death. I don't think that happens.

973
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,720
They definitely have something figured out. I think Utah probably has the lowest rate of

974
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,040
homicide of any state.

975
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,240
Well, that's because all their beer is like 3%.

976
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,920
They don't drink, they don't even do caffeine.

977
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,920
If you're, if, well, I mean, they do caffeine.

978
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,920
They don't swear, so there's no way for it to get tempers rising.

979
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,640
That's what they do at the Brigham Young parties, is like, they drink a lot of like diet coke

980
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
or like coke and they go like, "Oh!"

981
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,640
No, they don't, they're not allowed to have caffeine.

982
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
No, they drink a lot of soda.

983
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,640
They do stuff they're not allowed to because they're in college.

984
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,640
Caffeine-free soda.

985
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,640
In college, you think they're popping out the caffeine.

986
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,640
I think they probably are, but yeah, the thing of Mormonism is you're not supposed to.

987
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,640
Yeah, that's the thing is like, well, in college I drank soda and now because I feel so bad

988
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,240
bad I'm devoting my life to our God.

989
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,400
That's what they instead of having coffee shops in Utah they have soda shops.

990
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Yeah.

991
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Where you go and you get they make a...

992
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,400
They have a barista?

993
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,400
I'm serious.

994
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Really?

995
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,440
Yeah there's like a bunch of chains of soda shops where people go in the morning and they'll

996
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:55,480
get a soda with cream in it like it's a coffee and put whipped cream and sprinkles on the

997
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
top.

998
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
Yeah.

999
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,680
It's their uh...

1000
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Fuckin what is it?

1001
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,720
It's like it's their like mocha frappuccino or something.

1002
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
The soda shop is a sip of Utah culture.

1003
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Yeah, it's all like...

1004
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Look how disgusting that is.

1005
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,720
They're the weirdest,

1006
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,720
the weirdest fucking people in the world.

1007
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,720
But it's all branded like crumble cookie and shit.

1008
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,720
Like that kind of new kind of business that will fail.

1009
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
These are all caffeine free sodas.

1010
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Oh yeah, they're just putting the syrups in the...

1011
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,720
I wish Mormonism wasn't so evil

1012
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
because they have so much crazy cool stuff

1013
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,720
just built into their shit.

1014
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,720
You know the white horse prophecy?

1015
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,220
No.

1016
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,680
That's that the Mormons believe that at some point the U.S.

1017
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,760
Constitution will be brought to its knees and the only people that can save it

1018
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,800
will be the Mormons.

1019
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,560
How are you going to bring a piece of paper to its knees?

1020
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,560
And they call it the White Horse Prophecy.

1021
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,760
There is this old...

1022
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,520
What does that mean, brought to its knees?

1023
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,040
Like it'll be hanging by a thread.

1024
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,880
But what does that mean in regards to the Constitution?

1025
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,360
It's a prophecy, it's not supposed to make sense.

1026
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:01,400
There's this old Mormon like tape, like this old like thing.

1027
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:07,080
I saw it recently, it's like something they show in their Sunday schools where it's like

1028
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:14,120
how they taught the gospel of Joseph Smith to the natives and the way that they represent

1029
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,720
them going to the light is that they turn white.

1030
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,720
They turn white.

1031
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
People turn white in the afterlife.

1032
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:24,000
Well, you know what the curse of Cain is in Mormonism?

1033
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,040
So in the Bible it says when Cain kills Abel, God gives Cain the mark of Cain, like he curses

1034
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,920
So the mark of Cain in Mormonism, they interpret that as meaning that God

1035
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,960
turned Cain black and that all black people are descendants of Cain and

1036
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,320
they're cursed because of that.

1037
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,880
Okay, wait, I didn't hear about this.

1038
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,720
They also have a thing called the curse of Ham, where there's another

1039
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,880
biblical guy named Ham and his lineage gets cursed to become slaves.

1040
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
So they believe that black people are descendants of Cain and Ham, and that's

1041
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,480
why they are black and that's why they were slaves, because they were cursed by God.

1042
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,520
There's a bake shop in Utah.

1043
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,540
they only like renounced this and like I think it was like the 70s, late 70s that

1044
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,380
they were like okay or no it was it was I think it was like the late 70s were

1045
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,140
like maybe this isn't true and they didn't officially contradict it until

1046
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,980
like 2015 or something. There was a bake shop in Utah that made a bunch of cookies

1047
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,540
that were like like the name of them was like cane something yeah it was like

1048
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:23,220
fucking crazy there was like a double chocolate cookie. It's so nice. Did you guys know that the Catholic

1049
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,220
Catholic Church raped like five million kids.

1050
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,220
(laughter)

1051
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,220
(laughter)

1052
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,220
(laughter)

1053
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,220
You know, I think they're all...

1054
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,220
But they don't have as many cool

1055
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,220
things, ideas, prophecies to counterbalance.

1056
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,220
The Catholic Church has so much cool shit

1057
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,220
going on. Yeah. You know, you see,

1058
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,220
you're playing devil's advocate here,

1059
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,220
because I know you hate Catholicism.

1060
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,220
I love Catholicism. You grew up...

1061
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,220
I've never heard you talk positively about Catholicism

1062
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,220
until I just said that. I don't like...

1063
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:53,220
ever touched shit. But it is cool that they have.

1064
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,220
It's been held away into my mind forever.

1065
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,220
I'm not letting you get away with it.

1066
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,220
It is cool that they have so many...

1067
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,220
They have a lot of cool secret stuff.

1068
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,220
I like the secret stuff. You like the secret boy touching?

1069
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,220
Not that secret stuff.

1070
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,220
That's that secret stuff.

1071
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,220
No dude, they have the

1072
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,220
Ark of the Covenant, all that kind of stuff.

1073
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,220
The relics? Yeah, all the old relics

1074
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,220
are cool. It's cool that they have them and they

1075
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,220
say, "We don't know where this shit is, but it's all

1076
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,220
under the Vatican. I've learned this."

1077
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:27,640
Yeah, well, I think they don't have the three Nephites. Yeah, what's the Nephites? Those

1078
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:33,980
are three immortal guys that help Mormonism. Yeah, yeah, they're are they still around?

1079
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:40,040
Yeah, they were doing dude, they were doing this shit in 2012. So they do like proxy Mormon

1080
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,720
baptisms for like, people who I do know the Mormons believe this is so cool. The Mormons

1081
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,800
believed that the great flood was the baptism of the earth. That's so smart. That's crazy.

1082
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:58,360
Isn't that awesome? That's so smart. But they did a proxy baptism in 2012 for Anne Frank.

1083
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,660
I think you've told me that before. So what? I mean, someone had to do it. No, if no one's

1084
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,480
going to do this, I guess we'll step up. I mean, it's been a while. If anyone was going

1085
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,480
to do this, they would have done it by now. The honest truth is, if you are a Mormon,

1086
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,040
is the right thing to do. If you fully believe that you're saving her immortal soul, then

1087
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,440
fucking do it. You should be baptized. Baptize everyone, dude.

1088
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,760
That's what they do. They just put little Mormon kids in a tub.

1089
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,280
Do they think that normal Christians are going to heaven?

1090
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,200
No. I think they only think Mormons are going to heaven.

1091
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,200
Really? I think it's only Mormons.

1092
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,720
Who had that? Our friend Tom had that joke.

1093
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,840
Believe that, yeah. There was something I was reading. I was reading a lot about Mormonism

1094
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,240
recently and I think it's something like they believe modern, or they think the Roman

1095
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,840
Catholic Church is the great enemy. I think that's the biggest enemy to Mormons. I think

1096
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,360
they said that modern Christianity has less in common with the truth than like some...

1097
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,160
Yeah, it was something where I think they don't like...

1098
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,840
You know there's a famous Mormon, Napoleon Dynamite, creator.

1099
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,960
Wasn't that whole squad?

1100
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,520
Whole squad Mormons.

1101
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,520
That's crazy.

1102
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
And the Killers.

1103
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Really?

1104
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
The Killers is a Mormon.

1105
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,720
That's not a very Mormon name for your band.

1106
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,720
No.

1107
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,720
But that's why it's rock and roll.

1108
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,720
But I think a lot of their songs are...

1109
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,720
They were thinking of the darkest name they could possibly think of.

1110
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,720
All of their songs are like Mormon stuff.

1111
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
What?

1112
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,720
Pretty much all of them.

1113
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,720
What's a killer song?

1114
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
Mr. Brightside.

1115
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,720
That's not Mormon.

1116
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
Mr. White Guy.

1117
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
Nazis Violinist Lead.

1118
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
I Got Soul.

1119
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
I'm Not A Soldier.

1120
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Now She's Drinking Soda.

1121
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,720
And I'm Drinking Caffeine.

1122
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,720
That is not Mormon.

1123
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Mr. Brightside is not a Mormon song dude.

1124
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
I think it is.

1125
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,720
I think they're all Mormon.

1126
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
I mean I believe they are all Mormon.

1127
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,720
Brandon Flowers is a Mormon.

1128
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
That's just one.

1129
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,220
And his name is fucking Brandon Flowers.

1130
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,220
Is Gene Simmons?

1131
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,220
No, he's Jewish.

1132
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,220
Gene Simmons is completely Jewish.

1133
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Yeah.

1134
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,720
He is Jewish, isn't he?

1135
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,720
Yeah.

1136
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,720
His real name is Chaim Witz.

1137
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,720
Really?

1138
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Yeah.

1139
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
Wow.

1140
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,720
That's cool.

1141
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
That's a cooler name than Gene.

1142
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,720
Gene Simmons, yeah.

1143
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,720
I like that.

1144
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,720
That's the coolest name he could come up with for a stage name.

1145
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
Well, I mean, it was the 70s.

1146
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,720
You know, you go up dressed up like a demon and your name is Chaim Witz.

1147
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,720
I think a lot of people are going to...

1148
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,520
I guess he was always sticking his tongue out because he needed the Heimlich maneuver.

1149
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,420
Do you think the Heimlich maneuver is you get your tongue out of your throat?

1150
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,980
Well how else are you going to signal that you're choking?

1151
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,980
You can't say anything.

1152
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,980
Well you go like this.

1153
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,980
Yeah I guess you're right.

1154
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,980
True.

1155
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,980
You go ahhhh.

1156
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,900
Man Kiss is like one of the worst bands ever.

1157
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,460
The worst band of all time.

1158
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,080
I remember being so disappointed because I thought my entire life growing up I was like

1159
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,700
Kiss is like badass hardcore metal probably right?

1160
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,300
I'd never heard a Kiss song, but just based on how they looked.

1161
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,200
And then I played Guitar Hero,

1162
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,900
and it was like the wackest song I've ever heard

1163
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,100
in my entire life.

1164
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,120
♪ Everybody says you're looking good ♪

1165
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,540
It's like not, it doesn't fit the look, man.

1166
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,380
No, no.

1167
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,400
You can't have metal shoulder pads

1168
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,780
and sing about how you're everything,

1169
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,380
but in your entire song, it's about staying up past midnight.

1170
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,100
They have that song, God of Thunder,

1171
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,980
which like, that makes sense with their whole image,

1172
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,340
but it's like, if you're gonna do that,

1173
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,900
if you're gonna dress like that and be like,

1174
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,340
"I love rock and roll, baby!"

1175
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,340
It's like, what the fuck?

1176
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,620
Like, why are you dressed up like a demon to do that?

1177
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,620
You could...

1178
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,620
Yeah.

1179
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,460
Their marketing is so fucking crazy.

1180
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,000
They've like only stayed relevant because of like how much merch they put up.

1181
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,720
If you look up like the Kiss website, it's like a fucking like, it's like SkyMall.

1182
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,420
Like they have every single thing with the Kiss logo on it.

1183
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,420
Probably.

1184
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,180
Like, they like, what they tried to...

1185
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,780
Yeah, they had that arena football team.

1186
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,460
We like, we watched that show, right?

1187
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,000
what was it called? Like they had the, it was on, it was on Tubi.

1188
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,560
Remember we would, we would watch this together.

1189
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,580
I never have seen this with them.

1190
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,960
They had a reality show where like half of the show,

1191
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,480
I've definitely talked about it before, but the LA kiss,

1192
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,020
they bought an arena football team, tried to bring back arena football. Uh,

1193
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,700
the whole show is them creating the LA kiss and half the show is just Gene

1194
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,060
Simmons and Paul Stanley in business meetings. And they're like,

1195
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,560
this logo looks really good. I love that so much.

1196
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:11,620
And then the other half of the show is men who tried to get into the NFL and have been

1197
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,900
playing football and doing MMA and shit their whole life.

1198
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,900
They have so much CTE that if I get another concussion during training, I will go completely

1199
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,080
blind.

1200
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,420
And they're doing that for fucking the LA Kiss.

1201
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,420
I mean, they're doing it for a bag, dude.

1202
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,420
They don't care who they're...

1203
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
They're mercenaries.

1204
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,420
Yeah, that's true.

1205
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:39,300
that's true that would be a better name the LA mercenaries than the LA Kiss.

1206
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,180
Well these days you'd probably have a real mercenaries complaining about the

1207
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,100
name mm-hmm and you probably would have real people who kiss complaining about

1208
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,620
the kiss name too. Yeah I think it should all just be football team. Their name

1209
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:54,980
should be football team. The Panthers the North Carolina football team it should

1210
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:58,580
all just be that. Yeah that was that was the coolest. That's how they used to name baseball

1211
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,900
teams. What do you mean? Like the red socks were like the team that wore red socks, the

1212
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,300
white socks wore white socks, there was the black socks. Like most baseball teams were

1213
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,540
just named after like the shit that they were wearing. What about the Astros? Well they're

1214
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:17,300
a later team. Oh. They came later. Well what are we, okay so we all have socks, but what

1215
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:21,340
else? Athletics? They wore what? Athletic clothes when they played fucking baseball?

1216
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:26,660
I mean it was like, there was probably like 8 teams in the MLB I think. That's another

1217
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,760
sport that it's been around long enough you guys that we get it you all the pictures that

1218
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,620
you have of the sport are from 1905. Yeah, stop it. It's not enough. Nobody needs that

1219
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,000
sport now. We can get rid of baseball. We don't need it. It sucks. You know, the hats

1220
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,100
were almost completely like the baseball hat as we know it was almost completely different.

1221
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:50,420
We were almost this one and this would have been like a like one of those fucking flat

1222
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:54,960
caps. But because this is like the like the kind of like the baseball hat that they have

1223
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,320
now is like the Brooklyn style hat. Are you telling me all the teams had different style

1224
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,960
hats? Pretty much, yeah. That is cool. That's why the Pirates had like pillbox hats for

1225
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,800
like ever. That's so cool, man. Pillbox hats look terrible though. On my head, I can't wear

1226
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,960
that shit. Wait, what's a pillbox hat? The square hat. Oh, I thought you were talking

1227
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,760
about a pirate hat. No, no, no. You're thinking of a tri-corner hat. That's what they should

1228
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,560
have been wearing. That's what they should have been wearing. A tri-corner hat with a

1229
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,960
They should have all had different hats, you're right.

1230
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,360
But there's a thing that I saw the other day,

1231
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,560
and I think it was one of the first new era pamphlets

1232
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,360
or styles of baseball hats teams could get.

1233
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,360
And there's like eight of them.

1234
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,560
There's like eight different hats that they could have chose from.

1235
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,360
Did you guys know that the old real pirates

1236
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,560
are basically like bloodscrips of their kind of era?

1237
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,560
I knew that.

1238
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,560
I thought they were heroes.

1239
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,360
You thought they were heroes?

1240
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,920
I thought heroes were cowboys and pirates, but it turns out these guys were not good.

1241
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,920
They were criminals.

1242
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,920
They were bad guys.

1243
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,880
Cowboys were called cowboys because they were boys that stole cows.

1244
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,240
And pirates would steal.

1245
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,240
Pirates would get drunk all day on grog and pickles.

1246
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
There's jeans called rustlers.

1247
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,680
Probably named after rustlers.

1248
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:16,480
That's like having a pair of pants named Latin Kings.

1249
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,480
You're right.

1250
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,480
I guess it is.

1251
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,480
You're right.

1252
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
I guess.

1253
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,400
I would wear it. I would imagine him.

1254
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,400
Some LKs.

1255
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,200
Imagine the bedazzling on the back.

1256
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
It would be amazing.

1257
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,520
Oh my god. Imagine what those look like.

1258
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,160
Bedazzled AK-47 on one side, Mickey Mouse on the other.

1259
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:37,760
Speaking of clothes, yesterday I was with my friend Henry. I was trying to show him

1260
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,760
those shoes that Sam has, the Subway.

1261
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Yeah.

1262
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,160
The Subway like Jordan 7s. Have you seen those? Has he shown you them?

1263
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,160
He has Subway shoes.

1264
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,800
Yeah, it's the shoes with the Subway logo on them. They're so sick. But I was trying

1265
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,160
to show him what they look like. I found this website called I love my family forever and

1266
00:58:53,160 --> 00:59:02,380
it's just all just like they're putting different like brand logos into like these 3D shirts.

1267
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,020
You know the type I'm talking about?

1268
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,020
What?

1269
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,400
Hold on, I have some photos.

1270
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,640
I love my family forever?

1271
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:14,300
The website is called I love my family forever and yeah it's like this. You can get like

1272
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,760
custom, oh here it is.

1273
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,360
Are you doing an ad?

1274
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,360
No, I wish.

1275
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Whoa.

1276
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360
I wish they would send us some shit.

1277
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Look at these.

1278
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,160
These are like soccer jerseys basically.

1279
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
Yeah, pretty much.

1280
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,600
Dude, those look like Assassin's Creed.

1281
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,600
Yeah.

1282
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,000
This one, this hat right here, the Hormel chili.

1283
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Nice.

1284
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Damn.

1285
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
The Frank logo.

1286
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
These are expensive, man.

1287
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That is.

1288
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Zoomies shoes.

1289
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Oh my God, that is fire.

1290
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Wow.

1291
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
These Zoomies shoes are fucking sick.

1292
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, you can get custom printed.

1293
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,760
You get your name on the front and Walmart on the back.

1294
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,760
This is the one that I think Cameron would love the most.

1295
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:54,560
day. Halloween Arby's. Whoa, that is tight on that. But they have all these fucking Halloween

1296
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,640
graphics like they got like pictures of like the Grinch with like the Patriots logo. Oh

1297
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,400
yeah, the Punisher. Henry sent me the Dunkin Donuts. The Punisher Papa John's shirt. Punisher

1298
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,020
Home Depot is really sick. These are sick, man. I mean, I guess this is if you are. Oh,

1299
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,800
you could also get it on a polo shirt. This graphic. This is kind of what's it called?

1300
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:19,480
malicious compliance. If you are trying to fit with your work uniform. You wear one of

1301
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
these things.

1302
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:27,960
Yeah, these are, dude, this Pepsi logo is so fucking sick. This is the coolest shit I've

1303
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
ever seen.

1304
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,440
The thing is, man, none of these clothes ever fit a normal human.

1305
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,440
No, no, no.

1306
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,160
They don't, these are not meant for normal people to wear. This is like peewee football

1307
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,160
coach body. It's the only thing that can fit into this kind of hoodie.

1308
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,080
Oh yeah, they're made out of like 100% like...

1309
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:49,140
When I was in Ireland and I was in the tourist shops, I was trying to find a nice sweater.

1310
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:54,420
Every sweater I put on that was my size, it's so funny, they're all completely made for guys

1311
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:59,300
with the biggest bellies of all time. They all looked so insane and horrible on me because

1312
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:05,100
they're all built, they're all like knit together to like stretch like three times only in the

1313
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,860
stomach. It was so horrible.

1314
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:13,820
Yeah, I mean we have plenty of fatties here, and I love them because they're here, but in any other country

1315
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,440
Do not like the fatties in other countries

1316
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,400
Make some clothes for the skinnies because again we turn mostly he's over in Europe because they don't have sugar in their food

1317
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,740
They have they have

1318
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:27,820
You don't have any sugar in there for they have nothing that makes it

1319
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,620
There is an entire country that eats a pastry every morning where France?

1320
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,820
They eat pastry every morning.

1321
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,980
I know, actually I do that too.

1322
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:45,220
They may not have sugar bloating up their belly, but I think that everybody in Europe has some

1323
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:52,160
kind of gas bubble that's been in their stomach like a baby for nine months straight.

1324
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Guilt from World War II.

1325
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,160
They eat beans for breakfast.

1326
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,540
They're walking around pregnant with guilt.

1327
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,700
I don't think beans for breakfast is that crazy.

1328
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,700
It's not.

1329
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,700
That's because they do that in New Hampshire.

1330
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,700
It's not that crazy.

1331
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
That's true, yeah.

1332
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:07,020
I'm not that good. I ate it that one time when we went to that red arrow diner.

1333
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,540
The red arrow. Yeah, we got takeaway and we brought it to your apartment and it

1334
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,140
was not very good. There's no reason to eat beans for breakfast. The beans

1335
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:17,820
weren't good or the red arrow food. Just well both. But why would you eat? Yeah,

1336
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,980
just is not a breakfast food. It's not right. I mean, I don't know. I do like

1337
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,820
beans on toast. That is the British in me speaking. It's not good. You're not.

1338
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,420
We were. Oh, he just admitted he was British because he's 100% Irish and it's

1339
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,940
the same thing. No, you just said that shit. 100% British and Irish. I just don't like to

1340
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,860
talk about it. Oh, really? You're not 100% Irish. What if you were like 95% British?

1341
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:44,340
Do you probably are? You probably are. Well, again, it's the same thing. I don't even care.

1342
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:49,380
I'm not going to get into this. You're not going to get into this. No, no. You know what?

1343
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:55,380
I'm being a bigger person. I'm being a bigger person than Caleb today. No, you're not guys.

1344
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:02,240
Jake and Logan Paul are beefing. They're brothers. That's what I said. I bet it's a, uh, is it

1345
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,740
over the licensing of what's it called? No. What's it called when you have anything to

1346
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:11,680
do with Prime? An investment. No, when you do something, a trick. Yeah, but it's for

1347
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,980
attention. A magic trick. Oh, it's a publicity stunt. Publicity stunt. Yeah, it's definitely

1348
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,580
a publicity stunt. It's a publicity stunt. I don't think so. I think Jake's serious this

1349
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:24,900
time y'all. He said Logan is accusing Jake of not letting him bring a Prime bottle into

1350
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:45,820
to

1351
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:49,740
that guy is serious black. He's supposed to be his godfather.

1352
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,820
They named him serious black.

1353
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:58,220
Serious black. That's a Netflix special, dude.

1354
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:05,820
You got to be really glad that JK Rowling named Dumbledore before she

1355
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,520
decided that he was gay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Could you imagine? You

1356
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,220
imagine Dumbledore's name if she was like you're gay from the get go?

1357
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,720
it would have been like stretchy hole.

1358
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:22,300
It would have been yeah, but like it's so she's so like twinkle fairy. She

1359
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,700
wanted to be so subtle

1360
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:30,460
she would have named him like underwear or something yeah or she's like she

1361
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,800
would have named him like like Barnabas jock strap yeah

1362
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,640
professor anal puke.

1363
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,420
I mean, those names are just crazy man. Professor Pervious. Yeah, it would have

1364
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,880
been Pervious. Yeah, because she named it in the 90s.

1365
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:54,880
The only one that is not like that is McGonagall. Pervious Indoctrinatio.

1366
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,140
Snape. That would be his spell. Severus Snape is a name for an evil guy.

1367
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:04,180
It is so fucking funny, Severus Snape. She sucks so bad, dude. I've never

1368
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:07,460
liked those Harry Potter things. I'm glad that the public opinion... I so love

1369
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,860
Harry Potter. I'm so glad the public opinion is like I stopped

1370
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,260
looking at Potter on the fifth book. I was like never never

1371
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,660
read all of them. I read all of them too, but they were

1372
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,160
basically hate those little fucking wizards. Then do

1373
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,060
something about it. I'm gonna kill her Daniel Radcliffe.

1374
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:26,560
Look the fuck out. You stole my birthday. He's goaded.

1375
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,660
He fucked a horse on stage. He played weird. Ellen a funny

1376
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,360
ass movie. That was almost two and a half hours. I forgot

1377
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,160
about the weirdo movie really movie of all time. That makes

1378
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,960
me so sad. I couldn't finish it. I thought it was alright. I thought it was so, I thought

1379
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,680
it was the most, it's made by Funny or Die and you can tell that it's made by Funny or

1380
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:50,320
Die. It's based off a Funny or Die skit from like 10 years ago. Oh god. And it's a skit,

1381
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:56,240
not even a sketch. Did Daniel crush? Daniel was okay. Did he suck a horse's penis? You

1382
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:05,040
know what Daniel Radcliffe, I rescind my threat. I'm threatening now Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.

1383
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:08,680
We've seen the bugs, the invasive bugs. You've seen them?

1384
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
The red lanternflies.

1385
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,680
The red lanternflies.

1386
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,240
I've been thinking about this so, so much.

1387
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,960
I'd like to issue a warning to science. We've seen these bugs. If you pull up a picture of

1388
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:23,360
one on the screen to search lanternfly, these are invasive bugs that are attacking from,

1389
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,360
let's just say China.

1390
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
They're not attacking.

1391
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,760
Let's say they're coming from China. We'll say that they are because they're from...

1392
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,760
They're from...

1393
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,760
Oh, it is native to China.

1394
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:38,160
got these bugs. You'll see you've probably seen them around if you're in this area in

1395
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,160
New York. I don't know where else in the United States they're coming, but I know they're a

1396
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,440
big deal here right now. These bugs, they've got a larval stage that looks like that little

1397
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,180
spotted red thing right there. You see that? And then they've got the big adult ones. Now

1398
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:56,520
I'd like to issue a warning to China, I mean to the US government, but a warning to China

1399
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:01,100
also, but separate from this. The US government, beware because if there's any knowledge I've

1400
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:09,940
gained from my life as a video gamer. Phase one, phase two, there's always going to be

1401
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:16,060
a third evolution. Okay, we have not seen the Charizard of these bugs yet. You're right

1402
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:21,060
in the Charmander. We've seen the Charmeleon. Watch the fuck out. That's why we're killing

1403
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,700
him now. Get ready. You're anticipating legs that could have pants. I'm think that I think

1404
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:32,600
that we're going to be seeing a large new type of bug with my powers and an added type that

1405
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:38,320
really scares me spotted as a type spot is a type I I was thinking that for those who

1406
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:43,240
were more poetically inclined than I am maybe a great poem would be from the perspective

1407
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:49,540
of one of these spotter lantern flies about someone's looking in how you have I thought

1408
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,880
it was maybe a package for us but he just looked in and went and then he's just interested

1409
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,540
that's fine, well he heard me.

1410
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,380
But--

1411
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,220
- He's a poet.

1412
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:59,920
- Well, I'm gonna give him this idea.

1413
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,260
Guys, if I was a spotter lanternfly,

1414
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,200
I'm looking around--

1415
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,480
- Do you have a poem at the ready?

1416
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,320
- I'm seeing, no shut the fuck up.

1417
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,680
I'm seeing a butterfly descend from a tree

1418
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,660
and land on a child's finger.

1419
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,960
I'm seeing everybody around the child

1420
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,400
look in awe at this beautiful creature

1421
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,360
and people clap and people kiss

1422
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,480
and people celebrate, they're popping champagne.

1423
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,600
I see a ladybug crawling on the ground,

1424
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,060
somebody's foot about to step on it,

1425
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,400
then they realize, "Oh, that's a ladybug.

1426
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,800
I'll allow it onto my body to piss and shit on me."

1427
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,760
- Yep.

1428
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,240
- Me, a spotted lanternfly,

1429
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,080
the perfect combination of a ladybug and a butterfly,

1430
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,600
is being massacred.

1431
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:44,880
Literally, people are trying to do a complete genocide

1432
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,040
on these bugs,

1433
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,720
even though they're just as beautiful as every other bug,

1434
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,360
or even as the most beautiful bugs,

1435
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,320
the bugs that we allow to be in our homes.

1436
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,160
People let butterflies...

1437
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,920
I'm personally, I'm scared of butterflies. A butterfly landed on my head the other day

1438
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,920
and I screamed and a little kid laughed at me. I was at the dog park. A spotted lanternfly

1439
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:10,360
is just as beautiful and scary as a butterfly. Stop the hate. Why are we killing these things?

1440
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:11,800
My cat ate one.

1441
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:15,440
But what is the problem? People say it's an invasive species. I don't give a fuck. It's

1442
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:21,440
a bug. It's not taking up that much space. It's little. I don't care.

1443
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,680
One of them landed on my headphone.

1444
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:27,040
If there was so many of them, well, okay. I'll say this much.

1445
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,680
The spotted lanternflies do not know how to act.

1446
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,480
No, they don't.

1447
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:33,920
That's why they're making us kill them.

1448
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,000
They do not know how to act.

1449
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
They're too much.

1450
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,920
They act, they're wiling out.

1451
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,920
You can tell they're new bugs.

1452
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,480
Yeah.

1453
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,480
They're new bugs.

1454
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,680
They don't know how to act yet.

1455
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,680
They are acting brand fucking new.

1456
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,520
They're walking around like they own this place.

1457
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,080
They fly up and land on you.

1458
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,920
You are a guest in America.

1459
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,840
You are a guest in America.

1460
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,880
You're originated from China and Vietnam.

1461
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,200
I've been seeing, can you go back to that lanternfly thing?

1462
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,600
My girlfriend has been letting,

1463
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,520
she's saying that she's been finding ladybugs

1464
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,660
in the apartment and letting them free.

1465
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,520
They've been looking a lot like that motherfucker

1466
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,440
on the top right.

1467
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,360
Yeah, this top right, that's the nymph,

1468
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,880
I think it's called, form of the lanternfly.

1469
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,160
She has been making me open the window for her

1470
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,800
so she can free them.

1471
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,640
Wow.

1472
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,480
I should be I should be smacking the crap out of those bugs. I was seeing those bugs around

1473
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:27,080
before before the this the second wave because they come in the summer. Yeah. Before the

1474
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:32,220
second wave was going on, I was seeing these little guys around and I fully was 100% convinced

1475
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:37,740
I discovered a new bug and I was ready to let everybody know I've been seeing this new

1476
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:40,920
type of bug. I've never seen it before, but I'm seeing it all over. They're going to make

1477
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,120
an announcement soon that a new bug has been discovered in New York City. Wow. I go to

1478
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,080
Google red bug with white spots. It's the same bug all along. Wow.

1479
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:52,040
Has been here. Oh my God. I was ready to go public with.

1480
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,960
I felt like that when I first saw a silverfish. Yeah. You know, those like we,

1481
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:57,760
they're, they like crawl on your walls.

1482
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,560
One of them scared me so bad one time that I was silverfish completely paralyzed.

1483
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,440
The ones that look like cockroaches? No, no, it's like a centipede with giant

1484
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,840
antenna. Oh yeah. Kind of like a house centipede, but not really.

1485
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,880
When I was in, when I was in Austin.

1486
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,120
We don't have that in North Carolina. We just have giant ass roaches.

1487
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,120
You know those water bugs? Those really big ones that look like cockroaches?

1488
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,120
Those are like the big pest in North Carolina.

1489
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,120
The Toad Biters?

1490
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:26,120
Yeah. Well, I don't know if it's a water bug. I don't know what it was, but there's a bug that looks like a cockroach that isn't a cockroach.

1491
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,120
Can it fly?

1492
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,120
It flies, yeah.

1493
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,120
And it's giant?

1494
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:39,120
Yeah. So, when I was in Austin, I was on stage, I got three phone calls, and it was weird.

1495
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,120
I was like, "Oh my God, okay."

1496
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
Did you let that shit buzz while you were on stage?

1497
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
while I was on stage didn't check it.

1498
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,280
That's a bad look.

1499
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:45,780
Uh-huh.

1500
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,580
People in the audience can feel that you're getting a call from a collections agency.

1501
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,460
So, well, it's not a collections agency.

1502
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:51,920
Oh, OK.

1503
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,060
I was getting a call from my girlfriend

1504
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:00,940
because she said that a cockroach flew in the apartment and landed on her face.

1505
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,400
It was a...

1506
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,140
Break up with her.

1507
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,140
Big ass water bug.

1508
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:06,700
I am never kissing you again if a cockroach has landed on your face.

1509
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:08,600
You better scrub the shit out of your face.

1510
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,040
Yeah.

1511
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,140
She called me and I was like, I'm in Austin, Texas.

1512
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,580
I cannot do anything.

1513
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:17,180
So she locked it in a room with Moe and let him.

1514
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,020
- Let him eat it?

1515
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,300
- Let him fuck it up, yeah.

1516
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,300
- Phil's been eating the spotted, why can't I say that?

1517
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,980
I keep saying spotted, spotted lanternfly.

1518
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,180
He's been eating them and then getting really sick.

1519
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,140
- Yeah.

1520
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,980
- The other day he ate like three of them at the park

1521
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,860
and then I tried to walk him home

1522
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,180
and he just laid on the concrete.

1523
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:36,060
- Just threw up?

1524
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,500
- He didn't throw up, but he laid on the concrete

1525
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,340
for like 15 full minutes.

1526
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,300
- You should have induced vomiting.

1527
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,500
You should have put your finger into his...

1528
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,500
I'm probably sure he ate a zen the other day.

1529
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,500
He ate a zen?

1530
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Yeah, but it was used.

1531
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Oh.

1532
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,180
And I looked it up and they were like, "It's fine."

1533
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:52,820
I probably already talked about this, but yeah, Moe, when he was that big, a week after

1534
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:58,900
I had to keep monitoring him to see whether or not he got panleukopenia or not, and he

1535
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,460
threw up a bunch of red and I was like, "Oh, that's it.

1536
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:03,700
He threw up his heart.

1537
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,700
He's dying.

1538
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,700
I have to take him to the hospital."

1539
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,940
How would he throw his heart up?

1540
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,500
He was a tiny little fucker.

1541
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,420
He was so small.

1542
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:15,760
he was all the stuff was in one spot and he had there was a possibility that he

1543
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,380
had a disease that is like a 95% mortality rate and I looked at the

1544
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:24,060
looked at it as a little red piece on the ground and it was just full spotted

1545
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:29,080
lantern fly so then you're like I was like oh he's fucking stupid yeah well

1546
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,500
he's pretty smart actually to be catching a fly because this is a new bug

1547
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:37,700
cats don't have this in their ancestral memory exactly they don't know much

1548
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,700
Only a Chinese tiger would be able to know how to deal with a lantern.

1549
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,260
Only one of these cats that does this with its hand and sits on a windowsill, that one

1550
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,460
might be able to catch a spotted lanternfly.

1551
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,020
You put some glue on that hand?

1552
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,020
Yeah, exactly.

1553
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,820
You're going to be catching spotted lanternflies all day.

1554
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,340
Is that why those are there?

1555
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,340
To catch flies?

1556
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,340
To swat flies away?

1557
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:57,780
I think it's to wave hello as you walk into your home.

1558
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:02,120
I think almost everything in China is for good luck.

1559
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,120
Pretty much everything.

1560
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,320
I think everything is about auspicious things.

1561
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,920
They eat food because it's lucky.

1562
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,920
And the way they eat it is lucky.

1563
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,520
Yep, they eat in a lucky way.

1564
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,320
And that's why they are dominating the world right now.

1565
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:21,720
They've been generating luck for thousands of years.

1566
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,960
They have like an overflow of luck.

1567
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,220
They have like a sieve of luck pool.

1568
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,520
They have a surplus of luck.

1569
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,560
And they've been drawing,

1570
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,420
but they have not used maximum.

1571
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:36,320
They have so much left in the tank when it comes to luck.

1572
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,320
Pretty much everything in American culture is something that generates bad luck.

1573
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
We have mirror stores.

1574
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,520
We have mirror stores.

1575
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,120
Oh, yeah.

1576
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,720
And there are clean up on aisle three.

1577
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:48,920
Pretty often in the mirror store.

1578
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:52,220
The only two, it's the Irish and China.

1579
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,220
They are the ones that care the most about the luck.

1580
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:57,420
And Ireland's not doing that well.

1581
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,420
That's because what they do is not lucky.

1582
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,720
Also, they gave up on luck.

1583
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,640
Their luck was all fake and stupid.

1584
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,640
Yeah.

1585
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,240
They tried to copy China.

1586
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:10,740
Their luck, they tried to get luck by having rainbows, but the reason they have rainbows

1587
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,840
is because it rains so fucking much.

1588
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,840
The rainbow even then.

1589
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,760
So they tried to turn their terrible climate into a...

1590
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,600
The rainbow belongs to the world.

1591
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
It's not even yours.

1592
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Exactly.

1593
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,600
That's what I'm saying.

1594
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,800
They took the reason their country sucks and they tried to say, "Yeah, actually this means

1595
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,800
we're lucky."

1596
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,440
It's actually very lucky to have giant tornadoes.

1597
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:35,400
tornadoes. They're actually a sign of good luck. Shut the fuck up you fucking Irish bitch.

1598
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:40,640
They have every single natural disaster. It's the only place on earth that has all major

1599
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:50,960
natural disasters. They get hurricanes and typhoons. In Ireland? There's puffins. Really?

1600
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,480
In one of those black rock beaches? That's cool as fuck. I think of that as a cereal.

1601
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,480
No snakes though.

1602
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,480
Nope.

1603
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,480
No snakes in Ireland?

1604
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,480
No, it's too cold.

1605
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Ohhhh.

1606
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,480
That's why they have their little story.

1607
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,480
They ain't got no gators either.

1608
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:10,480
Their little story they tell themselves about who this guy who got rid of the snakes.

1609
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:14,080
Well wait, how did they even know what a snake was when they came up with this story?

1610
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:20,320
Well, St. Patrick was supposed to them interacting with other people I would imagine.

1611
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,280
Once the Catholicism got brought over.

1612
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,280
Yeah, because they weren't Catholic to start with.

1613
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,240
No, they were all doing spells and rituals and shit.

1614
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,240
They were like blocks.

1615
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,240
Yeah.

1616
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,240
Yeah.

1617
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,840
They had the fucking, what's it called, the Tain or whatever.

1618
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
The Tam?

1619
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
No, that...

1620
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
The Tain?

1621
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,280
They believed in all types of weird guys with strange names.

1622
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,280
Oh yeah.

1623
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,280
Plape and Tain.

1624
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Yeah.

1625
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,280
They had that.

1626
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,280
Alright.

1627
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,280
Yeah.

1628
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,280
Alright, I have to go pee pee.

1629
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,280
Me too.

1630
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,280
Because this Icelandic water really runs through you, man.

1631
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,280
This Icelandic water is so good.

1632
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,280
The pH balance, it goes down so easy that I drank the whole thing in the first 10 seconds.

1633
01:16:53,280 --> 01:17:00,280
That's enough for me. I'll give this an 8.4 out of 10. Thank you to Icelandic Glacial,

1634
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,960
Natural Spring Water from Iceland.

1635
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,400
I give this an 8.4 out of 14 on the pH scale.

1636
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,720
Carbon neutral product too. And I'm going to go throw it in the trash can.

1637
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,720
Alright.
