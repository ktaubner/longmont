11
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,240
Oh my God, he's drinking a Ray in the can.

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,560
Oh my God.

13
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,320
What's up Thomas, how we doing buddy?

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,280
Pretty good, how are you guys?

15
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,120
Not bad.

16
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,040
I'm good man, I always am shocked by your eyebrows

17
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,880
when I see you.

18
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
They're awesome dude.

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,720
I mean, it's insane.

20
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,240
- As somebody, as someone who also has gigantic eyebrows.

21
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,040
- No, I think you have gigantic eyebrows until I see Tom.

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,480
- Yeah, no, compared to yours, mine are just terrible.

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,040
- You don't fill those in at all?

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,880
- Me?

25
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
- No, no, I've trimmed them back some,

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,080
but I can't really stop them from--

27
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,800
- You can't contain them.

28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,680
- Yeah, I kind of gave up a couple years ago,

29
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,520
'cause I used to just shave this middle part.

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
- Do you have a, you got a uni?

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,160
- I've got a slight one on there.

32
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:08,640
I thought your forehead cast a shadow. I thought it was like offset an inch.

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,960
My nephew's head does that. Was he like just born? Did he have a weird

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
vagina? Otis.

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,280
Yeah, my nephew's name is Otis. Why are you saying your nephew's name on the

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,280
show? Yeah, we'll bleep it out.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
He's gonna

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,040
Head looks like that

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,400
That you were asking about

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Did you just get distracted in the middle of in the middle of talking about yeah your cousin with the weird head

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,120
It's not my cousin. It's my nephew cousin nephews or a cousin. He doesn't have a weird head. He just he looks normal

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
It's just his forehead.

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,120
If his forehead comes out an inch off his fucking head.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
It doesn't come out an inch.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Yeah, dude, it just has...

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
That's what you just said!

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
No, it looks like his...

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't know, it looks like he has a unibrow sometimes.

49
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
No, dude, he just has a pterodactyl beak and the horn thing on the back of his head, but

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
it's like normal.

51
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,120
It just looks like that, alright?

52
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
It's cuz he's Irish.

53
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
It's cuz his name.

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Oh.

55
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,120
But yeah, we're here with young Thomas.

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
He's looking good.

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
He's got the eyebrows.

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
He clearly just got his beard trimmed.

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
Do you trim your own beard or do you have a guy do it?

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,120
I shaved my beard off like four or five days ago.

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
And it just grows in like that?

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
That's like a perfect black guy beard.

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,960
Yeah, it doesn't like fill in in the cheeks at all.

65
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
It's just a chin strip.

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,800
I thought that was a style that you were choosing.

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
Whoa, yeah, that looks very, very clean.

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,320
It's incredible, dude.

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Every piece of hair on your face is perfect.

70
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm gonna take your hair.

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Sven is also pointing out different things about Thomas' appearance.

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Yeah, over on an audio show.

73
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Yeah, we're gonna do this for an hour.

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
No one can see.

75
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:10,320
This is, uh, this entire episode is gonna be me just, like, slowly trying to convince him to, like, donate follicles to me.

76
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Yeah.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
For a transplant.

78
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
I would love to get just, like, my shitty...

79
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I could give you some of mine.

80
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:25,320
My shitty, wiry, Italian hair in the back, and then right where I'm going bald, just like Thomas's eyebrows just stacked on top of each other like an equal sign.

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
That would look good, dude.

82
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Yeah.

83
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,320
So, what's life like in Texas right now?

84
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,320
It's... I mean, it's not too bad. Like, it's hot everywhere else, but it's not like hotter than usual here, you know?

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah, I meant the weather. That's what I meant.

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Yeah.

87
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,760
Yeah, I was getting to the weather, yeah. So it's hot there.

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Cool. Yeah.

89
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Nothing else going on. It's just nice and...

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Yeah, so there's cowboys.

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Is that Texas heat?

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Yeah.

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,080
Yeah, what is it like having to... You already... COVID is one thing, but having to battle Indians

94
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,520
every day, does that get annoying?

95
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Yeah.

96
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,160
Which side did you take in the cowboy Indian war?

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
Yeah.

98
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,880
I would love to be an Indian and just wear paint all over myself. I assume they still

99
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
do that.

100
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
Yeah.

101
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,440
You should try to rub your eyebrows off thinking they were face paint.

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,880
Bone Tomahawk was based off the life of Thomas.

103
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,160
It was originally called Bone Thomas Hawk, but they had to change the name because it

104
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
was going to suit him.

105
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
That's his Indian name.

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
It was a very different movie.

107
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
It was called Bone Thomas.

108
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Bone Thomas.

109
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Yeah.

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,560
It was a completely different movie and then they rewrote the script to make it not a porno.

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Yeah.

112
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,860
They still had the scene where the guy holds the guy by his legs upside down and pulls

113
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,580
them apart but it ended a completely different way.

114
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,100
The original version.

115
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,580
Thomas, has anyone asked you to do porn yet?

116
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,340
Uh, no.

117
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,340
Have people asked you, Caleb?

118
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,340
You mean considering the proposition?

119
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,340
People have asked me to do...

120
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,980
People have asked me to do OnlyFans quite a lot, actually.

122
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,460
Well, that, yeah, but...

123
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,740
I consider that porn.

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,740
On 50.

125
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Yeah, I guess.

126
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,740
That's what I think porn is.

127
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,500
Yeah, my problem with that is that I only have a gaming chair in my room, so like, in terms

128
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,740
of poses and stuff like that, like I...

129
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,980
You're relegated to sitting in a chair as you pose.

130
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,500
I'm not doing that standing up, I mean, come on now.

131
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,900
Nah, it's about, you gotta work the angles.

132
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,780
You want me to exercise for a living now?

133
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Geez.

134
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah, I feel like you could make a good chunk of change on OnlyFans, but you, the thing is

135
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,880
you give away too much on the on the Twitter you give away too much you have

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,480
to be shirtless photos already yeah people got that free I've got the whole

137
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,800
other in though to work with I guess I guess that's the only thing I could get

138
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
offer really Michael Rappaport could start a and only fans with that

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,160

and he just plays Shook Ones non-stop and I battle rap Thomas's penis.

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,480
He printed out like 20 copies of the of the penis photo and put him in

151
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,600
envelopes and was like giving to his family and was like if I

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,600
the ones with those windows over it like the bill in the club so he's given his

154
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,900

157
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,800

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,280
because... We meant to have you on that week, but we had Felix on. I think I asked you. I

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,240
don't remember. My internet ended up crashing that afternoon and then I sort

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,840
of found some other stuff out. Dude, you got DDoS'd by Rampaport. But he had like a burner account on

161
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,080
Instagram. Oh my god. It was clearly, it was like some college girl in a bikini and she

162
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,680
kept replying to like all my posts like Rappaport has your photo and he's gonna

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,800
to him kind of because he was being mean to Emma, right?

Emily, yeah.

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Emily, yeah.

169
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,440
Well, I introduced it like I had dirt on her.

170
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,440
That's how I got her to talk.

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,320
I didn't realize that's how you got it.

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Yeah.

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,840
So I said I used to, I told him that I used to work at a restaurant with her and he was

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,760

175
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,780
list. Yeah, what's on, who's on your hit list? I feel like you're plugging rain

216
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,700
every time you drink a sip of this. Rain? You mean the delicious energy drink that

217
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,820
leaves me not fatigued at all and just with a delicious rush? No, everybody knows

218
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,740
that about rain and bang. It's just a pure crisp high, no calm down at all.

219
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,820
Yeah. There's no, there's no like you sitting in your bedroom just kind of

220
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,380
looking at the ceiling. Yeah. Because you drank it on a day where you didn't work

221
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,220
out or anything and you never like you never vibrate free of the third

222
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,020
dimension and like see something that sees you back and just keeps following

223
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,540
you for the rest of your life just because you never there's a guy in your

224
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,140
house because you heard like the door in the apartment next to you unlock yeah

225
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,060
for me then the entire time I drink like a high energy or high like caffeine

226
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,300
content energy drink it's just me thinking I have to shit and then going

227
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,300
to the bathroom and then just like farting and pissing yeah oh no I'm

228
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm actually it actually this actually raised my vibrational levels high enough that I can perceive the ghost that's fucking my ass right now

229
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Yeah, it's doing it all the time

230
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,800
But the only time you can tell is when you have enough energy to notice it when you raise your raise your energy signature high

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,780
enough

232
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
What'd you guys do if you were ghost man?

233
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,040
I asked this earlier if you were if you were God would you go to the girls locker room and like take a peek?

234
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,720
Because also the thing is if you're God everything that you do is is fine. Yeah, you know

235
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
So it wouldn't even be morally wrong at that point

236
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,280
It'd be like looking at a sandwich you made

237
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,040
in the sandwich locker room

238
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,500
If your sandwiches were alive

239
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,740
Yeah, if you're beautiful pussies and big fat titties and they were barely 18

240
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,540
Would you go look at the sandwiches in the pantry?

241
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,460
It's just a question

242
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,700
It's a theological question.

243
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,620
Pat, you're so afraid of sex.

244
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
It's about Christ.

245
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
You're so afraid of sex.

246
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,060
That's why I had sex positive icon Thomas on.

247
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,540
We're trying to fix you, man.

248
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,180
You're too much of a Puritan, dude.

249
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,140
Thomas, your video where you were pretending like you were eating pussy was making me laugh

250
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
so hard.

251
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,860
So I pulled it, I was looking at it and I just couldn't stop laughing.

252
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,140
Do you have any tips, man?

253
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,580
You really don't want to think about it too much.

254
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,100
You just try and don't look her in the eyes or anything like that.

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Yeah.

256
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Because that's going to mess you up.

257
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,900
You just pretend it's like a Krabby Patty or something.

258
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
Like the little candy versions.

259
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Like the gummy ones?

260
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Yeah, the gummy ones.

261
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,620
You got to stay in the pocket.

262
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,620
Yeah.

263
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,220
Just know your place, you know.

264
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Lose yourself.

265
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
Yeah.

266
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
Yeah.

267
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,660
And also use your nose to hit the clay.

268
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,140
I try and make it good for either one of you.

269
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,820
Just get it over with.

270
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,020
Yeah, it's basically, just set a timer.

271
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,260
You might as well just be sitting next to her.

272
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,860
It's just, there's 10 minutes,

273
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,220
there's 10 minutes before you can come

274
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,220
and you have to just do something.

275
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,360
It's like watching a movie, you know?

276
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
Yeah. Yeah.

277
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,660
What I like to do is I like to, with one hand,

278
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,080
I have like a two-handed technique.

279
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,460
With one hand, I do a little, you know,

280
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,100
a little top of the, top of the,

281
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,740
I do some clit action with my left hand.

282
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,340
With my right hand, I show her a video on my phone

283
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,340
to distract her from how bad I am at this.

284
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
You know?

285
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,440
- Yeah, look close. - I'm like, check this out.

286
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,180
Look, this kid puts a remote in his ass and screams

287
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,780
'cause he's so mad.

288
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,620
Isn't that funny?

289
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,500
- No, this is the part.

290
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,340
Look, look right here.

291
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
- Okay, your turn.

292
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,460
(laughing)

293
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,660
- Look, this is-- - That's the ultimate,

294
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,900
that's God's ultimate trick.

295
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,820
Eating pussy, always bad for both of you.

296
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,900
Having your dick sucked is never bad.

297
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,300
'Cause it's always kinda funny.

298
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,940
It's a trick of sound.

299
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,540
'Cause I was like, "I have my dick in a face right now.

300
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,040
"That's kinda funny."

301
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,980
Yeah.

302
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,380
Yeah, I'm basically a master of sex.

303
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,100
Yeah, I'm always imagining that my dick is a microphone

304
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,180
and that the girl is doing a stand-up show.

305
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,820
And the girl is Howard Stern.

306
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,860
Yeah.

307
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,500
And I'm Robin.

308
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,140
And I'm the audio engineer.

309
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,660
Goddamn, I wish Howard Stern would suck me off.

310
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,500
Yeah, I got some private parts for you

311
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:51,540
to put in your mouth Howard. How's that? Did you see his dick in that movie? I don't

312
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,220
think you do. No? Kind of false advertising. Yeah kind of a misleading. I'm suing

313
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,120
I'm suing Howard Stern for false advertising. I'm suing the the Empire State

314
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,520
Building for covering his penis on the cover of private parts. Not enough private

315
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,320
parts in that movie. Yeah I agree. Thomas are you a you a Stern guy or an

That's a wild story.

I don't remember the rest of it.

345
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, no, a lot of people were very mad.

346
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,680
Like a lot of like the kids, like the house show kids did not like me after that.

347
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Yeah.

348
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,400
"Now she's locked!"

349
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Yeah.

350
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,080
that that list that was that's been going around of all those DIY bands but then

351
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,000
Patrick's name is on there and it just says thanks Casey Anthony is innocent

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,960
something I think I said Casey Anthony innocent free the Menendez brothers

353
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,040
something I love about every Patrick story is that it follows the Joseph

354
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,280
Campbell like myth outline yeah pattern you know where it's like a hero's

355
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,000
journey you know there's a clear beginning middle and end yeah there's a

356
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,840
there's a climax, it ends on a strong note.

357
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,080
- Yeah.

358
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,920
Well yeah, you gotta--

359
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,240
- Some guy always appreciates you as a storyteller.

360
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,080
- It's like that book--

361
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,920
- You should go on The Moth and tell stories.

362
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,480
(laughing)

363
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
- What's The Moth?

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,000
- Moth is like this show, it's like a storytelling show

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,760
where everybody talks about their dead daughter,

366
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,520
or the one video I saw.

367
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,080
And it would just be you going up and you'd be like,

368
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
man, my brother has a bike and--

369
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,400
(laughing)

370
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,320
He actually fell on it twice.

371
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,820
Yeah, and then I said what the hell are you doing? And then you be like, sorry man. I had I had six bud bud heavies

372
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Which is exactly how you do stand up yeah

373
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm so sorry guys. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I'm

374
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,700
Apologize when I do stand up you apologize after you record a podcast episode or a stream

375
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,600
Then where you get drunk or in the middle? Yeah, you'll be like, oh my god. I'm so sorry guys. I have a headache

376
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,120
I had half an Advil four days ago, and it's just like really messed up my brain. Yeah

377
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,780
Yeah, I tried to eat before 1 p.m.. And it really fucked me up

378
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:14,440
And now the only thing I can think about is which video game cartridges I played when I was 9 years old sorry guys

379
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,520
Yeah, I

380
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
Never I bet if you start eating breakfast

381
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,260
It'll like restore your memory, and you'll have some you'll be able to like add ends to your stories and stuff

382
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,820
Maybe I don't Patrick eats breakfast once gets a perfectly square

383
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:37,340
Today I did breakfast sandwich was on it. Yeah, let's hear it lunch food. I bet it was a spaghetti breakfast

384
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,260
It was just egg and beyond sausage sandwich. I'm eating so yeah

385
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,420
Dude, that's why that's why everything's fucked up in your head. Yeah, so that's so it's why you went twisted

386
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,040
Well, I counter I counterbalanced it by eating a bunch of peppered beef jerky. So

387
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Wow, yin and yang dude.

388
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Yeah.

389
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Incredible.

390
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
What's your diet been like Thomas?

391
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
Yeah, what have you been eating?

392
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,160
Well, I just got a George Foreman grill.

393
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,320
Oh, I saw that tilapia you grilled.

394
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
That's huge.

395
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Did you guys ever...

396
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,480
Hey Cameron, you want to steal my next story too?

397
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,280
Yeah, dude, no, go ahead, start it.

398
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,560
Let's do it.

399
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,840
I've been just eating normal for the most part.

400
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,160
I thought I had coronavirus for like a week and then my test came back negative.

401
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Nice.

402
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,160
That's a bummer, dude.

403
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, dude, I'd already told like 200 people I had it.

404
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
You're already bragging.

405
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Yeah.

406
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
You're already like, "Dude, that's the thing about that test.

407
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,320
You take the test because you only take it thinking you have it.

408
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,600
And then for the two days that you wait, you're just telling everybody like, "Yeah, I pretty

409
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,920
much have it and I'm fine and I'm surviving."

410
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,760
And then you're like in the middle of watching like eight hours of movies and then you get

411
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,960
the test back and it's like you don't even have this thing.

412
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Yeah.

413
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,320
And you're like, "What have I been doing for two days?"

414
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Yeah, man.

415
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,560
Near the beginning of all this, I was having like a ton of trouble breathing and it turned

416
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,720
out I just have trouble breathing.

417
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,920
I thought I had corona when we went to New York.

418
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,600
Yeah, I've been having erectile dysfunction and I think it's probably from the coronavirus.

419
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,400
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to stick one of those swabs up my pee hole though to test for it.

420
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
I think this is a new type.

421
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,080
Did you guys ever get into that growing up?

422
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,640
Exploring your body and putting pencil lead in your penis?

423
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
No.

424
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
No?

425
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
I can't say I did.

426
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,840
I read that Chuck Palahniuk story, Guts.

427
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,080
And he talks about putting pencil lead in his dick and jacking off with it.

428
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,600
And so I was like, you know what, I like to try, I'm an adventurer, I'm like Andrew Zimmer

429
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,320
from the Food Network show.

430
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
So I like-

431
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,600
You're an alcoholic?

432
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,720
So I like put, I tried putting pencil lead in the tip of my penis and it's like the worst

433
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
pain I ever felt.

434
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,480
Why would you put that pencil- I mean I got like a quarter of a centimeter in and I was

435
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,200
like that Chuck motherfucker's weird.

436
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Yeah, that's one crazy phrase.

437
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I just threw it away.

438
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,800
Actually no, I remember I put the pencil lead back in the pencil.

439
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,440
It was like a mechanical pencil.

440
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Nice dude.

441
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,960
Yeah, I don't know if it ever saw the light of day.

442
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,320
What a crazy moment for me when I was a kid like getting sent to fight club and then I

443
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,640
I find out the guy who wrote Fight Club is gay puts a whole new spin on the whole book.

444
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,960
Yeah, it's like yeah, maybe they weren't fighting each other after all maybe that was a metaphor

445
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,520
Exactly. Yeah, no wonder he had Brad Pitt in the movie

446
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,560
It's a good. Yeah. No. Yeah, there's two guys are the main character. Oh my god, dude

447
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,600
It's it's like at the end. It's the exact same storyline, but at the end he puts the gun to his head

448
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
And it's a pink gun instead

449
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,520
Exactly, yeah

450
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,660
I'm trying to think. I used to, there was a period where I loved like all those like

451
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,760
those like gross out short stories growing up. Man I love Chuck Palahniuk

452
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,840
still. I'll go to bat for him. I think he's a really good writer.

453
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,120
I'll go to bat with you. My favorite gross out short story is Chuck Berry's

454
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,360
The transcript of Chuck Berry's sex tape. Chuck Berry's sex tape transcript.

455
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,320
Sec tape. Sec tape. Sec tape. Where he says you can smell my fart. Are you wise to this Thomas?

456
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Have you seen that?

457
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,320
No, is it the same Chuck Berry who like filmed women in the bathroom?

458
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Yeah.

459
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
And sang rock and roll?

460
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Yeah, I was listening to rock and roll.

461
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,320
The Chuck Berry sex tape, he farts in a girl's face and he says, "You're gonna smell my fart."

462
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
No, no, no, he doesn't fart in her face.

463
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
His penis is like an inch from her face and he's peeing on her.

464
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,320
And then he farts and he's like, "You like that, bitch?"

465
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
And she's like, "Yeah, I love that."

466
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,680
Because you can't just stop there, you're getting your face pissed on.

467
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Like, it'd be crazy to draw the line.

468
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Well, there's another...

469
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I would leave the room.

470
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
I would say no.

471
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
I would say no, I don't like that.

472
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,600
You would get to that point, though.

473
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,320
You would get to the point where Chuck Berry's pissing on your face.

474
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
Of course I would, but I would say, if I didn't like it, I would say so.

475
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
But you gotta be honest.

476
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,080
You're not gonna do anything about it, but you are gonna be honest about the fact...

477
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
This man's saying my dingaling, so...

478
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
That's true, man.

479
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,880
You're gonna let him pee on you.

480
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
I can't wait to get to that point, dude.

481
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,880
What? To say where you sing my ding-a-ling?

482
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
Where I can fucking fart on a woman.

483
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
You can? Like, pretty much?

484
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I can, no.

485
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,880
No, that's an expensive... that's either like the most expensive prostitute or the cheapest prostitute in the world. We'll let you do that.

486
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,880
No, you can just fart on a woman on the train and not...

487
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Oh, I've done that, yeah.

488
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,880
I do remember one time, like, farting on the train and there was a guy... a guy was like...

489
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,600
Like I was standing and he was sitting down and he was eating a sandwich and I like basically

490
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,320
farted on his sandwich.

491
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
He loved it dude.

492
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
He was like, "There's something about this sandwich."

493
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
He smells it and it's amazing.

494
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I think my sandwich just leveled up.

495
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,400
He had a subway sub and he's just standing there and then he smells it and then he just

496
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,440
like deep throats the whole sub.

497
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Just immediately.

498
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Just eats it like Scooby Doo.

499
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah man.

500
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
But uh, yeah I like having sex basically.

501
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,280
That's what I'm saying.

502
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,960
Even with Chuck Berry.

503
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Couldn't be me.

504
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Yeah.

505
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Couldn't be me.

506
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Hey man.

507
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
You're too tough.

508
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm too tough.

509
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Couldn't be me.

510
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Show that kind of vulnerability.

511
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
You're like Ryan Gosling from Drive.

512
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Yeah.

513
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Dude I wish.

514
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Autistic.

515
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Did you know that song.

516
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
Completely non-verbal.

517
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
You're right.

518
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,460
you're right you know that song the song in that movie where there's where it's

519
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,640
like a real hero a real human being do you know that's about that's only

520
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:46,140
someone's song what yeah somebody said that or that's true like the I mean I

521
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,680
mean I'll look it up now I saw somebody saying it's the band that did that song they

522
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:56,160
say they did like a genius verified yeah I'm googling it right now you guys talk

523
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,120
about how autistic I am more. I was googling a song in the middle of the episode. I feel

524
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:09,120
like that's a pretty cool case. Yeah, I just googled it. It is about Sully's Burger.

525
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,440
This is the guy from Monsters Inc. Yeah. He was a hero in that movie. Yeah, but he was

526
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,760
not a real human being. You know who was not a hero? Randall. What a mean... That guy was

527
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:29,100
a real rascal. He's a monster. Oh my god, wait. He was a monster. I think that might be why

528
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,120
they called him Monsters Inc. is because of how evil he was, that one character. No, it

529
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,280
was, he's, his monster's pink because he's the pink monster. Yeah. He's purple though.

530
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,120
No. Yeah. You're colorblind. He has like a thousand legs too, you guys notice that? He's

531
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
got one, he's got two legs. The other one's blue and furry? What the hell's going on on

532
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,740
this movie make the monsters look the same they can't be the same thing thing

533
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,740
monsters if they're look yeah that's true what what if there is the same

534
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,220
variance in humans well I guess it kind of is like me and Thomas don't look like

535
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:07,140
the same species no no we aren't no we're completely did we have like just a

536
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,380
different genome yeah Thomas looks like if if you combined all three of us but

537
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:20,000
not like take the average just like overlaid each of us just Thomas looks

538
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,120
like a fucking like like three guys in one I mean it look he looks like pieces

539
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:36,440
of like magazines cut out to make a guy's face like a show yeah yeah I look

540
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,260
like Jim Carrey yeah you look exactly I've said this for a very long time you

541
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,140
looks so much like Jim Carrey. And Cam looks like Jim Carrey's girlfriend.

542
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:51,460
No. We're gonna see what happens when we put you in a room together.

543
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,820
We put Jim Carrey and a girl in a bottle of pills in a room. Here's what happens.

544
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,340
I bet he would make some crazy faces. Oh my god.

545
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,980
Pat, what the hell are you eating? Nothing.

546
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,780
I can hear that you're crinkling up your bag. Put it down.

547
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,780
it down. What are you eating? Cheese-its? You can't eat cheese-its while we're recording.

548
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:19,780
You can't go 30 more minutes without eating cheese-its? I didn't eat lunch. Me neither.

549
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:28,780
Oh my god. Oh fuck. Are you still working Thomas? Not really. Every now and then I'll get a

550
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:34,900
landscaping gig but I just yesterday worked for the first time in like a month. Nice,

551
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
How did it feel to be out there again?

552
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,340
It actually kind of sucked because it was...

553
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,340
Landscaping sucked?

554
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Oh yeah, dude.

555
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,460
I had to do it like...

556
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,580
This flower bed had been flooded for like six months so it was like sewer water basically.

557
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
You had to do it all out.

558
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
It was fun.

559
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,740
You had to suck it up with a big straw?

560
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
Yeah.

561
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
Yeah.

562
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,740
That's what happened.

563
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,740
Did you use some of your techniques?

564
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Yeah.

565
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Yeah.

566
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
He uses landscape techniques.

567
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,140
Yeah, he uses landscape techniques when he eats pussy too.

568
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Yeah, hold up, let me get my straw.

569
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,140
He goes both ways.

570
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,140
Hold on, I need a tiny shovel.

571
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Yeah, let me get the weed whacker.

572
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,140
Shorty, I'm gonna destroy that pussy.

573
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,140
Let me get a weed whacker.

574
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
This pussy's been flooded for six months.

575
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
It's full of seawater.

576
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Is that the sound a weed whacker makes?

577
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm gonna have to extract it.

578
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
I'm gonna have to extract it.

579
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,140
I'm gonna have to extract it.

580
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:42,060
was like sounds like this yeah sounds like Thomas I think you did that so loud

581
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,340
that the audio just cut in the zoo that's what it's like yeah hmm but I'm

582
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:56,020
glad so you're you're back to work so Texas how are the parents I don't know

583
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,100
anything about your life I know that you have a job you're like one of the guys

584
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:19,620
I

585
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
I've never been a landscaper. I used to work for a structure.

586
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Yeah, I didn't know that either.

587
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
I assumed you'd mowed a yard before.

588
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
I never have actually.

589
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
I had a...

590
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
I had a fucking push mower at my house.

591
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
One of those ones from like cartoons.

592
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
My stepdad at some point got into like

593
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
owning a scythe.

594
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Dude, I had one of those too at my house.

595
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
You could use it to cut the weeds.

596
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
You hit the weeds out of the ground with it.

597
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Sick as fuck.

598
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Was he like the angel of death or something?

599
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,620
Yeah, my stepdad's actually the angel of death.

600
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,620
It always sucked growing up having him around.

601
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,620
There was always like a low hum every time he walked into a room.

602
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
It sucked, man.

603
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
It was a bummer.

604
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:06,620
We had like a scythe and then he was like, "This is too hard. Let me get one of those push mowers that have no gas and don't work."

605
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,620
Yeah, man.

606
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
You know?

607
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,620
Sounds like we had pretty similar lawn mowing experiences.

608
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Sounds like we had the same stepdad.

609
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
Yeah, we might have.

610
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Now that I think about it, my stepdad said he was the Grim Reaper.

611
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,920
And I think I thought it was a different person than the Angel of Death, but you know, I'm thinking it might be the same guy.

612
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Might be the same.

613
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,920
You show the big ass leg.

614
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,420
Oh, you have a lawnmower tattoo.

615
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:34,920
I always forget I have a lawnmower tattoo on my leg, and then I'll go to tie my shoes and I'm like, "Oh, it's a lawnmower."

616
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,920
It's always such a bummer when I see the tattoos that I have that suck.

617
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,920
And it's only ever when I'm naked, because they're all on my ass and around my dick.

618
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,060
And I'm like, "Why do I have like a...

619
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,360
Why do I have this swastika on my penis?"

620
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,280
It's a poor decision.

621
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,000
I have like a ghost on my ass cheek.

622
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,320
I have a...

623
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,080
Somebody tried to write the word Satan on me once while I was like passed out drunk

624
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,200
but then turned it into a flower but you still see the S and the A.

625
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,680
So I'm just reminding...

626
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,360
It's like Stana.

627
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,760
Yeah, it's San Antonio.

628
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,720
Nah man, I'm covered in terrible tattoos, so...

629
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,680
what's what's next trying to get

630
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,160
now you know what would you have not been trying to get one well tell me we get

631
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,760
people know you said a thousand times yesterday's dad's tattoo to make fun of

632
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,920
it and it's been a step to

633
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,080
you need to get his penis tattooed on you yet

634
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,000
now my dad and i have a rose that's been a sliver of the rose next to his penis

635
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
that's cool

636
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,240
you know i mean

637
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
it's going up and it's a little bit with a tattoo of

638
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,320
of his dad's penis on his forehead and being like "look at this dad, I got you good dude!"

639
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,720
I got you, you fucking loser.

640
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,760
Hey, nice dick, dad!

641
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,960
Now everyone knows what your dick looks like, dad.

642
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,960
Yeah.

643
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,640
Well, time to go to work!

644
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
Time to go back to the bank.

645
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Time to go.

646
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Yep.

647
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm in line at Chili's.

648
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,840
My, my, somebody got my, somebody got my brother's initials tattooed on, on them when they were

649
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,880
like teenagers with a crown on top they were like best friends because he died

650
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,120
and he did not die but they now they like now they hate each other so this guy has

651
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,840
my brother's initials on him with a crown tattooed on him forever but the

652
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:30,000
best part is that my brother's initials are JAP so this guy has on his arm

653
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,600
Jap with a crown on it. How do you, do you think he's covered it up at this point?

654
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,600
No I saw him recently because he works at the same burrito place in my hometown.

655
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,560
But wouldn't you just get JP? Yeah because I, because he needs to make sure

656
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,200
that no one thinks he's talking about Jamaica Plain. Yeah the neighborhood in

657
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,600
Boston that's a good point. Yeah or Jeff Bridges. So he had to get the A.

658
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Oh, people would think that it was a giant penis.

659
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Or Japanese people.

660
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Yeah, exactly.

661
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,600
He wanted to make sure that people didn't think he was talking about Japanese people.

662
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah, exactly. JP, Japanese people.

663
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,600
But now he does, since he hates my brother, they had a big falling out.

664
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
He does have to just make something up.

665
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
For what they fall out of.

666
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
They fell out of a plane together.

667
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Yeah, they went skydiving.

668
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
That's a little too clever for us.

669
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
We'd like to go for more lowbrow stuff.

670
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,920
more lowbrow stuff. Can you tone it down dude? You're doing some NPR shit. Come on David Sedaris,

671
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,400
we just fucking, we just cool it. If there's a line I'm gonna cross it you know that. Just

672
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:44,600
like Sedaris. Sedaris is basically the king of sting, you know? In the humorous world.

673
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:50,360
Yeah. Dude that guy's nasty. That guy. You don't want to get on his bad side. No. Nah

674
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,960
He's a sharpshooter. He's like Geraldo, Patrice, David Sedaris.

675
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,800
Geraldo, Patrice, David Sedaris, Mo Rocca.

676
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,520
David Sedaris would have been so funny on the roasts, dude.

677
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,960
Dude, yeah. I mean, you just gotta watch out because he's gonna...

678
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,840
If you cross him, he's gonna write a 30-page story about his childhood

679
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,520
where something awkward happened.

680
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,680
And he's gonna add you in as a character for one paragraph.

681
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
Yeah, he's gonna own you.

682
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,460
Yeah, dude.

683
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,720
It would have been great in like the new style of roasts where nobody actually does any jokes

684
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,160
and they just all do the same bit where they like say "fuck it"

685
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,400
Roasts are weird.

686
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,320
Yeah, so annoying.

687
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,440
Yeah, so roasts are weird.

688
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:38,920
Back in the day it used to be like, I mean, yeah, Lisa Lampanelli just being like absurdly racist

689
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:44,040
and now you have Andy Samberg going, I'd be like "nooo, this is so weird"

690
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,920
*weird noises*

691
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
I get the song, Sandberg!

692
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,920
And that's in order.

693
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Yeah.

694
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Z's walking around, roasting all the women with his hands.

695
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
Tiny, tiny hands.

696
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,920
The only fun part of the roasts at this point is just seeing how bad Jeff Ross can look.

697
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Yeah. It's just worse every time.

698
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
I mean, I think it's better, dude.

699
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,920
It's crazy that he went from like, he had like giant braids to just like the baldest guy in the world.

700
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,480
the world. I think what's actually going on is they're making a boyhood style

701
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:24,440
remake of the fly where they're following him around in his life.

702
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:30,120
Just over the course of years. Yeah Jeff Ross is just like a like a puddle of

703
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,040
ectoplasmic goo by the next rose. Yeah they're like we need another Jeff to

704
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,720
play a fly. I think they actually I think Jeff doesn't go on anymore I

705
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,760
I think he was labeled too mean.

706
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,960
Too much like a fly.

707
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,560
Too fly looking.

708
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,960
I think, or too easy maybe.

709
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,000
They were just like, yeah, it's distracting to have him in the audience.

710
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:01,360
In like five years he's just like a gray puddle with box braids.

711
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,520
The first day I moved here to New Hampshire I saw a white kid with box braids in his car.

712
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
So sick dude.

713
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,960
it's like fine yeah I wouldn't in New Hampshire I would never care about

714
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,360
something like that you busy battling the outlaws who are trying to steal my

715
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:24,720
son yeah yeah yeah I'm a white person with dreads in New Hampshire that's just

716
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,240
your teacher yeah that's like that's like them there's like the most woke guy

717
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,320
in New Hampshire yeah yeah and every New Hampshire town there's at least three

718
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,920
people three like just different people who live on opposite sides of town that

719
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,760
look exactly like a borderland psycho.

720
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,440
- Yeah. (laughing)

721
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,520
There's a dude who has a bunker in the woods.

722
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,520
He has a picket fence that's the size of his house.

723
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,880
And he's got a keep out sign on the front of it.

724
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
It's so sick, I wanna see what his house looks like.

725
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,400
- We should definitely come up and shoot some guns soon.

726
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
- Yeah, that'd be cool.

727
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,720
- That'd be fun.

728
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,960
Thomas, do you own a gun?

729
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:09,040
Uh, no.

730
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
That's what I like to hear.

731
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,640
No, I've never owned one.

732
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Nice.

733
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,840
If you did own one, what kind would it be?

734
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,000
Probably a Mossberg 12 gauge and a 30/30 lever action.

735
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Nice.

736
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,720
I'd probably have like a giant laser beam gun.

737
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,440
I would get the Spartan laser personally.

738
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,720
I'd have a cooler gun than that one.

739
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,680
I would actually, I would probably train the Devastator from Transformers Revenge of the

740
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,200
Fallen to kind of be my pet and my like attack dog, but it's, you know, it's all, it's

741
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,000
kind of to each their own, you know, if you just want like a...

742
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,080
I'd probably get guns implanted in my arms.

743
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,920
Yeah, I'd probably just become Superman, so...

744
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,520
I'd get Liberty Prime's laser.

745
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Probably use my car like a gun.

746
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Yeah.

747
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,120
Yeah, I'd probably have a giant gun that shoots cars, but you know, it's no big deal.

748
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Whoa.

749
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Yeah.

750
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,520
And never mind, I'd choose Cameron's gun.

751
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,520
I'd probably have a Swiss Army knife, that's all I'd need.

752
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Yeah, I'd actually just need one long... I'd need a shark tooth.

753
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,520
I could actually do it with a single hair. I could actually kill any intruder

754
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
with one strand of hair. A dental floss, even if you tie

755
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,520
my hands around my back with a dental floss, I'll still kill anybody.

756
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I pretty much just need some air, if I blow the air in the right way, it works like a bullet.

757
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,520
That's pretty much all I'd need. I just need a big frying pan and a dress.

758
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,340
and I can chase him in and out of my house over and over again whenever the clock strikes

759
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
the hour.

760
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,120
I don't know.

761
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,920
It's just easy for me.

762
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,040
Did I ever tell you guys about my...

763
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,080
No, I feel like I've talked about this.

764
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,320
My grandpa just guns...

765
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
I'm talking about my guns.

766
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm talking about...

767
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Not my guns.

768
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I don't have any guns.

769
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Talking about guns made me think about my grandpa who is just obsessed with destroying

770
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
ISIS.

771
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,720
Have I talked about him before?

772
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
No, I don't think so.

773
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,480
My grandpa, he pitched me, when he found out that I was like working in like entertainment

774
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,660
as far as he knows, he was like, "Well, I got a movie pitch for you."

775
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,660
He's from New Jersey.

776
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,660
He was like, "Yeah, I got a movie pitch for you."

777
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:09,480
So basically, it would be like a team of guys, right?

778
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:19,800
And they would basically be retaliating against ISIS by going into Afghanistan and killing

779
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,800
every single person they see.

780
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:30,160
Through whatever it is, car bombs, IEDs, crossbows, they basically kill every single person in

781
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,840
every member of ISIS's family, extended as well, everyone in their hometowns, and it

782
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,320
would be like, that's how they stop terrorism.

783
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,800
And I was just like, Grant, you just pitched ISIS to me.

784
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,480
You just pitched doing the exact same thing.

785
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Good ISIS.

786
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,360
Yeah, but just like with no like not even like a political motivation.

787
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,860
Yeah.

788
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,760
It's just like still mad about 9/11.

789
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,440
It's just like get over it, you know what I mean?

790
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,940
Yeah.

791
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,840
Well, he was there when it happened.

792
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,440
Yeah, that's true.

793
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,000
No, he wasn't.

794
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,680
He was there when 9/11 happened, dude.

795
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,880
He fell off the guard tower.

796
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,520
Let's fucking go!

797
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,040
Let's go!

798
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,480
Let's go!

799
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,160
Yeah, he is in ISIS.

800
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,720
I mean it would be so funny for me to come home and be a white Muslim to him.

801
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,760
Like I wonder like what he would do.

802
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
Your head's so bald but you have like Arabic tattooed all over it.

803
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,240
Yeah I mean literally I mean I can just wear like... Caleb mathematics.

804
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,840
Khaleeb mathematics.

805
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,720
People do spell my name Khaleeb sometimes.

806
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,040
They'll do K-A-L-I-B on the Grubhub order

807
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,880
and then I get there and they're like, "Ah this is..." Hold on.

808
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,240
When you see that, that's the best feeling that you have in your life.

809
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,480
It's amazing. Yeah, I'm like, "You're right, I am Khalid."

810
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,400
You know, his name used to be just DJ Caleb before he made it big.

811
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,080
Yeah, Jedi Mind Caleb.

812
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,720
No, I would love to do that, man. I might be like a white t-shirt,

813
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:14,000
like white Muslim guy. I would just wear like a triple XL, white tee, shave my head completely

814
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,640
bald get like some like terrible script tattoos and just have like a very young

815
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:27,960
girlfriend I feel like it would work for me yeah yeah start a patreon just for me

816
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,800
yeah start messages start privately messaging all of the fans of the

817
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,040
podcast me like delete your pledge to the pod I need to make my trip to Mecca

818
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,800
I have to make my trip to Mecca.

819
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Yeah.

820
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,920
I don't know, I think it would work.

821
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah dude.

822
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,640
You just show up to your ISIS grandpa's house and you're wearing just like a burqa.

823
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Yeah.

824
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,520
You're wearing like the wrong outfit.

825
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
Yeah.

826
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,880
Hey guess what grandpa, I'm also a girl now so try that one on for size.

827
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm trans and Muslim.

828
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
God dude, I mean he would have a...

829
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
You'd just give your grandpa a heart attack.

830
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,840
It wouldn't be a heart attack dude.

831
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,560
It wouldn't be hard, his head would explode like scanners.

832
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Yeah.

833
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,820
Like that's exactly what would happen.

834
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,640
I would walk in, he would see me, even if he didn't know it was me, his head would explode.

835
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,440
Just seeing like a Muslim woman, his shit would be completely rocked.

836
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,120
Yeah, dude.

837
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
Yeah.

838
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,160
I don't know, I definitely want to change religions though.

839
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
Yeah?

840
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,920
What religion are you right now?

841
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,920
Bahai.

842
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,600
It's getting expensive.

843
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,200
Yeah.

844
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,120
Yeah, yeah, which one would you choose?

845
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,200
I mean, I know you were talking about going Catholic before.

846
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
I was never, no, I mean--

847
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
No, you were.

848
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,280
Catholic is too many rules.

849
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
I would need basically,

850
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,080
I would basically start a new religion, I think.

851
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,040
All right, let's hear it.

852
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,740
Yeah, so I'm God,

853
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,840
and that would be it.

854
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,140
So you'd be starting Branch Calebians.

855
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,200
Yes.

856
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,040
Is that what happened?

857
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,080
Did David start the Branch Davidians?

858
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,920
Was it a guy named David?

859
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,080
I don't think he started them,

860
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,180
But yeah, there's all their like Messiah is always named David or something like that.

861
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,180
Well, David's from the Bible. I think that yeah.

862
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,180
David's from-

863
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,580
His name was Branch and then he just started-

864
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,980
I've talked about this, but there is a guy in my hometown named Branch.

865
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,280
His name is Branch Leevold.

866
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,180
The only path for a guy named Branch in life is to start like a murder cult.

867
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,280
Like that's the only thing you can do.

868
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,780
Like you'll just get laughed out of any career.

869
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,980
Or you become a white rapper named Twiggy.

870
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
That's true.

871
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,900
In the case of the guy who lives in my hometown named Branch Leaf Olive.

872
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,980
That's such an easy name to find, too.

873
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,980
So anyone who listens can go find that guy.

874
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,980
It's so funny.

875
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
I mean, they've tried.

876
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,220
I remember we talked about him before and people couldn't find him.

877
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,220
People found like a different guy named...

878
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,500
Dude, his name is Branch Leaf Olive.

879
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
You think he's on the grid?

880
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,980
No, dude, he's living in a tree somewhere.

881
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:57,060
That guy is not in the fucking, in the yellow pages.

882
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,820
The government doesn't know he exists.

883
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,820
Yeah.

884
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,580
They saw his name on the NSA spreadsheet and they're like, "Oh, looks like we got another

885
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:10,900
error. This must be anonymous. This is a placeholder name. We'll fill that in later.

886
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,340
Oh no, the census taker accidentally just looked at a tree again and thought it was a person.

887
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:24,260
Yeah man, I think he had like heroin addict parents or something, turned Christian,

888
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,180
and they were like, yeah we're just gonna name our kid the coolest thing of all time.

889
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:33,860
Yeah, what's the most beautiful name? Noah's Flood. That would be a good name

890
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:39,540
for a christian kid. What about what about genesis bible? Yeah what about jesus christ?

891
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,340
What's the deal? There's a lot a lot of like mexican catholics name their kid

892
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,980
jesus. Isn't that like is that cool? Absolutely. I think it's one of the coolest things. I mean

893
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,780
it's definitely cool it's definitely cool but is it like is that allowed? Is that allowed with uh

894
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:01,140
the pope? I think they have a different pope. They have a they have el pope. It's just Gabriel Iglesias.

895
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:09,900
He wears a different... He does have disciples. He has like a... You know Gabriel Iglesias

896
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,140

897
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:26,860
that tour with him and they all just talk about being fat Mexicans. He just walked into a warehouse one day and everyone who worked there just started following him around.

898
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:32,980
yeah just like 50 fat Mexican dudes all doing jokes about their sister named

899
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Maria before he goes out yeah talks about food his one rules he's like don't talk

901
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,260
seen it maybe they do like a burlesque act to warm up the crowd I hope they do

902
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,560
I hope it's burlesque they're like they're like juggling like plates on

903
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,920
sticks like spinning them but all the plates have like a full meal.

904
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,520
Like a whole roast turkey.

905
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,920
Yeah but yeah man I think Pat you should definitely you might be able to glom on dude.

906
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,640
I might be able to join I don't think I'm fluffy enough.

907
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,040
No you're definitely not but that could be your thing you could be the skinny guy in the

908
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
fluffy gang.

909
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
That's true.

910
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,480
Right they can call you skinny P. Yeah.

911
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,800
I had a manager that only referred to me as Diddy,

912
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,680
'cause my initials were P.D.

913
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,200
So that turned, it went P.D., P. Diddy, then Diddy,

914
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,040
and then I quit.

915
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,120
- It's like the exact thing that happened to the real Diddy.

916
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,960
- I know.

917
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,320
(laughing)

918
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,360
He never went Puff Daddy though, I'm kinda mad.

919
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,480
- No, yeah, that's, which is the coolest one.

920
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
- Yeah, absolutely. - Any name with Puff in it,

923
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,400
- Yeah.

924
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,760
- Puff Thomas, it's got a nice ring to it.

925
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,360
Puff Tommy. You should rebrand. Yeah, Puff Tommy. Puff T.

926
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:04,960
Have you ever gone by Tommy? Um, no, because uh, I don't know. I didn't really realize you could

927
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,320
like pick your own nickname if you wanted to. I was like, I didn't think about it until I was like 17

928
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:15,520
and then I was already Thomas by then. So it's kind of late now. There was a like two weeks where

929
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,440
I decided, I decided to go by my middle name. Yeah, I did that too. I was like, yeah, I'm Michael.

930
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,720
yeah i was like fuck you do you know yeah i call that is a thing insane

931
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,360

932
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,560

933
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,140
holy shit

934
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,040
yet my best friend i don't know by the way i mean

935
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,780
his name is john but he went by alex

936
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,640
my name is uh... mohammed laura croft and third grade

937
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,200
i had a friend in middle school whose name was michael but everyone called him

938
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,800
bob and that was not as middle name i have no clue why they call them that

939
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,220
I don't even think he chose to go by it, I think everyone just called him that.

940
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,740
There was a point in middle school where I was like, "Yeah, I'm gonna be the guy who

941
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,060
gives people nicknames."

942
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,060
Yeah.

943
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,060
Yeah.

944
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
And I only got one off.

945
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:07,460
There was a guy named Duncan, and I got him, everybody called him "Dunkos" because of me.

946
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,460
There's a kid who I'm-

947
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:09,460
Yeah, he's just like a nerdy little kid.

948
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,860
There's a kid who in middle school, his name is Jack, and everyone called him "Muffin" in

949
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
middle school.

950
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,220
I don't know what the story behind that one was, but it like stuck around until high school

951
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,220
and he got really mad.

952
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,180
Oh shit, no, there was this kid at like the like the homeschool co-op

953
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,180
I went to in like ninth grade

954
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:30,580
Who his name was Samuel and he's just like really dorky little like loser who got into like Bitcoin

955
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,620
When like 2011 so he's probably rich now

956
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:40,120
He probably buy me but he his name was Samuel and I started calling him Sammy and then one day

957
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,860
I just called him sausage and then everybody there

958
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,280
So I started calling him sausage and then like the principal sent out like an email

959
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,400
There's like please stop referring to Samuel as sausage

960
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,040
And his mom teachers have to get involved with that. It's so funny there that happened at my school, too

961
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,640
With the kid whose name was Alex, but everyone called him Nubby

962
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:07,340
Eventually got so fucking mad after like oh, yeah, oh, I just there's a kid

963
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,640
There's two there's two kids who are the same name

964
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,860
There's two kids named Alex Augusto at our school and one of them was like really first and last name

965
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,920
Yeah, same first and last name.

966
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
That happened twice at my school.

967
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
There was two kids named Alex Augusto.

968
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
I think you had a glitch in the matrix there, dude.

969
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,920
Two kids named Alex Augusto and then two other kids in the same grade named Seamus Rio.

970
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,920
What the fuck?

971
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Which that's not fucking common.

972
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
That is not a fucking common name.

973
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Neither is Augusto.

974
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Yeah, but one of them was very tall and dark Italian.

975
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,920
I think he was probably Sicilian.

976
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,920
He finishes. Say he was handsome.

977
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,520
He was just very, he had just very dark skin and he was Italian and-

978
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,200
So that's not handsome to you?

979
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,000
*laughter*

980
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,080
Yeah, is that a problem?

981
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,600
No, he was busted.

982
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:54,840
But-

983
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,880
He was busted?

984
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,760
Oh my god.

985
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,280
Then the other Alex Augusta was like very short and fat and one day on the bus he was

986
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,720
going over someone else's house and like an older kid, this kid Hunter was trying to

987
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,400
get his attention and he was like, "What's his name, Alex?"

988
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,760
So he's screaming Alex for like three minutes and he went, "Hey Alex, there's a jar of mayonnaise in the back of the bus!"

989
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,200
And he looked.

990
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,320
And then he, we just called him Mayonnaise for the rest of time.

991
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,760
God, dude. It's so cruel what little thing can make you...

992
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,320
I know.

993
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
Dude, I just remember my favorite...

994
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,280
Yo, Chris took a poop. He's poop now.

995
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,120
What up, poop?

996
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,640
He started to embrace Mayonnaise, so then we stopped calling him it.

997
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,640
The best nickname story.

998
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,640
Yeah, when a kid is like, "Yeah, I'm my nickname for sure and I love it."

999
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,400
Um, there's this kid at my school, um, whose name was Steven.

1000
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,720
And, um, in the high school yearbook, um, yeah, no, I know.

1001
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,720
No way.

1002
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,840
In the high school yearbook, they had like a picture of him that was labeled Steven.

1003
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,040
And then next to it, they had a different picture of him.

1004
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,400
Like, it was just some glitch in the yearbook.

1005
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,440
It was a different picture of him, but like the name under it was, was Steeniuiu.

1006
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,440
like it was like s t e e n i o u i o u

1007
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,440
as we would call him steenu all the time

1008
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,440
it was i might still have a copy of that yearbook it's like the funniest thing i've ever seen in my life

1009
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,440
god damn dude

1010
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,440
yeah yearbook kids fuck everything up

1011
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,440
like someone just fell asleep on the keyboard

1012
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,440
there's another time my friend for con

1013
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,440
they printed his name in the yearbook as boy

1014
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
That's a pretty funny nickname already.

1015
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,440
He just didn't even want to bother getting his name correct.

1016
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:48,280
I, the yearbook, the girl who did the yearbook, my like senior quote was some like, that Harris

1017
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,280
Whittles joke about like wheat thiccs.

1018
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,280
Oh yeah.

1019
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,120
You know that joke, like wheat thins call me when they're wheat thiccs.

1020
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,960
I was like a big Harris Whittles fan in high school.

1021
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,280
And she messed it up so bad that my yearbook quote ended up being, "I love wheat thins."

1022
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,820
(laughter)

1023
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,660
- This is a suck dude.

1024
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,960
It's like everybody's just gonna think I like wheat thins.

1025
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,000
(laughter)

1026
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,180
- Not good.

1027
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,040
- I love wheat thins.

1028
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,260
Imagine liking wheat thins enough,

1029
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,620
you're like, yeah this is my senior quote.

1030
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,180
- Also it being a quote from somebody else.

1031
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,020
- Yeah.

1032
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,840
- Yeah.

1033
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,140
- It's not that I love wheat thins,

1034
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,280
it's that Harris Whittles, the dead comedian,

1035
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,620
loves wheat thins.

1036
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,740
Just terrible dude.

1037
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,060
Did they put Harris Whittles at the end of the quote?

1038
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,060
I love Wheat Thins, Harris Whittles.

1039
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,060
Yeah, it said, "I love Wheat Thins, Harris Whittles."

1040
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,620
It's like it was his final, it was like his last words.

1041
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,980
Yeah, my final will and testament, I love Wheat Thins.

1042
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:52,180
Yeah, man, that was a serious yearbook snafu.

1043
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,780
If I had been a chartered yearbook, I would have crushed it.

1044
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:57,700
I would have given, I would have been amazing.

1045
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,180
I would have put so many Wheat Leaves.

1046
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,180
I would have hidden so many weed leaves in the back of the photos, dude.

1047
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:04,180
I would have done mustaches, devil horns.

1048
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,180
Yeah.

1049
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,180
Yeah, nothing else.

1050
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Super ass.

1051
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,180
You know.

1052
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,180
It would have been good.

1053
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,180
I don't know.

1054
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,180
Did you, uh, you went to high school, right, Thomas?

1055
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,180
Yes, I did.

1056
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,180
How did you know?

1057
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,180
That's awesome, dude.

1058
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,180
You just had, you seem like an educated man.

1059
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,180
Yep.

1060
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,180
And I'd like to give you a job.

1061
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Yeah.

1062
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,180
Yeah.

1063
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,180
Do you go to a bank?

1064
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,180
Yeah.

1065
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,180
Yeah.

1066
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,180
Yeah.

1067
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,180
Yeah.

1068
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,180
Yeah.

1069
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,180
Yeah.

1070
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,180
Yeah.

1071
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,180
Yeah.

1072
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,260
Did you go to a big ass Texas high school when I was one of those 15,000 kids?

1073
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,940
No, my graduating class was 80.

1074
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:35,940
Whoa.

1075
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,940
Whoa.

1076
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,300
Is that because all the other 15,000 dropped out?

1077
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,300
Yeah.

1078
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,260
Yeah, we just had a terrible school.

1079
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,940
Like a 99% dropout rate.

1080
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
It was insane.

1081
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,500
I went to a wayside school.

1082
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,540
It was a bummer.

1083
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,540
Everything was sideways.

1084
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Yeah, dude.

1085
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,540
They turned me into apples.

1086
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,540
Yeah, they turned me into apples.

1087
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,540
It was just missing floor.

1088
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,540
I mean, Apples is just missing floor.

1089
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,540
Yeah.

1090
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,540
Not cool.

1091
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:04,140
I went to the MKUltra High School, so I did experiments on my mind the whole time.

1092
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,140
Is that why you're so weird?

1093
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,140
Yeah, dude.

1094
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,140
That's why I'm all messed up.

1095
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:11,140
Every time you look at me, I get a headache.

1096
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,780
You're doing powerful shit.

1097
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,020
It's so fucking funny that the government for like 10 years was like, "Yeah, we're gonna

1098
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,540
give people mind powers."

1099
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,540
Yeah.

1100
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,540
We gotta do it.

1101
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,540
It's the sickest shit of all time.

1102
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:23,540
Yeah.

1103
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,900
billions of dollars. Yeah. No, the best... Can we just pitch anything to...

1104
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,260
Hello, Mr. President, I'm gonna make cartoons real. And it's like the fun, the

1105
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,180
best part of it is like, oh you know what the way that they're like, you know what

1106
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,700
the way we're gonna give them mind powers is? Alright, here we go. We're gonna

1107
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,340
put them in a big pool, we're gonna put a helmet on their head, and we're gonna play

1108
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,740
a tape that says, "You have mind powers" for a week and not feed them at all and

1109
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,860
they're gonna get mind powers. And then we're just gonna give them like a drug

1110
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,440
Like me that makes you drop out of high school. Yep, and then we're gonna cut open their stomach

1111
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,460
Yeah, cuz why not just sick, dude

1112
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:06,060
Yeah, we're doing we're doing dark dark mind experiments to figure out. What does the stomach look like when you cut it open?

1113
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,220
I'd probably be pretty creepy

1114
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,700
Yeah, we're just gonna be kind of weird now. Yeah, we're doing weird experiments

1115
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:18,180
We wanted to make like a hundred and fifty very weird guys. Yeah, what would happen if you combine?

1116
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,700
What would happen if you combine waffles and pancakes that was one of the big

1117
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:28,500
MKUltra things that got covered up. Can we make it rain tacos? Sir we have we have

1118
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,580
collected 150 of the most random people we could find to do raw RxD

1119
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:42,380
experiments on. Sir what's the square root of dinosaur? Neapolitan ice cream?

1120
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,700
You're in. Yeah it's crazy. It's crazy. After just a week one of our

1121
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,520
specimens was able to translate the dinosaur word for love. For "I love you."

1122
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,700
They walk by like a testing chamber and they just see like a Tumblr teen trying

1123
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:08,620
to bend a spork with her mind. Yeah. Wow this is so bacon. Sir we have three

1124
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:14,100
bacon, tier bacon operators ready to go. Ready to attack Vietnam at any point in

1125
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:21,380
time it appears that these specimens have have developed a fixation for Bill Murray

1126
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:27,780
yeah they saw Bill Murray on the street and he said tell nobody Wow sir I'm

1127
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:34,340
afraid hallucinating Bill Murray sir I'm afraid the experiments were a failure

1128
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:41,340
doctor, all three of the subjects still like twilight.

1129
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:48,340
Oh, fuck, dude. Yeah.

1130
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:56,460
Fail blog. The operation was a fail blog, doctor.

1131
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:01,420
Yeah. Yeah, we could definitely design something

1132
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,740
like that for the government.

1133
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:11,420
You're walking around the grocery store and you see some emaciated test subject who escaped

1134
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:17,260
who's just like in Stranger Things style, in a hospital gown and stuff.

1135
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:25,420
They walk up to you and they're like, "Excuse me, can I has cheeseburger?"

1136
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,820
Yeah, the code was like, "Quick, Edison or Tesla?"

1137
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,820
Tesla.

1138
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,140
Yeah, you're in.

1139
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,140
Identity confirmed.

1140
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,020
Yeah, man.

1141
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,460
I think I'm going to go into the military now.

1142
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,620
I think I could change it.

1143
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,620
Yeah.

1144
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,060
What branch would you go for?

1145
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,980
I would basically go to the Marines.

1146
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,980
Yeah.

1147
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,100
I think I would be a Navy SEAL.

1148
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,260
I think I would be probably whatever's on top of the Navy SEAL. I would be a space marine, but you know

1149
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:02,260
Yeah, I'd be a I'd be a general. I'd be a Jedi so

1150
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:10,700
I'd be a Jedi Sentinel in the army. Yeah, yeah, and I would basically my plan is to go over to ISIS and basically kill all their families

1151
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:17,940
The thing is you if you pitch that like, you know, like Pompeo or whatever would be like, yeah

1152
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,940
Why didn't we think of that before? Of course?

1153
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,500
He's like I'm in

1154
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,760
(laughter)

1155
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,600
- Yeah.

1156
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,440
- Yeah.

1157
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,000
- John Krasinski proposing a crossover

1158
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,580
between Jack Ryan and Star Wars.

1159
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,000
(laughter)

1160
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,060
What if we revealed they're in the same universe?

1161
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,900
- Yeah, in real life.

1162
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah, the Jedi and the CIA and Jim from The Office

1163
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:45,560
are all in the same universe as ISIS.

1164
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,400
- Dude, imagine if in--

1165
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,220
- And I'm gonna take them down.

1166
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,440
- Imagine if in Star Wars 10,

1167
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,760
like the cliffhanger at the end,

1168
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,060
like they're like, "Oh my God,

1169
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,060
a new powerful Sith Lord has risen and he turns around and it's Osama Bin Laden.

1170
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,700
[Laughter]

1171
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,700
And that's the reveal that it's all been in our universe all along.

1172
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,300
It'd be even crazier if he was a Jedi.

1173
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,700
He's the last Jedi.

1174
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,500
Holy crap.

1175
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,700
I mean, think about it. He was in a cave.

1176
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:09,340
That's what Rian Johnson wanted to do. They wouldn't let him.

1177
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,260
He was in a cave, right?

1178
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,540
Yeah.

1179
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,060
I mean, that's some Jedi shit right there.

1180
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,340
Yeah.

1181
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:15,860
That's all you need.

1182
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,340
He was surrounded by 13 year olds.

1183
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:18,940
He could use the force.

1184
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:20,340
Very Jedi-esque.

1185
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,780
He could use the force, yeah.

1186
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:25,180
Yeah, nobody was piloting the planes.

1187
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,020
Yeah.

1188
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,980
Osama used his force powers.

1189
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,480
He destroyed a large structure

1190
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,920
by targeting its weak point.

1191
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,260
Oh my God.

1192
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:36,740
Very Jedi-esque.

1193
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,580
Yeah.

1194
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:42,300
He wore a dress.

1195
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,180
He did wear a dress like a Jedi.

1196
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,980
He believed in the divine power of Allah,

1197
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,420
which is a Jedi attribute.

1198
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,740
It is a Jedi trait.

1199
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,220
Yeah, that's part of the Jedi code.

1200
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,020
The Iron Code of the Shinobi.

1201
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,140
He loved, he had a ton of porn on his laptop.

1202
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,140
Yeah.

1203
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,140
Very Jedi.

1204
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,140
Yeah.

1205
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,460
I mean, how embarrassing for him.

1206
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,100
Do you guys think that the SEAL Team 6 like planted all that shit on his laptop, like

1207
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,100
all the movies and stuff?

1208
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,180
I think one of them left his laptop there.

1209
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,780
Yeah, and they were like, "Oh, look at all this gay shit."

1210
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,180
He's like, "Yeah, this probably belonged to Osama Bin Laden."

1211
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,180
Yeah.

1212
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:20,680
Yeah, these are probably Osama's things.

1213
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:21,680
Um, anyway.

1214
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,680
Geoff, is this your laptop?

1215
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
No.

1216
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
Anyway, that was Osama's laptop.

1217
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,680
That was here when we got here.

1218
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,680
Osama loved Evangelion and Naruto.

1219
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:29,680
Oh, how embarrassing.

1220
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,680
He had a bunch of naked pictures of me and my friends.

1221
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,680
This is us.

1222
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,680
Yeah.

1223
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,680
He was trying to extort us.

1224
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,680
That's why we killed him.

1225
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,680
Wow.

1226
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,680
He had this naked photo of me grilling.

1227
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,680
Yeah, he knew he was onto us, dude.

1228
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,680
He was gonna leak this to the press.

1229
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,680
That's why we had to kill him.

1230
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,840
check out his joking bookmarks do this is so sad

1231
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:57,840
has an entire folder on chrome is joking website

1232
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,080

1233
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,140

1234
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,260

1236
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,220

1237
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,220
yeah i'm guessing it's mario with big boobs one

1238
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:27,380
so far into osama's mind i was able to extract the password

1239
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,520
we did some deep research on him and what his password would be

1240
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,140
yeah turns out it's SEALTEAM6

1241
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,740
yeah

1242
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,380
i wish i'd been there dude

1243
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,380
If I was there it would have gone different.

1244
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,780
If I was there it would have gone different.

1245
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,780
He would have killed me.

1246
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,780
Yep.

1247
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,780
Yeah.

1248
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,980
Osama would have killed me and all my friends so easy if I had been there.

1249
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:50,980
Yeah.

1250
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,980
God damn it.

1251
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,980

Not really.

Maybe next time though.

1264
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,420
What about like a landscape?
