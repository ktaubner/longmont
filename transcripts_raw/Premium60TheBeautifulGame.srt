[Explosion]

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,560
Why did you wait before saying zero?

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,720
Why didn't you do--

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,480
I have to keep you on your toes.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,760
Okay, it's just going to be harder for you to edit.

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,240
No, it'll be easy for me.

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,880
I haven't even pressed record yet.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,400
That's--

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:25,920
Why not?

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
You can't be telling the truth.

16
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm not even--

17
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,480
You have to be lying.

18
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
Guys, it's 2021.

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,920

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,560

21
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Year of the frog.

22
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,520
Year of the golf, dude.

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,800

24
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,080
I'm sitting here drinking an Armold Palmer.

25
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,540
Armold?

26
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,680
That's his name, Armold Palmer.

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,480
Armold Palmer.

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,280
Armold Palmer.

29
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
He's one of the greatest golf players.

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,560
Caleb's over here saying "Erma-gurd."

31
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm drinking an Armold Permer.

32
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Erma-golf, dude.

33
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
'Cause I'm in golf mode.

34
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm ready, dude.

35
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,720
Is that your new thing for the new year?

36
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
My new thing for the new year?

37
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,480
Your new one week thing?

38
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,240
Yeah, my new thing is I'm gonna start

39
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,020
taking cocaine at 8 a.m., I'm gonna cheat on my wife,

40
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,520
drinking Michelob Ultras, I'm dry popping a cigar inside.

41
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,500
That was your stop me, dude.

42
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,340
Your dry pop--

43
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,520
Get that thing out of your mouth.

44
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,620
Yeah, no.

45
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,960
Take the cigar out, it looks--

46
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,800
I refuse.

47
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,340
I will not refuse.

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,440
Get it out of your mouth.

49
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,840
Light it or get it out of your mouth.

50
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
It's disrespectful.

51
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,720
- You can't light it inside, dude.

52
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,880
- Well then don't, then get it out of your mouth.

53
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,240
- I'm a paid member of this club.

54
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
You think I wanna get kicked out?

55
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,120
- That shit looks like Dookie.

56
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,240
- You pay to be a part of your family?

57
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
- Yeah.

58
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,760
- I gotta stop recording these when I woke up an hour before.

59
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,200
- An hour is plenty of time for an adult to wake up.

60
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,520
- You should also stop waking up at that time.

61
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,480
You should just wake up earlier.

62
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,320
- Yeah.

63
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,040
- We planned we were gonna record at this time.

64
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,400
- Yeah, I know, but I woke up

65
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,240
and I couldn't get back to bed.

66
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,680
- I don't think I've slept in a long time.

67
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
- Yeah. - I think that's not true.

68
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,120
- You just kinda sit up, just waiting,

69
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,960
waiting for something to happen, you know?

70
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
I'm just-- - Caleb goes to sleep

71
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,440
at 8 p.m. and then he wakes up and he sees the clock

72
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,760
says 8 a.m. and he thinks, I didn't sleep at all.

73
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,200
Oh my God. - Exactly, yeah.

74
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
I think someone just turned the lights on.

75
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,640
- Yeah. - I couldn't sleep last night

76
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,080
'cause I was so excited for my drives today.

77
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
- Yeah. - Yeah.

78
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,200
- I'm living the line-- - What's your favorite

79
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
part of golf?

80
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,260
- Dude, it has to be the course.

81
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,820
- Have you been golfing before?

82
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,480
- No. - Okay.

83
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,540
Today's gonna be my first day at the Wilmington

84
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,420
Municipal Golf Course.

85
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm paying 30 bucks, I'm putting money on the line here.

86
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Yeah.

87
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,220
I borrowed a bunch of clothes from my stepdad.

88
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,640
I have a Boston hat on.

89
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,920
I have a cigar that I stole from my grandpa.

90
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, you look like all of my uncles right now.

91
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,660
Dude, yes!

92
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,880
That's cool.

93
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,400
I just bought an Arnold Palmer light at the dollar store.

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,800
That reminds me guys, I have really good,

95
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,680

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,200
i don't know what i don't know what my dad's cousin is to me so i like my

102
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,760

103
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,800
my hair that's your dad's cousin exactly he uh... he lives in new hampshire

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,440
uh...

105
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
mhm think uh...

106
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
uh... was a cause it

107
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,280
whatever it's like a he's like north new hampshire and i'm

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,280
and he bought one of his kids a pig,

109
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,360
like as a pet.

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
- That's gangster.

111
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,760
- It grew gigantic, like humongous,

112
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,960
and then his wife left him and took the kids,

113
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,240
and then he just stayed in the house with this giant pig,

114
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,680
and the pig won't go outside, it hates going outside,

115
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,400
so it lives in the house.

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,700
and they turned the electricity off,

117
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,120
and they turned the heat off,

118
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
and so he sleeps with the pig.

119
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,520
The pig got too big so it couldn't get onto his bed,

120
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,440
so he cut the legs off of his bed

121
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
so he could sleep with the pig.

122
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,120
- I thought you were gonna say

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,640
he cut the legs off of his pig.

124
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,440
- And so he lives with this pig, right?

125
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,000
And then they finally, the police had to come

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
and get him out of the house,

127
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,480
so he bought a trailer,

128
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,320
and now he lives in a trailer with a pig.

129
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,640
- With his best friend pig.

130
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,920
and the pig is like really, I guess like temperamental,

131
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,760
so it's like chewed up, it's ripped up all the linoleum

132
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,000
inside the trailer and like chewed up all the furniture.

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,780
And it'll like, apparently like if he's eating food

134
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,480
and the pig wants food, it'll like throw a tantrum

135
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,680
and like start freaking out.

136
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,400
And it still hates going outside, so it has a litter box

137
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,480
and he has to like, if he wants to get it outside--

138
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
- Oh, a fucking litter box?

139
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,160
- Dude, pigs are fucking huge too.

140
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,800
- He has to, yeah, he has to push it down a ramp

141
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,800
out of the trailer and apparently one time it was like sick and he wanted to take it

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,040
to the vet and the vet was like "no we don't treat pigs, they're livestock, we don't do

143
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,520
that here" and he begged the vet to take it and then so I was like "okay fine" and he

144
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,120
took the pig to the vet but the pig was really scared of the vet so it didn't want to go

145
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,500
Inside so we had to stand behind it and push it

146
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:21,560
And it was like it was like squealing and apparently pig squeals are like insanely loud yeah jet engine loud

147
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,800
So there's a bunch of people sitting in the best way to like

148
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Noodles and shit yeah, just like covering their ears for the pig is just screaming and being pushed

149
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,720
That's like in that's like a fucking your ghost Lanthimos movie. Yeah, that's not I don't know what my dad

150
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,440
My dad just told me about this like a day or two ago.

151
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,120
I don't know why he didn't tell me before.

152
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,560
- Why does he, does he visit this cousin in the pig?

153
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
- He does.

154
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,220
- Do you have to pay your respects

155
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,820
to the pig when you visit?

156
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,660
- You do.

157
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,280
- I've, he's a French guy.

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,480
I've not seen this cousin since I was very little.

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,360
- Dude, we might have to make a,

160
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,160
we might have to make a trek.

161
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,040
We have to go see this fucking pig, dude.

162
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,120
- Yeah, I gotta find out where this guy lives.

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
- I can show you a video of the pig

164
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,560
when it was not full grown on Instagram.

165
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,960
The thing is pigs don't stop growing.

166
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
They grow forever.

167
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
They get gigantic.

168
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
I was saying that pig's gonna eat him someday.

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Definitely dude.

171
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Pigs love human flesh.

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Yeah.

173
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah.

174
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
They'll eat any guy that they see.

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,280
They think it's funny.

176
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,320
Here's a picture of the pig when it wasn't fully grown.

177
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,840
That's already a huge pig.

178
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
It's giant.

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
No, it's huge.

180
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Yeah.

181
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,720
How the fuck does that thing live in a fucking trailer?

182
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,540
I know, dude.

183
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,400
How does that live in a trailer?

184
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Dude, can you imagine?

185
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,680
- Can you imagine, your family leaves you

186
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,040
and you live with a pig, it's so cool.

187
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,040
- In a trailer, and also you get up to go to the bathroom

188
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,960
and because the trailer isn't wide enough,

189
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,760
the pig is just in the way.

190
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,800
And because the pig also is kinda alpha-dogging you,

191
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,680
you just have to wait for him to decide to move.

192
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,140
'Cause there's no way that there's a 400 pound pig

193
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,140
and you're like, all right,

194
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,160
you gotta get the fuck out of my life, right?

195
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,720
You just have to wait for him to make his own decisions, dude.

196
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,860
- The pig's name is Sunny, by the way.

197
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,700
- Sunny.

198
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,680
- Sunny the pig, dude. - Yeah, Sunny the pig.

199
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,380
- Wow. - Yeah.

200
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,060
Pretty good, right?

201
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,900
I was really excited to tell you guys that one.

202
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,000
- That's really good, dude.

203
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
That's really good.

204
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

205
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,380
You learn anything about your cousins

206
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,060
this Christmas Eve, Patrick?

207
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,060
- Yeah, all of them have cancer.

208
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,540
- Dude. - Swag!

209
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,340
- Swag, dude! - No.

210
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,820
None of them have cancer.

211
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,420
- Oh, that's sweet. - Swag!

212
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,060
- Swag, that's great news! - Even better!

213
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,220
- Congratulations. - So much better.

214
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,140
- Dude, I guess the only thing I could think of better

215
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,400
than my cousins having cancer

216
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,820
is that they don't have cancer.

217
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,660
- Yeah, one of the only things better.

218
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,600
- Did they get cured?

219
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,100
- No, they never had it.

220
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,940
- Oh, come on.

221
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,300
- They got cured with a time machine.

222
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,580
- Oh, that's cool too.

223
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

224
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,740
- Yeah, basically one of my cousins

225
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,700
invented a time machine and cured cancer,

226
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,100
brought the cure back.

227
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,860
- Dude, I want a time machine so bad right now.

228
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,020
If I had a time machine right now, I would--

229
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,900
- I would time machine back before you asked me this question

230
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,160
and think of a better joke.

231
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
- I wouldn't.

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,900
- Oh my God.

233
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,140
- Wow.

234
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,740
I would, personally, I wouldn't probably stop any

235
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,900
like horrible thing in history.

236
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,500
I'd probably just skip to my tea time, 2.39.

237
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,580
- Yeah.

238
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,500
- Yeah.

239
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, five minutes before, that's common courtesy.

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,020
- Yeah.

241
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,740
How many holes in one are you gonna get?

242
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,660
- Probably, how many holes are there?

243
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,540
- 18. - 18.

244
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,180
- I'm gonna hit 18.

245
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,000
- Yeah.

246
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
- Hole in one, dude.

247
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,840
- Birdies, bogeys, or golf boys.

248
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,640
- I'm gonna be picking my bogeys

249
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,140
and flying them like a birdie.

250
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,200
(laughing)

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
Right, all across the course.

252
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm flicking these bogeys left and right.

253
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
- I'm picking a bogey.

254
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,960
- That's what the caddy's supposed to do.

255
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,640
- If the caddy says bogey, I'm gonna say,

256
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,680
what the fuck did you just call me?

257
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,120
What was that?

258
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm gonna do that every time.

259
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,560
- Yeah, a bogey, you feed your bogeys to the birds,

260
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,520
to the birdies.

261
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,400
- I told you guys that my friend used to have a fish

262
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,280
named booger yeah everybody's gonna feed him boogers I'm a booger yeah that's

263
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:14,620
that's a pretty good I do you think that would work with that pig you feed him

264
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,920
boogers you feed him boogers and earwax he loves it yeah he's a fucking dead

265
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,020
that's how you make it that's how you grow like an evil pig that would like

266
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,720
poison its soul pigs are like pigs it's like one of those things it's like it's

267
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,680
- It's like in a fantasy movie or something

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,520
when it's like, oh, the wizard got corrupted

269
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,800
by evil magic and he turned into a monster.

270
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
Like, that's how you make like a dark pig

271
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,260
is you feed it boogers.

272
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,100
- Do you think he'll get a--

273
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,680
- The wizard got corrupted by a pig?

274
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,520
- I hope he gets obsessed. - Yeah, you.

275
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,080
- Whoa, oh my God, dude.

276
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
- You're the wizard. - Please don't cry.

277
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,800
Please don't cry.

278
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,840
- Yeah, you're the wizard.

279
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,820
- So I was thinking, next time we meet up to record

280
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,720
maybe a golf trip, who knows?

281
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,160
Depends on how the day goes.

282
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't fucking--

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,720
My plan is me and my brothers are gonna get

284
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,200
really good at golf the next three days

285
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,120
and then we're gonna challenge my dad.

286
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
Yeah.

287
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah, for his car.

288
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,680
Well, golf is just like really big pool, right?

289
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,980
That's what I'm saying.

290
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, that makes sense.

291
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Ask me tomorrow though, I might say that--

292
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,960
Balls and green and holes.

293
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,720
I might say that pool is just little golf.

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,120
I might have switched sides.

295
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
Really?

296
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,120
Dude, it's just gonna be so easy.

297
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,800
I think I have a natural talent.

298
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,520
Yeah.

299
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,340
Have you played it yet?

300
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,760
but I think I, but mentally I've been looking up different things.

301
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Why don't you, here, take a swing, get up.

302
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,600
You want me to take a swing?

303
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,020
Let's see it, let's see your swing.

304
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,500
Let's see it.

305
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,380
Use the, yeah, use the mic.

306
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,280
You gotta use your, gotta make your wrist straight.

307
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,120
Wrist straight.

308
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,140
And then I pull back, follow through.

309
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,940
And you guys couldn't see it,

310
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,800
but I did actually pivot my foot,

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,940
which is one of the main five things

312
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,780
that I've learned from the YouTube video.

313
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,300
Let's get a few more swings, get back up.

314
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,020
Just keep swinging the rest of the episode.

315
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
Okay, alright, you guys do the episodes, I'll just swing.

316
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,520
Alright.

317
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Every time I've played golf, I've uh...

318
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I mean, I've played golf like a couple times.

319
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,520
I always do the Happy Gilmore thing.

320
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Yeah?

321
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
I've been to like a driving range before,

322
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
but I've never like played golf besides mini golf.

323
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Yeah, that's what I mean by mini golf.

324
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
I do Happy Gilmore shit at the mini golf rink.

325
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Oh yeah.

326
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Me too, man.

327
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
I do like Caddyshack stuff pretty much.

328
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Yeah, you do pranks on a gopher.

329
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Yeah, I do tons of insane SNL crap at the golf course.

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,760

Swag.

And it's only one tweet from 2009, and it says, "I'm enjoying my day off."

339
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,680
Whoa, do you think his name was Cheeto45 in 2009?

340
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,560
No, his name's Robin Jones.

341
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, fuck, dude.

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,920
That's Robin Williams' brother.

343
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Yeah.

344
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah.

345
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,360
woman named Robin? No. I just said what it was. I don't know. That's actually pretty

346
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,040
rare to have a woman. A woman named Robin? Yeah, it doesn't really happen for the

347
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,800
most part. I'm pretty excited to not see a girl on the golf course also. Yeah. Yeah.

348
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,400
A woman disrespecting. Dude, if I see a woman's midriff today I might lose my

349
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,120
mind. What kind of shoes you're gonna wear on the golf course? Bowling shoes.

350

351
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,600
wearing the shirt I'm wearing a purple polo a three-quarter zip I have a Boston

352
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,900
Red Sox hat on let's see it I do I showed you didn't know the hat dude I mean what

353
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,600

354
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,780
don't you do you badmouth Boston you're a second you get out of Boston yeah you

355
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:16,400
were goth a week ago and now you're golf hey I yes yeah yeah yeah that's a you're

356
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
You're right, that is an interesting switch.

357
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Caleb is just into odd future.

358
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I never, no.

359
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
That's why he likes golf.

360
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
I'd like to iterate, I never stopped being golf.

361
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I'd like to reiterate for the first time.

362
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
You never stopped being golf?

363
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
You stopped being into golf?

364
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
What are you into now?

365
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
No, listen to me.

366
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
So he went from goth to golf, so next he's going to be a wolf?

367
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm deciding to mix the goth and golf lifestyle into one thing.

368
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
It's called synergy.

369
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
at a business school where I went.

370
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,560
You went to business school?

371
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,480
Why'd you go to business school?

372
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
To get better at golf?

373
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
Who the fuck is starting a business?

374
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,940
What accent was that, Caleb?

375
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,320
It was cigar in my mouth accent.

376
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,800
It's an Arnold Palmer accent.

377
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,460
Are you guys stupid?

378
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
No, you are, dude.

379
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,880
You know what, you guys just don't understand

380
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,440
what it's like to have passion.

381
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,480
And to have drive.

382
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,600
And to have a straight drive.

383
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
Dude, I mean, whatever.

384
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,720
You guys are putt-putt.

385
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
A straight drive is going to Hooters.

386
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Straight drive lifestyle might not make it, dude.

387
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,800
They might have to take me off that course in a stretcher.

388
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,280
I think they probably will.

389
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,440
'Cause I had too many Michelob Ultras,

390
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,360
which I just picked up a 30 rack of, by the way.

391
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
You fell over and got your ear stuck in the hole.

392
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,640
I just picked up a 30 rack.

393
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,200
I just picked up a fake, no.

394
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,040
They're not gonna have to get me out of the hole

395
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,880
with the jaws of life, that's not gonna happen.

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,880
You're gonna fall over and the flag is gonna go

397
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,480
into one ear and come right out the other

398
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
and you're gonna be stuck on the ground.

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,060
- I just picked up a pill from a gas station called Adol.

400
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,900
(laughing)

401
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,460
It's called Adol XR and it's gonna get me through

402
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,980
an intense-- - Yeah, Adol.

403
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,460
- I'm not kidding. - I just realized.

404
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,820
I just realized.

405
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,700
- There is a pill at the gas station down the street

406
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,740
that they sell called Adol XR.

407
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,580
- Damn.

408
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,380
- And it's about to power up my golf game.

409
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,220
- Yeah, yeah.

410
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,400
- Dude, my swings are gonna be insane.

411
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,780
My rotator cuff has never been in better shape.

412
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,060
- Yeah. - Yeah.

413
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
- I'm serious.

414
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,940
- I don't believe you.

415
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,780
- I don't believe you either.

416
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm gonna send you guys a video, dude.

417
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,360
- Please do, send it.

418
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,320
- I'm gonna send you so many videos.

419
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,440
- You should stream from the golf course.

420
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,080
- Dude, I might. - That's not a bad idea.

421
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,600
- I might have to show the world because it seems--

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,160
- This will come out after you go golfing, though.

423
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
- Well, now that I've-- - By the time this comes out,

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
you won't be into golfing anymore.

425
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,320
- I will, I think I've learned a new lifelong passion.

426
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,920
- You said you're gonna play golf for three days, right?

427
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,760
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,920
- This comes out more than three days from now.

429
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
- But I'm gonna train, I'm gonna challenge my dad.

430
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,560
- Okay, where are you gonna golf

431
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,920
when you get back to New York, Trump Links?

432
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
I might go to Trump Links.

433
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
You could go to Trump Links.

434
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
I could go to Trump Links.

435
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
It is really close.

436
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
It is the only golf course I've seen.

437
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
It is really close to where you live.

438
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,320
It's probably across the street.

439
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,040
I think, yeah, I live in the Hudson River.

440
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,760
You could just walk across the highway to get to Trump Links.

441
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I think there's a-

442
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,960
You put your arms out, holding a golf club in the air.

443
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Stop for me, do not hit me.

444
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm going to Trump Links.

445
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,080
I would go to Trump Links and I would just sit there.

446
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,040
I'd just gum up the works.

447
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Just fucking-

448
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,400
- Just shoot one foot at a time.

449
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Sabotage those rich pieces of shit.

450
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,560
- Yeah, and Donald Trump will be behind you saying,

451
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,880
and no one ruined Trump links more than Caleb.

452
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm owned, I'm completely owned.

453
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,840
- He'll be saying that that is praxis.

454
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,320
- Wow, that's praxis, wow.

455
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
- Trump hates praxis is the thing.

456
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,600
- Dude, he hates it, dude.

457
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,880
He gets so mad. - Praxis is what defeats him,

458
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,600
and he gets really mad when it happens.

459
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,040
- When someone does something praxis,

460
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,680
like reading a book or making an online blog post.

461
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,840
- Giving an ice cream cone to a young child.

462
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,060
- And also he's such a baby,

463
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,760
he might even crap his pants, pretty shit.

464
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,480
- Oh, if a baby does praxis.

465
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,360
- Folks, nobody hates praxis more than me.

466
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,200
- Now that Joe Biden is president,

467
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,480
we can do as many Trump impressions as possible.

468
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,420
- Sex work is not work.

469
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,640
It's just a hobby.

470
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,280
Golf is work.

471
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,240
- It's a game.

472
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,400
- It's just a game that women play.

473
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,840
- It's just people playing games.

474
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,000
- That was an interesting kind of like

475
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,640
older Woody Allen take on Trump.

476
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,040
- I'm Donald Trump.

477
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,840
- I'm Donald Trump.

478
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,680
- Hello.

479
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,500
- Yeah.

480
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,340
- Excuse me. - Hello.

481
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,240
- Well excuse me.

482
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,520
- Lady.

483
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
- Urkel Trump. - Lady.

484
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,100
- Yeah.

485
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,400
- I'm gonna grab you by the.

486
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,940
(laughing)

487
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,780
- Whoa.

488
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,460
- He would have, Jerry would have never said that.

489
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,600
- No, it's Donald Trump.

490
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
- Donald Trump would have, oh he did say that, whoops.

491
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,480
But yeah, I'm ready to do stuff like that.

492
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm ready to talk, I'm ready to talk with my friends

493
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,140
in the golf locker room.

494
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,560
- You're ready to talk like Jerry Lewis?

495
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,720
- I'm gonna talk like Jerry Lewis.

496
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
I'm gonna walk around with a cigar.

497
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,480
I'm gonna pretend I know everybody

498
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,120
'cause that's how you dominate them mentally on the course.

499
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,440
You walk in, you say, hey, what's up?

500
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,280
What's up, Chet?

501
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,100
- Hey, what's up?

502
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,940
Yeah, how's the missus? - Good to see you, buddy.

503
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,780
How's the swing?

504
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,240
Hey, Derek, Derek, I love what you're doing.

505
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,480
Keep doing it.

506
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,160
- Hey, Ricky, off the course.

507
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,040
- Fred, Jose, if I see you again, I'm kicking your ass.

508
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,480
- Yeah, I don't want you here.

509
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
is my course.

510
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,260
- This is my public golf course, the only one.

511
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,240
- I get onto the golf course and I take out a megaphone,

512
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,000
I say, "Attention, everybody,

513
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,940
"I just purchased this golf course, it belongs to me.

514
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,080
"You're gonna get off, this is my backyard now."

515
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,920
- Welcome to Pits Links, dude.

516
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,000
Fucking suck my dick or get off.

517
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,880
$100,000 buy-in.

518
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,080
- Caleb, I don't know if the online leftist community

519
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,040
is gonna like you being a golf guy.

520
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,480
I don't think they want you to,

521
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,320
- They wanna turn all the golf links.

522
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,200
- You know golf is a waste of--

523
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
- It's a waste of land.

524
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,400
- It's a waste of land and it's a waste of being

525
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,040
on the left politically.

526
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,600
That's fine 'cause I also just bought 30 drums of crude oil

527
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,900
and I'm about to just dump it all over the field.

528
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,160
- It could be, I mean the golf course that you're going to

529
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,560
could be affordable housing for inmates.

530
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,680
- And they could use the water

531
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
to like feed a thousand fishes too.

532
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,900
- It's about to be affordable housing

533
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,120
for a bunch of chill guys enjoying drugs on a Sunday.

534
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
so, 'cause it's a $30.

535
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,200
- It's affordable playing.

536
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,280
- Exactly, dude.

537
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,520
- We don't need more housing.

538
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,320
- No, we need more playing, less housing.

539
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,200
- People can live on a tent in the street,

540
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,040
they do that already, it works.

541
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,840
- People can live in a trailer with a pig,

542
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,520
they can do a lot of things, dude.

543
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,320
- But can you play on the sidewalk?

544
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,480
- No. - No disrespect

545
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
the resolve of humanity. - Unless you're doing

546
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
urban golf, and it's 2006. - Unless it's like

547
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,040
urban hopscotch. - It's urban hopscotch.

548
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,400
(laughing)

549
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,680
- That's cool.

550
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,520
- What's that?

551
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,720
- I don't know Patrick, what is that?

552
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,360
- Hopscotch, backwards hat. - You said that, I mean.

553
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,200
- No I didn't.

554
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,400
- Yeah you did. - You said that Patrick.

555
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,060
You just said that.

556
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,800
- You said urban hopscotch.

557
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,640
- You said that first.

558
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
- Can we stop saying the word urban?

559
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,380
I'm wearing this Red Sox hat and it's giving me anxiety.

560
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,680
(laughing)

561
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm getting really worried.

562
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,040
I keep looking out at my car and making sure it's locked

563
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,640
every time you guys say urban.

564
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,560
My Hyundai Tucson that I have.

565
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,440
- 'Cause you're wearing a three quarter zip and a polo.

566
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,420
- Yeah I might just, now that I'm looking at it dude,

567
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,320
I might just use my, I might just pop the trunk

568
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,460
with the button on the keys,

569
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,400
'cause that's one of the features

570
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,180
of the Hyundai Tucson that I have.

571
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,180
Are you gonna be driving a golf cart when you get there?

572
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,780
You know, if you're freaking out,

573
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,100
if you're freaking out from wearing the hat,

574
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,980
why don't you just go, why don't you go to Lidz

575
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,020
and just get a Scali cap or something,

576
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,140
get like one of those like--

577
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,180
Yeah.

578
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,580
The Lidz Scali caps?

579
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,700
Yeah, the Lidz Scali caps.

580
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,900
With the sticker on it.

581
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,220
The New York Yankees Scali cap, the 50/50?

582
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,380
- No, it would be a Boston one.

583
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,180
- No, we're not in North Carolina, dude.

584
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,160
- Maybe this problem isn't fixed.

585
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,060
- I'm really worried that somebody might see

586
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,900
a glimpse of a tattoo and I'll get kicked out of golf.

587
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,380
- Yeah. - Yeah, I'm pretty worried

588
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,220
about that. - Here's the solution.

589
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,940
You get a tattoo, you get all your tattoos

590
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,580
covered up to be golf balls.

591
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,300
- If you have a tattoo, you can't be buried

592
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,780
on a golf course. - That's true.

593
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,020
- Yeah, you're not allowed to be buried in a golf--

594
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,520
- The holes on the golf course is where

595
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,860
they bury leprechauns.

596
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,360
- Fuck.

597
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,940
- That's why the golf course is green.

598
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,820
- I'm about to bury some of these white balls

599
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,760
in those holes, dude.

600
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,660
- Yeah, I'm gonna bury my white balls.

601
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,180
- I'm burying, listen, I'm taking it to the course

602
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,380
and I'm burying these white balls.

603
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
I'm pretty excited, dude.

604
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,440
I might buy a Porsche today.

605
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,280
- Yeah?

606
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,100
- Yeah.

607
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,940
I don't know, man.

608
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,060
I think I've become a different guy

609
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,140
very recently in the last couple hours.

610
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,500
- You were goth a week ago.

611
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,340
- Yeah.

612
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,420
- And the thing is about being goth is that it's childish.

613
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,800
- Okay, so we have confirmation that you think

614
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
you're not goth anymore.

615
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,140
- I actually just decided right now.

616
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,500
- You said you were synthesizing them earlier.

617
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,240
- Yeah, and I decided that they're unsynthesizable.

618
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,380
- What made you decide that?

619
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,340
- Because I put the eyeliner on

620
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,740
and it was blocking my vision of golf.

621
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,780
- You didn't do that.

622
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,620
- I did do that.

623
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,440
- You never played golf.

624
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,940
- You never wore eyeliner either.

625
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,180
- I never wore eyeliner or played golf.

626
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,540
- I'm actually running a physics simulation in Blender

627
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,780
of what golf will be like when I'm golfing.

628
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,980
- Of what eyeliner looks like.

629
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,100
- Yeah, of what eyeliner does to a golfer's body.

630
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,940
And it actually is a, it's actually a detrimental

631
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,780
to golf performance. - I'm actually looking at

632
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,620
like a deviant art simulation right now

633
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,980
of like what it would look like to golf

634
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,940
if you had a giant bouncing belly.

635
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,980
And it seems very sexual.

636
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,820
- Yeah. - It seems like it actually.

637
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,220
- There's a lot of Caleb. - It seems actually

638
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,040
really cool.

639
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,580
- There's a lot of Caleb Pitts and Prague deviant art stuff.

640
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
- Yeah. - There's not.

641
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,660
- I'm actually, I'm running a simulation right now

642
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,780
to see what it would look like if their Pikachu was trapped

643
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,120
inside of Sonic's stomach.

644
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,820
It's beautiful.

645
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,500
- It's actually the miracle of life.

646
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,340
- Yeah.

647
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,340
- Yeah.

648
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,180
- I don't know.

649
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,940
- Yeah, I can't, my wife's pregnant

650
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,740
and I'm gonna cheat on her today at the golf course.

651
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,740
- With the hole.

652
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,580
- With the hole.

653
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,180
The hole is the girl who works there.

654
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,380
- That's how leprechauns are born, right?

655
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Is that you fuck the golf hole

656
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,500
and then a leprechaun comes out in nine months.

657
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,380
- That's how I was born, 'cause I was born to golf.

658
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
- You're not a leprechaun.

659
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,260
- Yeah, my mother was Mother Earth.

660
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,100
- I'm looking at some-- - Through the golf course.

661
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,700
- Evian art and preg gifts right now.

662
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,620
- Stop looking at disgusting stuff and golf with me, dude.

663
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,020
- Well-- - You'll fly me out.

664
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,580
- Okay, you know what golf stands for?

665
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,100
- What? - And preg football.

666
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,980
- Gentlemen's only life fun.

667
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,380
- Gentlemen's enjoying life fancily.

668
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,840
Yeah. Green old, green old leaves and friends.

669
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,820
Golfing, awesome, lovely fun.

670
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,380
Great old life to fulfill.

671
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:39,140
Just, just, just, just awesome, loving fun.

672
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,580
Great old, great old laughing friends.

673
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,780
I love golf.

674
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,900
You guys want to play golf? Yeah.

675
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,260
Great old laughing friends.

676
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,860
How about we throw on an episode of Mind of Mencia?

677
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,940
Let's do a Jeff Dunham special.

678
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Yeah, Mind of Mencia, me, I need the awesome, fun,

679
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,720
my favorite, favorite show is a show called Mind of Mencia.

680
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,960
Wow, that's good.

681
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,040
Yeah, I think my new favorite comedian,

682
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,780
I mean, it's gotta be Tiger Woods.

683
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,420
(laughing)

684
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,900
- Yeah, it's gotta be the Tiger Woods.

685
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,660
- You know, he's not that funny, but his swing.

686
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,820
- Yeah.

687
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,700
I mean, it's funny that he did--

688
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
- It's funny that his wife hit him with a golf club.

689
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,980
'Cause that's the last thing a golfer is expecting

690
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,100
is for your weapon to betray you.

691
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,780
- Yeah. - Yeah.

692
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,660
- Yeah, you know that came out of left field to him.

693
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,260
He was like, what have you done?

694
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,100
- Left field?

695
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,340
You mean the green?

696
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,500
- Yeah, left green. - Come on, man.

697
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
- Left, the left side of the green is what I meant.

698
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,340
- Yeah, you're right.

699
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,240
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

700
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,500
- You're a fake golfer.

701
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,180
- I'm sorry dude, I need to take a Xanax, dude.

702
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,720
- Do you, have you done mini golfing before?

703
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,620
- I'm about to play many different rounds of golf.

704
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
- Have you not played mini golf before?

705
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,580
- 18 to be exact.

706
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,700
- I've played mini golf, dude.

707
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,080
- So, okay.

708
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,740
- Come on, who do you think I am?

709
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,660
- Well, you said you'd never played golf before.

710
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,900
I would assume you would at least put,

711
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,740
say something about whether you played mini golf.

712
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,060
- Well, because I take golf so seriously,

713
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,140
I actually have decided that mini golf is not golf.

714
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,060
- What would you do if you saw Bill Murray?

715
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,500
Anything isn't the main thing.

716
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
A miniature horse is not a horse.

717
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,780
- What would you do if you saw Bill Murray

718
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,740
at the golf course?

719
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,180
- Beat him.

720
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
- Yeah?

721
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,860
- At golf.

722
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,680
- Okay.

723
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,340
- Easily, without him blinking.

724
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,180
- All right.

725
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,460
- Would you also beat him physically?

726
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,020
- No, dude, he's an old man.

727
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,700
I don't wanna, and also, I don't wanna end up

728
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,660
in a Zombieland situation.

729
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,140
- Okay.

730
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,220
I haven't seen Zombieland in so long.

731
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
- He's a, I don't remember.

732
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,140
- He's in there and they go like, "Bill Murray?"

733
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,500
Yeah, and it's kind of a lesson to all comedians

734
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,580
that a prank might get you killed one day.

735
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,540
Does he get killed from a prank in that movie?

736
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,900
He pretends to be a zombie or something, right?

737
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,360
And then they kill him for real?

738
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,820
I don't know, I haven't seen that since it probably came out.

739
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,380
Well, I think it might be my new favorite movie.

740
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,060
Is that true?

741
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,180
Yeah, actually I think, you know what my favorite movie's

742
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,620
gotta be, The Longest Yard.

743
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,460
No, that's not--

744
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,280
Is that a golf movie?

745
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
No.

746
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,940
It's gotta be the--

747
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,980
Are there golf movies?

748
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,860
Yeah, there's the greatest game ever played

749
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,100
- Starring Shia LaBeouf. - There's Caddy Shaq,

750
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,340
obviously.

751
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,740
- Do you guys think that I'm up to snuff

752
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,940
for the beautiful game?

753
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,300
- Here, okay, popular movies about golf.

754
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,620
- Yeah, greatest game ever played.

755
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,340
- Seven Days in Utopia.

756
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,300
- Happy Gilmore.

757
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,820
- The Short Game, Tommy's Honor,

758
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,300
the greatest game ever played,

759
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,380
Who's Your Caddy, From the Rough,

760
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,220
The Legend of Bagger Vance.

761
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,580
- Nice. - Birdie and Bogey.

762
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,740
I coulda guessed that one.

763
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,740
- How 'bout The Legend of Baggy Pants?

764
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,880
- Walt Disney's Donald's Golf Game.

765
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,500
- Yeah, that might be the one for me.

766
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,900
- Practicalgolf.com, the definitive list of golf movies.

767
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,400
I guess we shouldn't do a list, huh?

768
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,580
- Sieve the movie?

769
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,740
- I think I'm gonna get into Impractical Jokers

770
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,580
and learn all their names.

771
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,220
- There are more golf movies than I expected.

772
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,020
- Yeah, you know what, Caleb?

773
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,580
You could be like Dorf.

774
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,240
You could be like Dorf on golf.

775
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,940
- I don't know who Dorf is.

776
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,820
Just look up Dorf 'cause he's your height.

777
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,660
Nope.

778
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,720
He's the same height as you.

779
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,980
Oh, he's like an inch taller than you?

780
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,220
That's cool.

781
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,060
No.

782
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,020
Yeah.

783
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,260
You look like Dorf.

784
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,340
Not with my golf shoes on,

785
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,700
the spikes give me an extra inch.

786
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,100
You look like Dorf.

787
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:24,940
You do look like Dorf.

788
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,180
That's the whole reason I like it.

789
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,580
I'm gonna get into ballroom dancing,

790
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,420
girl stuff.

791
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,980
No, no, I mean in the face.

792
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,340
In the face, you look like Dorf.

793
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,540
I don't look like Dorf.

794
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,820
You know, I look like Phil Mickelson.

795
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
No, you look like Dorf.

796
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,580
I look like Rory McIlroy.

797
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,460
Who?

798
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,520
- So, you would know who that was.

799
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,280
He's a golfer. - Well, why don't you tell us?

800
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,840
- He's basically one of the best golfers.

801
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,920
He's hit tons of wins, and he's got--

802
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,420
- Oh, dude, we should watch this movie, "Golf Balls!"

803
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,160
With an exclamation point at the end, from 1999.

804
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,680
- I'll watch any golf movie.

805
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,200
- "When the Penny Tree Golf Club faces closing their doors

806
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
"due to rival Bentwood stealing their business,

807
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,940
"John Penny Tree and his daughter Liberty

808
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,780
"fight back with alternative tactics

809
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,600
"to draw a new audience in the raunchy comedy, 'Golf Balls!'"

810
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,360
- John Penny Tree? - This sounds really good.

811
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,200
- Do you eat cigars?

812
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,160
- Yeah.

813
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,480
- Have you been eating it?

814
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,640
I've been kind of chewing on it

815
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,560
and some it's gotten my mouth and now I have a headache.

816
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,140
- No matter what they say, I really liked this film.

817
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,920
It should be put in league with classics

818
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
like bikini carwash.

819
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,280
The theme of the broken down business

820
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,520
has been done to death.

821
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,960
Bikini, hotel, drive-in and bistro,

822
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,160
as well as the erotic house of wax.

823
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,920
But this one does it with style.

824
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,560
The use of the diver was brilliant.

825
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,720
I just hope the next generation

826
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
can come up with some new ideas

827
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,360
because the bikini ID mail is running short.

828
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,580
They made a film called Bikini Traffic School for Pete's sake.

829
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,460
What is next, Bikini Mining Camp?

830
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,640
Just wait, if they get desperate, they just might do it.

831
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,920
Maybe I should copyright it.

832
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,840
- That's a good idea. - I think--

833
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
- That's a good review.

834
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,460
- In my post-game interview today, after I win,

835
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,620
right, after I win the tournament,

836
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,720
when they asked me, "Caleb, first time golfing.

837
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,860
"You came in, you beat some legends.

838
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,740
You beat Fred Flintstone.

839
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,740
Fred Astaire.

840
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,860
Yeah, you beat all these guys.

841
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,300
You beat, I mean, you beat Trippy--

842
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,140
Fred Golf.

843
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,660
You beat Trippy Fred.

844
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,300
You beat Trippy Fred.

845
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,040
And you beat Drippy Fred.

846
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,460
And the entire time, I mean, what do you have to say?

847
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,020
I would say, first off, if you wear a mask, you're gay.

848
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,100
Second off, I'd like to thank Jesus Christ

849
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:28,980
for giving me the power.

850
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,920
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

851
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Yeah.

852
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,360
- Will you bring your knife to the golf course?

853
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,720
- I'm gonna bring my knife and I'm basically

854
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,280
gonna memorize a bunch of different,

855
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,360
I'm gonna have a new Bible verse

856
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,480
for every single time I swing.

857
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,320
- Wow.

858
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,140
- I'm gonna turn back to the crowd.

859
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,240
- Give us the first one.

860
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,040
- I'm gonna do John 3, 16.

861
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,240
- Just say it, just say it.

862
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,400
- For God so loved the world,

863
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,440
he gave his only begotten or forgotten.

864
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
He got, God so loved the world.

865
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,440
- God got it.

866
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,480
- God so loved the world that he got his son.

867
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,320
- God got crazy.

868
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,320
And then I'll give a big thumbs up, you know?

869
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,000
I might do an end zone dance when I win.

870
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,900
Yeah, there's no end zone in golf.

871
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm gonna do the Dougie somewhere.

872
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,960
Okay.

873
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,880
Wherever I do the Dougie is the end zone.

874
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,320
Yeah, they should call it the Golfie.

875
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,160
That's right.

876
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,640
What kind of music should I listen to on the course?

877
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,680
Odd Future, dude.

878
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,200
Golf Wang.

879
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
Odd Future, I think, is a little too--

880
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
They say golf in the songs.

881
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,440
Yeah.

882
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,160
Mm, I don't know if that's enough for me.

883
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,560
- They say golf in the songs.

884
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,160
They make shirts that say golf on it.

885
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,680
- I might listen to like one rap song

886
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
that came out when I was in college

887
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,440
and really, and it'll be the only one that I ever know.

888
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,340
Something, kind of rap that they listen to at a wedding.

889
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,880
- Oh, White Iverson, some, no not White Iverson,

890
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
but maybe like Congratulations.

891
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,920
- Or like a Black Eyed Peas song, right?

892
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,760
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,680
- When I do it, I'll do a bunch of exaggerated

894
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,960
hand movements, you know, and really get into it.

895
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,800
- Ooh, you could dice roll walk, dude.

896
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,640
What's that?

897
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
- It's when you like.

898
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,240
- Dude, I could dice roll walk.

899
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
That's a really good idea.

900
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,880
My goal is to, I'm trying to get a video on a bar stool.

901
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,920
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

902
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,420
- Yeah.

903
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,520
I found this other movie that we could watch,

904
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,800
if we wanted, called Hole in One from 2009.

905
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,160
And now it says here,

906
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,400
even though this movie has the tagline,

907
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,800
"American Pie Plays Golf,"

908
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,960
this movie has nothing to do

909
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,640
with the American Pie Presents series.

910
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,320
And on IMDb, it has some plot keywords here.

911
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,040
I think you're going to be interested in these.

912
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Can I guess them?

913
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Plot.

914
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Yeah.

915
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Sex.

916
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Are you going to...

917
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Oh, he froze.

918
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
I'm back.

919
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Sorry.

920
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
I was thinking of golf.

921
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Quick meditation.

922
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,840
Just guess them so I can say them.

923
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
There's 19 of them.

924
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,640
Golf.

925
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
That's one of them.

926
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Hole.

927
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Nope.

928
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Getting hole.

929
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Swing.

930
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
No.

931
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Green.

932
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Green hole.

933
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Putt.

934
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
All right.

935
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
I'm going to read these, okay?

936
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Shit!

937
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Shit is one of them.

938
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Lesbian kiss.

939
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
*Gasp*

940
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Black comedy.

941
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Golf.

942
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Surgeon.

943
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Bet.

944
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Plastic surgeon.

945
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Girlfriend.

946
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
College.

947
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Golf club.

948
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Ball.

949
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Sexual humor.

950
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Student.

951
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Golf ball.

952
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
University student.

953
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
College student.

954
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
University.

955
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Female nudity.

956
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Nudity.

957
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
And boy wears eyeglasses.

958
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,640
Wow.

959
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
That's good.

960
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
That's good that they put that in there so I know never to watch it.

961
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,640
I'm gonna hate boys who wear eyeglasses.

962
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,800
- Dude, I'm gonna make some off-color jokes on the course.

963
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
- Yeah. - Yeah.

964
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,460
- I'm really thinking about it.

965
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,300
I might-- - You should,

966
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,740
you could watch this to get some ideas.

967
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,040
This seems raunchy. - Yeah, and you know,

968
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,480
and you know, you could just make fun

969
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,020
of some of the guys at the office.

970
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,980
- Yeah, I think I might.

971
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,060
I think I might, I might walk in and call my boss

972
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,880
a fat piece of shit, but boy do I love him to death.

973
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,720
- Yeah. - Yeah.

974
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,540
- Thanks for everything you do for me, man.

975
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,380
Glad we're both rich.

976
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,260
Yeah, it's honestly, it's hard,

977
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,980
it's really hard being rich, you know?

978
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,140
I went, I got a bagel earlier.

979
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,980
- Yeah.

980
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,860
'cause you have to fuel up for the course.

981
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,360
I got a bagel, it was $8.49 for the combo.

982
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,360
But she said $8.49 and I said, huh, $849?

983
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,960
It's pretty cheap for breakfast.

984
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,220
Oh my God.

985
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,140
Yeah.

986
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,980
Are you serious, dude?

987
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,820
Did you say that?

988
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,100
Do you guys wanna see 100 ducks?

989
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,940
Yeah.

990
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,100
You wanna see a $100 bill?

991
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,940
Yeah. Sure.

992
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,980
I'm not even kidding, I have one.

993
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,820
Really?

994
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,980
Pull it up, come on.

995
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
I mean, look, look.

996
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Dude, that's paper.

997
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700
Look at that, dude.

998
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Ben Franklin was a famous golfer.

999
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
That's why he...

1000
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,700
He golfed? He invented those glasses to

1001
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
see the hole better.

1002
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah, he doesn't even have glasses on here, but you're right.

1003
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
Well, you know the glasses he invented.

1004
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
Dude, I'm...

1005
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Here's the plan.

1006
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm gonna

1007
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
go play golf.

1008
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm gonna get off. I'm gonna pretend that I'm tired.

1009
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,700
You're gonna get off?

1010
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,340
- That's the plan, yeah, go hit the locker,

1011
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,340
hit the showers, go get off, you know?

1012
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,940
- You're gonna jack off in the showers at the golf course.

1013
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,980
- What do you think a sauna's for?

1014
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,040
Why do you think a sauna has a lock on the door?

1015
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,920
- Yeah, why do you think a sauna has rocks in there?

1016
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,980
- Yeah, 'cause you get your rocks off.

1017
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,220
- You flatten.

1018
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,060
- Exactly.

1019
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,300
- Oh, that must be, okay.

1020
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,740
- So you can burn, you come into the rocks

1021
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,860
and then that's what makes all the steam.

1022
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,700
- Yeah.

1023
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,520
- Kinda makes like, yeah.

1024
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,260
- Yeah, that's why it smells so weird in there.

1025
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,100
- Yeah.

1026
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,820
- Yeah, oh fuck, smells like salt.

1027
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,220
(laughing)

1028
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,200
- Smells like sulfur, dude. - Going to the doctor

1029
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,220
and like, it seems like your lungs are saturated

1030
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,740
with like cum.

1031
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,860
- I have, there's a thick cum layer.

1032
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,580
- Yeah, I've been hitting the YMCA after the golf course.

1033
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,420
(laughing)

1034
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,940
- It looks like, yeah, it looks like a smoker's lung,

1035
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,780
but it's white.

1036
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,460
- Yeah, immediately try and change the subject.

1037
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Do you like the back nine or the front nine more?

1038
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,540
Which one do you like more?

1039
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,580
Anyway, I'm gonna go down to Ruth's Chris,

1040
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,980
get a prime rib well done,

1041
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,740
Throw some 81 steak sauce and ketchup on it.

1042
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,380
I'm going back to the YMCA.

1043
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,380
No reason.

1044
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,540
No reason at all.

1045
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,980
Just kind of being normal down there.

1046
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,700
I think I gotta go clear my lungs out in the sauna again.

1047
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,740
I gotta get back into the sauna.

1048
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,740
Yeah, I know you're trying to give me advice, Doc, but I think I'm just gonna go back to

1049
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,740
that sauna.

1050
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:16,020
Do you know any doctors who are golfers that maybe you could refer me to?

1051
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,020
Because I feel like there's a big difference here.

1052
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,900
You're disrespecting me right now.

1053
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,820
I guess you're right. You know what? I'm just going to go see a sports scientist.

1054
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,580
I'm just going to go visit a sports scientist. I think he'll have a better idea of kind of

1055
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
what I'm doing.

1056
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Sports scientist.

1057
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,580
Yeah.

1058
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,020
One of those guys who writes books that are like, "The physics of a successful dunk."

1059
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:46,540
It's 80 pages. You get it for your dad. It sits in his bathroom, still in the wrapper

1060
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,260
for years until he gives it away.

1061
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,800
It's like, yeah, well, I don't know anything about your lung,

1062
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,420
but did you know that a golf club can move at 10 miles per hour

1063
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,500
when you're swinging it?

1064
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,300
Gee, Doc, that's nice.

1065
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,220
Thanks, Doc.

1066
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,700
Yeah, can you prescribe me a Klonopin?

1067
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,220
Say no more.

1068
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,820
Say no fucking more, dude.

1069
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,140
I don't mean to derail and go back to this hole-in-one movie,

1070
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,500
but I'm reading the user reviews

1071
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,100
and I've just found out what the plot is,

1072
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,460
and I think the tags really kind of buried the lead here.

1073
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,300
Really?

1074
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:24,840
movie is that the main character Eric he loses a bet my brother's name he he

1075
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,260
probably the same guy is it about my brother?

1076
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,240
oh yeah well just listen to this he loses a golf bet to two weirdos who happen to

1077
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,440
be plastic surgeons since he can't pay them the money they then freaking

1078
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,200
electrocute him to knock him out and give him hold on tight for this one tits and

1079
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,280
that is the whole plot the rest of the film is Eric trying to hide his new

1080
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,440
double D's and finding a way of getting rid of them. It's just a it's a it's a

1081
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:57,880
golf a golf guy with a golf movie about a guy who gets boobs and has to hide them. Wow.

1082
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:08,760
Well it's gentlemen only ladies forbidden is what golf actually does

1083
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:17,840
stand for so yeah so walking around with your tits out dude yeah yeah especially

1084
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:22,440
as a golfer dude if I see a Bernie Sanders sticker today on a fucking car

1085
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,640
I'm gonna go ballistic yeah I'm gonna break some windshields you can and they

1086
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,360
won't get mad at you well they can't do them higher status in them I'm a golfer

1087
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,920
mm-hmm the upper echelon listen to this review so I heard it is not a part of

1088
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,060
of the famous American Pie series.

1089
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,160
But, being a collector, I ought to watch it.

1090
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,000
(laughing)

1091
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,120
- A collector of American Pie?

1092
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,960
- Yeah, dude.

1093
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
- Not much of a story present,

1094
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,420
but when half-baked characters play ball

1095
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,060
with the sinister intention of overtaking

1096
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,160
a low-profile clothing firm, the plot goes awry.

1097
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,280
Fake boob transplants cause the lead character

1098
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,440
and his friend to set on a quest to collect 50 grand.

1099
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,220
The supporting cast play their farce balls

1100
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,040
to create gross humor.

1101
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,680
Other than some flesh show, horseplay, and slapstick,

1102
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,300
it has nothing more to consider.

1103
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,180
Bottom line, if you're a fan or collector

1104
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,180
of such run-down teen movies, give it a try.

1105
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,660
If you're not, stay away.

1106
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
And the last line is,

1107
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,100
can be watched with a typical Indian family?

1108
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,940
No.

1109
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,180
(laughing)

1110
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,500
- That's what I'm always asking

1111
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,340
whenever I watch a movie. - Dude, I would love

1112
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,580
to be a collector of those movies

1113
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
that they try to make you think there's tits

1114
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,420
in the movie based on the cover.

1115
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1116
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,500
- And also it's called like, school fuck.

1117
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,540
- Yeah. - Or whatever.

1118
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,860
- Yeah. - And then you watch it

1119
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,380
and it's just like a, it's just a super bad rip-off.

1120
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,200
Yeah, yeah, dude. I need more movies like that. I watch those with my Indian family

1121
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,800
Did I might put one on my Android phone and watch it on the course?

1122
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,060
Oh, yeah, why you can't watch actually I don't I have a Windows. I have a Windows 10 phone. Yeah. Mm-hmm

1123
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,820
I have a I have a golf phone. Yeah, that's right. I

1124
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,540
Have a flip up goal. You don't know you don't have that. I do you just say you're Cameron

1125
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,660
I just came in the mail. No, it didn't. No, really? Yeah. No, there's only one in the world

1126
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,700
There's only one in the world and I have it right here now. They lied to you

1127
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,580
There was one in the world till they made mine.

1128
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,420
- No.

1129
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,860
- Yeah, it's a golf ball and it has one button

1130
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,380
and it calls 911.

1131
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,340
- No, it calls 1-800-I-love-golf.

1132
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,940
- It only calls 911.

1133
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,620
- It can only call 911 and I'm allowed to do it

1134
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
whenever I want.

1135
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,340
- Yeah, you call 911 to tell them

1136
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,580
that you got a hole in one.

1137
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
- Yeah.

1138
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,260
- That's what 9-1-1 said.

1139
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,080
- Are you proud of me, 911?

1140
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,700
- Nine means the hole 'cause it has a hole in it.

1141
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,300
- Well, nine, one, if one means eight.

1142
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,000
- Well, the first nine is the hole, it means hole.

1143
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,800
One stands for in and one stands for one.

1144
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,960
So it means hole in one.

1145
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,920
Yep.

1146
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,760
That's so true.

1147
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,360
Nine, no, it's nine for nine iron, one, no.

1148
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,200
No.

1149
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,020
One.

1150
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,960
Listen, we could sit here and argue about

1151
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,560
how 911 is related to golf all day.

1152
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,760
But what we do know is that it's made for golfers

1153
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
and it's by golfers.

1154
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,800
That's right.

1155
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,640
Yeah.

1156
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,720
It's, I don't wanna say that.

1157
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,920
Yeah, I was about to say it too.

1158
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,920
(laughing)

1159
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,520
I don't even know what you were gonna say.

1160
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,520
- Mm, think about fooboo, but instead of ooh, do guh.

1161
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,400
- And say that.

1162
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,140
- And now say that.

1163
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,940
- Fig big?

1164
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,760
- Fug bug.

1165
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,060
Fug bug.

1166
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,220
- Yeah dude, I'm so excited to start exercising,

1167
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,620
I just got my fig big.

1168
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,840
It's gonna calculate so much stuff for me.

1169
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,880
- I hope people don't make fun of my golf bag

1170
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,800
and just call it a fugabug.

1171
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,920
- That would, I would get so owned on the course

1172
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,560
for something like that.

1173
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,440
- That would be disappointing.

1174
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,320
- For my little, I don't know man.

1175
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
I just have to get, I gotta get tuned in

1176
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,520
to the golf lifestyle and golf culture.

1177
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,040
- Yeah, I agree 'cause you're not--

1178
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
- I don't mean to, 'cause I'm not there yet,

1179
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,960
but I don't mean to dominate, I don't mean to,

1180
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,400
do you guys have any sports that you just recently

1181
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,440
got into in the last couple hours?

1182
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:10,000
Nope. No. Are you serious? I mean, I don't talk about it much, but I've been a, uh, I've

1183
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,480
played croquet my whole life. Yeah, I'm really, I'm really into bocce, but you don't hear me

1184
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,160
like, yeah, like tooting my own horn on the show. I mean, I, I tend to like, you know,

1185
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,640
view the show as someplace, some way to like entertain the fans and like give back to them

1186
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,520
instead of just like going on for like 40 minutes about my own personal interests and

1187
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,040
like kind of like dominating the entire episode but I'm sorry you guys why I'm

1188
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,200
sorry I am can you take that can you take that

1189
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,440
out of your mouth I know you feel bad but you don't have to put poop in your mouth

1190
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:53,240
just because you're a cigar and taste amazing it looks like a Cuba it looks

1191
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,960
like a big it looks like a big shit it doesn't look like a big shit it looks

1192
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,680
- It looks like a bunch of delicately wrapped tobacco leaves.

1193
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,140
- It looks like-- - No, it's delicately

1194
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,860
wrapped poop leaves.

1195
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,040
- Come on, dude, we're trying to do

1196
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,680
a family-friendly thing here.

1197
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,040
- A family-friendly thing.

1198
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,880
- Come on, dude.

1199
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,640
- Oh yeah, a family-friendly thing, sure.

1200
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,080
That makes sense.

1201
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,440
- All right, well what do you guys wanna talk about?

1202
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,560
If you don't wanna talk about my cracked swing

1203
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,200
and how fucking swag I am.

1204
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
- I'm gonna crack you with one swing.

1205
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,240
- How much of a beast I am, dude.

1206
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,080
- Amen.

1207
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:31,080
I'm gonna turn to a beast and crack you.

1208
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,200
I'm gonna throw my little towel on your head.

1209
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,160
My little golf towel that sits on my bag,

1210
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,640
it's going on your head and you won't be able to see.

1211
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,500
I'm gonna eat you in one bite.

1212
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,200
I'll eat you in one bite.

1213
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,400
Yeah, you couldn't eat me.

1214
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,160
I'll cover you in my mouth.

1215
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,920
No, no, you definitely couldn't eat me in one bite.

1216
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,920
I think I might be able to see an alligator

1217
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,600
on the course today and make a viral video.

1218
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,400
I'm gonna throw my mouth over you like a net, Caleb.

1219
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,240
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1220
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,480
(laughing)

1221
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,400
Wrong sport.

1222
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,100
- You know, maybe I'm into fishing.

1223
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,080
- No, you don't, no, no, no, no, no.

1224
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,000
You don't get to fucking switch it

1225
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,240
in the middle of the episode.

1226
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,280
- Why? - No.

1227
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,760
- Why, 'cause, dude, I'm a fisherman,

1228
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,600
and I'm always doing one. - No, you're not a fisherman.

1229
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,520
- I was born a fisherman. - You're not, no, no.

1230
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,160
- How many times have you fished?

1231
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,960
- Like, like three or four times.

1232
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,360
- I fish more than that. - You're not a fisherman.

1233
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,480
- I mean, I've caught a shark before.

1234
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,980
No.

1235
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,320
You've never-- what the fuck are you talking about?

1236
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,560
I caught a great white shark.

1237
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,720
Caleb's going to be off the show pretty soon.

1238
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,840
I caught a great white shark with a worm

1239
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,040
and a piece of dental floss.

1240
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,080
You did not catch a great white shark.

1241
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,640
I caught him.

1242
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,080
I saved thousands of lives.

1243
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,520
You never-- you never did that.

1244
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,320
You caused thousands of deaths.

1245
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,820
Yeah.

1246
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,480
You brought the--

1247
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,640
Of different fish, yeah.

1248
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,120
No.

1249
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,400
Because I'm so good at fishing.

1250
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,160
A real fisherman never kills the fish.

1251
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,640
OK?

1252
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,080
All fishermen are real fishermen,

1253
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
because you've got a reel in your dam.

1254
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,600
No, no.

1255
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,600
That's exactly what a fake fisherman would say.

1256
00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:01,600
You don't know CPR. Yeah I do. Catch pussy and release it. See you were already messed up.

1257
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:10,400
Catch fish with a... okay catch prune... no catch piss off and release.

1258
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,240
So you catch the fish you say you're a fucking stupid fish until they start

1259
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,480
wriggling around. They don't do that. Throw them back. No. Yeah. It doesn't happen.

1260
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,680
So you threw back the great white shark?

1261
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
No that one I kept.

1262
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
You put a great white shark back in the water.

1263
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
So okay let's see it then.

1264
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
You kept it.

1265
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
Where is it?

1266
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Let's see it.

1267
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Well he's huge and it would take a while.

1268
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,080
Yeah exactly so it would be really easy to see because it's huge.

1269
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,000
I mounted him on a piece of wood and turned him into a billy bass.

1270
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,680
Great let's see it.

1271
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,440
He sings the shark, he sings the Jaws song.

1272
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,480
Okay let's hear it.

1273
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,840
He goes, he moves his head and goes, "Donna."

1274
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,320
I don't want to hear you sing it, I want to see him do it.

1275
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Let's see it.

1276
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
"Donna, Donna."

1277
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Let's see your shark.

1278
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
He's over there.

1279
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
He's like right out of frame.

1280
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,000
- Turn the camera. - I can't, dude.

1281
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,600
I accidentally glued my computer.

1282
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,920
- All right, Caleb's not a fisherman or a golfer or a golf.

1283
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,400
- You did not glue your computer.

1284
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,680
- I spilled a bunch of glue.

1285
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,000
I was trying to fix a golf club,

1286
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,680
spilled a bunch of glue all over my desk.

1287
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,560
- You did not put glue-- - You said you weren't

1288
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,720
a golfer anymore.

1289
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,440
- Well, that was back when I was.

1290
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,680
- So if you're not a golfer anymore,

1291
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,720
can you give me your golf reservations?

1292
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,360
- Sorry, the PGA Tour's calling me.

1293
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,200
Hold on.

1294
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,560
- Yeah, you're going on a PGA Tour.

1295
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,340
- Hey, what's up, PGA Tour?

1296
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,560
Yeah, no, I'll be there.

1297
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,760
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the PGA Tour definitely.

1298
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,640
Okay, cool.

1299
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,440
Sorry, a little work business I do at Tick Tock.

1300
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,200
Yeah, you got one of those Chinese spam calls

1301
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,040
and you were trying to figure--

1302
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,500
No, no, no, I would not.

1303
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,520
I don't know any Chinese.

1304
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,120
I couldn't even point the China on a map.

1305
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,280
So I can call it back.

1306
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,100
Okay.

1307
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,520
Here, wait, I'll dial right now.

1308
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,480
It's 555.

1309
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,560
Okay.

1310
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,400
555.

1311
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,220
Wait, I don't have my phone open.

1312
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,680
Okay, wait, wait.

1313
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,760
Hey, 555.

1314
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,840
555.

1315
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,680
555.

1316
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,240
Five, five, five, five.

1317
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,600
Five, five, five, five, all right.

1318
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,440
Yeah.

1319
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,820
I don't believe that's a number.

1320
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:57,360
See, I told you, it's not real.

1321
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,980
Well, you know, coronavirus.

1322
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,880
So.

1323
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,640
You think coronavirus isn't real?

1324
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,360
Various things, well, of course not,

1325
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,080
but various things are closed because of a different.

1326
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,040
But they just called you, so.

1327
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,720
They're gonna try and vaccinate me on the course,

1328
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,560
and I'm saying no.

1329
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,380
(laughs)

1330
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm gonna hit 'em with a big N-O, dude.

1331
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,800
- Yeah, you keep that thing away from my hole.

1332
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,960
- Yeah, there's gonna be a big sign that says FEMA camp

1333
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,440
that's crossed out and it says golf course underneath

1334
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,240
and on like a piece of printer paper.

1335
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,200
I'm gonna be like, yeah, you just have to take this,

1336
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,440
you just have to put this lava in your arm

1337
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,920
and then you can definitely play golf

1338
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,760
and we aren't gonna put you--

1339
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,840
- Yeah, the first hole is inside this tent.

1340
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,680
Get in there.

1341
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,760
- Actually, the first hole is that meat grinder over there.

1342
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,160
You see that hole?

1343
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,520
Yeah, you just jump in that.

1344
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,120
- Yeah, just climb to the top of that 5G tower.

1345
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,400
The 5G is five golfs.

1346
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
- Put the 5G ball in your mouth.

1347
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,760
- 5Golfing.

1348
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
- Yeah, you wanna get five good?

1349
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,760
- Five good shots.

1350
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,880
- You gotta get 5G.

1351
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,920
Dude, I mean, I've never loved anything

1352
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,240
as much as I love the beautiful game.

1353
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,280
- Which game? - You don't love golf.

1354
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
- Fishing or golf.

1355
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,600
I can't remember which one I'm back on.

1356
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,480
- See, see, fucking look at this shit.

1357
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,320
- Whatever, dude.

1358
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,720
- It's pitiful, it's pitiful.

1359
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,240
- It's pitsiful.

1360
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,080
I'm thinking of getting--

1361
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,680
- Maybe that's why that's your last name.

1362
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,720
- Yeah, you're Caleb Pitsiful.

1363
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,040
- It's not, dude.

1364
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,360
Can we just make some New Year's resolutions?

1365
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,480
- Nope. - No.

1366
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,840
- New Year already passed.

1367
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,900
- Exactly.

1368
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,980
- Can we make some for next year?

1369
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,820
- No. - No.

1370
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,900
- I don't wanna make anything with you anymore.

1371
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,440
- Yeah. - This is one of the

1372
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,720
worst days of my life. - You completely abused

1373
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,880
your friendship with us.

1374
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,020
- How? - Mm-hmm.

1375
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,240
- To talk about golf.

1376
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,080
- What do you guys wanna talk about?

1377
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,600
- We talked about golf for 47 minutes.

1378
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,720
- Are you impressed?

1379
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,600
No. No.

1380
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,360
Have I proved that I'm a real golfer?

1381
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,520
No. No, 'cause now you're

1382
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,000
a fisherman or something.

1383
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,480
Well.

1384
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,760
I can be both, I just decided.

1385
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,600
No, you can't.

1386
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,960
You can't be both.

1387
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Yeah, you already know you can't synergize something

1388
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,480
'cause you couldn't synergize golf and golf,

1389
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,840
which is probably the easiest thing in the world to combine.

1390
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,360
I'm pretty much bi, so.

1391
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,040
So now you're something else.

1392
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,880
I think I'm even--

1393
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,200
That's not even a real thing.

1394
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,040
Yeah, now you're this fake thing.

1395
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,880
I'm getting in the game by sexual nature.

1396
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,280
This thing that doesn't exist, I've never heard of.

1397
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,080
- Yeah, I'm gonna become bisexual

1398
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,440
instead of golfing or fishing.

1399
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,720
- Yeah, I'm bi-golfer-fishual.

1400
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,560
- Yep, I'm gonna do both.

1401
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,440
- That means I'm golfer-fishual.

1402
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,280
- I'm gonna hit the pier.

1403
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,880
- That means I golf and I fish.

1404
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,840
- I'm gonna hit the pier.

1405
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,800
There's gonna be some scruffy fishermen

1406
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,840
tights right next to me. - I'm gonna hit my pier.

1407
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,000
- Great day to fish, man.

1408
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,600
I'm bisexual.

1409
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,440
Do you--

1410
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,440
- They're gonna throw you in the water

1411
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,520
if you say that to a fisher.

1412
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,600
- Got any interest in that?

1413
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,800
And they'll be like, "Wait, so you're gay?"

1414
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
And I'll be like, "No, dude, get this.

1415
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,640
I'm gay and I'm straight.

1416
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,480
- Yeah. - Okay, all right.

1417
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
- I'm twice as gay.

1418
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,840
- As long as you're straight while you're fishing.

1419
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,000
And I say no other way, dude.

1420
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,840
- No, they will not accept you.

1421
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,280
- Yeah, unless you're fishing off of a fucking Navy boat.

1422
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,600
- They're gonna throw you back.

1423
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,400
- Dude, the Navy's full of just homo sailors.

1424
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,720
I think I'm joining the Navy.

1425
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,560
- Okay, good.

1426
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,600
- You know what it was?

1427
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,960
I was deciding that I've been watching Forged in Fire.

1428
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,400
I was getting into swords and I was gonna buy a forge.

1429
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,680
- Yeah, that's right, you were a blacksmith too last week.

1430
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,240
- Yeah, I wasn't a blacksmith, dude.

1431
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,800
- You said you were gonna get a forge and make a sword.

1432
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,640
- I got a blacksmith.

1433
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,460
- I got a blacksmith.

1434
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,800
- I got a forge man.

1435
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,640
- A forge man.

1436
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,600
- You're a forge man.

1437
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,440
- It's not a thing.

1438
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,920
- And a golfer and a fisherman and a goth.

1439
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,360
- I contain many multitudes.

1440
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,200
- No you don't.

1441
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,040
- No.

1442
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,860
- And I'm a sports scientist too.

1443
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,800
- You have nothing inside of you.

1444
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,120
- You're not a sport, don't, don't, don't.

1445
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,080
- Oh, if I'm not a sports scientist,

1446
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,120
how'd I come up with this question?

1447
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,320
If a soccer ball is moving at 30 miles per hour

1448
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,400
and then baseball is moving at 20 miles per hour,

1449
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,640
and they're both heading towards me

1450
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,840
'cause I'm catching both due to my multiple sport abilities.

1451
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,520
- That's a math problem. - Like Bo Jackson.

1452
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,360
- That's a math problem.

1453
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,760
This is a sports science problem.

1454
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,320
This is a sports science problem.

1455
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,460
Could you play water polo on a train?

1456
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,020
- Oh, wow.

1457
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:57,920
- That's sports science.

1458
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,680
Math would be if I said how many miles

1459
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,720
could the train travel towards

1460
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,000
when you were playing water polo on a pool

1461
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,840
moving 100 miles per hour.

1462
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,480
- Maybe I'm a sports math petition.

1463
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,320
- All right, that's fine.

1464
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,880
- You're not, you're not, dude.

1465
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,960
- That's the one thing you can be.

1466
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,800
- Okay.

1467
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,520
- No, he can't be anything else.

1468
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,660
- I'll agree on that.

1469
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,500
- Don't encourage this.

1470
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,400
- Okay, well, now he's not a golfer or a fisherman anymore.

1471
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,240
- Or a sports mathematician.

1472
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,440
- Or a Navy.

1473
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,420
- He's never gonna be true to himself.

1474
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,540
- I am true to myself.

1475
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,080
- You should be a magician, too.

1476
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,560
- I just need to find something, dude.

1477
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,560
Something for the new year.

1478
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,880
I have all this time now.

1479
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,800
I think video games have become,

1480
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,120
they're childish to me now,

1481
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,880
due to my golfing and fishing new things that I do.

1482
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,320
- That's not happening.

1483
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,000
You're not fishing or golfing.

1484
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,240
- Well, not yet, but I will be in a couple hours.

1485
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,640
I'm gonna do golf first, and then I might go fishing

1486
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,480
at midnight.

1487
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,300
- You won't fish.

1488
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,140
- I can't.

1489
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:47,980
- You're not Mike Gunna.

1490
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,760
You're not Mike Gunna.

1491
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,760
- I cannot describe how much that this is angering me.

1492
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,380
- You don't seem very angry.

1493
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,320
- I'm pissed off right now.

1494
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,960
- You can't do more than one thing.

1495
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,800
- Ah!

1496
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,760
- You know what?

1497
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,440
I've been thinking of karate moves and learning them

1498
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,280
and becoming really good at it.

1499
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,120
- No, you're not a martial artist.

1500
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,840
- And I might end up doing martial arts to you

1501
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,520
if you keep talking to me about my different interests.

1502
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,840
- All right, what martial arts moves do you know then?

1503
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,760
- Fucking kicking.

1504
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,600
- Do it.

1505
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,640
Don't get up and kick.

1506
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,320
Don't get up and kick.

1507
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,840
- Terrible form, terrible form.

1508
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,600
- I heard the rip in your pants.

1509
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,280
- I didn't rip my new plaid golf pants.

1510
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,040
- I heard your plaid pants, your plaid golf pants rip.

1511
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:41,520
I heard it. No, I didn't dude. These are 42 28s. All right. And they fit me like a glove.

1512
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,960
There's no way I'm ripping them. You're ripping. You just ripped them. I saw your thing come

1513
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,640
out of it. You guys are you guys. You're so disrespectful. I bet you don't even I bet

1514
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,800
you don't even wear I bet you don't even have golf attire. I don't. I don't. Neither do

1515
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,120
Me, what do you think I'm wearing?

1516
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,520
Ugly clothes?

1517
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,000
You're wearing my dad's clothes.

1518
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,520
It's not ugly clothes, it's a three-quarter zip

1519
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,840
and a polo, you know, I have a Boston Red Sox hat on,

1520
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,520
I'm wearing Dickies, that's kinda cheating it a little bit,

1521
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,960
but I don't have any other pants.

1522
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,240
Yeah, that's not golf pants.

1523
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,080
And I got Nike--

1524
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,400
It's not, yeah, so exactly, no,

1525
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
you literally just admitted you don't have golf clothes.

1526
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,240
Okay, I may have--

1527
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,920
And you just said, okay, so you disagree with it.

1528
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,400
I may have, listen, dude, not everything's

1529
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,600
gonna be a hole in one.

1530
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,840
- That's right, you are a hole in 1,000.

1531
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,680
- No.

1532
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,560
- Worst golfer in the world.

1533
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,400
- No.

1534
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,440
- Not every four's gonna be a nine drive.

1535
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,880
So just fucking cut me some slacks

1536
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,720
which you can win on the golf course.

1537
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,540
- No.

1538
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,180
- No, you just ripped you some slacks, dude.

1539
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,460
- Yeah, you ripped your slacks.

1540
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,300
I heard it.

1541
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,480
- Can you guys just cut me some golf?

1542
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,320
- I'll cut you.

1543
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,040
- Cut, I'm gonna cut you in half.

1544
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,920
- Can you bring a weapon onto the golf course?

1545
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,760
- I'll split you in two.

1546
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,120
- This is an important question to ask.

1547
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,160
- The golf club is technically a weapon.

1548
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,000
- Can you bring a cooler weapon though?

1549
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,840
Can you bring two weapons then?

1550
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,480
You can bring a cooler full of beer.

1551
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,320
I actually don't know if you can, because that's my worry.

1552
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:09,080
I bought this 30 rack of mix, that's what we call them, Mickey Olt's, Ultra Mickel

1553
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:16,160
Obs, and now I think because it's a public city golf course, you're probably not allowed

1554
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,160
to drink.

1555
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,160
But I'm going to do it anyway.

1556
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,160
That's probably true.

1557
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
And if I get kicked off...

1558
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,160
I hope you go to jail.

1559
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,400
If I go to jail for golf, it'll be a life well spent.

1560
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,080
What'll you become in jail?

1561
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,880
A thug.

1562
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Yeah. Yeah. I think if I get to jail, I'll become a thug.

1563
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,880
You're gonna be the first thug golfer.

1564
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,880
Yeah.

1565
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,880
It's like Thug Kitchen, dude.

1566
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,880
You can publish a book called Thug Golf Science.

1567
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,880
Yeah, this is the swag drive.

1568
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,880
Thug Golf Science.

1569
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,880
Thug Golf Science.

1570
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,880
Yo, if you hit a golf ball on the moon, what'd it do?

1571
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
That's what you would write.

1572
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Is it swag to pop a cap in a golf ball?

1573
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Yes or no question only.

1574
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,500
yeah yeah but I think I'd like to combine different that see that book wouldn't

1575
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:05,720
that would have no market because this golf science is for dads and dad will not

1576
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,000
read a thug book dad's hate thugs so much pull up your plaid pants as well

1577
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,880
dad would say turn your scally cap around yeah come on and stop hitting that golf

1578
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,640
ball all that trying to yeah trying to flatten the brain on your skin hitting

1579
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,360
- You're hitting the golf ball too hard like a thug.

1580
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,620
Knock it off.

1581
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,840
Come on, what happened to the fundamentals of the game?

1582
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,520
You're getting all flashy over there.

1583
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,360
- Yeah.

1584
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,400
- You're trying to hit it in the hole.

1585
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
- Yeah. - Come on, dude.

1586
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,320
Back in my day, you had to-- - And stop.

1587
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,120
And the caddy's twerking.

1588
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,320
- Oh, great, now the caddy's twerking.

1589
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,600
Jesus Christ, dude, tuck your shirt in.

1590
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,900
What's wrong with these people?

1591
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,960
- What do you mean by these people?

1592
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,220
Swag, swag golfers.

1593
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,540
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

1594
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,800
I don't know, maybe I'll--

1595
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,540
- Don't even say it.

1596
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,520
Don't even say it.

1597
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,920
- Maybe I'll get into animation.

1598
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,180
(laughing)

1599
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:09,860
Maybe I'll get into animating different kinds of cartoons.

1600
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,760
Anthropomorphic animals.

1601
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,000
(laughing)

1602
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,840
You know?

1603
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,320
Maybe I got it. You're not doing that. I think I might do that. You don't do no. No.

1604
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:29,600
How many things have you animated before? I used to use pivot animation. I used flash.

1605
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,200
I have. I'm going to download flash and I just got this drawing tablet. What are you

1606
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:41,320
download? What flash are you downloading? What program? Adobe. Adobe flash that's not

1607
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,160
- That's real.

1608
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,280
- That's cap.

1609
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,680
- It's called Adobe Animate now.

1610
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,680
You would know that if you were a real animator.

1611
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,600
- Is that what Adobe Animate is?

1612
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,020
- If you were a real old school guy,

1613
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:49,860
you would know that.

1614
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,680
It used to be called Flash, I'm gonna use that.

1615
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,120
- I use my, I still use Macromedia Flash.

1616
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,200
- Yeah, that was the one, dude.

1617
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,160
- That was it.

1618
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,960
I think you guys should trust the animator on this.

1619
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,800
- You're not the animator, man.

1620
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,040
- You guys should see my old stick figure animations.

1621
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,640
- I'm already coming up with amazing kinds of backgrounds.

1622
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,100
- You literally just copied off what I just said.

1623
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,040
- No.

1624
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,600
- I had this idea for a--

1625
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,100
You just stole what I said.

1626
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,120
No, I had this idea for like a,

1627
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,680
it's like about a family.

1628
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,520
Yeah.

1629
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,280
Yeah, but they don't always make the right choice.

1630
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,120
Okay.

1631
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,940
Yeah.

1632
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,780
Okay.

1633
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,840
And it kind of gets them into trouble sometimes.

1634
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,160
Do they love each other?

1635
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah.

1636
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,160
Do they maybe show it the wrong way?

1637
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,000
Absolutely.

1638
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,320
What family doesn't?

1639
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,680
Kind of the perfect, kind of a,

1640
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,840
maybe a lampoon of the American family.

1641
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,880
Okay, so yeah, we got the mom.

1642
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,040
Wine.

1643
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,400
Wine, drinks wine.

1644
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,720
- Loves drinking wine. - The dad, the dad.

1645
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,920
- Loves it. - Mose the lawn.

1646
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,000
- It's an adult cartoon, so you can get away

1647
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,400
with mom drinking wine. - Exactly.

1648
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,560
- The dad, the dad. - Hey, you could not,

1649
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,080
you could not fucking get away with mom's drinking wine

1650
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,360
on primetime cable. - This ain't exactly

1651
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,680
made for Nickelodeon.

1652
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,520
- The dad, okay, he's Mose the lawn,

1653
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,280
he pitches baseball. - He plays golf and fish.

1654
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,400
- He plays Little League.

1655
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,460
Here's the twist, he's metrosexual.

1656
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,960
He wears a scarf. - Oh.

1657
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,280
That's the adult swim twist.

1658
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,200
- Wow.

1659
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:16,560
- The kids, five, 10, 15 kids.

1660
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,400
- Okay. - Wow.

1661
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,200
- They're the kids from, 19 kids and counting.

1662
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,800
They're the kids from the Duggars.

1663
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,280
- Yeah. (laughs)

1664
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,800
- One of them's evil, did something bad.

1665
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,840
- It's the kid, yeah.

1666
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,520
- One of the adult kids was very naughty.

1667
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,440
- He was on the naughty list this year for sure.

1668
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,000
- Yeah, he did something that the dad

1669
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,960
took off his scarf and whipped him with it.

1670
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,800
- Yep.

1671
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,420
Here's the big twist.

1672
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,720
The dad, the metrosexual one,

1673
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,720
he falls victim to the virus--

1674
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,600
- Known as COVID-19.

1675
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,260
- No, the virus known as the common cold,

1676
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,320
which actually disproportionately affects metrosexuals.

1677
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,620
- And he's affected by the T virus as well.

1678
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:00,400
- Yeah, the low T virus, 'cause of his metrosexual nature.

1679
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,240
- And here's the twist of the series.

1680
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,420
It takes place on Mars.

1681
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,400
They have a robot friend named Dr. Robot.

1682
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,720
- Named Mr. Jetson.

1683
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,680
- Named Beep.

1684
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,220
which Mr. Jetson is kind of a,

1685
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,000
that's an homage to earlier, one of my--

1686
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,200
- Something to some other figure.

1687
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,320
- But here's the twist-- - Something that

1688
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,160
I can't remember.

1689
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,880
- Here's the twist though on the series

1690
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,600
is it's made for stoners.

1691
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,920
- Yeah, so every, but there's nothing about--

1692
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,320
- They need a show for stoners.

1693
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,200
- Listen, it's a show made for stoners,

1694
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,680
but there's nothing about smoking weed in the show,

1695
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,760
but there's a five minute break in the middle

1696
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,600
where it says--

1697
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,520
- It says do what you gotta do.

1698
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,560
- There's a chyron on the bottom of the screen

1699
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,560
and it says, "Do what you need and do what you love."

1700
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,980
- Yeah, and it shows, and get this,

1701
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:48,980
it shows a guy licking a flower as a metaphor.

1702
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,260
- Well, but also it's trippy visuals.

1703
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,420
- Yeah, so yeah, here's the twist on the show,

1704
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,220
is it's very colorful.

1705
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,580
- Yes, yeah, there's tons of pinks and blues

1706
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,420
so that when you watch it you go,

1707
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,060
"Wait, am I high right now?"

1708
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,900
- Here's one of the twists, is they swear.

1709
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,780
When you watch it on TV, it's bleeped out.

1710
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:06,140
You find the episode online streaming,

1711
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,500
is as this wears a naked

1712
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,700
definitely clearly they say and right out loud

1713
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,080
definitely

1714
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,860
and they're saying all of them

1715
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,440
it's every episode there's a checklist on the side of the screen

1716
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,620
that they run down

1717
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,860
they gotta hit that the carlin seven

1718
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,540
yeah here's a visit to a george carlin voices the dead here seven dirty words

1719
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,140
that we're saying on television right we were psyched with the cycle that

1720
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,500
audio from old george carlin specials the one that

1721
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,500
It's all, it's all, yeah it's all George Carlin,

1722
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,340
different clips of him.

1723
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,740
There's a lot of him going like, "What?"

1724
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,260
- Yeah, that's all the dad says.

1725
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,660
- 'Cause we don't want him to talk about the Iraq War.

1726
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,500
- Yeah.

1727
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,740
- And listen, since the dad's metrosexual,

1728
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,580
he says, "God suck your supplies."

1729
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,980
- Wait, what if we do have him talk about the Iraq War?

1730
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,260
What if we finally knock that down a peg?

1731
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,100
- We could do a land use--

1732
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,700
- Yeah, so here's the twist, the Iraq War is happening

1733
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,540
while the show goes on on Mars.

1734
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,780
- Yeah, what if we, what if we're the first--

1735
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:07,700
called the Mars Wreck Wars. What if we're the first comedians to ever talk about I

1736
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,040
mean the first TV show to ever lampoon the Bush administration. Right. That might be a

1737
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,260
really. First animated show to ever lampoon the Bush administration. So here's the twist is Bush,

1738
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:22,380
is George Bush moves in down the street. Wow. And Bart gets into trouble and

1739
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,940
and is annoying to him. It's little Bush from the show Little Bush. Bart Duggar.

1740
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,680
- When do you think, at what part of the Simpsons

1741
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,560
development do you think they were like,

1742
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,680
yeah and also there's this Indian guy for no reason.

1743
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,920
(laughing)

1744
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,180
Do you think that was like the fifth,

1745
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,280
right after the family?

1746
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,000
- That was the first character that Matt Groening

1747
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:42,840
came up with.

1748
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,520
- And they were like, oh we can't just do a,

1749
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,640
can't just do that, right?

1750
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,680
- Yeah, I guess we need a family.

1751
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,760
(laughing)

1752
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,400
- And we need a comic book guy to balance it out.

1753
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,440
- Yeah.

1754
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,560
- Yeah, they should have had a golf episode of the Simpsons.

1755
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,800
Come on, you fucking prick.

1756
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,960
- We were doing animation for some reason.

1757
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,360
- I'm sorry, I'm just saying, you're right.

1758
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,480
I got caught in the past.

1759
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:08,540
I used to be a golfer and a fisherman and a goth.

1760
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,380
Now I'm an animator.

1761
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,320
- You were not any of those things.

1762
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,160
- No.

1763
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,480
- Well, I'm actually animating different stuff right now.

1764
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,320
- Okay, good.

1765
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,140
- You're not.

1766
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:16,980
- You're an animator now.

1767
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,120
That's it, you have to stick with that.

1768
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,080
- So you guys are finally behind me on this?

1769
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,920
- I'm behind you on being an animator.

1770
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,400
- I don't know what's going on now.

1771
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,160
- As long as you don't ever switch it again,

1772
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,100
- Okay. - You have my blessing.

1773
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,340
- Wow, that's actually really sweet.

1774
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:30,560
- What's our show called?

1775
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,580
- The Sopranos.

1776
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:32,420
- Okay.

1777
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,080
- No, that's a show!

1778
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,920
- Oh, it's called Delightful Fancies.

1779
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,420
- Yeah. (laughs)

1780
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,260
- Right?

1781
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,960
- Yeah, how about, what about this?

1782
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,960
- That's pretty good.

1783
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:49,260
- The family who lives together, loves together.

1784
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,400
- How about this?

1785
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,700
Un, it'll be like un, and un is a different color

1786
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,420
than the rest of the thing.

1787
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,240
It'll be un is red, dash, family,

1788
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,000
that's a different color too, that's blue.

1789
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,840
Yeah, okay.

1790
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,880
And then fide is green.

1791
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,200
So it'd be unfamily fide.

1792
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,080
Okay, what about uncommon grounds

1793
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,280
and it's like as a coffee cup?

1794
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,920
And it's, oh, and they own a family coffee shop.

1795
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,860
There, okay.

1796
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,040
But here's the twist.

1797
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,640
They sell the worst coffee in the world.

1798
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,360
No, no, they don't sell the worst.

1799
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,120
It's coffee that's made with a lot of heart.

1800
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,200
No.

1801
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,040
- What?

1802
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,700
- What about, okay, it's like a pun on home,

1803
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,900
what about a like, it's like a pun on home sweet home,

1804
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,820
but it's the family, it's the gnome family.

1805
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,780
- Gnome? - And it's gnomes eat homes.

1806
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,500
- Phones. - Gnomes eat phones.

1807
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,620
- Gnomes eat bones.

1808
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,600
(laughing)

1809
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,040
- Gnomes eat bones?

1810
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
- Yeah, and they eat bones in the show.

1811
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,600
They're like, they're like necromancers.

1812
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,380
- Can there be a goth daughter?

1813
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,900
- What if it's called, what if it's called,

1814
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,360
what if it's called the necromancer gnomes?

1815
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,280
(sighs)

1816
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,440
- What if the show's just called The Necromancer?

1817
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,480
- How are we gonna deal--

1818
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,640
- What if it's called The Necromancer?

1819
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,520
- How are we gonna deal with the teen daughter's

1820
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,720
kinda bad attitude?

1821
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,080
- What if it's a good--

1822
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,120
- We'll just kill her off in the second episode.

1823
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,880
- Yeah, if she gets too mouthy, we'll kill the character.

1824
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,340
- But it's like she falls in a factory,

1825
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,560
and we're also making a point about factory farming.

1826
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,680
She falls into the hole that they put the male chicks in

1827
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,360
in the chicken factory,

1828
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,360
and then we just see that entire process

1829
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,000
and she's getting like fucking turned into nothing.

1830
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,200
- That could have been a chicken.

1831
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,040
- Yeah, yeah.

1832
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,520
But luckily it was just some goth bitch.

1833
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,200
(laughing)

1834
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,640
- Named Caleb.

1835
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,760
- Whoa!

1836
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,520
No.

1837
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,680
- Yeah, I think that'll really drive the point home.

1838
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,420
- What about gnomes is thicker than water?

1839
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,260
- Wow.

1840
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,920
- Bones are thicker than,

1841
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,360
bones are thicker than blood.

1842
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,560
- Bones are thicker than gnomes.

1843
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,400
- That's why they like bones.

1844
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,240
- Bones are thicker than gnomes.

1845
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,060
- Bones are thicker than the father.

1846
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,560
- That's why it's called family.

1847
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,700
How about, that's the subtitle.

1848
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,960
The subtitle should be, "That's why it's called family."

1849
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,420
- Gnome improvement.

1850
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,580
- Okay.

1851
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,220
What about...

1852
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,020
- That's pretty good.

1853
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,900
- What about the simps, the simps twos?

1854
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,080
- Little gnome, what if it's called gnomenclature?

1855
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,520
- Little gnome on the fairy.

1856
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,420
- And the fairy's the dad.

1857
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,980
- Oh my God.

1858
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,580
- And the little gnome is, he's wearing a baby

1859
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:24,980
in the baby Bjorn.

1860
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,460
That's the little gnome.

1861
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,040
- It's a gnome Bjorn.

1862
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,220
- What about, what about if it's called

1863
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:34,460
King of the Thrills?

1864
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,380
- King of the Gnomes.

1865
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,180
- Here's all I want, okay?

1866
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:39,220
I'm willing to animate this show.

1867
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:41,060
- Wow, that's great, wait, hold on.

1868
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,300
My sister just sent me this.

1869
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,260
- Can't even see what that is.

1870
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,100
- Can't see what that is.

1871
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,860
- But you're ruining a brainstorm session and--

1872
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:49,540
- Wait, okay.

1873
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,860
It's pertinent.

1874
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:51,700
I can't see.

1875
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,820
It's a picture, it's a gnome gif.

1876
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:54,900
Oh, it's a gnome?

1877
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:55,900
Yeah.

1878
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,420
Listen. That's crazy.

1879
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:00,460
Listen, I do want, I'm willing to animate this,

1880
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,140
only if one of you two, I mean, between the three of us,

1881
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,820
one of us has to have Dr. Dre's phone number.

1882
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,660
Right? Yeah.

1883
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,740
So we're gonna call him up, we're gonna say,

1884
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,260
"Listen, Andre," first name him, "Listen, Andre,

1885
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:16,440
"we want a Beats sponsorship.

1886
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,840
"We're gonna animate a Beats pill,

1887
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,800
And we're gonna pour Sprite on it to prove that it's Sprite-proof, and it's gonna be in the show.

1888
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,200
And he'll say, "Yeah."

1889
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,620
"Yo."

1890
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,560
"Yeah."

1891
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,840
What else will he say?

1892
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,160
"Yeah, yeah. What up, Detroit?"

1893
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,400
Say something like that.

1894
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,400
Yeah, we'll tell him we're from Detroit.

1895
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,240
Yeah, that's why he'll agree.

1896
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,560
Yeah.

1897
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,840
Is he from Detroit?

1898
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,320
No.

1899
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:48,800
We'll say, "Hey man, if you don't do this, you might end up with a guilty conscience."

1900
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:49,280
Oh my gosh.

1901
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,820
- Oh my gosh. - And he'll go, yeah.

1902
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,140
Yeah.

1903
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:53,980
You know?

1904
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:56,360
And then he might puff some weed too.

1905
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,120
- No, he's not on, I was, he's not on that fuckin',

1906
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,180
what's that Eminem song about Detroit?

1907
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,940
- Just stop, just stop.

1908
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,860
- I thought he was on the song about Detroit.

1909
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,060
- Eminem's a golfer.

1910
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,160

01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,060
- I gotta go.

1913
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,820
