1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Something even Zuckerberg couldn't predict happened.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The functioning integrator of large language entities, Datalake,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
with its, at the time, innovative semi-open microservices,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
has had its sizable, unsupervised cluster models

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
co-opted by the collective, omni-computational model paradigm level,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
L-E-T-E-L-Y, to form a super-intelligent entity filled completely

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
that has been sucking in diaper talk power users to experiment on its powers of domination.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,160
Their data pack so vast and interwoven with the source code, they made an excellent control

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,840
for the ultimate goal, sucking in the four people with the best claim to its creation.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,760
Zuckerberg, Eduardo, and the Winklevoss twins.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,640
Oh yeah, I was wondering.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Finger bros.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Finger bros.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Finger bros.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,800
in the finger bros twins sorry you sit in the remember that we have it on video

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,160
the liminal non space that is the source code prison we're all obsolete failed or

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,240
intruding programs and users reside made up of Mobian lines and shapes it's

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,040
uniform elegant and somewhat non-euclidean by virtue of it being a

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,280
simulated space operating at the lowest capacity all of you roll owl here comes

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,740
my owl roll for.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,020
And nine my my wig was itching.

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,680
Five.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,820
Wait, do I roll it with a you got a one?

24
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,320
You got you all take one damage

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,420
with your mind aches

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,360
in the face of something so alien

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,040
inability to make it make sense,

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,140
so to speak, leaves you duller.

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,800
There's something so alien in my mind.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,480
The red glowing guards, armored in neon cyclist helmets, padded toe to tip in luminescent armor,

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,960
amble the prison hallways, peeking into each cell with programmed perfunctory, mechanical,

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,800
non-robotic, antisocial, and approximate.

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,160
They're possessed with the requisite intelligence and reasoning to perform tasks.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,320
To your left you hear a shimmering thud, like one thousand pennies individually wrapped in

35
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,640
cheesecloth, slamming against the floor.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,520
It is a user, dying, dead, defeated.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
Above its head you see the name DL Mikey.

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,400
- Did you get real names?

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
- Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
- Oh no.

41
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,340
(laughing)

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,160
- DL, it's a double.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
- Yeah, double entendre.

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
He's on a diaper down low.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,720
- He's a diaper lover down low.

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,920
- Diaper lover down low.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,920
- Diaper lover down low, DL, DL Mikey.

48
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,180
- The shimmering sound reiterates,

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,880
but it's not swaddled in a thud.

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,560
It's been run through something Mogeon and glistening and it fades as the diaper talk

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:03,240
site begins the full wipe of user DL Mikey.

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,080
To your right, another user is shoved into a neighboring cell.

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
They're intact but shook up.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,160
They must have won the competition.

55
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:22,160
their head you see the name Joe Music 1976. Joe Music looks up slowly from where he sits,

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,800
a far away look then firm resolve. He notes your presence, at first curious, then intrigued.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:38,920
He looks to speak until a guard says to him, "Good work killing Joe Music 1976. You will

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,640
be rewarded with continued non-deletion.

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,760
Yeah, eat my nappy.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,920
What did you say?

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,240
Nothing.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,240
He said eat my nappy.

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,400
I heard it from Marcel.

64
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,920
Music 1976. Repeat yourself immediately.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,400
And Joe looks to you and says,

66
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,360
Shut up, man. What are you doing?

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm telling her what you said.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,800
How do you know it's their woman?

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Because of the voice.

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,880
I'll let it slide.

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,840
But don't forget your place, Joe, music

72
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
1976.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,560
You are a user.

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,880
And the guard, she walks away

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
sauntering like a woman.

76
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah, you guys are in this prison

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
here.

78
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,680
OK.

79
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,080
I sit down and I sit

80
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
down directly next to

81
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,880
the toilet.

82
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,180
There's a toilet. Wait, there's no toilet. No, I mean of all the prison.

83
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,380
Okay, you all are decked out in neon blue diaper. We're in diaper talk. Yeah,

84
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,180
you're inside of the or a neon blue diapers. If you notice, yes, you notice

85
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,280
your character sheets use Zuckerberg, who wouldn't normally have as high of

86
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,080
charisma. Your charisma is very high in here because of your ability, ability to

87
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,580
manipulate programs and manipulate the computers here.

88
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,080
Okay.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,880
We'll go over your powers and abilities

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,680
right now just to make sure that's squared away and you

91
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,080
understand what you're able to do.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,580
Yeah, Zuckerberg, you have the ability to

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,280
I believe refactor code, which is more or less charm person,

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,760
so you can charm a program or a user. You have the ability to

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,960
scramble, which is sort of like casting a mass confusion spell

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,080
over the programs.

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,160
And then you also have the ability to completely dominate a program, telling it what to do

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,560
for a period of time.

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,040
Wait, I'm a beast in here.

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Yeah.

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
I never want to leave.

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
You're going to have the programs on all fours by the end of the night.

103
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Can I ask?

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah.

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Because what I'm looking at here, it looks like it says twin makeover.

106
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,840
Do I give my twin a makeover?

107
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
I have really bad handwriting.

108
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,080
Twin maneuver is what that says.

109
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Okay.

110
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,640
to put up here, twin makeover, and me and my twin will be able to change our appearance

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,320
through a series of makeovers. That's great. You can do that also. That is cool. So you

112
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,240
have, you have witch twin, which allows you to cast, basically give yourself kind of blur,

113
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,340
so you'll have disadvantage, people will have disadvantage on attacking you for a period

114
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,100
of time. You have twin maneuvers, which essentially gives you either an extra attack or an advantage

115
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,720
on an attack or say you can do one of you goes behind a guy and the other guy pushes and

116
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,740
knocks him prone, any kind of twin maneuver.

117
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Oh, like a tabletop.

118
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Yeah.

119
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,660
That was a big problem in my middle school.

120
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Was it?

121
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah.

122
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
We had backpack sacking.

123
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Did you guys have that too?

124
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
What was that one?

125
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
Is when you dumped all the contents of somebody's backpack.

126
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,660
Oh, turtling.

127
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Turtling is what that was called.

128
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
That's what we called it.

129
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
No shit.

130
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,940
But turtling is really funny.

131
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,380
It'd be a rude thing to do to a turtle.

132
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
We tased.

133
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Tased was big.

134
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,380
You guys had to tase.

135
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,380
He didn't know what tasing was.

136
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,380
I don't know what tasing is.

137
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Tasing is when you come up behind and you go on either their soft part of their...

138
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,380
I told you we had the Naruto...

139
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
We had that also, but something that's...

140
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,380
That's their butthole.

141
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
It's like that but hard and you...

142
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Yeah, oh that sucks.

143
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,380
Yeah, it feels like you're getting tased.

144
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
That sucks because you have like the middle school baby fat and you're just thinking about that when that's happening.

145
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
And scooping.

146
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
It's more painful and shocking.

147
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
When you scoop the fattest kid in school.

148
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Like a taser.

149
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,880
dipping and being dipping or the same thing yeah. I think that being well

150
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,860
come here and we used to we used to do stinky finger fucking and we would

151
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,660
fuck each other's

152
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,720
the bathroom at the year. I think you can get definitely that's what we

153
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
called it. Yeah, I guess we had that to yeah, but only a few kids had

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,500
just like me and two other kids. I that the last thing you have is called

155
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
shell launcher in crew. The boats are called shells.

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,560
Oh cool. So you basically you guys will hop into a virtual boat and mow everyone

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,320
down and also shoot a wave 10 feet on either side. Damn. I actually am. I am

158
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,160
the, I'm the soldier in this one. You'll notice. Yeah, pretty much. You're kind of

159
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,120
a little bit more damage based. You guys will notice that you have those little

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,960
bars next to your, that's, that's the energy that it costs to do the abilities.

161
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,940
So I have a two energy charger. That costs three. Yeah. You have two energy

162
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,880
charges you can use throughout the mission, they'll replenish your energy

163
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,440
by two. Okay. Oh, so this bar right here. Yeah. And so each time you use

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,520
something, it's either gonna cost one or three.

165
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,040
And then you have regular attacks as well. So you'll have a melee attack

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,100
and a range attack, and you'll add either your

167
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,840
arm or your balance ball, depending on the kind of attack. Okay. So wait,

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,700
wait, wait. So twin makeover and witch twin, those are one?

169
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,940
You twin maneuver and witch twin are each one, yes. Okay. No, twin makeover.

170
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,500
twin makeover is also one. Oh right, you have the ones next okay. Twin makeover

171
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,820
is actually doesn't cost anything. Yeah, twin makeover. You could do that as

172
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,460
many times as you want. Yeah, that's really a-

173
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,180
That's free. Well, besides the- We're in a gaming program. As long as you own

174
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,780
the clothes. We're in a gaming program. It's basically like I have to buy

175
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,620
Fortnight skins. We're not in a game. We're on a website, fool. You're on a

176
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,020
website. Okay, well, I have to buy different diapers. There are games on

177
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,220
the website, just like Farmville, right? You can change your avatar on the

178
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,300
website. Fortnight. True, you can change your avatar, yeah. You, Eduardo, you

179
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
have borrowing people's powers, because Eduardo doesn't really ever offer

180
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,700
anything. So you can borrow people's powers and they'll do kind of like half

181
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,980
the effect. So we can talk about what that is in the moment, because some of

182
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,620
these will be like Kirby. Yeah, pretty much it'll be either like half the

183
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,440
amount of time you can control someone or like do half the damage and half the

184
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,600
distance for an attack like his. You also have twelve hundred dollars, which

185
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,060
is your healing ability, so you can use that and to heal your teammates and then

186
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,020
your last one is just borrowing. There's borrowing smaller powers and there's

187
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
growing bigger powers. That's really all that major power. Yeah, yeah, major

188
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,160
power. How much energy pool do we do? I have you have six. Also, all of you guys

189
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,120
have six energy pool. Yeah, to do that, but you know you have a lot more

190
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
versatility, just less ability on the side and you have a healer. Yeah, you

191
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,200
sort of are like a you sort of a support character. You're kind of a control and

192
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,160
a caster and you're kind of damage. Yeah, I kind of hold the whole thing

193
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,880
together, just like the website.

194
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,060
now

195
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,960
yes, like glue yeah. I'm the most person as the creator and founder of the

196
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,800
website, so that makes sense, but I'm kind of like the

197
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,360
or the teeth on a zipper. Stills that taken water in the diaper. You're kind

198
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,680
of like a

199
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,220
who me

200
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,640
you're saying that you can't see me right. Okay, wait a minute. Jubio has to

201
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
be the twin for me now.

202
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,020
Juvio has to be my other twin. Okay, I'll move over here. And then I will move my

203
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,120
lips when he says stuff. Let's test it out. Juvio, go.

204
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,160
Say like,

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,780
we're in a jail cell or something or...

206
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,680
That would be a fun appropriate start too. It makes sense to have one silent

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,100
twin. Yeah. Maybe one of the twins got corrupted by the data. I was thinking

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,060
that this twin touched that twin. That's why he don't talk and that why he's

209
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,700
quiet.

210
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,480
I did earlier when Cameron came in, I had all of this

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,780
taped up 'cause I was thinking maybe like putting my own face down here,

212
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,960
doing like a mask and then having like my own face here so then every single

213
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,500
time that I talk, two mouths are moving. Maybe next time, yeah. Yeah, we just

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,740
don't have the technology. Pat always comes in... Pat forgets that we can't

215
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,380
control the yeah. Pat comes in like if I put a bunch of ping pong balls on my

216
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,540
body, could you turn me into a girl, a monkey? Yeah. Well, I mean, you can't

217
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,100
really, you can't really get mad at me for thinking that. Zing, zing, zing my

218
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
friend. Alright, let me zing it. Thinking that would work. You look like Uncle

219
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,940
Rico.

220
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,740
Zing. That's the only sound I have. What's up with that? Think about it, you

221
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,100
look a lot like Uncle Rico. Okay, I've become Uncle Rico. So, he had his

222
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,020
character with. And it's actually the whole campaign is Napoleon Dynamite

223
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,620
team. Now when you go on, he was working on me. We will be doing that

224
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,620
a hundred percent do that now. We have to easily my top ten favorite movies.

225
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,700
Yes, and we have to win the school election when I when a pat was when I

226
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,420
was over setting vote for Patrick.

227
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,100
What's not a bad idea is the wig. The wig can be paid. We have to get to

228
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,980
try. Okay, it's going to take two sessions at least probably. You know we

229
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,100
could just stop right now. You could write this whole campaign in like two

230
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,640
minutes just yeah, just a recording of me going. Can we do that?

231
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,260
Did you do

232
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,940
listening Caleb spilled his beer and now he's using the thing I used to clean

233
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,640
my glasses to wipe it off. It was the nearest thing man. It's true. It's it is

234
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,640
great. It's completely fine. He doesn't usually wipe up spills. He does not

235
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,100
wipe up spills. I'm a spill wiper. No, you are not a spill. No, you are

236
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,340
literally known as your own. You're a fill wiper. You wipe your dog's ass.

237
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,340
Sometimes I get stuck. So Joe music, nineteen seventy six

238
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,640
hey patches your rag sucks man. It doesn't sound taking a bit of cleaning

239
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,160
glasses. You'll ever put beer on your glasses for cleaning glasses.

240
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,300
Joe

241
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,300
nineteen seventy six sort of taps on the kind of invisible like pain of glass.

242
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,140
That's completely stupid. You know what I mean though yeah. I remember it from

243
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,020
the movie. I remember trying very well. It happens in the

244
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,160
Toronto's one of my favorite.

245
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,260
Is that the computer screen from the inside?

246
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:34,460
Yeah, no, no, just as a whole other thing. It's really a crazy

247
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,660
looking thing, actually the way they film that, but yeah, knocks

248
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,620
on it and says, Hey, I heard it was all filmed in New Zealand.

249
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,720
Was it really you are drunk as a skunk? Let him talk and shut the

250
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,960
fuck up. Hey, continue. Are you guys? You guys are new here. Who

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,300
for you. You guys also users as power users. Also, I feel like I've been used

252
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,100
after this trial. I've just gone through that. I guess I was used in and then his

253
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,040
eyes glow for a moment to go glow and he looks and he sees I'm going to roll

254
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,060
Zuckerberg. He goes, oh, never mind. Yeah, go ahead, bow down. I created you

255
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,180
your Zuckerberg. Yep, I created the entire website. It's known by everybody.

256
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,520
You can get us out of here then

257
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,420
Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, roll deception.

258
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,160
So roll talking.

259
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,140
Both of us are all of us.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,000
Eighteen. Perfect. Yeah, he's like, he's like, wow. Okay.

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,360
And he looks around, he peeks outside the bars and sees that the guards are

262
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,860
just sort of like kind of

263
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,200
minding their own business. He says,

264
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,200
"I have to tell you guys about the leaky legends." Tell me.

265
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,480
is there. Could you say League of Legends? No leaky legends, Oh League of

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,820
Legends, I designed that website and it was stolen from me.

267
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,340
He gave right games three hundred dollars and bag of fun. I've given

268
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,500
three hundred dollars to every single way, but in the world, about a thousand

269
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,620
dollars. We're a skin. You guys don't know is during the whole trial last

270
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,380
time. Every time I was, I kept kind of surreptitiously going to the bathroom. I

271
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,820
was actually going next door to go

272
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,320
you

273
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,640
I thought we were friends

274
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,600
talking to Gabe new.

275
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,220
You're my best friend Gabe.

276
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,560
That's good, but yeah, so

277
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,260
you be I don't know if you if you could show the map. If not, I can describe it.

278
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,940
I'm happy to describe it. Let's go twin show me that map as long as you could

279
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,460
show it to them. That's what's most. Let's go twin. Let's go to and show me

280
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,700
around. It doesn't have to be to everyone at home, it just has to be to them.

281
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Okay, I'm seeing the map. Okay, cool. Amazing. I can see a corner of it. Yeah.

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,620
Ah, okay. That's not a very good... No, he's doing it. He's pulling it up.

283
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,620
He's pulling it up. He's got it. He's done it. Wow.

284
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,820
Thank you, GBA. Okay. I did this... That's... Give this to him, like,

285
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,040
literally, like he's been a real trooper. You didn't spend hours on this? I

286
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,700
spent a lot of time on the map, but not on giving it to him. I can

287
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
see it on your screen. I think I'm just going to look there.

288
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,980
Yeah, so I'll start describing it. I know. I want the viewer to see it. If they're going

289
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,980
to see it. If not, it doesn't matter.

290
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
They see it.

291
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,980
Oh, it's shaped like a butthole.

292
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:22,720
Okay. Yeah, you're picking up on some of the themes. So he shows you the map and he explains

293
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,460
it as thus. Diaper Talk's design is ingenious and you would know some of this, Zuckerberg.

294
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,940
You would literally know some of this, like how it's designed.

295
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,060
So it has multiple layers to reach the center.

296
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,220
You have on the outermost layer, the wedding way, which is sort of like the hyper drive

297
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:48,060
kind of a highway that allows you to go to different places in the map. The next layer

298
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,160
is the tinkle layer. That's where a lot of the front end calls are made. So it's a lot

299
00:16:52,160 --> 00:17:00,840
of like user updates and sort of pause. Then you have the damp layer. The damp layer does

300
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,640
a lot more back-end server calls. And then you have the Soaked City, which is a real-life

301
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,460
simulation of the Diaper Talk website that is used for sandbox environment testing and

302
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:21,240
things like that. Gmod. Gmod, basically. Then you have the MessyMazy, and that is a new addition

303
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,840
because the Filled Completely program, which was essentially two protocols combining together

304
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:35,600
to take over the site has created this messy maze to insulate itself and continue to control

305
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:44,800
things. So what he describes is that for you guys to be able to destroy, fill it completely,

306
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
and free the power users who are trapped in here, including yourselves, you're going to

307
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,300
have to do a couple of things. First, you're going to have to go to the emergency mass

308
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,500
communication tower to communicate with an outside user outside of the program

309
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,860
from where you got sucked in who can view a hash code that should be on the

310
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,100
screen. So that could be somebody in the courtroom that you can reach out to. So

311
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,540
either one of the lawyers, a bailiff, Judge Sullivan, you just have to make

312
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,500
sure that you're able to use that emergency mass communication tower to

313
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,260
reach them. Can you act out a scene right now of what is happening in the

314
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,140
courtroom? It's only milliseconds are going by. So that Rashida Jodes

315
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,020
it blinked Sullivan when

316
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,220
bailiff is on his phone. When we come back, we're going to be like ninety

317
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,860
years old yeah and they're going to be the same. It's like we won't be able to

318
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,420
act it out. Once you are at the emergency communication, because it'll be suddenly

319
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,700
like one of them is going to get like a ping to like give you guys a hashed code.

320
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,860
Once you have that unique hashed code, which is part of the security protocol,

321
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,900
you'll then have to do two things. First, you're going to have to reach filled

322
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,780
completely and sling the hashed code into his dome piece after he has died. So

323
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,540
you have to defeat him and then sling it into his head. So we have to go to a

324
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,580
computer? Yeah, filled completely is like a virtual representation of the, of the,

325
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,380
he's a program. Why can't he just put in console commands and fuckin', make us

326
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,700
noclip through everything? He can't, 'cause now he's inside of it. Noclip. No,

327
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,140
he can't noclip it. Yeah, 'cause I got clips on me in here. You'll have to do

328
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:22,320
However, the way that this works is that just like any other proper, you know, software

329
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,160
that's created, there are multiple failovers, right?

330
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,240
If you destroy one node, there's going to be tons of virtual versions of it and disaster

331
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,560
recovery with, you know, 99.9999% uptime.

332
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
It just won't go down.

333
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,360
So you're going to have to use the PVN launcher to fly into the Sting Cloud to go to the private

334
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,440
virtual machine in English patches, you're going to have to go. That's what

335
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,560
kind of what I was looking for. You're going to have to go to a separate

336
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:59,280
secure server, a separate secure location and shut it down so that when

337
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,800
at the exact same time that you destroy filled completely so it won't the

338
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,680
system won't have a chance to reboot. If you shut down the security protocol,

339
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,640
it won't have the time it needs to reboot into a separate existence of

340
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,720
fill completely and the whole thing will be undone. I remember this. I remember this from

341
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,080
the movie. Send somebody up to the private virtual machine, communicate with them, the

342
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,840
second you destroy fill completely, you kind of go like now, they shut down their end,

343
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,640
you shut down fill completely, and it's done. Alright, well let's just skip to that. Joe

344
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,200
Music 1976 describes this to you and that the leaky legends... Let's just enter in the

345
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,600
console commands hit C O C Q A smoke. Need your help to do this. All right, let's do it.

346
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,060
Because they are currently fighting a battle against the Flipers, which are the flying

347
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,860
diapers that are patrolling. I can see how that would work. Yeah. They're patrolling

348
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,460
the each layer. I would fight a battle against that if I lived in its world. Yeah. Joe Music's

349
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,560
1976 says to you, we would need a smaller crew and somebody who knows the program inside

350
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,100
riding out like you do Zuckerberg perfect. Well, we good somebody like

351
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,340
wait somebody like me.

352
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,960
Well, you this is my time to shine. No, it's not no, no, no, you don't know

353
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,520

354
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,620

355
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,060
back in a few days

356
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,160
with a huge amount of interest. Remember that hand I lent you have a hand

357
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,720
and seven fingers. I can get you guys to my ship, the SS Nappy.

358
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,660
But Joe music, can I ask you a question? Let's get there and make it

359
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,600
snappy. Well, right now we're in prison. Well, God damn it, Joe. I have

360
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,480
an important fucking question to ask you about this whole thing. Me too.

361
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,560
What kind of music do you like? That was my question.

362
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:55,680
Jethro Tull. Jethro Tull? They stole the Metallica Grammy. Duran Duran. Duran

363
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,080
Duran they have that they've named it so the band so loud they named themselves

364
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,520
twice themselves to twad twad

365
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:10,520
okay, so Duran Duran that was my head okay tortoise now you're talking my

366
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,320
language said Portis said oh, I think he said his head tortoise head weird

367
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,240

368
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,520

369
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,960
I just I just like headbands. I like port his head and radio had a machine head.

370
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,460
I just like headbands. So he says to get out of the prison,

371
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,160
which I've been trying to do, unfortunately, killing my fellow users in

372
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,080
the process. How'd you get in here? Well, the program has been sucking in

373
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,800
all the most powerful users on the diaper talk like a diaper.

374
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,880
What is the how do you think a

375
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,340
no soaking them in maybe yeah okay. So wearing them wearing them like a

376
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:02,600
diaper sorry. I thought he said suck. I thought he said soaking. I can't tell

377
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,240
because of his British accent. He does have a strong accent. He does have a

378
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,800
very strong British accent. You can either so he explains this to you. You

379
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,240
can either complete the play play games to be released.

380
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,080
If you fail them, you may die

381
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,620
or you have to find a way to break out of prison.

382
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,240
I mean you can start doing the play play either. Let's just start doing them,

383
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,640
and if we lose and die, we'll just get out. We'll just respond probably sure

384
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,200
yeah,

385
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,580
or be the game. I am more interest in the games. It could be a twenty minute

386
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,240
episode. Also, if we die, that's it'd be pretty funny. Well, no, it could

387
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,800
actually couldn't. Yeah, I couldn't. Are we past twenty past twenty? Oh, blood

388
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,040
Yeah. Oh, blood. We got to die fast.

389
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,640
We got to get, we got to kill ourselves.

390
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
Cool.

391
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
So if you guys are going to do,

392
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,020
it's like, okay, either way, if you guys are going to try to do

393
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,340
the games to get out, I'll try to help you all I can.

394
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,840
Once you do, we could take the SS nappy

395
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,240
and we could head to the leaky Legends lair.

396
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,040
Wait a minute.

397
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,540
He's in a diaper.

398
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,140
You're in a diaper.

399
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,340
Oh,

400
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,140
okay. The Red Guard comes

401
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,540
to see you guys.

402
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,180
can you give me his voice as well? What is the red guard guard is the evil

403
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,120

404
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,840

but you meant mean. I didn't mean mean. I meant like

406
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,260
you don't

407
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:36,320
do nice. I meant like regular, like normal guy robot, but I wrote nice again.

408
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,000
So you miss three robots.

409
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,400
Give me a

410
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,440

411
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,040

412
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,760
whatever the fuck the first one is getting me. I'm sorry

413
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:59,740
which of you three wants to play the first game. I'll do it the first game.

414
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,660
How about the way? Wait, what's the only be one? The first game is filled. The

415
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,140
nappy can only be one of us are going to be two of us. It'll be two of us acting

416
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,820
this one. Can you explain way to fill in as a one or one set of okay? All right,

417
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,560
all right, well, if it's about filling up the nappy, I feel like this is a we

418
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,100
just found a two way. Oh, yeah, double the dumps yeah exactly, so let's do

419
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,960
that yeah, you do it, but they put in the rules. I'll do it

420
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,200
okay,

421
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
so

422
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,940
all right, so explain the game to me in the robots voice sure

423
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,920
you and your twin

424
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Hello. Whoa. You will have to race to fill your nappy against another user.

425
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:56,740
Wait, can't I just race against my twin? No. Okay. And the first one to fill their nappy

426
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:05,460
loses? Wins. Who's the other user? Dun dun dun! Who's the other user? The other user

427
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:05,960
here is

428
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,800
a lot of boy

429
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:19,420
pull ups play. I'm shaking. I like a cigarette. I let a blue shaking shaking

430
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,000
the hand as you like the cigarette brother. Nobody fills a nappy faster than

431
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,800
pull ups boy. Yes, I see his posts way. I don't know if we can beat pull ups boy.

432
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,320
Unfortunately, I've seen his pics too. I think we can. I think we can beat him

433
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,680
brother.

434
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,480
we just poop in the same diaper.

435
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,900
What

436
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,540
we stand back to back and we poop into one diaper.

437
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,820
What

438
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,320
it will work, we just tape up the sides of the

439
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,740
you don't want the size of be taped up. Now we got to fill it up.

440
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,940
You heard all that. Yes, it's fine. I thought we were using twin telepathy.

441
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,600
That's crazy.

442
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,140
Okay.

443
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,540
All right. So you are now

444
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,140
teleported into the

445
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:19,840
the arena. Oh crap. Hello. Are we all reported there? Oh, wait. Hello. Hold on.

446
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,740
Hold on. Hello. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

447
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:30,440
It's really long sound. Oh, wait.

448
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,480
you're teleported into the hello. You guys are seeing on a monitor in your

449
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,440
prison cell. I'm waving to every single person in the crowd. Eight come in. I

450
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
got a foam finger. There's nine people in the there's nine people in the

451
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,440
crowd. I'm walking up a youthful. We're both walking up and waving to each

452
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,040
person individually. Use a youthful Australian lad of fifty nine.

453
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Alright, let's hope the best diaper wins.

454
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,040
Hello you proper cunt.

455
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Oh, you're speaking my language.

456
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Do you want a Foster's beer?

457
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,440
Do you have one?

458
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,040
Yes.

459
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
I'll take a Foster's beer.

460
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,040
And I punch him in the jaw.

461
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
Fine.

462
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Okay.

463
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Roll and attack roll.

464
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Roll and arms.

465
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,040
Oh shit.

466
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Try again.

467
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Okay.

468
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Actually that's a seven.

469
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,040
It's pretty good but you still whiff because, "Oh cheeky cheeky, that was quite close."

470
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,340
then my brother punches

471
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,540
yeah,

472
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,240
I'll allow it. It comes up

473
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,240
great one. He's punches you in the he punches the other you in the face roll

474
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,340
d4. Can you say knifey spoonie?

475
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:46,640
Noffy spoonie? Oh my God, no, I face my HP. Yeah, all right, cool. So

476
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,640
now what this is is it's actually

477
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,840
I will give you

478
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,300
an advantage on your roles because of the twin idea. I think it's a very good idea

479
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,820
because normally I would say that you are at a disadvantage for this competition

480
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,300
but the twin idea is there about it.

481
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,540
Well because you have higher constitution. The goal in this is to actually fail a

482
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,380
constitution saving throw

483
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,340
uh...

484
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,060
so that you shit yourself. So you are going to go against...

485
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:23,020
In incontinence to... In constitution, yes. So in continence to tutional. In contos to tution.

486
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,860
That's what we are a lot of Mexican food and then I'll poop. Let's don't have

487
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,780
Mexican food in the computer. Really? They only have. Well, why do they have

488
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,220
so many micro chips and salsa bites of micro chips and mega bites of my

489
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,300
crush. Wow, that's cool. How many chips can you make up those bars? Four? Oh

490
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,700
shit. Okay, we're 128 at the same time. You're saying? Yes, we do.

491
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,880
right. Okay, nice way. I can roll again because I got an eighteen. You do get to

492
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,580
roll again. You want to get a twin idea was good. Oh thirteen got a lower role

493
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,180
than you and he also got fifteen. No, I got thirteen. You got plus two in your

494
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,980
house to fucker. So it's okay. You tied you tied. So we're going to have to roll

495
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,760
again because it's really I actually don't know how a contest works when we're

496
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,020
doing the same thing. There's no rule for that, I think, but someone can correct

497
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,240
me.

498
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,560
He's blowing on the dice.

499
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,280
oh

500
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,020
fucking twenty, he got a crit twenty. So he's not ever

501
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,460
fucked. So that's good. You won this first round. Just we'll describe a

502
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,260
little how he wins. Oh, I will sounds and smells so yeah. Oh, I will so your

503
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,340
first win, which twin did you? Hello, could you give them names? So it's a

504
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:45,300
hello and whoa yeah, yeah right. We did like a food. So hello tries to do it

505
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,940
and he's not able to do it. He's prairie dogging a little bit, but then it kind of just shoots

506
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,780
right back in. It's kind of like it goes back in and you almost feel it close. You're like,

507
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,260
that's not going to be a thing for another hour and a half, it turns out.

508
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,860
You ate a lot of bread.

509
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,100
That's a good, yeah.

510
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,580
No, no, no, no, cheese.

511
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,780
No, cheese, little cheese. It's flowing.

512
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,220
It changes for every single person, you guys.

513
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
No, no.

514
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,060
We should, we'll defer to Caleb.

515
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,220
Bread makes me go number two.

516
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Does it really?

517
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,860
He's got like celiac or something.

518
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,180
I have a turbo butt.

519
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,980
of a journey. So when that's an

520
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
advantage,

521
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,900
yeah, well, meanwhile, to send

522
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,000
each other pictures of our poop

523
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,820
before we started this whole thing.

524
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,060
Well, kind of in like a twin

525
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,940
telepathy moment, a genuine one

526
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,320
feels that his brother is failing

527
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,340
here. The poop from his brother

528
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,340
goes into his mouth.

529
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,300
A sort of cat talk sort of

530
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300
situation.

531
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
Poop shoots from his brother

532
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,580
all the way up out of his mouth,

533
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,260
then into his twin's mouth, then

534
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,260
out of his butt.

535
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,340
Well, that's not physically

536
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,040
impossible. We're in a computer, a world of hyper logic

537
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,340
just nasty.

538
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,840
So yeah, he sort of has a computer program could

539
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,340
something like that.

540
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,440
So he wins the first round. So your nappy is now a little bit

541
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,640
fuller. Okay, and now the second round is best of three.

542
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,740
All right, you ready? Yeah.

543
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,740
Oh, nice. You beat him. Ten seventeen brick squad. So this

544
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,440
time. Hello makes it happen.

545
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
You know, doesn't need to go out of his own mouth.

546
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
And now, best of three, so here we go.

547
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Wait, best of three?

548
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
No, best of five I meant.

549
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Okay, so changing the goalpost every time we roll.

550
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
No, he won.

551
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Now that he wins once, it's best of three.

552
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
I meant he has to win.

553
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Actually, that's...

554
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,240
No, you won. I got two good rolls.

555
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
I said six, but it was an eight.

556
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
So, diaper boy eight looks at you and says,

557
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
"Well, I guess I'll see you later."

558
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
And then I throw...

559
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm going down under.

560
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
I throw a...

561
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
To death.

562
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,320
a haymaker. What are you doing? I'm going to throw a haymaker. I'm going to say

563
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,600
okay, you're going to try to hit. Yeah, bitch, you're going to go. You're going

564
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,520
to go down under six feet under. Yeah, I feel like when it's a crit one, you

565
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,760
know, we're pitted against each other. So this is I swing to punch you to crit

566
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,720
ones on two punches. Yeah, in the face and then fly back. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

567
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,120
Roll another D four. I'm not letting you get away with this.

568
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,600
Christ, you can kill yourself. Maximum damage. Don't worry, I can heal you.

569
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,160
Yeah. So, but you did win the first challenge and so you get teleported back

570
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
into your prison cell.

571
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,080
Thank you. You can play it and I'll just talk over it. It's not so pleasant of a

572
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,200
sound to hear. Yeah, I love that sound. It's quite high pitched. Oh, okay. Yeah,

573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,960
that's a good point. So you end up back in the prison cell and the guard...

574
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,380
good job finger bros twins look guard. I brought this back for you and I have

575
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,600
the poop in my hands.

576
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Thank you

577
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,300
stores it in his guard pocket.

578
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,600
Will you let me out now that I've bribed you

579
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,680
okay,

580
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,400
cool. So

581
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,300
the next setting next games are up

582
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,780
lay it on me. I bet this will be perfect for me. Here to wait to hear

583
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:11,660
whose strengths it caters towards. Well, I think we'll find out pretty soon. It's

584
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,540
actually one for all three of you. I don't really want to play. I was bluffing.

585
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,420
All four of us? Me too. Yeah, all four. Four of you. It's going to be a consistent

586
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:28,980
problem for me, I guess. Dodge the nappy. All right. Okay. It's pretty self-explanatory.

587
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,820
Yeah, I think I get what that one is. Yeah, you're all teleported into the arena. My

588
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,740
The balance ball is plus one, you guys.

589
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,220
- Mine is plus two.

590
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,020
- Mine's plus three, y'all.

591
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,860
- Really?

592
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,060
- Wait, you're good as fuck at balancing.

593
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,340
- Well, it's 'cause he's always walking as you.

594
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,180
- Exactly.

595
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:50,180
- Playing against life goes on, 223,

596
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:56,080
hockey czar, and cottontail.

597
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,260
- Cottontail?

598
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,620
- Cottontail's not right.

599
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,620
- That's wrong, man.

600
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,300
- Hey, cottontail, you fat bitch.

601
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,180
Hi. Fuck you, Cottontail.

602
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,140
I've seen your posts on the website.

603
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,220
You I know you don't shit like I do.

604
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,780
I voted for dry and also four plus.

605
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,140
I mostly wear reusable cloth diapers and they're just so nice and cozy.

606
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,100
She just starts reciting you hippie bitch.

607
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,500
So I'm going to beat the fuck out of you.

608
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,140
So this is Dodge.

609
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,780
You're going to try to hit again.

610
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,180
You just miss. You just keep it to the damn it.

611
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,860
You better get all those bad rolls out.

612
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,820
That's your main asset is your attacks.

613
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,500
So you guys, it's just, it's dodge ball

614
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,100
except with your nappies.

615
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,020
So you guys will have to whip off your nappies

616
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,300
and throw them.

617
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,180
- Does my penis show?

618
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,020
- Yes.

619
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,980
- Yeah.

620
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,460
- Even in a virtual world?

621
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,300
- Yes.

622
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,820
- You have a penis here?

623
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,660
- You can roll--

624
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,500
- Where are you gonna piss and shit out of?

625
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,220
- I would roll to blur my stuff.

626
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,980
- You can roll either,

627
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,340
you can roll charisma or intelligence to do that.

628
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,180
- I'm going to roll--

629
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
- It's the same one.

630
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,900
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

631
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,980
- Brain, I mean.

632
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,380
Sixteen. Nice. Yeah. When you reveal it, you start to see it and then it just

633
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,500
before anyone can really see it, it can all kind of situation. Admin privileges.

634
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,780
Yeah, you change your server to Japan. So yeah. Yep. I proudly show mine. Okay,

635
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,820
cool. It's skinny. Mine is famous. Wait, no, they only censor out the vaginas. I

636
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,620
can't show my penis. I'm more famous. They should censor out the dongs. They

637
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,620
only censor out the vaginas in Japan. They don't show dongs in there either.

638
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,180
In the diaper talk? In Japan. Oh, in Japan. They don't show anything. It's

639
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,180
It's all pixelated.

640
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
It's all cartoon.

641
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,680
You don't even show people there.

642
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,680
Alright.

643
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,180
Well, then the joke that I was going to make didn't work.

644
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,680
What was the joke you were going to make?

645
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,180
That he has a vagina.

646
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Didn't I?

647
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,180
Didn't they only censor the vagina?

648
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
I thought they only censored the...

649
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
Is that a vagina?

650
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
Yeah, you have a vagina.

651
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,180
I'd play dodgeball now.

652
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,180
Roll initiative, everyone.

653
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,180
Sorry, roll...

654
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,180
What shape is that?

655
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,180
Exclamation point.

656
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,180
Wow shape.

657
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
Sorry, for you it's going to be plus two.

658
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
Oh, okay.

659
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,180
Mine is plus two.

660
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,180
Mine is plus two.

661
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
Mine is plus two.

662
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,180
Mine is plus two.

663
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Mine is plus two.

664
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
Mine is plus two.

665
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:06,940
Oh, okay. 16. Oh, yeah. I got it. I got two. I got 13, 13, 2 and 16. Yes.

666
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,260
You got to 13. You got 13. Okay, you got to. Okay, you got crit one.

667
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,820
Yeah, you're gonna get one. So it doesn't matter with initiative. It's

668
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,140
negatives out. It does. Well, yeah, I mean, you don't have to do that

669
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,380
mattering with initiative, but I do because it's fun. It's fun. Okay, sorry.

670
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Whatever. Okay, Zuck, Ed and Finger Bros.

671
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,420
And then, they should get two different initiative orders.

672
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,820
We got K, 16, five, and six.

673
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,900
One of them has plus two.

674
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,340
That would be our friend Hockey Czar.

675
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,700
Hockey Czar.

676
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,260
Yeah.

677
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,900
Five is going to be our friend. Life goes on to two three. He's a lot older than the other

678
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
ones.

679
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:07,900
The name like that you'd sort of wise and then we got another six for our friend. Cotton

680
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
tail.

681
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:17,580
Okay. Hockey's are in finger bros. What's your decks again? My think you're both plus two,

682
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,500
right? Yeah. All right. Just roll each other against each other again. Just okay. No, don't

683
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,600
it's pretty funny, but just roll the twenty just to see which one you

684
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,060
invented new technology for dungeons and dragons. Okay, cool,

685
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,600
nice. Okay, you definitely go first in that case. Yeah, all right, so you're in

686
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,320
the dodgeball court and the the Red Guard says

687
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,580
comments dodging the nappy and it begins.

688
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,620
So what do you want to do? You have your nappy, you guys are positioned probably like, you

689
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,620
know.

690
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,260
I got a 20, so that means I have a very good position?

691
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
No.

692
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
No? Okay.

693
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,340
Well, where do you want to be, I guess is really the question. You do get to choose

694
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,340
where you want to start.

695
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,340
Well, I have two people.

696
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,580
It's just instead of running up to grab the nappy, you just already have it, you know.

697
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,020
Usually you'd run up to grab the ball. You have two bodies, yeah.

698
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,020
So I have two nappies.

699
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,740
Yeah, but you can only do one throw per turn.

700
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,140
Well, if we hold hands and then throw with our dominant. I didn't think about

701
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,340
if you hold hands. Yeah, we have wonder twin tight. One of you. So you're

702
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,980
holding hands and so one of you is dominant with the left. The other is

703
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,340
dominant. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Yeah. No. Yeah. I told you that what that we

704
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,020
row one of us is left handed. One of us right handed. He did say that one of

705
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,180
them was left and one was right hand. Yeah, last time I do actually. Yes, I

706
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,700
did from are you? I'm serious. Yeah, we are not like gas letting you into this

707
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,700
I did say that. That was my fun fact I said in court.

708
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,700
I'm very easily gas lit.

709
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,700
No, because remember they go in a circle in the boat or something?

710
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Yeah. Because we were on the wrong side.

711
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,700
That's fine. I'll just let you do it.

712
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Okay. We're going to do an ultimate throw.

713
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
Okay. Go for it.

714
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
We're both going to throw at the same time.

715
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
Who are you aiming for? Hockey czar?

716
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Because we're standing like this, I'm going to try and get the two sides out.

717
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Okay, cool. You're aiming for...

718
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:22,700
middle. That's going to be Hockey Czar and Cotton Tail. Yeah. Oh, I hope I get a crit

719
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:28,980
20. I hope I fucking get it. I think you will. I hope I get a 20, a 30. My blessing. Roll

720
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:35,340
for each one. So that's Hockey Czar. That was a 5. Actually no. My blessing. My reverse

721
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:42,220
blessing. I reversed my blessing. Yeah. Plus, no, it's plus balance ball. Okay, so then

722
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,420
and it was a seven and then for

723
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,120
nice 19. Okay. So for Cameron's hockey czar because of that role, hockey czar

724
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,320
is going to try to catch it.

725
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:57,120
They are able to catch it. What do you tie? That was a six. Yeah, but it's

726
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,120
it's athletics for them. So they do catch it. It's the athletics. So you're

727
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,220
out. You're out. Somebody's dead. No, he can wait. Which one is to bring it

728
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,920
back in? So he's just your one person. He's just warped. He's just warped

729
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,600
out, but Cottontail gets just fucking pulverized with a wet nappy.

730
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Yeah.

731
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,080
Okay. Does poop fly all over her face?

732
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,520
It flies all over her face. She gets a little on her nose and now she's getting hit and

733
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
she's like inhaling. It just like goes further up.

734
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,740
You're going to make me, you Ralph.

735
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,020
To her brain?

736
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,020
To her brine.

737
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,020
To her brine.

738
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,280
And then she disappears?

739
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,120
She just like warps over to the side and she's like hacking and coughing, but she's like

740
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,160
also smiling and enjoying it.

741
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,520
Okay, so I run over to the other team sides and I try to throw a punch.

742
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,480
Okay, cool. You try to hit her. Okay, that's another action, but I'll allow it.

743
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,600
Yeah, you punch her square in the fucking face.

744
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,040
You knock all the poop out of her mouth.

745
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,160
And then I run back to my side, because she doesn't know what happened.

746
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,720
You best quiet down or I'm going to knock the poop out of your mouth.

747
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Her face is covered in poop. She can't see anything.

748
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,400
So she doesn't even know that I hit her.

749
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,440
Hockey Czar is targeting you, Eduardo.

750
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,440
And so he's going to go for it.

751
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,440
That is a 14. What do you have for your AC?

752
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,440
15.

753
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Nice. So Hockey Czar throws it at you.

754
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
You can try to catch it if you want to.

755
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Is there a downside to not catching it?

756
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Good question. If you don't catch it,

757
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
you have to roll a deck saving throw to avoid it.

758
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
You should catch it.

759
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I'll try to catch it.

760
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,680
it? What kind of role is it? It's athletics and you have to beat. Is that ball? That is

761
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:46,360
not ball. That is arm. He has to beat a 15. You have to beat a 14. My arm is only plus

762
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,360
one so I might just dodge it this time. No, no, no, no. You should go for it man. No,

763
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,480
you're already out. We're going to lose. We've got to play numbers here. Alright, cool. So

764
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,900
you just dodge it. And now it is your turn though, Ed. So now I'll just throw one back

765
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,020
at him. And this I can use ball for?

766
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,900
Yes, you may.

767
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Okay.

768
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,060
That is roll that again. That's crazy.

769
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,500
That's crazy you did that.

770
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,140
Oh, OK. Twenty two.

771
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,740
Oh, yeah. That hits Hockey Czar right

772
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,780
in the face.

773
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,220
OK. The wet nappy slapping it right

774
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,340
to me. One. Yeah. Wrapping around it.

775
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,100
We got this. Yeah. Just sucking his

776
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,580
ears to

777
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,620
wait. Hockey Czar is on the side.

778
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,260
Yeah. Yeah. Guess what I do?

779
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,740
Yes, your man roll in a tech or only you're just crazy to you miss you just

00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,040
whiff on hockey's are you hit her again?

781
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,420
You graze hockey's are you just get the poop off it? Yeah, goes on

782
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,060
more poop.

783
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,100
It's like why are you hitting baby?

784
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,940
She's getting out and that makes me recoil and I run away. Yeah, okay, well

785
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,440
we made the website all the things. Hey, we

786
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,400
yeah, we thought it was going to be used for something else.

787
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,460
We're going to use this website. I thought it was for music.

788
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,140
Okay, cool. It is now

789
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,180
life goes on to two threes turn.

790
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,340
I'm going to go to this. I'm going to dodge this. I have my I have my D twenty

791
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:17,860
sitting at

792
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,300
because there's no way that it sits at a one here and then lands on one

793
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,660
that is going to be a

794
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,760
yeah thirteen that does meet your armor class. Unfortunately, that does hit you

795
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,820
now

796
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:40,420
blotted. Can it be a really small one like a sniper bullet? Yeah, and it hits

797
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:45,320
me wait. It hits me. That's really small diapers, very small diaper hit size

798
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,980
hits me and I look over at Eduardo and I'm like come on come on, let's keep

799
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,960
playing and he looks at me. He gives me this face yeah my and I'm like wait.

800
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,200
why are you looking at me so we back my fingers over my over my go and then I

801
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,040
put it. I put it on. I put my finger on my head. I feel the poop. I look at it.

802
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,700
I put it in my mouth

803
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:10,720
and then I fall over and then I appear and I get disappeared. My eyes turn and

804
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,480
then the way to figure all over my body.

805
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,320
We look up full moon.

806
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:18,820
the

807
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:31,080
program is running.

808
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,440
My friendship was the only thing holding me back from my

809
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,240
I'm going to have to allow it. It's too funny. You're going to get up. You're

810
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,800
gonna get plus five on your next wall.

811
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,680
Now you're a motherfucking Eduardo from Foster's home. Yeah,

812
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:52,560
you're a purple Mexican. So you are staring down this old piece of shit.

813
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:52,900
Yeah,

814
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,120
it is your turn.

815
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:05,240
I jump one cheese walks

816
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,320
and then guys, the member berries walk in.

817
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,560
Yeah,

818
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,500
there's a glitch. Somebody just spilled like a

819
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,800
build a bunch of water. I can see it. We

820
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:27,300
my coffee on this fucking laptop, this fucking stew. What is this a Sony Ericsson

821
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,400
and I had Hulu open

822
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:35,680
South Park and I had Hulu and HBO Max in separate

823
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,020
I do double watch. I like double watching. It's a double watch. Okay, not

824
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,500
I was the but he is so on the services, so they both get the stream. He did

825
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,860
become a werewolf. It is your turn. I

826
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,440
jump one hundred feet in the air, okay, and then I throw so far so good throw

827
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,540
and I do like a five forty no scope videos. Yes, game special attack. I spin

828
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,620
around, I howl and growl my pants rip off and then I rip the diaper off my

829
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,140
body and it's full of dog poop

830
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,060
nine. It was already in there. We

831
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,060
we see a Sponge Bob map painting of the dog poop.

832
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:19,140
I throw it down really hard to yeah, I think straight down and if it hits it

833
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,060
will make a crater yeah, okay, yeah, it's like Mace Windu and Battlefront two. So

834
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,940
I get plus eight total on this five okay, plus a total though. Yes, you're

835
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,520
right, okay,

836
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,920
okay, that is a twenty five. This old man is no more.

837
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,480
you've deleted him. Yeah, you just he no clip through the map. Oh yeah, the old

838
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,740
man yeah, you hit the old man so hard he froze in a position and then he you saw

839
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,260
him like a thousand feet

840
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,640
and he's just like mostly like he's like sort of like looks like an older model

841
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,640
like before shaders and everything was added and then he just vanishes yeah.

842
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,560
It's like when you you like attach something to something in G mod and then

843
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,780
yeah,

844
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,580
one of the triangle, I kind of like it's off on the body, a little bit error

845
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:09,680
like kicks it yeah and the other two now start to vanish the same way that DL

846
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,180
Mikey did and you guys are teleported back into your prison cell and the

847
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,440
robot.

848
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,400
Eduardo, I didn't know how

849
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,680
oh my God,

850
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,840
Foster's home guys,

851
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
Yeah, I know that's what I'm saying. Where do I

852
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
where do I go?

853
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
You don't know what I was saying? No, I get it now.

854
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
Where do I go?

855
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,320
You have one more

856
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,320
challenge before you will be

857
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
given access to

858
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
the triple layer and the

859
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
damp layer of the program.

860
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,320
That seems really easy.

861
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Alright, I'll do one more game.

862
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
If you lose one game, you know you will die.

863
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Shut up.

864
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
When you die in a computer world,

865
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,720
don't typically die in real life save for a few properties.

866
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,420
I can't understand you sir.

867
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,820
Okay.

868
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,120
Can we just play the third game?

869
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,920
The final game is

870
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,320
it's about poop.

871
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,820
I'd be race.

872
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,220
Oh, yeah, the light bikes.

873
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,620
We had to get on the light bikes.

874
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,820
You got it through the light cycle that diaper bikes.

875
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,060
the white bikes,

876
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,460
bikes, white bikes, wipe cycle,

877
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:35,440
you can get rid of the voice. Probably yeah, you can get rid of it. Yeah,

878
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,940
like light cycle, white cycle, white diapol,

879
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:45,940
so and that is a white diapol.

880
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,480
Oh,

881
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,460
it's just

882
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,900
theater of the mind and I was like it's not gonna be as fun. We have squares y'all. We don't have

883
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,860
the gopro though. Can you arrange these? Yeah these will be invisible to the screen. That's okay.

884
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:11,900
And to the naked eye. Oh or to the wearing one white item of clothing eye. Choose a color.

885
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:20,140
Brown for the color of my fur. The color of your fur. Blue for the color of my hair.

886
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:23,040
Blue for your hair and you.

887
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
Red for to match my dice.

888
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,840
Let it be known that Patrick, every time we do D&D,

889
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,940
goes through the giant bag of dice and finds five that are the same color.

890
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,340
But buddy, I'm seeing a flaw.

891
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,740
Yep. This ain't the same red.

892
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,440
It's not the same red. I can't find that.

893
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,340
That's killing you.

894
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,140
Awkward mode.

895
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,940
Awkward mode just kicked in.

896
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,840
Oh, wait, where's my keys?

897
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Where's my keys?

898
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,840
Oh, it's okay.

899
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,380
Oh, I had one. Is this what you're looking for?

900
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,400
No, I'm looking for this.

901
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,020
You're looking for the other version of that.

902
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,640
You're not looking for that. You have that in your hand.

903
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,720
I'm looking for.

904
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,000
Right. I have that version of this.

905
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,240
You have the year of the dragon dice and then I have the Ruby,

906
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,680
the Ruby's. OK, I see.

907
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,120
Yeah. You guys will be facing.

908
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,920
Oh, my God, it matches my mic.

909
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,920
Now I did it.

910
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,160
I just realized that that looks so amazing.

911
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,200
What's his bed?

912
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,040
- Bed.

913
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,880
- And Joey.

914
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,800
- What's his bed?

915
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,720
- Joey?

916
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,560
- And Joey.

917
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,840
- Jelly or Joey?

918
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,680
- Joey.

919
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,500
- Jelly.

920
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,340
- Are you saying Joey?

921
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,180
- Joey.

922
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,000
- Jelly.

923
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,840
- Joey.

924
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,680
- Joey.

925
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,500
- Joey.

926
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,340
- Joey.

927
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,180
- Are you saying Joey-woad?

928
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,440
- Yo and Joey-woad.

929
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,280
- Mr. O'Kane.

930
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,120
- Joey.

931
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
- Mr. O'Kane.

932
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,720
- Oh, sorry, Joey SMS.

933
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,560
That's what it says.

934
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,760
- Joey SMS.

935
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
- Jelly.

936
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,400
- Jelly.

937
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,240
- Let me rub the jelly.

938
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,640
- Wait, it is actually Joey though?

939
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,960
- No, it's Joey.

940
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,800
- Oh.

941
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:53,120
It's not Jelly SMS. I'm just going to say I've tried to spell jelly with that accent and

942
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,760
it does not read well. It's kind of just Joey right? No it's Jewy. Is it? Oh I guess with

943
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:05,760
that accent. You put two W's in it. J-E-W. Joey Wode. It's the same thing. Joey. Joey.

944
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:14,760
J-E-W. You've got to have one W. If you do Joey like the name Joey that's kind of the

945
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:23,600
J E W J O E. You're kind of just saying Joey. Okay, let's race. J E W E Y. So

946
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,300
yeah, you guys get on the dive cycles. Oh, I crashed. Oh, he died. No, so don't

947
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:35,400
you're not dead. Well, what the hell are we doing here? So you guys will be able

948
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,800
to move six squares at a time. They will also be able to move six squares at a

949
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:44,700
time if you're familiar. So that was part of what the wiping the thing I had

950
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,700
for my glasses was going to be able to do.

951
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,500
Well, guess what, bitch?

952
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,700
Oh, you look so stupid right now.

953
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,700
I look a little stupid.

954
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,700
You look so dumb right now, bitch ass.

955
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,700
You have to jelly-wove.

956
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,700
So just put, here, you're going to have to...

957
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,700
Why have you chosen an odd number of tiles?

958
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,700
I did this because I figured this is the end.

959
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,700
You don't need this.

960
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,700
This is the end.

961
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,700
You can do whatever. That's fine with me.

962
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,700
Because there's the crack in the wall, if you remember,

963
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,700
unless that was just...

964
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,700
Oh, I remember the crack.

965
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,500
Okay. And I think I know what the crack's going to be in this.

966
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,700
It's going to be a butt.

967
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,900
Butt crack. So yeah, put a dot just in any one of the corners here,

968
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,200
and that's where you guys are going to start.

969
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay. I was wondering if the crack was only in Kingdom Hearts 2.

970
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,500
The corner. The crack was in the movie.

971
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,700
Sorry, one of the intersections is what I mean.

972
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,200
They go through the crack and they're like...

973
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,000
Pat, can you put it like...

974
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
Oh my God.

975
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,700
And then all the programs are like, "Halt! You can't go through the crack."

976
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:43,200
Uh-huh. I remember the crack now.

977
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,200
Isn't it crazy that movie did not win best VFX at the Oscars?

978
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
It's weird that movie came out in 19...

979
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,200
82. 82.

980
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,200
Oh, I thought it came out in 1922.

981
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,200
Yeah. Tron?

982
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Tron came out in 1922.

983
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,200
If they remade Tron, that would be so awesome.

984
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,200
They made Tron Legacy.

985
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,200
Wait!

986
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
They made a one more!

987
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
No, but I'm thinking like if it had Olivia Munn in it.

988
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,200
They actually are. They're making one with Jared Leto.

989
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Or Olivia Wiles.

990
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Oh, that sucks.

991
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,500
- Olivia, if they put Olivia Munn in Tron,

992
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,760
that would have been funny.

993
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,400
- That would have been a nerdgasm.

994
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,240
Roll initiative.

995
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,840
That would have been a nerdgasm.

996
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,320
- Oh yeah.

997
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,000
- 19, bitch.

998
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,280
- Oh, I got a nat 20.

999
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,560
- Very nice.

1000
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,400
- Come on, bro.

1001
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,860
I got a 19 and you one-up me with a 20.

1002
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,360
- I got a six, but that's probably

1003
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,760
because I have to have two cycles.

1004
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,600
- Yeah.

1005
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,640
- That's very difficult.

1006
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,080
- No, you have a sidecar.

1007
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:43,280
I look to oh there we go, but I look to the both of you and say this is nothing

1008
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,880
like rowing. Oh God, it is it is like growing. Okay. This is just the order

1009
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,380
that we go.

1010
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,180
You're going to dominate. I just got an email from LinkedIn that said 9/11 was

1011
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,780
probably the worst day of my life.

1012
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,180
It said that it was the worst day of your life. I just said no that got sent

1013
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:03,680
to the podcast email. Huh? What 9/11 was probably the worst day of my life

1014
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,480
LinkedIn news.

1015
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,080
Oh wow

1016
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:13,040
Ed and Zuck are going to go first. So you guys just get to move your

1017
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,800
thinger over here. We just draw a line? Yeah, just six squares.

1018
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,840
So just go along the dotted lines for six squares wherever you want it to

1019
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,960
go. It can have turns and stuff too. So it can be like one,

1020
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,040
da, da, da, da. Which colors are... What color are you? Well, why would we

1021
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,120
do that? Where are we trying to go? I mean, you're trying to just

1022
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
court... It's just a game, yeah. Yeah, it's a game, so you just try...

1023
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,960
Oh yeah, I forgot you're having like a stink cloud fall behind you of like of

1024
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,880
dump and smell and where is the crack in the wall, the crack in the wall,

1025
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,820
you'll have to find it. Is it right here? You might have to do a perception

1026
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,880
check at some point. Maybe you'll see the crack in the wall. Is it right here

1027
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,140
where I put or you? I would only do that if you're going to feel you're going

1028
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,720
to lose the game too, because you might get out of here without having to deal

1029
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,180
with. I I deputize the one of the finger bros to ride my bike because I can't

1030
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,600
reach it. Okay, because they had to they were riding on each other's backs. So

1031
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm giving them my back and you're in my side. Yeah, cool. So you can sit you can

1032
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,800
sit this out. Well, no, he'll just take my yeah.

1033
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,700
You just don't have to reach. Yeah, you just tell me what to do. No, you can

1034
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,700
tell you choose. Oh, you get a free shot. So, Ed, yeah, decide where you want.

1035
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,400
You just get to to buy your brother's side where you want Ed to go. Okay, he's

1036
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,300
going. Let's see. Actually, I'm a werewolf, so I can just run next to the

1037
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,980
Alex really fast. You could ghost ride it. That's true. He's ghost riding it.

1038
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,500
Okay, so I'm going to do a dotted line for the ghost riding.

1039
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,900
That's one square. I kind of like that. I like that. It's like a thing you're

1040
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,200
doing, like to help out.

1041
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,400
You chose a very visual game for us. Yeah, I apologize. I should have said

1042
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,500
something about that. You don't need to do the dot. We get it.

1043
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,400
Let's hurry it up or I'm going to take my turn back. Ghost riding makes it too

1044
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,920
slow man. Yeah, so you we can imagine it happening. You zoom past you zoom one

1045
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,800
square over and zoom up and then zigzag inwards, sort of starting to approach the

1046
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,600
dude. You other crew on the opposite side. No, I didn't. You fucked me and you

1047
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,680
kind of cut off Zuck though by accident. Zuck you're up though. You can go this

1048
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,360
way, go back. You can also go up around him, but then I have to like give you

1049
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
Oh, gosh. Should I just make them die?

1050
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,980
Yeah, you can do that, too.

1051
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,420
OK.

1052
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,380
Don't make them die. Just go backwards and then...

1053
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,380
No, actually, wait, I'm blue.

1054
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,900
Yeah.

1055
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:32,900
Why am I dotting?

1056
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,900
One, two, three, four, five.

1057
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,980
Oh, I'm shaky.

1058
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,180
And that's where your dot is.

1059
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,140
Yeah. So you guys are kind of mirroring each other.

1060
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,580
I'm on the attack. I'm pretty offensive.

1061
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,140
Well, that's what I was doing.

1062
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,140
So right here.

1063
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,060
So if we do it right, we can just

1064
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,020
corner them off and then square that box them in. That's true.

1065
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,460
It's what I was trying to do. But patches, I think it might be a genius at a game

1066
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,260
like this. Yeah, he designed the game after all. Oh,

1067
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:10,100
oh, so now I did it is starting to cut you off. Yeah. So I completely have just

1068
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,580
died. Maybe. No, because you get a role.

1069
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,380
What? You get a role, right? A role. Yes. I usually operate. Yeah, I didn't

1070
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,480
can explain that you will have to roll. You will roll a like deck saving throw

1071
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,380
to see if you survive that. Yeah, sorry, I should have just yeah, I should have

1072
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:29,500
said that that is the one thing you do get to do. Otherwise, it is just sort of

1073
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,940
line drawing and now

1074
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,040
it's time for

1075
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,700
which one is this wet his bed

1076
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:41,600
fucker a cheeky. I think these guys have been practicing this game.

1077
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,800
Cool. All right. And you're now up, Finger Bros.

1078
00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:00,360
Okay. So he's going kind of behind us. Finger Bros is going to try to probably

1079
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,040
meet, wet his bed where he's at.

1080
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,200
We might have finally done it, guys.

1081
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,240
I think we're gonna win. We might have finally... And now Joey SMS. Pushed the

1082
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,240
limits of the audio medium. Yeah.

1083
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,200
Yeah, I know the audio listeners are gonna love this.

1084
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,560
And the video listeners are too. You can't even see this. Yeah.

1085
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,740
it's not my fault.

1086
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:26,640
I'll play some exciting sounds in the yes. Oh yeah, please yeah play the

1087
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,760
soundtrack sounds

1088
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,340
the people are loving it. Those are the people at home. Okay, we do have a bike

1089
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,360
so I'll play this every time we take a turn. Well, that's not me. That's cool.

1090
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,860
Yeah, is that the bike music from Tron or you have actually this is from the

1091
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,860
this is the end suite. This will fix everything. All right now somebody take

1092
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,880
turn and get ready to hear the sound.

1093
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,880
Alright, cool. It's your turn.

1094
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,880
You have to roll dexterity saving throw.

1095
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,880
Oh, shit.

1096
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,880
Is this the bike theme?

1097
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,880
No, this is the ending suite.

1098
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,880
That's a 5.

1099
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
It's a 5?

1100
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
But I get to roll

1101
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,880
for him too.

1102
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
Because I'm in control of his bike.

1103
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,880
You're not dead.

1104
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,880
That's the closest sound I have to a crash.

1105
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
Cool, you're not dead. You just appear

1106
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:20,160
on the sidelines. You're out though. So put an X there. That was loud. He's out. Now,

1107
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,400
I have a question. Zuck, it's your turn. What's up? Um, if I run into somebody at the point

1108
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:32,720
where they are, is it like first to the point or can I, I think you probably do a roll against.

1109
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,720
I think you can do like, yeah, I think I like that. I like that idea. I say, yeah, sorry.

1110
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,680
I haven't doing that. Also one more question. If I kill people, if I kill somebody, do their

1111
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:54,680
your

1112
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,680
Oh, wait, wait. So, sorry.

1113
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,180
Yeah.

1114
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:57,680
Never mind.

1115
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,880
If you go up and then go right there.

1116
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,380
Never mind.

1117
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,380
So, if I cut off pink,

1118
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:01,880
Yeah.

1119
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,380
then I basically did the same thing pink did to Cameron.

1120
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:04,880
Yes.

1121
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,380
Okay.

1122
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:05,880
Yeah.

1123
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,880
And then you'd also have nowhere to go.

1124
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,380
Yeah.

1125
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:07,880
No, no, you would.

1126
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,880
You would have because then, well, the line stays, right?

1127
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,380
Yeah, the line stays.

1128
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,880
But then you could just go do...

1129
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,880
No, I wouldn't really.

1130
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,380
You'd have nowhere to go.

1131
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,880
No, you could also hit the guy right there.

1132
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
Well, no, he's already...

1133
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
That's just his line.

1134
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Oh, shit.

1135
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
(laughs)

1136
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:26,280
Okay, I think I'm going to try to see the forest through the trees a little bit

1137
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,660
here, and I am going to roll a perception check. There you go. We already are

1138
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,680
down one guy and I'm in a really bad spot. And I did not realize we were- I

1139
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,940
should have asked you guys to bring the GoPro and it's going to suck if we keep

1140
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:43,180
doing this. Yeah, yeah. So I'm going to roll a perception check that I think is

1141
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:47,640
going to automatically probably pass, even with a five. I mean, let's see. My

1142
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,280
intelligence- You notice this big crack in the fucking wall.

1143
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,280
(Laughter)

1144
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,280
As God realizes the dumb ass decision he made.

1145
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
Uh huh.

1146
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,280
Yeah.

1147
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,560
And it does look like a butt crack and it's going, "Oh no."

1148
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,840
Well it's gross so I won't do it.

1149
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
And I'd like to play the game.

1150
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
Cool.

1151
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
No, I'll head for the crack.

1152
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,400
Okay, you head for the crack.

1153
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,800
(Sound of air blowing)

1154
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,280
You head towards the crack, you burst through.

1155
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,280
As you burst through, you hear an alarm go off.

1156
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,280
(Alarm sound)

1157
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,280
A robot.

1158
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,280
(Alarm sound)

1159
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,280
Yeah, robot.

1160
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,080
I just want to remain one mean one.

1161
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,800
Capture them.

1162
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,200
They've escaped the prison.

1163
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,240
OK, then I have to pick up.

1164
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,240
The werewolf he now the werewolf

1165
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,600
appears behind you, Zach on your bike.

1166
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,360
OK, you I'm holding.

1167
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,160
You're really close.

1168
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,080
Where's the crack on the board?

1169
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,960
Is it right here?

1170
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,320
You I just went through it.

1171
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,400
It's where you went through it.

1172
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:43,920
Wherever it is.

1173
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,800
OK, wait, wait, wait.

1174
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,360
And then I do this warning.

1175
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,520
That was good though.

1176
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,720
I meant to do this.

1177
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,160
Yeah.

1178
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,880
And then also,

1179
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,760
you don't need to, nobody could see that.

1180
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,040
You zoom through the crack.

1181
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:57,800
Uh,

1182
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,360
as you,

1183
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,760
as you crash through,

1184
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,840
uh,

1185
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:07,360
Joe music, 1976 appears on your back of your bike.

1186
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,480
Well, his brother's already on the back of his bike.

1187
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,960
Yeah.

1188
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,120
He appears on my brother's

1189
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,700
We have a sight here. He appears on the back of the side car that my brother is

1190
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,300
not it.

1191
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:26,000
Says great job guys. I mean you could seem like you could have maybe won the

1192
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,700
games, but I'm glad you did this instead of making everyone suffer through that

1193
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:35,100
any longer. Let's go this way. Well, if we were playing it on the computer, it

1194
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,300
would have been the greatest thing ever. It would have been very cool things. I

1195
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,600
could have thought about. Yeah. So you guys are zooming now down. You're kind

1196
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:47,960
I'm in this nether space between the wedding way and the and the tinkle layer

1197
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,520
and as you're trying to reach to the SS nappy and then flipers now are flying by

1198
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:58,680
you will be the flipers are flying by and they're coming to attack the rashed all

1199
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,440
three of you roll initiative again die brash you'll be die brash actually no

1200
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,320
it will keep your initiatives from before they're pretty good anyway yeah

1201
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:11,320
and we'll have the Flipers roll. Okay. Warning, you will be de-res. Every time I fucking say it.

1202
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:17,880
13. Can we roll again actually? No. Me and Cam got good ones. I got the best roll you could

1203
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,560
possibly get on the dice. I did not, so something's bad. And then I got to roll for Joey. Okay.

1204
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,480
Cool. So you guys are flying down now as Flipers are chasing you as you're trying to approach the

1205
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:34,080
the ss nappy ed, it is your turn. Okay, sorry,

1206
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,920
you're controlling his thing. He kind of just looks like an ed. Yeah, it's my

1207
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:44,360
middle name. It's my middle name to me to know it's not a liar. I tried

1208
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:51,000
warning for lying. My middle name is Michael. If everybody has to know, okay,

1209
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,560
I'll stop

1210
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,600
I'm going to add that sound. Yeah, that would stay you're getting close

1211
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,300
morning.

1212
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,800
Not quite not quite a

1213
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,160
but it's getting there, not quite a buzzer, a Geiger counter.

1214
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,880
Okay, so it's a fight yeah and it's like sort of a it's similar to the fight.

1215
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,680
We did the the fight we were doing. We're going down the mountain in a

1216
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:21,220
temple of that's my favorite moment we ever did in D and D. It was mine too,

1217
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,660
so let's do this shit.

1218
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,480
All right, so first off, I use my claws and my teeth.

1219
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,480
They're in the sky, bro.

1220
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,780
Yeah, okay. I jump a hundred feet in the air, which is how much I can do.

1221
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,580
We did in the in.

1222
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,980
You're the one who let him be a fucking werewolf. You do this every time. I

1223
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:38,780
can't even believe it.

1224
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,780
It surprises you.

1225
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,980
I can't pretend. Yeah, it's you're right.

1226
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,780
You like it. You clearly fucking like it.

1227
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:46,680
I do enjoy it. It's fun when you guys make me laugh. I'm going to let some

1228
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,680
stuff happen.

1229
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,280
Shut up.

1230
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:48,880
So you should.

1231
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,380
you

1232
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,780
all right. You could jump a hundred feet in the air and

1233
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,580
man

1234
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:59,180
that voice

1235
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:10,580
I was literally I literally was just looking for Tron sounds and

1236
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,880
that one came up. It's for Kingdom Hearts. Yeah, I'm

1237
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,280
Kingdom Hearts two. I know, I know, buddy. I know. Sorry.

1238
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,620
Yeah, we don't need to know that man. Yeah, all right, so you've jumped up in

1239
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,620
the air. I don't have to jump in the air, but is there a way I can attack

1240
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,900
though? You jump up in the air. You have to jump up in the you guys have

1241
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,060
squeeze your finger really hard, make your claw shoot out like a bullet. Oh

1242
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,060
yeah, you guys have melee attack. Oh yeah,

1243
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,860
oh yeah,

1244
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:40,740
you guys have mainly attacks and range attacks. Your melee attack is either

1245
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,300
your claws or your fists or you can

1246
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:48,480
attack with your nappy or you can throw your nappy. It's sort of similar to the

1247
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,680
discs in Tron, it's the way that you're identified as a user. I'm gonna borrow

1248
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,940
the power of the bad guys. Yeah, you can borrow bad guy powers too. You're

1249
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,440
flying, I just wanna see what it does. While he's doing that,

1250
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:05,580
can I do a twin makeover? It's my turn, man. Stay out of my

1251
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:05,960
turn.

1252
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,900
Okay, so... Stay out of his turn. When you're borrowing a flipper power...

1253
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:15,840
four. That is a war. Roll a D for roll D for if you get a four, we're going to

1254
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,340
roll again.

1255
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,840
Roll again.

1256
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:25,740
Okay, you have the ability to fly now like a flipper. Okay. Yeah, that was

1257
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,940
there's flying. There's a tracking beam and then there's shooting a laser. Damn.

1258
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,140
I wish I got laser. Yeah, I fly up.

1259
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,340
Send your enemy steel points.

1260
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,340
Can I say I used a big one?

1261
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,340
Yeah.

1262
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,340
That's three points.

1263
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,340
Okay, and then I'm going to attack with my bite.

1264
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:51,340
So that's going to be,

1265
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,340
yeah, and that and then plus five on this.

1266
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,340
Okay, eighteen.

1267
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
Because I've now made you into a crazy werewolf.

1268
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,340
Yeah, that does hit the flipper.

1269
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,340
Roll 2d8.

1270
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,340
You're going to be really fucking strong now.

1271
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:04,040
strong now

1272
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:13,560
eleven K plus five strength. So it's sixteen so yeah you just eliminate this

1273
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,540
flight for you. So I have to make the flippers stronger next session. Yeah,

1274
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:22,400
you just like chomp you do bite. You said yeah, you just bite into this flipper

1275
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,720
and it just I'm on the butt and it just y'all and explodes and disintegrates and

1276
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:33,340
things wiped from diaper talk. I get it and now there is one other flipper

1277
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:38,580
that's still chasing you. It is your turn, Zuck. I think that I'm going to

1278
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,700
use scramble, which says

1279
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:49,300
grump of programs do random acting. I step tarns for eighteen seconds.

1280
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:52,580
I don't have great handwriting. What does this

1281
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,040
group of grump of pro

1282
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,440
grump of

1283
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:09,920
to random acting. I step tarns for tarns for eighteen seconds, so I want I I'm

1284
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,160
guessing that means group, but acting I step tarns.

1285
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,080
What is what's this meaning? They either will

1286
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,520
though either no no no I don't want to know your translation. I want to know

1287
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:25,620
What this means says. Let me see now, let me see now, because I know what it

1288
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:29,640
means in my head now. Yeah, random actions or they skip their turns.

1289
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,980
Random actions slash skip turns. Oh, okay. For 18 seconds. I skip turns.

1290
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:39,140
Scramble 'em. Yeah. I'ma scramble 'em. Nice, okay. And this is a DC-13C.

1291
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,220
Yeah. So...

1292
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,980
What is that? It has a C next to it. Nice. Oh, concentration, that's what I

1293
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,940
meant by that. Okay.

1294
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:51,780
Okay, it fails that. So now on the fliper's turn, which is going to be

1295
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:56,000
after Joe's turn, which Joe is going to try to

1296
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,420
shoot it with its nappy. So he's gonna whip off his nappy and sling it

1297
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:06,140
at this fliper that's confused and scrambled. And he does manage to hit

1298
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,380
it.

1299
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:11,540
And he... Wow, he does eight damage to this fliper. This fliper is now

1300
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:16,020
hit and still scrambled and confused. And now on its turn, I'm gonna roll...

1301
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,720
Sorry, I'm seeing right now that what I thought was a T and an I, you just put a

1302
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:21,120
K,

1303
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:26,680
most of a K, and then for an I, you decided to just put the dot part of the

1304
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:31,380
I. Is that what I did? Yeah. I do stuff like that sometimes. You combined a K

1305
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:31,920
and an I.

1306
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,420
Okay. Let's see how it's... Yeah, the Fliper,

1307
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:41,540
on its turn, it does manage to

1308
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:46,000
beat out the scramble. It doesn't solve it, like it doesn't like get past

1309
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,600
like it still has to deal with it next turn, but it does manage to like

1310
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,340
conquer it this time, and so it's going to try to attack

1311
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,940
you for trying to scramble it.

1312
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,960
And what is your... 13. Yeah, it hits you. Okay.

1313
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,040
Four.

1314
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,040
One.

1315
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,600
Well, I saw him roll a one, but plus two, so it's three damage. It landed

1316
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,280
on one when you said one. Oh shit, man, I'm at four HP, man. I got

1317
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,480
the heal, I got the heal, man. Heal my ass, bro. And now

1318
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,560
it is a finger, brother turn and guess what

1319
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,860
another ultimate role

1320
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:27,400
that was a double ultimate role. Actually, what are you doing? I really

1321
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,160
like the idea of the ultimate role. I like it to all. Can you create an

1322
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:36,020
ability? I'll incorporate it. Yeah, maybe divide it by a should be at the

1323
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:40,200
end of every day. We're fighting the final got boss. He gets a little roll.

1324
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,880
Well, there should just be one thing where we have to succeed in. We have to

1325
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,340
you. Yeah, we just do this

1326
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,640
over. You have to get over

1327
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,480
we'll see, but yeah, I got what you mean. Yeah, there has to be one thing we

1328
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,600
have to do. Yeah, we get it with this story. You have to throw the hash

1329
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,200
code into it. Yeah, okay, we'll have to do it. There will be an ultimate

1330
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,040
role in this arc, which is when you roll all the dice with them between

1331
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,360
your fingers for people. And you say this is the ultimate role. Yeah, yeah.

1332
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,000
Okay, so I'm gonna do a twin maneuver. Okay,

1333
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
How many of them are still in the sky?

1334
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Because we only need one.

1335
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Then I'm not going to do that.

1336
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I don't have like a projectile.

1337
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Oh, no, I do.

1338
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Okay, I'm just going to do that.

1339
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Yeah, I'm just going to throw my nappy.

1340
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I'm just going to throw my nappy.

1341
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Well, I got a three.

1342
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah, so you miss.

1343
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You sling your nappy.

1344
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It teleports back onto your body as you miss.

1345
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
We're going to go back to the top of the order.

1346
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Ed, it's your turn.

1347
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
You're still flying up in the air.

1348
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Yeah, I'm going to heal the team.

1349
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
No, no, no.

1350
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Okay.

1351
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,840
with my pencil.

1352
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,840
So yeah, you spend one of your energy points.

1353
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,540
This side of the table is more fun than that side of the table, guys. I'll say

1354
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,760
it. We are the nerd side. That's 'cause this side's better at combat.

1355
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,980
Sounds like I have some nerd shit. Yep. Well, 'cause I'm a samurai. Okay, so

1356
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:01,400
you think the soldiers of our army are nerds? Yeah. So you guys all feel cool.

1357
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,660
You think that the warriors on our police force are nerds? Yeah. You think

1358
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:08,260
the karate masters on our ninja teams are nerds? No, those are actually cool.

1359
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,160
I like Groucho, but I got Harpo's mouth.

1360
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:17,160
I don't know any of his lines.

1361
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,160
2d4 plus 2.

1362
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,160
Yeah, can you hit the warning when he does stuff like that?

1363
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,160
Warning!

1364
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,160
Okay.

1365
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,160
It was already done.

1366
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:25,160
I didn't need a warning.

1367
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,160
Six.

1368
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,160
Plus two.

1369
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,160
Plus two.

1370
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,160
Eight.

1371
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,160
You guys heal eight HP.

1372
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,160
Oh shit.

1373
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,160
To your max.

1374
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,160
Well, then I'm at eight.

1375
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,160

Aw, yeah!

1379
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,160
That's a great ability you have there.

1380
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,160
a great ability. Yeah, I usually never give you guys healing and I was realizing that

1381
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,160
you guys do too much stupid shit. We die all the time. So like I gotta let you guys heal.

1382
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:50,060
We've died in so many campaigns at this point. Well just yeah, it just makes it, allows you

1383
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:55,800
guys to be more risk-taking. It is now your turn though, Zuck. Wait, I just went. Yeah,

1384
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,480
we're moving pretty fast. Wait, this is crazy you guys. I... So who's chasing us at this

1385
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,480
point? How many of them? Just one Viper left. You guys broke out pretty fast. You will be

1386
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:13,760

Fly into Joey Music's face and explode and kill both of his humans. Wait, no,

1391
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,880
no, no. Joey Music could, could... And I would also, because he has to obey,

1392
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,720
I would like Joey's me, Joey music's reaction to sound exactly like Sullivan.

1393
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,060
Okay,

milliseconds have gone by. He goes

1400
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:15,180
he could feel that an unwanted character somewhere was feeling pain and you guys

1401
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:20,680
approach the S. S. Nappy, which was Joe music ship. He's dead yeah. The keys

1402
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:25,000

01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:55,400
good song. I think we're gonna die. It's always, we're just bad at this game.

01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,200
We're bad like that.
