1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,200
Was a good clap that was a probably the best one so far

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,000
Slept so well last night that we're gonna have the best episode ever

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,080

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,480

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,980
aware that this is what is going to when people are looking for this episode,

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,120
this will come out, yeah, when they click on the hashtag, this episode, okay, I

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,520

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,180
okay, go ahead, my hashtags are hashtag one last episode, hashtag Patrick

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:51,800
whoa, those are my one last episode, why Patrick forever, yeah, what is he, is

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,960
something gonna happen to me,

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,260
what are you saying, is something happening to me, no, they're separate

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,480
they don't have to do with each other. Even individually I don't like them.

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,280
Can I say one hashtag also?

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,780
Hashtag one last time.

17
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,080
I don't like these hashtags. Hashtags keep going for quite some time.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,280
Yeah. Hashtag one last time. Hashtag one last one.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
One last time in here.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,380
Hashtag RIP Petunia Fish.

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,580
Who's that? John Mulaney's dog.

22
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,880
Oh, God. Wait, the dog that was in all the videos?

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,680
The dog that was in all the stand-up specials and stuff.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,180
The stand-up movies? That just kills me.

25
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,980
yeah, just because I am his dog

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,680
and I died. Yeah, well,

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,780
well, that's one of those. What kind of dog is that a pug? That

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,780
is one of those dogs that only lives to be seven years old. I

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,280
think a French bulldog. Yeah, they know. No, these ones live

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,480
forever. Really, but they die violent, awful deaths because

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
they're they're 10 years of the last 10 years of their lives

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,080
are so bad. They're sniffling the first two years. The first

33
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,480
two years of their lives are fine. And then the rest of their

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,880
lives, they can't breathe at all. They had they have their

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,340
their noses are so clogged that they have like a pressure differential inside

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,320
their body and they explode like an airplane. You reach a certain age like a

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,880
doctor. I am a doctor. Oh my God, you're right. You are a doctor, but okay, so we

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,120
did the

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,480
microphone. Juvia, here's a hashtag for you. What hashtag get a life

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,840
to who and why? So what is up with? What does that have to do? Patrick, not

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,320
forever, Patrick for no time, Patrick for one last time, Patrick, hashtag one

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,700
last because he's done. I

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,460
I had a actual prophetic dream last night. Oh yeah, I had a it was the

44
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,800
craziest thing ever. I had a dream that

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,120
I had to go into detail to show just say what it's the broad stroke. Okay,

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
the broad strokes are

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,040
I had a dream that

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,720
I needed to talk to somebody about something and I thought that it was

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,600
and you can go a little you're a little bit

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,240
at

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,820
we're moving to a new place. We're moving to a new office and I and the

52
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,580
landlord basically

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,380
wanted

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,420
or I needed to

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,300
I don't know. I don't know. I

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:17,420
we need to talk to somebody. I had to the old tenants. I we didn't even need.

57
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,740
I didn't know that I needed to talk to them, but I had a dream that I went over

58
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,440
to the old tenants at the place and I talked to them and I figured out that we

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,180
can. I figured I chopped it up with them and I got along really, really well and

60
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,600
then we were able to move in in the time where we originally wanted to yeah,

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,980
which didn't seem like an option as of yesterday, which and the reason that it

62
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,000
didn't seem like an option was because supposedly we had to talk to these

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,360
people

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,260
and we not even that we had to talk to them, but they didn't want us. Yeah,

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,020
that early, because there was a firewall that needed to be built. They were

66
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,660
building a firewall, because they thought we would hack them and then I

67
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,500
woke up

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,760
and as soon as I wake up, I get a call from the future landlord, who's a very

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,980
smart guy and I get a call from him and I answer and he basically says the

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,740
entire thing is solved instantly, because I think that I in my dreams,

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,580
because you talk to the which that I talk to the old tenants yeah, which was

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,140
the thing that was the obstacle. I have a feeling that in your dream, I want to

73
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,960
I and now I want to get their phone number, call them up and say remember

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
what was your dream last night.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,120
Let's go and say remember me

76
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,120
what was from your dream. What was your dream last night? Tell me right now,

77
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,460
don't say my name just because also I don't want to influence them and say

78
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,020
yeah, I'm going to be the future tenant because then they might make up. So

79
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,120
you have to be a stranger to them. Yeah, to call and be like I need to we

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,620
need to dress up like oh, I'm with I'm with National Grid and we're going to

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,760
come out and check on what your dream was. What was your dream last night?

82
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,860
What we need to do is when the first day that we move in, we paint ourselves

83
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,180
like a translucent blue, right? Like we're forced ghosts. We'll figure it

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,180
out. Okay. And we walk around there in the halls of the building and just

85
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,020
walk by a window that they have or something, just look in.

86
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,380
So they think like, "Oh shit, I just saw a ghost."

87
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,140
Right? So then when they see us... Make it so they see our face. So they

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,100
think they're having a prophetic vision of us. Yeah, yeah. And then...

89
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,300
Oh, I get it. Yeah, see them and we're not blue anymore. Yeah, so I thought

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,520
you were saying we just dress up like ghosts and then ask them still if they

91
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,740
had a dream last night. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

92
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,060
we're not going in, we're not going in like like ghost of Christmas past,

93
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,500
we're going in, you know, it's ghost of Christmas future. What's crazy is I

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,800
actually had a a prophetic experience this week as well, and I didn't think

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,320
much of it until I heard about yours. Mine is less but less cool, but it's

96
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,860
just I think reality is breaking down around us maybe, but so what happened

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,320
I went to see the new evil dead movie with Alex okay, and while the previews were

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,360
playing, I made it. I had a I had my book in my pocket. I was reading on the

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,520
subway. My book was Wuthering Heights. I was reading it and I was making a joke

100
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,680
to Alex. It's like I'm going to read this book during the movie and I took out. I

101
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,560
showed him the book right. Silly joke funny and then the movie start very

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,320
funny joke. The movie starts

103
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,520
the movie opens on a character sitting down and reading and what book is that

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,200
character reading Wuthering Heights and then there's a part of the movie where

105
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,500
where the character reads from the book that you could have read along. I

106
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,180
could have read a lot. I could have found the page and read along. You

107
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,980
stand up in the

108
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,380
guys hold the

109
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,420
but it was pretty crazy. By the way,

110
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,460
and you know what's scary about this prophetic experience is that moments

111
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,100
later that character's scalp was ripped off. So you're looking around behind

112
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,220
you, checking the seat behind you all of a sudden, some little kid is pulling

113
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,020
on the back of his head.

114
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,620
Tomahawk

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,680
happening about your head. I'm sorry. Can I just do this real quick? I will say

116
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,280
that is my version of the subway surfer with the with the family guy things as I

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,580
go and watch a Suspiria and you and I watch and I have a book underneath me. I

118
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,820
do that at home. Sometimes I put on a movie of already seen and I read a book.

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,300
Yeah, the movie is back. That's just the smart version. It's how you accumulate

120
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,000
information. It's how you make links between media absolutely and I'll be

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
listening. It's the only way that your brain can connect like the movie Star

122
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,160
Star Wars with the novelization of star. That's why I in separate that's why I

123
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,540
always am reading that if there's a book that gets turned on a movie, I have to

124
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,660
read the book while I watch the movie. The problem with the novelization of

125
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,460
like the move like Star Wars and stuff is like you do have to posit because

126
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,860
there's a lot of deleted scenes like bigs dark lighter on Tatooine. Don't

127
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,740
know what is that Luke's friend who dies and they have no in the original movie.

128
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,540
They have like no build up. He just like meets him at the rebel Academy and then

129
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,940
in that he plays a much bigger role.

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,640
They're supposed to be like a cool action figure of him and stuff.

131
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,140
He's going to be like a cool guy.

132
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,140
He is a cool name.

133
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
What does this have to do with books?

134
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,140
There's a deleted scene in the book.

135
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
The novelization. You just wanted to talk about it.

136
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,140
You just wanted to say that.

137
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I mean the cool, the Star Wars book,

138
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
The Splinter of the Mind's Eye, did you ever read that?

139
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,140
No, I saw the sequel.

140
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
The graphic novel. Well I read that.

141
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140
You saw it? I saw a picture of it.

142
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
I saw it on a bookshelf. Yeah, I saw a picture of it.

143
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,620
That's the one where they hired whatever his name is to write a sequel novel before the

144
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
movie came out.

145
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,980
So it's like Divergence.

146
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,900
But the funny thing about it is that because Leia and Luke, or they didn't reveal that

147
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,060
Leia and Luke were brother and sister yet.

148
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,700
So the Splinter of the Mind's Eye, the whole book, they're like falling in love with each

149
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
other and kissing each other.

150
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Oh yeah.

151
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
That's so sweet.

152
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,900
And then like Luke is training Leia to be a Jedi and shit.

153
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,900
Yeah.

154
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
And they're completely in love.

155
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,220
And then the next movie came out and they were brother and sister.

156
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,180
We need to make a cover of that is Darth Vader and then Leia with a like a purple lightsaber

157
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,180
or whatever.

158
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,340
I don't remember my cover.

159
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,900
I think the mind's eye.

160
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,060
Mara Jade Skywalker has the purple lightsaber.

161
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,340
We need to make a Wookiee Pedia Dramatica.

162
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,780
Yeah, we do.

163
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,980
Dude, that'd be so sick.

164
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Wouldn't that be cool?

165
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Wookiee Pedia Dramatica.

166
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,380
And we're just like, and the Wookiees are gay.

167
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Yeah.

168
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,140
And 50 gay Ewoks had butt sex on the fuck planet.

169
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,580
You guys realize that Ewok is an anagram for woke?

170
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,180
Whoa.

171
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,540
Okay, there's a lot of things that we say on this show that are kind of just stupid and

172
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,740
funny that actually just blow my mind.

173
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Yeah.

174
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,740
Uh-huh.

175
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
That blew my mind.

176
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
Endor.

177
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
Ronda.

178
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Doner.

179
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Doner.

180
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
Oh my God.

181
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Yeah, like a kebab.

182
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Kebab.

183
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
Doner kebab.

184
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Why'd you say kebab?

185
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Because that's how they say it.

186
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Like a kebab.

187
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
That's how they say it in the show.

188
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
What the hell is going wrong with you?

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
Kebab.

190
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Kebab.

191
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Anagram.

192
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Bobca.

193
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Bobca.

194
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Bread.

195
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,340
little guy with a big nose, Turkish guy who'd hit. Oh yes, he yes car. The video

196
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,460
I do remember the bat. You remember him? Luke anagrammed to

197
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,380
yeah. So his name is cool. Skywalker.

198
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,340
Cue Skywalker

199
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,540
and Skywalker Sky Clawer

200
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,260
squawk.

201
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:59,420
Wait, my God, there's so many. The truth is revealed on solo. Guess what?

202
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,080
that's an an a anal holy shit on solo shanel, so

203
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,820
it's all what the fuck you're right.

204
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,960
This is scaring me. There's so many anagrams in star wars. What's the

205
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,860
Voldemort one? What's his middle name in that?

206
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,380
Marvolo Tom Tom Marvelo yeah,

207
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,600
that they just had to fill in the middle where they're like Tom. We got riddle

208
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,400
fuck

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,340
- Marfolo.

210
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,460
(laughing)

211
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,420
- It's the stupidest, there's this kid,

212
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,420
I did the high school film festival thing in high school,

213
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,140
and the dude who beat my short film,

214
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,300
it was a movie called Revolution.

215
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,380
- It was a movie?

216
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,940
- It was a short film called Revolution,

217
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,100
and the whole thing, the whole,

218
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,680
(laughing)

219
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,720
The thing it was like it's like a news article or whatever, and it's like

220
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,240
graffiti has been popping up all over town and the graffiti is just the word

221
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
no vile route.

222
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,760
End of the movie is that coming together in the same way as like the Harry

223
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,080
Potter thing, and then it just spells revolution. I was like, Oh,

224
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,200
I fucking wonder what no vile route meant. That is no vile.

225
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,120
What was your short film about? It was about a puppy bowl tailgater.

226
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
Pretty fucking epic puppy bowl. Tail. Okay.

227
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,120
The guy who tailgates the puppy bowl. Do you still have this video? I do still have the video.

228
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,000
Can I see this soon? Yeah. It's not online? No, it's online somewhere.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,080
But I entered it into the film festival.

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Somebody else did because the person, it was like we were in groups in the classroom and this kid

231
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,480
was like, "Do you want to join up in our group?" I was like, "Okay, yeah, because I don't know

232
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,800
anyone in that class that well." And then I found out that he only had me in there because I had no

233
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,320
no one else in the group and then he was trying to ask out the other girl who was in the group

234
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
and then the group dissolved and then I had to make the whole short film within like a

235
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
day.

236
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Creative differences.

237
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,760
You used to rule the school with my videos on.

238
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,360
I was in stuff too.

239
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,080
In the morning I'd go to P.E.

240
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I lost the fan vote.

241
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,400
Play dodgeball and jump and roll.

242
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,800
I was second place.

243
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,160
Second place fan vote.

244
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Wow.

245
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,360
cheerleaders in the crowds of singing the quiet class in home room science

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,960
and math. I'm sleeping

247
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,560
the bell is ringing yeah yeah, here we go in the Mr. Peters calling

248
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,760
my

249
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,240
principal. Peter just called my name

250
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,440
because I hate this school and one day I'll rule the world

251
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,180
and one day I'll kill my brother. That's about a classmate. I prequel it's the

252
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,920
prequel to Viva La Vida. Yeah, it's Viva La School Viva La School Viva La School

253
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,080
days eating at school.

254
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,280
It's a good idea.

255
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,040
What else did I want to talk? Oh,

256
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,440
no, I forgot it again. It's was it something about me. It probably was

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,180
because you're the main character of my life and I think about you all day and

258
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,460
night.

259
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,960
>> Well, you pointed at me, you went like, oh.

260
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,040
>> It's just a habit I have.

261
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,280
>> Yeah.

262
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
>> Point to point.

263
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,440
>> I point to people, too. I think I go like, oh.

264
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,600
>> Oh, I hate graffiti. You were saying graffiti. I hate it.

265
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,680
>> Why do you hate graph?

266
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,480
>> I think it's--

267
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
>> Why do you hate writers?

268
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,880
>> I hope I never see graffiti again as long as I live.

269
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,080
>> Bro.

270
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,440
>> I don't ever need to see it.

271
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
>> It kind of turns my stomach when I see somebody put graffiti on the fresh wall

272
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,680
of a business.

273
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,680
what you guys need to do. Fresh, by the way, F R E S H. None of that

274
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,080
H R E C S H. What you guys need to do right now.

275
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:02,380
Go on to Amazon dot com prime ship at two copies of Mark Echoes getting up.

276
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,680
Actually, no, you can buy it on steam. Go home by Mark.

277
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,980
I hope Mark Echoes gets out in the gallows and then we drop him through

278
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,680
that little square and you can find out the whole twisted world of amazing

279
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,320
photography. I was rather put a star in my gallows yeah and the hole where they

280
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,640
fall through instead of a square that be like a star. I would do it like a bronze

281
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,480
die cut pasta and I come out the other end like a different shape. I would do.

282
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,660
I would get it. I'd get it make a cast of the person who was dying. I make it

283
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,400
their exact shape so that nobody can be falsely executed. So if they try and

284
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,480
switch out like so, so I'd put like you know what you put like put like a round

285
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
peg into a round hole deal, but I well exactly what if they put it so it was

286
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,480
a skinny guy and he gets a fat guy to replace him, but otherwise it works

287
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,480
well skinny guys that's okay. They don't have much to live for. What if

288
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm not going to what if somebody's really skinny and they have put like a

289
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,880
baby in there and you're like well, he fits in the hole, but baby wouldn't fit

290
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,080
through the hole is too short. It wouldn't go all the way down. You could

291
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,000
put a baby. We have a perfectly fit the baby. You could put the whole baby in

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,560
the head. I guess maybe I'd build a robotic version. How does that the

293
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,080
perfectly thick and he's already dead? If you've already hung him into the

294
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,840
hole? Well, no, because it's the floor that comes out. Which one is the gallows

295
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,060
is that the hand? No, that's a hanging. No, the you know what I'm talking about?

296
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,900
That's a stockade stockade. Gallows is hanging. That's not where you're thinking

297
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,460
about this whole time. Tomatoes at the people in the stock. Ah, that's okay.

298
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,740
That's what I thought when you can put the whole baby in the head hole. I think

299
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,540
a lot of these stock traders up at the top should be put in our traders who

300
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,980
should be put in stocks.

301
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,900
Wait, drop a put the oh, you don't have the thing with you.

302
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,400
don't have the drum machine. No, we could have just let him cook for like two

303
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,320
minutes and we wouldn't have to do any work. That was already pretty cool

304
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,160
though. Yeah, I don't think they needed a beat. That was one of my better lines

305
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,360
for a while. Can you do like just right now, just acapella off the dome? No,

306
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
you can't make me do that shit. All right. Well, what are you doing? I just

307
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,280
wanted to hear him for you. I'm, you know, you just, you're tired and you

308
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,480
don't want to talk. I am a little tired. Mo has been ruining my sleep because he

309
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,180
he bites me. My sleep to make him make me feed my sleep. I've had the worst sleep

310
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,300
in my life for like one week and then last night I got one good night of sleep.

311
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,580
I put my phone in the other room at 11 o'clock. I put on, yes, I have a

312
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,780
sleeping mask. I put my sleeping mask. I told you about that. I put you on to

313
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,760
that. It's real good. I love it. I sleep with my arm covering my eyes. I love

314
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,160
this. It's not enough for me. It's not enough for me either. I need to get the

315
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,560
mom from Matilda. That's how I sleep. And then I sleep. She has a sleeping mask

316
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,780
that has eyes on it. And it scares Matilda.

317
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,980
I like that thing. I don't know if you remember...

318
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,480
What doesn't scare Matilda, though?

319
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
She's a bit of a fraidy cat, bitch.

320
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,680
She's afraid of child abuse for some reason.

321
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
She gets so scared she develops powers.

322
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Listen, I tell you what, if my dad was fucking four foot eleven,

323
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
I would not be afraid of his bum ass.

324
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,680
No, I'd be rubbing, I'd be putting vegetable oil on the floor.

325
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,680
If Danny Rubino was my dad, I'd be tipping him over.

326
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I'd be putting vegetable oil on the floor.

327
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
You'd rub your dad?

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,100
him when he fell down. What

329
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,800
why would that help you avoid being here?

330
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,560
He doesn't know how to hit now because he's covered in Crisco and I'm

331
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,440
bad dinner. If I remember correctly, not baby carrots, it's really not that bad.

332
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Her dad's a scumbag who puts sawdust in the cars. Yeah, he's got no

333
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,520
read. Does the odometer yeah, he switches the

334
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,600
the vert was cool. It was cool. That blew my mind. Did you guys know that

335
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Danny DeVito directed that movie. No, I was thinking of a different fact

336
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,840
actually.

337
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,400
Yeah, that's a fact that I

338
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:43,680
feel like I've learned that fact with full surprise, maybe ten times every

339
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,760
time I learn. I really learn. Why didn't you keep making movies man? Yeah,

340
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,120
that's a fact that I just autistically very remember immediately. When I saw

341
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,800
that when I was younger, I was like, whoa, I feel like I feel like I learn

342
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,280
it every year. Yeah, and I yeah, I would have believed probably because I keep

343
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,160
I would have sooner believed that Matilda directed that with how heroic it made

344
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,760
it look yeah. That's what I was saying. I was like wait. Why would this guy

345
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,160
direct a movie where he's the bad guy? This doesn't make any sense at all to

346
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,760
me. I want to see I want to see a movie from his perspective. I knew yeah. I

347
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,920
heard the new Superman movies directed by Lex Luthor. No, it doesn't make any

348
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,880
sense. Exactly directed by Superman. Yeah,

349
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,800
exactly. It's so stupid. Yeah, yeah, also a movie from the dad's perspective

350
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,900
would be pretty good. I'm thinking his name is Frank, a movie called Frank.

351
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,600
Would you guys name and always that's yeah, you're thinking of always sunny,

352
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,540
but it might also be his name and Matilda. Now that I think about his name

353
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,480
is Matilda's dad in Matilda. What if that is the same universe? Whoa, why

354
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,100
would yeah, maybe if they have the same name, his name is Harry Wormwood,

355
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,160
Harry. Yeah, it's close. So it should be called Harry or maybe Wormwood.

356
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,920
Wormwood is good. What is good? And it's about a guy. He's got a guy just

357
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,280
trying to make a fucking living and then his daughter starts throwing

358
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,320
the electric books, Adam and shit through the fuck that and she emancipates

359
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,380
herself at the end of the movie exactly and I'd go what the fuck I don't want

360
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,620
this

361
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,220
yeah everybody wins at the end of that. That's what yeah Matilda at the end she

362
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,300
crossed her and she's like that's right. I won't let you spend any more money on

363
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,260
me and I won't let you feed me or clothe me or have a roof over my head anymore.

364
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,300
You're done yeah. I'm going to go live at the library. I can shut up go ahead.

365
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,680
I'm going to live with Miss Librarian. Yeah, that's right. You don't get to pay

366
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,400
for my education at this beautiful private school anymore. Yeah, I'm going

367
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
to go live with a damn teacher nerd. That's what I say. Okay, nerd

368
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,520
dork. I hope if I hope to God that I have a nerd kid who just leaves

369
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,540
instantly. Yeah,

370
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,980
that's why he was such a nerd that they learn how to emancipate themselves and

371
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,720
get the fuck out of that. So we're so we're all three of us are so anti

372
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,440
abortion that if we were in a position where we didn't want a kid, it's our

373
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,260
biggest hope is like well. I hope it's a really smart nerd who becomes a chess

374
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,540
prodigy. That's a flying machine and I never seen

375
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:08,100
goes James and the giant and I think I think I'm like sit down in my living

376
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,860
room. I think to myself like he's probably in China right now or something,

377
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,380
but no he fell into the ocean exactly, but you at least get to do this. Yeah,

378
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,940
I get to imagine him like the end of Dark Knight Rises. If my kid did some

379
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,860
James and the giant peach it, I would I would step up and be his dad, because

380
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,560
it looks fun as hell. Do you guys ever think about how fucking shit it would be

381
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,080
if you were a parent and what's the worst? Well, that, but also like what's

382
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,280
the worst case scenario for a parent is that you do, you have like a Casey

383
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,760
Anthony kind of situation. She was, well, she killed her kid. I know. Well,

384
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
that's up for debate. But what I'm saying is if like Casey Anthony, what if

385
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,560
your kid is just like weird and like not that bright and just crawls into

386
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,640
something bad and then goes missing and then all of a sudden you're on the news

387
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
because people think that you put your kid into somewhere. It's like the only

388
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,760
reason you're on the news is because you're because you're beautiful enough

389
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,280
that they want to keep the cameras on. She got a she got a BBL. I'll handle

390
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,800
this. You see that you guys see that case. I actually did see that. He got a

391
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,520
damn BBL. Yeah, that's insane. That is well. I mean, what are you going to do?

392
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,080
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?

393
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,120
No, what happened? Her BBL when it died? Yeah, I think it was more like

394
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,720
Oh yeah, it did. Bubbled. Yeah, this is not the kind of thing we want to talk

395
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
about. Probably not dying child. Yeah, I'm gone for one second to plug in the

396
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
laptop. You guys are doing an impression of a drowning child that actually

397
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,720
drowned. Well, we don't know. We don't know. It's a pretty good be in China.

398
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,520
Yeah, no, they found a bot. They found the bones. No, I think. Yeah, they

399
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,120
faked it. The baby faked it. They've I think that's what I'm talking about.

400
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm talking about you have a Matilda style kid who's really, really smart.

401
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,360
what's to keep them from not faking their death from getting a couple of dog

402
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,020
bones and shaving down the head exactly and then that you're pulling their teeth

403
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,300
on that and you're fucking,

404
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,700
you know, whittling down the dog skull. It looks kind of like them replacing

405
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:01,940
the

406
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,020
replacing bores or it's like yeah. This is inconclusive fucking long.

407
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,260
Yeah,

408
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,820
my child skull, they find that they find the skeleton. It's got a collar on, but

409
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,540
you replace the the tags. It's as you

410
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,540
you put it in the laundry yeah now I'm going to jail

411
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,200
put like a week on it yeah. Meanwhile, this kid is has found a civilization in

412
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,240
the center of the earth or something and well this king this kid moves the

413
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,260
fucking Taiwan. He's the next dali. You turn on the news like like forty years

414
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,580
later and he's the president of some with that. How much does that have to

415
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,280
suck to have your kit you you birth your kid and then like two years in you

416
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,320
never be like. I kind of think he's going to be the

417
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,420
sucks. Damn it, that would suck. I

418
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,660
would love to

419
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:59,740
to father the white Dalai Lama. Yeah, that would be maybe the well. Is that a

420
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,920
rule that the Dalai Lama has to be born in a spoken rule that it has to be

421
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,000
Taiwanese? I want maybe they spoke it or maybe it isn't a rule at all. Has

422
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,500
there been a white? Anyway, the point is I would love to be a father to the

423
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,900
great Dalai Lama. There will be especially when my birth to it when my

424
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,600
kid grows up and he's like the adult Dalai Lama is doing all the dollar and

425
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm just sitting. I'm sitting in my armchair at home. I'm watching to be

426
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,580
like that's my boy.

427
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,540
You're hoping for a shout out like he's a

428
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:32,300
and one more thing I'd like to thank my dad for showing me how to sit quietly

429
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,060
for a long

430
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,260
yeah. When he like I see him on the TV, he's asking another kid to suck his

431
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,720
song. I'm calling him like you can always come home. You know, yeah, no

432
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
matter what you do, we love you. I know you didn't do that.

433
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,460
You're

434
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,180
you have like the first white Dalai Lama and he's doing right guard extreme

435
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:52,900
commercials.

436
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,040
He's like he's like yeah, I'm in a roller derby thing. It's like look. I

437
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,300
do sit around all day pretty quiet, but that doesn't mean I don't sweat a

438
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,520
fuck ton. I made

439
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,240
be rink he'd be like yeah, he'd be like he'd be on the TV and a commercial be

440
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,460
like

441
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,360
yeah, I don't I may be the dog a long, but I don't like these busted as robes.

442
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,760
That's what we're adidas yeah

443
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,560
or he would come out with a line of his own adidas roads. Oh my God, he comes

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,040
out with like

445
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,720
is the ropes with the

446
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,500
stripes, the stripes all the way up to be so hard. I'll be so hard. Then

447
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,760
they're kind of like he has a ration. He has Bart beads, yeah, art beads yeah.

448
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,980
what he was a part of. He understood. Oh, I get it now. I don't understand even a

449
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,080
little bit. I don't know shit about the Dalai Lama. I know he's bald as fuck and

450
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,440
wears tiny glasses. My Dalai Lama son would not be bald. He would have long

451
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
ass hair. Take your hat off. Oh my God.

452
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Oh my, I never even considered. Holy crap. That the white Dalai Lama might be

453
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,440
here right now.

454
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,040
who knows he might be amongst us.

455
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Whoa, that's kind of do I look exactly like the Dalai Lama? Can we get like a

456
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
robe?

457
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,200
At what point is this not good?

458
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,760
Wait a minute, that's nasty. Here's a dirty shirt, a dirty shirt, so you wrap

459
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,400
it around. Yeah, I need the back side of it.

460
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,840
Oh, my God,

461
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,320
I kind of I dig the logo on your. I kind of feel like this is a bad

462
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,660
got him offensive Gandhi costume. What do you mean or something? No, you're the

463
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,800
white Dalai Lama. I don't know. I don't feel good about this. You guys made me do

464
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,840
this. I didn't know it was pet. Pat made me do this. He handed me so many things.

465
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,400
You look no, no, no, no, no, because he have a gong. They're

466
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,760
coming.

467
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:53,000
They're replacing him soon because of him, like sucking on little kids. I think

468
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,280
the only way they replace him is if he has to die and they already have chosen

469
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,020
the next one, by the way. Really? They already chose him? He's like nine years

470
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,460
old, yeah.

471
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,060
Really? Are you lying? No, no, no. There goes my dreams of coaching you. The guy,

472
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,500
the current Dalai Lama goes and finds the other Dalai Lama and says, "You're

473
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,940
me." You're, okay. "You're me, so you'll become him." Yeah, but what if he does

474
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,060
like a trade up now that he's seen you in your robe and your little glasses?

475
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,540
He's like, "Oh, I was mistaken." I don't think that, I think that the Dalai

476
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,500
Lama, you know how people always say that? You don't think he listens? You

477
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,700
don't think he watches every week? I just don't think he has that much money,

478
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,140
so I don't really want to become him. I want to be the first on a llama.

479
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,540
We think he's a broke hoe. I want to become the host of at midnight. I want

480
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,900
to be a a community. That's what I'm saying, though. You can just be the

481
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,840
Dalai Lama and do that stuff. Yeah. In fact, you're more likely to get on TV

482
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,860
shows. If you're that, that's your that's kind of they say we're looking

483
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,420
for people who can bring a unique perspective and bring a kind of story

484
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,900
that Dalai Lama story that that is that people can relate. Yeah. How about a

485
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,660
cartoon about being a Dalai Lama? Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's a good idea.

486
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,200
that it's a really good car to about being the now that he's like on the

487
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,400
kid's tongue. It's

488
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,600
punching up to make a TV show like the one they made about the British Royal

489
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,240
family. If you make one, I think he was always weird. People mostly just didn't

490
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,100
like him because he did, but that's I think that's the that's the

491
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:13,500
people didn't like it. I know the people didn't like him because of some stuff

492
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,980
like some like you know stuff about like warring countries or whatever like

493
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,660
of the country want to be free. Which I do not care about that at all. I don't even know

494
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,600
what those countries are called. I only know countries based on if their food is different.

495
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,840
That's the only thing that I know. If they have different barbecue, Turkish barbecue,

496
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,600
British barbecue, Korean barbecue. Korean barbecue is my number one. That's why I think

497
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,400
that's the greatest country in the world. American barbecue as well. I think it's probably

498
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,080
Korean and then American and then there's a bunch of other countries. No, shut the fuck

499
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,080
countries, then there's a bunch of other countries. Oh, no. Okay. So you think

500
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Korean barbecue is number one. Meanwhile, guess what they do in America? They cook

501
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,920
the food for you.

502
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, you know what? Good point. In Korea, you have to do it yourself. I think

503
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,760
Korean barbecue is number two. And you have to use scissors. Yeah. Fuck that. I

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,600
forgot, 'cause I-, the only time that I eat Korean barbecue is when it's-, you

505
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,680
know, it's-, it's 'cause it comes from North Korea. They can't afford a kitchen.

506
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,160
Exactly. They don't let-, they don't, yeah. You have to-, yeah, you have to do

507
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,360
it yourself. The only time I eat Korean barbecue is when it's, like, a new

508
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,860
limited time a thing at McDonald's limited time edition thing limited

509
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,100
edition meal at McDonald's yeah McDonald's Korean barbecue that's what

510
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,240
you're going with right now yeah I think the last time I had Korean barbecue

511
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:30,120
with that one think we all got Korean barbecue together in Boston yeah that

512
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,120
was maybe the last time I got it that was ages oh my god yeah we took pictures

513
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,840
of the red napkin I don't remember that we got a lot of oil on the napkin cuz he

514
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,440
he was wiping his face a lot. I took a lot of pictures.

515
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,560
Why do you remember a detail like that? That's crazy.

516
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,840
'Cause you have hair in the photo. You just scared me. What? You guys know I

517
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,280
remember shit like that? That is such a crazy detail to remember.

518
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,960
We thought it was really funny that we were taking pictures of us holding up

519
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,320
our napkins like it was like a trophy. Like we were like, "Clean Plate Club,"

520
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,000
we're holding up the napkins like and this was it. I don't remember years ago.

521
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah, yeah, that is I'm a photo. You are weird. How am I weird for remembering

522
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,600
good times? That's true that we had. I guess that's right. Yeah, the way you

523
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
know, honestly, the thing that you crossed the line into being weird is

524
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,120
that you said, because he was wiping his face a lot. Yeah, that was the thing.

525
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,260
You should yeah, yeah, definitely you can remember the photo. We can't

526
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,040
remember the exact like the reason why the photo exists.

527
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,320
why was that? Why is my face? Yeah, also I don't think you guys said that that's

528
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,640
just a thought you had to then was like Caleb's wiping his face a lot and you

529
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,420
still remember that. I don't know why I remember it, but yeah, you know what I

530
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,500
want us to have guys. We haven't made a memory in a long time. We haven't. I

531
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,220
want to go. What are you talking about? We I guess you guys don't think about

532
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,140
our friendship the way that I think about it. You think about it pretty much

533
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,660
every week. What's our last memory? What's our last three of us crazy

534
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:05,460
experience? I feel like we've had a lot of we've had a lot of duos duos

535
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,660
memories coffin club for sure.

536
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,060
Uh-huh.

537
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,360
So but that was like a year ago.

538
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,660
That was months and months and months ago.

539
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah, that's true.

540
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,760
I mean that was way to go.

541
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,860
We need to go to a sports game and get on the field.

542
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,960
I think we should go to a lake.

543
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,460
I think you're right on a pontoon boat.

544
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,560
Oh, we did and get we could go on a canal.

545
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Happy dad seltzer.

546
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,060
Yep from the Nelk boys the Halloween show.

547
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,160
That's that was a big that's a show.

548
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,860
That's just a show.

549
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,760
That's not a memory.

550
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,960
Yeah, pure fun excursion a field trip.

551
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,920
I know what I used to last. You know what I do. I guess the last field

552
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,760
I feel exactly a field trip is what we need. Yeah, as I was

553
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,960
thinking about, I'm thinking about the League of Legends thing. That's the

554
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,800
type of thing that we need to all exactly. That's what I'm saying.

555
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,440
There's I feel like there's been too many

556
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,160
experiences that we only two of us have had. Yeah, yeah, it's like

557
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,480
usually I'm thinking about it. I was like we did it one last weekend.

558
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,960
Just me and Cameron with that drunk. We had a beautiful dance to

559
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,080
get there. I and we talk about that already. Our new best friend.

560
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,280
Yeah, you guys did that. No, we talked about it in the meeting. Okay. I the

561
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,080
thing is and I don't want you guys to think that I'm coming after you talk

562
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,080
about it because it was just he's going to use about the eyes. I am. I know

563
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,880
that we need to have three because we do too, but it's usually just you two and I

564
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,180
get completely excluded and I'm not. I don't care about who was at the League

565
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,480
of Legends thing. Married life. How long ago was that? I don't even know.

566
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,580
That's what's happening. You guys did something last weekend. Very invited to

567
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,980
that thing and didn't come. I don't I don't you know I don't check my mailbox.

568
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,440
Who was I don't know if I get invitations. Well last week, last weekend we went to a

569
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,780
bar that had a jukebox and Cameron gave me a dollar because he knew my last

570
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:48,100
dollar. He knew that I saw the jukebox and I got really excited. This already sounds like

571
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,820
movie level story that I wish that I could have been a part of. You were

572
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,980
we're completely invited. We played shows, not the dinosaur junior version of

573
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:03,820
just like heaven and the drunkest man in the world. They like it with us and

574
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,640
kept hugging me and Cameron and then was getting mad. I love you. I love you to

575
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,580
us and was getting mad. I know what he was doing as he was right. He was

576
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,780
saying I'm in love with you, which is the line in the song, but he was just

577
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,060
saying it all. He was said the only line song that he knew

578
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,980
I'm in love with you.

579
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,540
I'm in love with you.

580
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:29,940
And then the Dinosaur Junior version cuts, you know, it goes like the last

581
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,180
bar.

582
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,740
Yeah, no, I don't know this. Okay, that's why this, that wouldn't work for

583
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
me. If you guys, if we went in and... It cuts off and then the guy,

584
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,220
it's switching songs to the next song, but it's taking a while 'cause it's

585
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,740
a CD jukebox and the guy's standing there going,

586
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,620
"What the fuck?" Turn the music back on, what the fuck? He's screaming at

587
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,680
thought that they cut the song, maybe because we were having too much fun.

588
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,080
Yeah, and then he flipped Cameron off and ran outside and then he came back in

589
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,020
and then he went out again. That's my problem, man. I'm going to a place like

590
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,980
that. You guys are playing songs that everybody knows and I'm trying to get

591
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,340
them to play Worldwide Choppers by Tech Nine and I'm wrapping it to the

592
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,220
bartender. Somebody played Blue Suede by Vince Staples immediately after. See,

593
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,580
that's what I would have had probably that moment with that guy. Yeah, yeah, I

594
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,580
would have been a walked up blue sway, blue sway, the blue flight. No, I would

595
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,360
we've probably done out of the throw back rap or

596
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,300
Caleb would have been walking around waiting for somebody to sing with

597
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,580
them. Just blue swine, blue swine, blue swine. Here's who I am at the

598
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,100
jukebox. We should go to a sports game or a lake or a museum. I

599
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,180
don't think a museum... We should go to a museum and play pranks on

600
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,080
everybody. I think we need to go right back to Coffin Club in Corpse

601
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,900
Paint again. And here's what we need to do. We need to all go to

602
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,900
the jukebox and cue up that one Dr. Dre song and then say, "Smoke

603
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,360
weed every day at the wrong part of the song, all in unison. And I'd be like,

604
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
"Oh, smoke weed every day. We need to do that." That is so cool to do that.

605
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,360
Yeah.

606
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,080
See, that's why I love touch tunes so much. You know what my favorite

607
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,000
public prank at a place is? What? My little prank that makes me laugh every

608
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,280
time that's so dumb is I go to... What if I go to a place and it's

609
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,160
crowded, like a store or something, just really loudly saying to whoever I'm

610
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,280
with being like, "Yeah, it's so sad that this place is closing down.

611
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,920
guy. I'm just glad we got to come here before it closes

612
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,800
for people to over

613
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
that it like F A O short

614
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,700
random

615
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,340
it really gets me. Every mom and pop stores with only one employee.

616
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,920
It's so sad they're demolishing this play

617
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,040
man, just because I know it doesn't nobody. It doesn't mean anything to

618
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,360
anybody. It's not tricking anybody. It just it's so sad. What I'm going to do

619
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,080
here next week

620
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
(laughter)

621
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
That's so sad.

622
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
It's so sad what I have in this backpack.

623
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
(laughter)

624
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
It's so, so sad.

625
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,920
Oh, man. I don't want to put it in the bathroom. I don't want to put this backpack in the bathroom

626
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
in my home.

627
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
But I have to.

628
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
But I have to.

629
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
I have to do it. The voice is telling me to.

630
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,120
Yep. Sorry. I hope that we get another son of Sam soon in New York City.

631
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,080
Yeah. Oh, we will.

632
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Sam Kinison, I hope.

633
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
The son of Sam Kinison.

634
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
(laughter)

635
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
That's actually a pretty good idea. I like that idea.

636
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
That is a good idea.

637
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,280
That's actually a pretty good idea.

638
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,780
Yeah.

639
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
And I like that idea.

640
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,280
That's a good idea.

641
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,280
He's walking around, he's doing new, updated for the times, kind of woke kind of stuff.

642
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Sam K-

643
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
My partner!

644
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
Ahhhh!

645
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,280
No, if Sam Kinesson was here, he would be the opposite of woke.

646
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Dude, he would be demolishing all these blue haired fuckers.

647
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,280
He would be out there with his fingerless gloves and his long hair and his shapely body.

648
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Uh huh.

649
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
He looked like the onion from-

650
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Actually, he would be woke.

651
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,660
Yeah, I just realized he looked like the onion from VeggieTales if you look yeah, he looks like a piece of garlic. Yeah

652
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,920
Elephant garlic. Yeah, really really big. Have you ever seen his SNL intro?

653
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,200
Did it sound like

654
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Now Sam can I say no?

655
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,220
No, so he walks out and then like motions for the the band like the guitar player in the band to give him his guitar

656
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,420
Oh

657
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,920
Soloing he was so wow too cool to live

658
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,880
He's soloed and then does his like, he does just his stand up as the monologue and then

659
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,960
like, you know, then the episode starts.

660
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,160
One day when I host SNL, I'll probably do something like that.

661
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,840
Rick Moranis got his ass though.

662
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,200
The Rick Moranis thing is very funny.

663
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
What was the Rick Moranis thing?

664
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,480
Rick Moranis goes up, starts playing the guitar, then starts blowing into the guy's saxophone.

665
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,760
And he like goes and he starts operating the camera, he's got the camera on and then he

666
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,480
like, yeah, he just goes through the entire thing and does everybody's.

667
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Dude, Rick Moranis.

668
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
That guy is very funny.

669
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,360
wife got his jaw slid. That's why he got his jaw slid. Because he's always in other people's

670
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,040
business. Well, because the cameraman, he held on to it all those years. It was either

671
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,560
the cameraman or the biggest Sam Kinnison fan in the world walked up to Rick Moranis

672
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,080
and was like, "Here's for old, here's for Sammy, bitch," and then knocked him out. He's

673
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,120
like, "You don't make fun of Sam Kinnison." I would love to say that to somebody. I would

674
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,520
love to say that to somebody. I would love to say that to somebody. Sam Kinnison death

675
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,880
story where he got his head decapitated in a car accident that flew 40,000 feet down

676
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,380
on the road and it slid until it was just like basically a little piece of hair

677
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,140
and then his brother was like holding the piece of hair and was like that's

678
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:08,980
not real. Yeah,

679
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,060
the piece of hair, I was a little ration for a mortal and then the hair moved

680
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,800
like this and said, Oh, my God, the light I'm going into the light. You know

681
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,880
that that's right. I heard that

682
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,960
or maybe the details aren't right, but basically he told his brother that he

683
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,600
was he saw some kind of light. Yeah, yeah, which gave me hope as a child.

684
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,480
Yeah,

685
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,600
that was the and you realize there and then you realize they're shunning a

686
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,280
the flashlight into his eyes to check if his head head, head, body, head is

687
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,880
concussed

688
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:43,820
you think that's what it is when people say they see the light. It's because

689
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,040
they see the light on the ceiling in the hospital or just realize that it's

690
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,420
making me scared. I think it is that or they get checked for a D U I yeah when

691
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,380
they're dying, because that's the first thing they should do is what do we send

692
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,240
out to see? Do we say that they were drunk while they were driving? I would

693
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,720
like to start driving driving Sam Kinson. I think that he was drugly driving on

694
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,520
cocaine and I thought he was in the back of a limo because of the auto the

695
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
on now he's in limbo yeah, the unlicensed autobiography can't decide

696
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,920
what to do and that's the only time he could ever do limbo by the way, yeah, is

697
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,240
if he was if he had no head yeah a lot easier. He was just a piece of hair

698
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,840
that's because that's what happened his head flew and as it went, I know I'm

699
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,200
visualizing the mortal con there literally is a mortal combat fatality and

700
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,120
and it was just one single hair out the very top of his hair. The peak of his

701
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,400
head

702
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,800
was just sitting there on a little piece of dandruff. Yeah, that was all that was

703
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,960
left of Sam Kennison and then that you know what they did a bio pic about him

704
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,640
that and he wanted to be alive. They said that he wanted he had to be buried

705
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,840
open open casket. So they basically sat that little hair in a cashew or a

706
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,080
pistachio shell. No, no, no, no, no, he had already bought the coffin because he

707
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,680
knew this was coming. So he bought a coffin for his four hundred pound body

708
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,200
and there's just a single piece of hair with a piece of dandruff sitting in

709
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,620
there and women are coming up beautiful women dress like goth goth moms that

710
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,720
have the veil over their head and they look like they're in a music video and

711
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,000
they're crying Miss murder hair, yeah, this murder, and then a really old guy

712
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,640
came up. I looked in the coffin and he went

713
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:19,840
to yeah and he covered him and snot well. No, it blew it away. I didn't blow

714
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,880
and nobody can find it and then another guy came up and he sneezed even harder

715
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,980
and nobody find. I think that was a me little kid me and refer. Do you think

716
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,960
that was a damn rack of cocaine? I heard it was a brain cell and he was alive all

717
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,260
the way until he got buried, but then little kid me. I was at the funeral in

718
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,160
nineteen eighty nine and after the old man sneezed, they served hors d'oeuvres

719
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,580
they don't know, and so I'm eating my mini burrito right and I take a bite.

720
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,720
Oh, my God, what the hell is a hair? It's called a to keto. What the hell is

721
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,840
moving around my body? Oh, my God, it's climbing into my stomach. It's going up

722
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,120
my spine and I'm gonna crash when I get old. I basically became the Dalai Lama

723
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,360
style Sam. I thought that's why you were bald, because it rejected that hair and

724
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,760
it all the hair shot out of your head. I didn't want any hair in your body

725
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,200
anymore.

726
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,440
How does that make any sense? He's got one really long blonde pube. That same

727
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,720
can't even have pubes.

728
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:19,880
wouldn't that be cool if you just didn't have any pubic at all? Yeah, I mean you

729
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,100
can get a laser. I'm starting to get so old. How old are you? My pubes have

730
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,680
started leaving my pubic area. They've started going down my legs like I'm,

731
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,160
like I'm dropping them. I've had that problem my whole life. I mean this whole,

732
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,240
I just started getting that. You've seen, I mean you guys have seen my legs and

733
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,440
shorts, you know, my legs are really... I don't tend to look at your legs and

734
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,640
records. Hey buddy, you should look without a barf bag because it looks

735
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,180
like without my x ray glasses

736
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,780
and you're looking at my penis or my extra regular

737
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,380
size. The extra can you on you? If I worked at a massage parlor, yes, I

738
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,020
would walk. I always saw you walking down the street. I would literally

739
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,580
lure you in and I would comb your entire body with a lice comb just to make it

740
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,540
you're really smooth. You know the really thin comb. I want to wax your

741
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,600
entire self until you look do if I if I know I want them to look like that would

742
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,900
be the most painful. I want to know that you know the that Air BnB commercial

743
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,140
where they have the monsters that have the hair. No, I you'd look like that.

744
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,120
Some people might have seen this commercial dude loves Air BnB so much.

745
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,860
This guy can't get a watcher fucking enough of Air BnB. Hell watches TV like

746
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,760
it comes on and on to be yes. Oh yeah, that's TV

747
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,700
to be. No everything's hunky dory with your hair, but I would like to rip it

748
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,240
off, which if anyone works for to be who's listening here, hit me up hit up

749
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,060
Cameron for a movie idea, hit me up for giving me everything.

750
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,020
If anybody works for to be hit me up for giving me everything I've ever

751
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,540

you work it to be, I'm going to yield my message that you send me and give

754
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,760
another one to Cameron. If you were to send messages to people to be they do

755
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,060
coded messages, then they send somebody like a big I've seen some I've they've

757
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,600
you're listening,

758
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:24,200
here's my idea to be inner tube for the summer that you guys would not believe

759
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,100
this stuff. It's a thousand times better than an inner tube. Here's what I want

760
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:46,520
to

761
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
I'm employed right now.

762
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Look at my hands.

763
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
I don't know that I would even say perennially.

764
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
I would say year-round maybe.

765
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Look at my hands.

766
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Look at how-

767
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Alert.

768
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Alert.

769
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,520
Alert.

770
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,680
Podcast about list is about to issue a correction.

771
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Cameron here.

772
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,760
It really hurts me to have to do this, but I need to issue a correction for today's episode

773
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
and I need to apologize to Caleb.

774
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,000
I made a mistake when I corrected him about the word perennial.

775
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,520
I was thinking about a flower blooming and unblooming and it led me to make a mistake

776
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,960
and perennial actually does mean the thing that he said that it meant.

777
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,560
And in the heat of the moment, I corrected him falsely, and I feel really bad about it.

778
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,800
So please, Caleb, accept my apology, and please, listeners,

779
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,560
accept my apology as well for providing false information.

780
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,760
What's up, guys? It's Caleb from Podcasts About Lists,

781
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,400
just checking in to say I accept the apology.

782
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:51,520
I'm a hard worker. Wow. There's scabs. Yeah, that's a stigmata right there. I'm lifting

783
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,480
stuff all day. I get scabs on my hands. I have those. I have. Oh my God, why are my

784
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:02,520
hands yellow? Simpson cigarettes. Yeah, that's probably cigarettes. You don't that's bologna.

785
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,000
I haven't smoked in. You don't smoke. I saw somebody smoking a cigarette with one glove

786
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,100
stuff to hold the cigarette. You know, he used to do that. You know, he used to do

787
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,480
that was

788
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,260
yeah,

789
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,840
well, she had both gloves. Well,

790
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,360
what's that guy's name? Peter? I wear a glove on one hand to smoke a cigarette,

791
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,600
and then I like love on the other hand, it's because I handle a lot of asphalt.

792
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,280
Peter Cushing had a little white smoking glove that he would wear on the set of

793
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,840
Star Wars. That's sick, yeah, that's so cool to be like that guy who like looks

794
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:36,800
perpetually like a I play. I played smoking glow Dracula in a movie. Yeah, I

795
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,480
do a Christian bale type thing where I would be transforming for the role, but

796
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,980
I would get actual fangs in my head and I would never get rid of them ever. Do

797
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,200
you ever think white you get like I would get white whites as well. The

798
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,340
whites of your eyes like and I'll get my skin whitened because I don't think I'm

799
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,920
pale enough to sell Dracula. I think that I don't think people would believe that

800
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,640
I was directly. I think that you are beyond the pale. No, I don't think I'm

801
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,720
he's pale enough to play. Hey, hey, ease up on that. Don't you dare say he's

802
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,380
beyond the pale. Sorry. Not bad. Don't you dare. That is our friend. You're

803
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,100
before the pale. Thank you.

804
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,660
I'm gonna get very pale to play Dracula. That implies that there's something

805
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,140
that's gonna happen. I think that you could play Dracula. Honestly, I think we

806
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,980
should... Not without my fangs and with... Not without my skin being paler.

807
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,860
I have... Oh, no shit will do... Oh, I lost my fangs. No shit will do stuff

808
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,940
to you, to make you... No shit will do stuff to me? Will make you look like

809
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:35,380
Dracula. Oh, no shit will do stuff. I think that we will we will make a

810
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,600
Dracula movie. Yeah, I need you need a black widow's peak. I have a black hair

811
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,980
peak.

812
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:44,940
You are the furthest thing from Dracula. You are Dracula's number one food item.

813
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,180
You are literally the value meal that Dracula would eat every single day. I

814
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,180
have a Dracula. I have a full Dracula costume. No, but you just don't look like

815
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,220
him. You have a beard. You're too. You're too. Just

816
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,680
you too stocky to be dry stocky yeah. You know what I always think about here's

817
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,700
something I was thinking about

818
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,580
what stocky stocky your big boned

819
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,940
that's the what that's that's true. I didn't say you're too portly.

820
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,220
I would never say that

821
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,860
you're too stocky to play dracula. You have to your shoulders are too broad.

822
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,900
Okay, you're too masculine to play dracula. I guess there we go that worked.

823
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,180
what about wolf man? I could play a will. You could play a no man. I could be

824
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,660
you're not sure man last night. I do I could you I take my shirt off. I look

825
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,780
like damn wolf man and I could be the human baby.

826
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,460
You'll be good bride of Frankenstein. Yeah, you get the big you'd be good

827
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,740
baby new year, baby. New Year does not have the definition that I have on my

828
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,900
core. I mean you could be like baby new year on a pride float. I could

829
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,460
Okay, so you mean you're thinking then magic Mike that I could be mad, you

830
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,340
know, you know what also you could do really well. You could play a really

831
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,900
good phantom of the blink fitness.

832
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,780
I don't go to

833
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,420
that's well you that's a movie. You don't actually have to go there. It's a

834
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,620
J. Well, you basically would be a fucking phantom of the mean

835
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,780
there's some club for rude people.

836
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:34,260
Oh, it's okay. Hey, buddy, what turn back around? I'm

837
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,420
fish tank. I'm going to miss all this. You know,

838
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,940
I'm going to type on this and it's going to be said, you remember this thing?

839
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,460
What

840
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,820
from before? I remember that. I remember that.

841
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,500
Broken.

842
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,100
Let's see the lights in these died a long time ago, but I just never fixed it.

843
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,100
We were going to put something into there.

844
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,100
Never did that.

845
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm going to miss this guy.

846
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,100
We're killing him.

847
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,100
We're not able to take him.

848
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,100
He's just in this.

849
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
The plasma ball is completely destroyed.

850
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
We need to get a new one.

851
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
Look, it still works.

852
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Look how bad it looks now.

853
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,100
It's because it's been on all day.

854
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,100
It looks really sad.

855
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,100
I'm just going to miss this whole place.

856
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,100
You know what? This set was a great big experiment.

857
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:29,820
big experiment. Yep. And now the next one is going to be a circus. Yep. Oh, a

858
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,500
circus, a clown circus. I think that's a really good idea. Yeah. I'm still

859
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,700
thinking about what kind of thing to do. Yeah, I'm still thinking, I'm thinking

860
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,820
circus or maybe... I've been kind of lobbying for Wild West. Yeah, Wild West

861
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,340
would be fun. Yeah. I think I'm gonna rewatch Westworld. Guys, I have the

862
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:54,880
perfect idea what what if it's just like a dope hangout place? Oh, that a tree

863
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,080
house, a Nintendo sixty four, I think a basement tree house, a basement of a

864
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,980
tree house with nerd shit all over the place. Yeah post does yes and a flat a

865
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:10,500
flat screen TV that plays halo plays red versus blue clip. Wait post us and

866
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,380
video game cartridges, dope ass aesthetic that we are custom with faces on them

867
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,740
with a turntable and frame Pokemon cards

868
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:24,060
and records. Oh my God framed of every trading card ever and framed of every

869
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,860
Chris Nolan movie in a line. My God, except for this Oppenheimer one,

870
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,540
because it's to

871
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:34,720
yeah to SJW and also to new. They don't make it on DVD and even then they

872
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,500
probably make it on day one when they buy that when they make that on DVD. I'm

873
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,060
buying ten. Is that as I know that price is going to go up? Is that movie black

874
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:48,660
black and white? I think so. I'm pretty excited for it. I want to see colors though. I bet

875
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:54,500
the explosions will go into color. Sin City style, the explosion is full color. Better

876
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:00,180
Call Saul style. It'll be Wizard of Oz. I just finished it. And the complete spoiler

877
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:08,820
is that Better Call Saul, the final episode was long. An hour and nine minutes. I tried

878
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,220
to trick Cameron into thinking that he had a kid.

879
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,220
You completely tricked me.

880
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,220
And it didn't work.

881
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,220
It didn't work.

882
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,220
Did it?

883
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,220
I believed it.

884
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,220
You did?

885
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,220
No, I did not believe it.

886
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,220
Why would I believe he has a kid?

887
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,220
What does that mean?

888
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:21,220
I don't know.

889
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,220
I thought maybe you would believe that him and kids get away.

890
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,220
Do you know what's funny?

891
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,580
The one time that I made up a fake, I made a joke fake spoiler, when Patrick said he

892
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,660
didn't watch the episode of Succession yet, the one where Logan dies, that's out again,

893
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,660
we're going to spoil that again.

894
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,500
I texted him and I said, "Guess what, spoiler, the dragon dies."

895
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,380
but it was before I was watching the episodes before Logan died in the

896
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,820
episode. So that isn't that kind of prophetic a little bit. So we've been

897
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:48,700
having prophetic attacks to our to our bodies. Yeah, something I've been having

898
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,020
something, a tax allergies. My allergies have been so fucked. Today was the first

899
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,740
day of allergies from really this past like a week or two has been like you

900
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,100
saw. You saw me on Monday, right? I was I was a shell of myself. I think it's

901
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,380
because I haven't been smoking. I think that smoking protected me from allergies.

902
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,880
Uh-huh.

903
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,380
And now that I'm not smoking, I've just been being attacked.

904
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,880
Mm-hmm.

905
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,380
Yeah.

906
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,880
I did a set on Monday where I was asleep the whole time.

907
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,880
No, you just bombed.

908
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,380
I bombed because I was asleep.

909
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,880
You were wide awake, you just didn't do very well.

910
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,880
I was like this.

911
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,380
No, you were awake.

912
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,880
I was half awake.

913
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,380
I don't think so.

914
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,880
It was my allergies and I took Benadryls.

915
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
I think that you just...

916
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,880
[whistles]

917
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,380
You know?

918
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,980
know just bombed. Well, it happens. Yeah, and I'm blaming the allergy. Okay. Yeah. No, that's

919
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,820
fine. But you have to say you were asleep. I was pretty much asleep. No, you were wide

920
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,420
awake. Yeah, I talked to you before and after you seemed alert. Well, it was my Benadryls

921
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,460
that did that. I believe that I believe it. It threw me off. Yeah, it threw well. No,

922
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,020
No, it's pretty now. I think about it's kind of just like pretty normal. Yeah

923
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,460
Damn

924
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,500
No, it was okay

925
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:09,900
Yeah, I was I remember getting home that night and just falling asleep immediately after you cried for a while

926
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,160
Yeah, yeah, I went to the doctor because my allergies are really bad

927
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,700
I thought it gave me a sinus infection because my head was hurting

928
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,480
And I went to the doctor and they had looked in all my holes and on my head just the head holes

929
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,820
and you better and they said and what the doctor said she said yeah, it looks

930
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,840
like what you have is a combination of two things.

931
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:32,540
Damn allergies and brain tumor, allergies and something else. I just

932
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:35,440
said something I said you probably I think it looks like you have allergies

933
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,200
and then something it's probably just two things. What

934
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,700
you need to go to a different doctor yeah, it's an urgent care. I didn't

935
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:47,760
want to make an appointment with a doctor take way too long. I did I hate

936
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,780
and they made me wait for thirty minutes in the in the room, not in the waiting

937
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,160
room in the actual like exam.

938
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,320
Yeah and there's okay. I know I know it's it's it's hack and anointing to

939
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,140
like okay. You have to tell the the nurse and then you also have to tell the

940
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,700
doctor, but the thing that was making me left this time is it first of all I

941
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,000
told the nurse and then another doctor came in later and I told that doctor

942
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,400
and then that doctor left and a third person came in that I did tell it, but

943
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,900
when I you're a sketch, the doctor came in the thing is making love with the

944
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,060
thing. The doctor came said when she came in she was like so I heard you're

945
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:16,860
not feeling well,

946
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,440
because if you like it, like yeah, there's a guy in there is not feel and

947
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,740
also just the idea that a doctor walking. So the nurse says you're one

948
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,860
hundred percent you're good to go. Yeah, no ring. I heard you're not feeling

949
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,780
what like clearly just not like forgot that I was in the room and then had to

950
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,820
go in really fast.

951
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,040
I heard you're not. I heard you're not. I think that's a hard job being a

952
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,100
doctor. No, I think it's pretty easy. I know being a doctor is what I will say.

953
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,480
I go of the road job in my experience. It is very easy to be a lead doctor

954
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,920
which is what they call the top doctor at the doctor facility. But if you're any

955
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,280
doctor who works under a lead doctor, I'm a lead doctor. So if you're the people

956
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:58,920
who work under me, you treat them badly. Yeah, because I have to because that's

957
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,640
how they live. My life gets easier. A lot of doctoral business is, you know,

958
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,680
like telling like your inmates and like your

959
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,840
like staff of joke. We say victims. Yeah, victims

960
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
walking around the doctor's office.

961
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,960
That's a kind of a backstage, if you will, joke for the doctors.

962
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
I don't say that to the people's faces.

963
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,960
That's the aristocrats for doctors.

964
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,960
Just saying, calling them victims.

965
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,960
No, come on. Everybody loves the aristocrats, even the doctors.

966
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,960
My doctor came in and said, "The aristocrats for me?"

967
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Yeah, real quickly, I've got to test this on you.

968
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,960
So this is family.

969
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
I start laughing my head off, cure my cancer.

970
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,960
Like that, laughter, best medicine.

971
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
That's a pretty good idea.

972
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,460
you know, be crazy is a TV or a stand up show called the best medicine.

973
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:52,660
I feel like that probably exists. No, no, no, there's no way that exists and

974
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,460
it's hosted by a guy like this. This is good. Yeah, the best medicine and what

975
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,660
are some of the names we would see on there? They're all doctors. Dr. Ken

976
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:05,660
John. It's an all. Yeah, Dr. Ken John, Dr. Eddie. Oh, the guy who in better

977
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,260
call Saul plays the vet. Maybe he could become a real life. Veteran. Oh,

978
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,520
Joe de Rosa yeah Dave

979
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,560
Filoni, no Dave Foley Dave Foley from MTV. Yeah

980
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:21,200
who else is doctor doctor house yeah,

981
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,860
patch Adams patch Adams. That's not going to work all doctor all doctor

982
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,480
comedy show

983
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:32,680
for it's a good idea. There's four doctors called best medicine. Yeah,

984
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,320
it's for doctors, because like you know how they have

985
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,300
You know how they have those stand up shows where it's like by veterans for

986
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,940
veterans and then it's like, no, you never heard of those. No. Oh,

987
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,700
they have like a, like there's like a vet or like a,

988
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,540
a veterans comedy thing where it's a former army members who were like,

989
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:56,300
and now I'm in stand up. Now I'm doing stand. Are you talking about, uh, we,

990
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,260
by the way, we should do a USO tour. Yeah, we need to go to,

991
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,260
pretty good idea to go to Iraq and we need to perform in, in,

992
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,820
in camouflage. Wow, that is really a great idea. Just like John Stewart,

993
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:12,340
exciting idea, just like Louie in the episode with the duckling. Yep, that's

994
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,260
a great idea. That is a really good idea. That's enticing. We should bring

995
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,500
Jubio with us and sell him to the Taliban. Yeah,

996
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:26,300
'cause look, he looks tall, Jubio, and he could save. Yeah,

997
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:37,520
he looks tall and he is like, you know, good bait for like them to like dress up

998
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,260
like them and then put him out. So then, like they're like, is there a sniper

999
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:46,140
outside? Just send you be out there. He's like what, like six seven. He's a

1000
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,360
monster. He's not that tall.

1001
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,660
I don't know. No, no, I think we were going to say that he looks middle

1002
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,080
eastern and he went for tall. He doesn't look middle eastern. No, I mean, why

1003
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,900
maybe yeah, maybe it looks like me or you, Jubio does not look Middle

1004
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:07,860
Eastern at all. You don't think so. I do you do you do yeah, show yourself. He

1005
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,900
could be Persian get get

1006
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,420
he could definitely be. He could be from anywhere. He's got a boy.

1007
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:24,140
That's why I like him. Yeah, this is the this is the person we're setting the

1008
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,720
an Alabama yeah we're sending this is

1009
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:34,420
put this on put this picture up right now. This is a Patrick with a gaff tape

1010
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,500
haircut to we did this and we said he looked like Drake,

1011
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,340
which we thought was pretty cool. I forgot about that is really clean. You

1012
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:45,940
look really

1013
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,340
amazing

1014
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,060
one bookmark

1015
00:57:52,700 --> 00:58:00,140
Patrick. Yeah, that's so stupid. I think it's cool. I think I

1016
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:05,900
buddy ears to even line up. They never do. I think that it

1017
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,100
might be a good idea for me to start getting into actual wigs.

1018
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,820
Yeah, I think that I could just have a lot of different

1019
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,980
identities. Grow your hair back out. I think that I might actually

1020
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,220
I have to get a new license. I think I might actually wear a

1021
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,060
wig. Yeah, because they can't tell you to take it off. You

1022
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:26,520
know you kind of maybe can they don't not if they don't know that's true. You

1023
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,720
could tell them you have cancer.

1024
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:33,120
Cancer. I have cancer. I have cancer. Oh yeah.

1025
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:42,360
Walking in walking in and he's in like a like a hospital gown and he's wiping

1026
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,480
his tears with a nap. If you're going to get your new driver's license photo,

1027
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,780
they can't tell you to stop crying because you'll just cry harder if

1028
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,660
someone says that to you. Yeah, what if you imagine if you got a driver's

1029
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,520
license photo on your

1030
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,460
running down your face? This looks like a mug shot yeah, a new or what are they

1031
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,300
yeah? What are they going to do? Yeah, they have to they have to try to

1032
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,340
comfort you, not give me my license. Yeah, I think if you got like a

1033
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,820
come back, if you got a blonde surfer wig, I think that look good. I always

1034
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:13,140
think you know that's why I lost my hair because I tried to bleach it. That's

1035
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,140
not why because I well, it was part of I believe my hair like four times. I

1036
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,260
I never had dandruff until I bleached my hair and then I believe my so bad my

1037
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,560
damn hairline. Oh, there's probably a big red line because this is all that's all

1038
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,260
bleach man. Yeah, yeah, that's pure bleach. Yeah, I push my hair to yeah,

1039
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:33,020
but you have great hair. I was going to go bald, but I was thirty and then I

1040
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:37,580
and then you celebrate it. Yeah, you sped it up. Yeah, yeah, so don't do

1041
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:41,420
that and by the way, I think God was I think that maybe God is not involved in

1042
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,520
my hair. Maybe God plucked your hairs out and they're waiting for you in

1043
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,460
heaven for one.

1044
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,220
you mean that baby new year

1045
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,300
God needs you to serve as the Dolly

1046
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,340
says they're doing red light therapy on my head. Maybe I think that the

1047
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:00,160
Christian God has selected you to be the next Dolly Lama to discredit

1048
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,740
the movement yeah and bring light to Christianity. I chose a Dolly Lama when

1049
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,480
there are five, the first Christian

1050
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,180
yeah, you know what you could do

1051
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:15,900
kill the Dolly Lama. No, I was going to say just get like a little curly blonde

1052
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:21,540
big damn. Maybe people maybe there are people like a little curly blonde afro

1053
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:25,080
if do you think people try to assassinate the kid Dali Lama when they

1054
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,040
pick him? Yeah, that's why he goes into as you go into hiding. Yeah, he's

1055
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,040
playing all day. I do. I bet that bodyguard for him is so cool. He's like

1056
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,800
you're in a row. His name is chance. Wait, Christopher Big Black Boykin

1057
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,240
faked his dad because he got a job for the Dali Lama. Oh my God, that's

1058
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,220
totally right. Lama kid gets to go around skateboarding and mall parking

1059
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:50,240
shots and Christopher Big Black Boy can tackle security guards who make $4 an hour.

1060
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
Yeah.

1061
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,840
Damn. Do you ever feel bad about those guys and those shows?

1062
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
What?

1063
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,920
Like, why is he harassed? He's just, the guy's doing his job.

1064
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,920
That was just a sketch.

1065
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,920
Oh, I thought it was real.

1066
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,040
No, no, no, no, no. That was a sketch for the DC shoes video that came out in '04.

1067
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,320
Well, why does he have a bodyguard in the first place?

1068
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,040
He had a bodyguard, like it was like a sketch that went into his part in the DC video and

1069
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,760
and Jeff Tremaine sold that sketch to MTV or whatever and made it a whole show.

1070
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,640
But also even just as a skater, skaters are mean to security guards.

1071
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,440
Skaters think security guards are cops.

1072
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,440
They are cops.

1073
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,440
They're not.

1074
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,440
It's just a job.

1075
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,080
There's something you're going to really like.

1076
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,080
There are better people.

1077
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,320
If you go on YouTube, look up skaters vs. Karens.

1078
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,680
I hate skaters.

1079
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,680
Both of them, right?

1080
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,000
No, I, in that war, I'm with the Karens all day.

1081
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,360
I think I think no, the care what a skater calls a Karen is not what a normal

1082
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:48,960
person. You got to see these.

1083
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,880
This lady won't let me grind her baby.

1084
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,800
Yeah, shut the fuck.

1085
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,600
You got to see these Karen's in these videos, though.

1086
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,080
They won't let me smoke marijuana under their window.

1087
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,120
This guy loves I want to go smoke marijuana and I want to smoke marijuana

1088
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:04,960
right next to the dryer vents and your house and make all your laundry smell

1089
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,280
like lay down your eight kids and then skate all the way across their backs.

1090
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,400
Just grind their entire on your car.

1091
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,600
What the fuck you can.

1092
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:16,200
I stand on your car to take out my run on your car. Yeah, yeah, there's a good

1093
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,680
there's a sometimes it's like a video of like an old man, just like just

1094
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,480
punching a sixteen year old good and that's not a Karen. By the way, that's a

1095
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,700
veteran. That's Kevin.

1096
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,880
Kevin's a cool name. Kevin's not the name for a male Karen. No, definitely

1097
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,600
not. I would say maybe a Patrick can a Patrick. Yeah, I don't think it's that

1098
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,720
doesn't rhyme with Karen. It doesn't have to rhyme with it has to rhyme with

1099
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,520
It has to be evocative of an annoying type of person.

1100
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,520
Yeah.

1101
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,120
Patrick's a saint.

1102
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,120
You have a little Minecraft kid name, Caleb.

1103
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,120
Whoa!

1104
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,120
No I don't.

1105
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
He's right.

1106

You can hear the moms like, "Caleb, get off!"

1110
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
Fortnite's a fun game.

1111
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Actually, Minecraft's a fun game too.

1112
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
Minecraft is not fun.

1113
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840

He really wants to make a like a hill in Kansas or something yeah yeah. Please

1131
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,340
let me do that. Please. I'm applying to make this plot of land and craft on the

1132
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,880
Earth project. Meanwhile, I have a forty five hundred dollar

1133
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,080
racing set up so that I can play and I'm dropping twenty thirty limbs in a

1134
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:17,640
fortnight game crown royale. I'm playing flight simulator. I've genuinely thought

1135
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,760
about that. All my credit cards to get one of these. Yeah, I genuinely thought

1136
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,760
of like getting like a VR headset and like a steering wheel and like pedals and

1137
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,960
stuff to try and teach myself how to try. It's not a bad idea. I was I was

1138
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,440
actually considering that just the other day. I'm not even kidding. I thought

1139
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,840
about that for so because, like, my biggest fear,

1140
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,400
my biggest fear with driving is crashing and killing somebody, right? Well,

1141
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,480
that's and maybe getting, like, a few people upset with my driving. So

1142
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,040
I think if I just do exposure therapy and in VR, I don't think that that I

1143
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,400
think if the purpose is exposure therapy, I don't think VR is gonna work.

1144
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:01,980
the purpose I'm going to be in VR and I'm driving and I just crashed the car and I

1145
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,520
have like a rumble seat and everything and I'm crashing my car and everything

1146
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:11,320
I'm like just crazy that's 200 200 miles per hour I'm getting 200 miles per hour

1147
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:16,240
in a Lamborghini and I'm just going Ryan Dunn into like barriers that doesn't

1148
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,400
work because that will not make you you will not you will have you will have fun

1149
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,680
doing that it will make you want to do it and nobody will be mad at you and

1150
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,440
they will congratulate you for playing so and then that's the annoying thing

1151
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,200
thing is you're going to get to the MV to do the driver's test. The guy's like

1152
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,360
all right, we're going to bring the car around, pulls up

1153
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,320
Lamborghini Mercy. Wait, I need to put on a I need to put on a full headset that

1154
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,400
covers my eyes before I can drive this, but as soon as you see that Lambo,

1155
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,360
which is what they give you the DMV to do, you're going to just immediately

1156
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,720
kill you and this innocent DMV lady. Yeah, no, because it's my well, I'm

1157
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,040
saying and guess I'm saying it's my biggest score for that. I'm saying it's

1158
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:55,160
my biggest fear is killing somebody in a car, but this is all you're going to
