1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Recording, and I'm playing the song.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,600
Sorry about my fan. I'll turn it off.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:21,500
Jesus!

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
What's up all my chuggers?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm trying to get that burp out.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
We can't hear it though, but you're fine.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
I'm fuckin' here.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Not my problem.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Beer's we drank, motherfucker.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
With Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Beer.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Beer.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Beer.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Beer.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Beer.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Beer.

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Beer.

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,340
Somebody is moving a bowling setup.

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,340
A homemade bowling alley.

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,340
I have two questions for you right now.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,820
Do you think that that could possibly be a ghost?

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,300
And two, how do you respond to the allegations lobbied at your person by a certain person

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,420
in our friend group that you live in a fully empty abandoned building.

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,020
Who lobbied that at me?

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,020
I can't, I cannot.

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,020
Okay.

27
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Noah said this?

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,020
Yeah.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,020
Um, okay.

30
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
So.

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,020
We should give the context for that because.

32
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,060
Okay, let's do, let's do beers first.

33
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,060
This is too much.

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,060
Let's do beers first.

35
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,060
Alright, let's do beers first.

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,460
It's been, we took a week off.

37
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,980
We forgot how to do a show.

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,260
Horrible family tragedy and here we are.

39
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,940
I have a twisted tea, half and half guys.

40
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:41,540
I did the original flavor last time, this time I did the half and half, hard iced tea and

41
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,540
lemonade.

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,300
Guys, I love the original twisted tea.

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,900
Love it to death, one of my favorite things.

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,420
This tastes completely identical and I did not know there was no lemonade in the original

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,780
twisted tea before I had ever had this.

46
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
This tastes insane.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Is it like sugar?

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,460
Half tea, half lemonade.

49
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,460
Oh, okay.

50
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,460
It's sweetened tea.

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,460
It's like Arizona tea.

52
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,460
I see.

53
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,940
This, this, this Twisted Tea thing has been going on for a while.

54
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,780
It was going on with you guys before I, when I was in town and I didn't even get to try

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
it.

56
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
And I was so curious.

57
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
It's amazing.

58
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
Do they not have that in Mexico?

59
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,280
No, we don't.

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,300
This is a magnificent, magnificent drink.

61
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,180
I'm going to give this, I'm going high on this guys.

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm going to give this an 8-1.

63
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Wow.

64
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Wow.

65
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,980
You love the sisters.

66
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,140
Now rate it in basketball terms.

67
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,780
In basketball terms, this is Ant.

68
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,580
Anthony Edwards, is that his name?

69
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,580
Yeah, sure.

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,180
Yeah, this is him.

71
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,900
This is a high upside, doing some insane things, punching way above where he should be for

72
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,980
how old he is.

73
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:01,980
your

74
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:15,860
the

75
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:22,980
I do not understand why people are drinking white claws and stuff.

76
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:27,120
If you don't want a beer, this is the beverage to go for.

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,140
This is like, I mean I'm like a quarter of the way through this already.

78
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,500
This is a giant can.

79
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
It's so delicious and it has caffeine in it.

80
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,620
Which is extra good.

81
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,300
Which I like caffeine quite much.

82
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
Okay, who's next?

83
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,740
I'm going next.

84
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,980
I have a beer Julio might be familiar with.

85
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,940
I have a tomato gelato.

86
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
A gelato!

87
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,940
A cendilla picante!

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Whoa!

89
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,180
I have a cendilla picante modela gelato.

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,500
Ok, I've seen this often, but I think that gelatos are basically disgusters.

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,340
So tell me why, but I've only had the tomato ones.

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Ok so that's just tomato juice?

93
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,700
And the mango one is way too sweet.

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,200
Yeah, tomato juice is awful.

95
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,900
And only like old men who are weird drink it.

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,000
I would pause it.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a spicy watermelon flavor.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,500
Yeah.

99
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Whoa.

100
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,000
What you think, white boy?

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
This tastes really good.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
You look so Mexican today.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,700
It's crazy.

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,200
Me?

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,300
No, not no, never you.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,200
Me.

107
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,900
Never me?

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,700
What does that mean?

109
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,300
It's because I have my pointy shoes on.

110
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,200
You can't see.

111
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,340
every you dude. My shoes are so long and pointy they're curling under my desk. What if I bring

112
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,140
my beanie down like this? Rex has so many looks, has so many looks over the years that have

113
00:04:50,140 --> 00:05:02,700
known him. You've always looked like a ball. I'm sorry but if I- A ball! Well you've had

114
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:09,700
You've had two looks. You've had guy with hair and then most of the time you've had a ball.

115
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Ball is the other one I get.

116
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,700
No, that's fine. That's a fine thing to say to somebody that you love.

117
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
You look like a ball.

118
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
You're a famous ball. Like a cue ball, a beach ball, a volleyball.

120
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
You are probably the most famous ball around.

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah.

122
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
I can't take a word famous, Paul.

123
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Rate the beer.

124
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Rate it.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Rate the beer.

126
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Say any number and we'll just continue.

127
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
This is like a 7.5.

128
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Maybe an 8.

129
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Very light 8.

130
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
You know?

131
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
You do Anthony Fantano.

132
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
On the score.

133
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Me, Portnoy.

134
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
You, the Needle Drop.

135
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I guess that's true.

136
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,900
watched Anthony Fantano but I guess saying like something is his...

137
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,100
I think it's just something that you can just like pick up like without watching it

138
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,700
how does it what's that called like you don't have to watch it but just like

139
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:21,020
pick it up by like context clues I forgot what the term was yeah anyway this is

140
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,980
delicious it tastes like water with sweet and spicy it sounds good you know what

141
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,060
is it something that the Spanish world is hiding from us

142
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:39,940
agua fresca this is the best drink ever I've noticed women the sweet there is

143
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:46,340
water hand agua fresca that is starting to come up in in vending machines really

144
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:53,340
see it more often. I think Minute Maid makes an agua fresca. Obviously not Bluey Autentico.

145
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:00,460
Yeah, Autentico agua fresca is basically the best drink on planet earth. Like a melon flavoured

146
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,580
water. Oh my god it's so damn good. I love that shit. This has been around for a while.

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:11,700
I thought you were talking about... It's probably been around anciently. Yeah. I would assume.

148
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,220
One of the most famous TV shows in Mexico, it was like one of the gags on there was like

149
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,120
agua fresca that tasted and looked incredibly weird.

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,120
So that's like a 50s show.

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,860
Pretty much like the dirty rag agua fresca that looks like shit but it tastes like mango.

152
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Dishwater agua fresca?

153
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Yeah, yeah, basically.

154
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
That sounds pretty good actually.

155
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,860
It was a funny thing 50 years ago.

156
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Show me your fucking beer you piece of garbage.

157
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,580
Finally I know what everyone has been thinking over

158
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,420
Over every single episode. Oh, what's to be you're gonna bring in is you're being some bullshit. I was meaning like

159
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,220
Take out the roja. It's gonna be something stupid

160
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,680
Something that everybody's ever like already seen you have a heater this week. You're claiming today

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,740
Yeah, oh shit. I'm clean

162
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,900
Claiming it's more interesting than my usual beer

163
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,820
You fucking bitch a couple weeks ago

164
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,340
I discovered that we have quite a beer collection on my supermarket and

165
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:27,020
They have a nation section. So I went ahead and pay myself up a original Thai beer called singer

166
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,740
Oh sing ha this is a good beer. Yeah, you think so? I've had this one. I

167
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,860
think

168
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,580
I had some kind of fucking Asian beer. That's good. I like it

169
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,580
It's a premium lager from Bangkok

170
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:53,180
Okay score that muh, this is a 7 I like it

171
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,060
Little anticlimactic but under rate underwhelming

172
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,380
Score, I just think it's a it's a good like you ever like that's not even true

173
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,920
You don't like beer I don't know why you're arguing with that I I don't like

174
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,360
Dark beers. This is this is pretty late. This is really not even going for a decimal point. You think seven point zero seven point one

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,100
It's a little it's a little better

176
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,140
Also, I also saw the hello

177
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,300
Things house and there that I want to I wanted to buy all of them. I like those. Yeah

178
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,320
Character I realized recently shut up

179
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,860
That when you showed me the singha I was thinking of that beer and that I've never had the beer that you just tried

180
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:45,640
No, that one that's crazy. That one's so completely green, but it has sing in the name. That's true

181
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,740
I think you won this time. It's

182
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,540
Different sting

183
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,980
Another debate that I've won. Yeah, it's really funny

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,860
the

188
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,580
the

189
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,380
that's the asian part of africa

195
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,900
really i'm learning a lot from you too

196
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,300
basically

197
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,060
have you watched like early curb

198
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,580
curb your enthusiasm?

199
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,820
you know the episode with the uh...

200
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,980
the basspec ratio is somehow smaller than four by three

201
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,060
it looks like it was filmed on a phone

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,860
You know the episode with the uh...

203
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,700
the carp

204
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
not the carp actor, the acupuncturist

205
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,420
I don't know, it's been many years

206
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,680
well it's got this guy that does like

207
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,100
he's the asian voice

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,580
for like twenty years

209
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,380
but you never like see him actually he just does it in like cartoons

210
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,540
is it the guy who plays the dad duck in kung fu panda?

211
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,820
I believe so. Whoa I love that guy he's isn't he in he used to be like an actor

212
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
in the eighties

213
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,320
Yeah.

214
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,580
Yeah, and he's-

215
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,580
And he passed away, I believe.

216
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,140
No, I think he's still alive.

217
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,600
Uh...

218
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,100
He passed on.

219
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,880
Okay.

220
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,980
Alright, well he's dead.

221
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,480
*laughs*

222
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,540
But the point is...

223
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,220
Uh, I had never seen what he looked like before.

224
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,060
I just assumed that there was, like, multiple guys doing that voice.

225
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,720
No, it's one guy who invented the Asian voice everyone does.

226
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,700
Yep.

227
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,780
And he's from Hawaii.

228
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,660
Really?!

229
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,480
Yes.

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,980
That is funny.

231
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,660
Well, good for him!

232
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:23,660
the

233
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Israel Kaliwa'uwi

234
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Israel

235
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,660
They can't claim him anymore

236
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,660
They invented Israel

237
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Well he, what do you mean he passed on?

238
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Good

239
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
What do you mean good?

240
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
He aided himself to death

241
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
He had children

242
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
So?

243
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
What the fuck is your problem today?

244
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
Think about the children in Gaza

245
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I care for these children too

246
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Why are you so hostile?

247
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
It's just a fat guy who passed on to the next line

248
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:13,380
to

249
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,660
He deleted the video today.

250
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,740
It was a couple days ago.

251
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,260
Guys if you're not, if you don't know what's going on right now, first of all I'm praying

252
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,020
for you because you do not have a lot upstairs.

253
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,700
Because you should be plugged into this.

254
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,220
If you like this show you should be plugged into this kind of stuff.

255
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,520
Tap into this shit.

256
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,780
Me and Rex's favorite gambling streamer Mr. AZ who is either 24 years old or 21 years

257
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
old.

258
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,340
He said both ages.

259
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:55,860
So

260
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,340
he had met levied an accusation against rosh dine who's the number one biggest

261
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,020
really streams of the drake

262
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,020

263
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,540
levy an accusation of russian that he was attacking him

264
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,420
with uh... all this like fake information and then also that russian

265
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,660
does not use real money guys this

266
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,460
is huge fucking news

267
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,300
so that was already come down

268
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,780
uh... of course it was known

269
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,760
but it proved it

270
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,540
but he proved it he brought rossi would have to have lost

271
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,500
to

272
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,360
billion dollars

273
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,720
which is just not gonna happen without being

274
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
you would never catch me losing two billion dollars not even on my worst day

275
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,980
i would cry

276
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,540
two billion are you kidding me

277
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,440
when my in on mosk

278
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
even for him it would hurt

279
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
somewhat

280
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
probably no

281
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,380
but i was a fifty five billion which is

282
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,120
honestly very funny

283
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
well twitter

284
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,920

285
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,080

policy scheme

290
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,680
or really i don't know anything about the story what happened with that

291
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,800
uh... the judge in delaware is not letting him get his like twenty eight

292
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,680

293
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,200

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,920
uh... dark night rises whole

298
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
you finally make it to the united states

299
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,080
and he said him have a great idea

300
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,200
ebay

301
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,440
not the day

302
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,540
people are just

303
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,360
was a bit yeah i think it was a bit off

304
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,320
the

305
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,440
and i think it would be a bit of a little bit

306
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:55,380
PayPal which was bought by eBay. So basically he created eBay. Yeah, you invent PayPal so that people can buy drugs

307
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,040
now

308
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,040
That sells and you say hmm. What else I want to use my giant African brain on

309
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,760
Hmm, maybe a car that runs on batteries you do it

310
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,200
Everybody's saying you can never do that cars run on gas. You can't have a car that runs on a battery

311
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,640
You fucking do it you make some of the greatest coolest looking cars of all time that are the best possible

312
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,560
Ubers they're literally made for uber. They're perfect

313
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,920
The handles don't open that makes no sense. The handles are I like that. It's a it's a security measure

314
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,540
Yeah, the one time we took we took that Tesla over. I felt like I was sliding around on the seats

315
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:41,640
Exactly. Yeah, they don't have seat belts. You have to hunt for the seat belt. The entire thing smells like a matchbook and then you make

316
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Trillions right? Yeah, or you think you did and then some fucking fat guy in Delaware handles parking tickets all day

317
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, you can't do this. Yeah, that is some bullshit

318
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
He was

319
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,200
Like

320
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,700
Billions of dollars in stock under the condition he could make Tesla like a trillion dollar company

321
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,720
And everyone's like, "You'll never be able to do that. That is retarded."

322
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,600
-Mm-hmm. -Uh, in 2018.

323
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
-And he did it. -Well, you could say it.

324
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,840
-Yeah, back in 2018. -Yeah.

325
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,880
Yeah. In 2018, you could definitely say that.

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,280
Well, actually, no. 2018, you definitely could not say that. You could say it now.

327
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,560
-But 2018, you cannot. But the point is... -Right.

328
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,760
...he's not getting his money. Which is very funny.

329
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,880
That's why he's been complaining about the state of Delaware on Twitter.

330
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,420
Which is very it's a very funny beef to have with like a state. I like that shit. I

331
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,000
don't like

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Kansas

333
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,280
Yeah, but you can't fight the state of Kansas. What do you like?

334
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:01,240
Watch me watch me. I'm more powerful than you will ever know man, and that's what

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:09,400
That's that that's the host of the show I would like to congratulate Caleb on his big breakthrough

336
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,760
It is officially gonna be the year of the Caleb. Guys, we all saw it. He's starting off in LA.

337
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,500
He's going all over. He hates not-Kansas though.

338
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,300
He's gonna be a big-time celebrity and we're here to just interview him pretty much.

339
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,760
Is this because the Chargers posted my video y'all?

340
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
And then deleted it like cowards because they found out that

341
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
it was a racist video.

342
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,760
It's not a racist video! I never understood this!

343
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:46,000
How do people say that this is a racist is it the least racist video ever you were calling him a pussy and

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
some other

345
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:57,420
What kept being a gay guy is that's a lot of you down on our gay Kenyan president

346
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:06,600
Hawaii I say he's from Hawaii in the video completely true. It's all facts. Oh, why?

347
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,080
No, I don't think you don't think it's a state does what you said

348
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,200
I say Hawaii. Yeah, you said that. Yeah, you know what?

349
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,680
Never watch the video. I've got

350
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,120
Just sent that shit out did not watch that shit man. I need to make a video

351
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,520
I need to think of a video idea man. What should I've been? I've been telling you

352
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:36,480
I've been telling killer for you two years now make another video and he goes like no that's stupid and then

353
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,840
The Chargers come in and they're like, "We're Caleb's biggest fans" and we'll post this video without even doing an inch of research

354
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,360
You know who this guy is. We just saw this video

355
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,860
I don't know like on TikTok or some shit and then they were so

356
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,960
Amazed that you replied "What's up?" to their tweet that they fucking deleted it.

357
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,340
That they deleted it man, these fucking cowards. I thought I was about to get tickets

358
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,760
My dad likes, not the Chargers, but he likes the Rams which used to play in LA. Close enough.

359
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,940
and or they do now they do now again yeah okay so they played in LA when he was a

360
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,780
kid and then the Chargers came in so he hates the Chargers actually but I was

361
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,120
gonna surprise him with April Fool's tickets where when the NFL is on in

362
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:26,400
April and that's not gonna work out I guess I guess my entire thing is yeah in

363
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,760
my head it was it was two scenarios as we won which is the the the utopia they

364
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,520
found out who you are they're like oh my god we're such fans of your video from

365
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,320
five to ten years ago let's collab let's make you the face of the Chargers

366
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:47,040
social media Twitter account yes and they fly you out they take you to the

367
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,440
games and you're running around doing your thing the second scenario is that

368
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:59,800
what is my thing do you just run around and do your thing I run around you run

369
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,240
around you post tweets I'm the charger stadium I hate Obama which is what I

370
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,800
said and I'm also a racist which is what you said I didn't say that in the video

371
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,280
and second second scenario they delude the post and they block you which is

372
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,360
halfway there honestly they did I don't know if they blocked me I didn't check

373
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,080
but either way it's only content exactly dude people I mean what you posted they

374
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,040
probably have posted other videos that were had unsavory people and I'm not

375
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,200
Not that I'm unsavory, I'm very very, I have a lot of mainstream appeal.

376
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,880
You guys would be shocked if you looked through my emails, all the different mainstream type

377
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,240
stuff that comes into my, onto my desk.

378
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,440
But I'm sure they've uploaded a picture of, probably nothing about, probably no Hitler

379
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
photo has ever made it to sports.

380
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Sports thing.

381
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,600
see what's the charges considerable

382
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,240
one of the best

383
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,040
no no i'm not saying it's like a hitler

384
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,540
thing

385
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,340
woah don't raise your hand like that bro chill

386
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,840
i can't win in this

387
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,340

391
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,140
you're gonna be the biggest celebrity of the world

392
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,440
basically

393
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
i get des- i can't because i get destroyed

394
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,960
They're gonna put you in a movie with Ryan Reynolds.

395
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,880
I, I, no. No, no, no.

396
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,360
I was walking around, have you guys ever played that Vampire the Masquerade game?

397
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,360
Yeah. You know there's the ugly character where you walk around and people just are

398
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,640
like "Ew, fuck you, you're fucking ugly."

399
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,240
That is what my life is like. I walk around and people fucking give me the worst

400
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,640
looks, people pull their

401
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,000
kids and dogs and cats away from me as I walk by. Isn't that weird because you have a dog that

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
what's the kill everything it sees?

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I...

404
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
um... yeah

405
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
he's not the best dog

406
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was thinking on the way home today

407
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I was like walking him and I was like

408
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
god damn I wish I didn't get this fucking dog

409
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
how fucking dumb am I that I got a dog

410
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was thinking about

411
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
how much better my life was with no dog

412
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
god damn

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
don't get a dog if you're watching this do not get one

414
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
cause you have to you're tied to them for

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
you know how long does a dog live

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:37,440
like

417
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
you're like sitting at the house like the reason why we got him in the first place

418
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,000
was I was like oh I'm at the house all the time it'd be nice to have something

419
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,280
to hang out with and then you realize that nothing is better than just sitting

420
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,320
at the house alone and you watch your you watch TV and you make one of the

421
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,080
worst meals of all time and you eat cold rice you get sick from the rice that is

422
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,680
a much better life than having a dog in your house yes having a pet is something

423
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,120
women do to feel less alone. Men have the computer, we're fine.

424
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,980
That is true. Yeah, exactly. I'm gonna open my door cuz it's getting...

425
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,180
Sometimes I forget that I...

426
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,180
I, uh...

427
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:24,680
My old roommate keeps asking me when I'm going to give him my address so he can send me the ashes of a dog that I

428
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,180
had for two years and left the ashes at his house.

429
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,680
Feed him, go to, feed him to a bird on a bench.

430
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
-Throw it away! -It's like, dog's ashes? Yeah.

431
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
What the fuck?

432
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,280
Why did you even have those ashes in the first place? That's my question to you.

433
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,400
They give them to you. They're like, "You have to take these ashes."

434
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,000
So just leave them at the vet. Do they put them in a giant urn? Is it in a bag?

435
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,800
They were sitting in a shoebox, and I left the shoebox in the closet.

436
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,960
The whole point of keeping ashes is a sign of respect, and you're putting them in a shoebox deep in a closet?

437
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Yeah.

438
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,160
It's more respectful to throw them away at that point.

439
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,640
Listen, this dog was blind.

440
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,720
He pissed himself constantly.

441
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,960
The fact I even moved him across state lines is a blessing.

442
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,040
Well, it does, I mean, it seems like the op, it seems like a curse that you had to move

443
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,600
this fucking terrible dog.

444
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,520
Well, I was cursed by having his ashes, if that's what you're saying.

445
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Yeah.

446
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Do you feel like...

447
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,880
Okay, I want to talk about my apartment being haunted. What did Noah tell you about my apartment?

448
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
So Noah did the thing...

449
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,760
I don't know. I think you've talked about this before right? The Patrick thing when he locked himself out of your apartment?

450
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,320
Yeah, so it was the it was...

451
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,440
to set the scene I

452
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,880
went back home for a funeral and it was a very very sad kind of thing and

453
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,000
it was like the last night that we were... I was in North Carolina. Mm-hmm, and it was

454
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:13,680
was

455
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I

456
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,800
just catch my reaction as I looked at my phone just like eyebrows throwing so

457
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,280
crazy and then just without saying anything I just got up off the couch

458
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,480
like this and just the worst posture ever hunched over just walked into the other

459
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,640
room because I had to keep my phone plugged in so because it was also about

460
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:59,300
to die and so he fucking sends Phil to his girlfriend's house and I guess he

461
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,940
destroys that house too and then calls... wait did he tell you this? He called three

462
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,860
different locksmiths and they all get there at the same time the locksmiths are in

463
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,060
front of my apartment and he has them argue about who will do it for cheaper

464
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:22,100
this is it's three locksmiths and I'm getting a live vlog of this entire thing

465
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,580
happening he's like yeah I have three Polish guys in front of your apartment

466
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,820
arguing about who's gonna give me the lower price to get into this fucking building.

467
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,500
Okay. So one guy finally breaks and is like, I'll do it for a hundred bucks. And he's like, okay,

468
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,260
I will go with this. So my, my POV of the situation is I sit at my computer and I see that Mike

469
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,860
is playing Valorant with a certain Caleb on discord. And I go, oh, that's crazy. I thought

470
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,180
Caleb was a very important thing. And then I joined the call and, and, uh, Mike goes like,

471
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,660
"Oh no, this is... no, he's at Caleb's."

472
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,460
I was like, "Oh, okay."

473
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,300
So then he starts sending the messages on Discord,

474
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,780
like, "Oh, I got myself knocked out."

475
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,460
And he's doing all this thing.

476
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,940
And I think it must have been like an hour or so

477
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,420
when I can finally hear him talk.

478
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,140
He finally made his way inside.

479
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,340
And he comes in like,

480
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,860
"Oh, dude, Jesus Christ, that was so fucking stupid."

481
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,580
And he tells us that he was out there in the cold with Phil

482
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,140
for about 30 to 40 minutes,

483
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,380
just laying on the doorbell of like every single apartment in your building and no one even

484
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,620
looked at the door.

485
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
And so he said...

486
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,780
There are four people in my building, man.

487
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,780
There's what?

488
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
It's four people.

489
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,340
It was like a Saturday night.

490
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,940
I'm sure they were all gone.

491
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,260
And now he's accusing me of living in an abandoned building.

492
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,340
So okay.

493
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,460
So proof number two, there's a ghost haunting you right now, making noises.

494
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,660
So I think the ghost building theory is picking up steam.

495
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
It's really not.

496
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,860
Another thing was I got back, I do not have, I was just kidding.

497
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,340
I wasn't even sure, I didn't even hear anything.

498
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:17,220
I got back here and I sat at my desk and literally the entire desk was covered in black ash because

499
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:24,300
he was clearly smoking a joint at my desk in my room which has no windows and just stinking

500
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,620
it up with disgusting smoker's weed.

501
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,900
Did it smell?

502
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:33,340
No but I'm gonna tell him it did to make him feel worse.

503
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Just ash everywhere.

504
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:39,500
Oh god I have a white mouse pad there was a giant black streak on the mouse pad that I

505
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,060
had to go clean off.

506
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,300
He sucks man.

507
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,820
I'm done with him.

508
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,700
I'm opening another beer guys.

509
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,240
This is a Bitburger.

510
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Bit Burger.

511
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,240
That's what I like to do now.

512
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,040
This is, yeah I'd like to bit on a burger.

513
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:59,520
This is a Prieb Pils, original German Pilsner.

514
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,160
This is a, it was on special, it was $3.50.

515
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Let's see how this one is.

516
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I wish I'd bit a burger.

517
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,560
A burger beer is crazy.

518
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Wow.

519
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Burger.

520
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
*sips beer*

521
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,240
Guys this is not what I was expecting from this beer whatsoever based on the look of the can hold on what?

522
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,840
There's a deal with a name. I

523
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,120
Believe it means something in German

524
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,520
Wow, this is really good. This is a pilsner that is not I think of a pilsner as a very light kind of boring beer

525
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,920
This has complexity man

526
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,760
This has different layers to it in terms of beer

527
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
It's like beer

528
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,800
It has a almost I would say I would say it's bordering on like an IPA type of like drying out your mouth

529
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,680
type of thing I see I

530
00:30:52,680 --> 00:31:00,480
See some transiting from German to English and apparently bit burger in German in English. It stands for bit burger. Oh

531
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,280
That's pretty simple then yeah, that makes sense

532
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,720
What it what did I have to drink while I was home that's I know that's your question I'll answer that I had

533
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,160
I had a new kind of wine that I've never had before

534
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,040
Which is a Sarah?

535
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:26,400
Wine and guys, I think I have a sir. I think I have a Sarah addiction. I had three glasses

536
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,920
This is the best wine I've ever had in my life. I

537
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,040
Don't know what that is. I don't know either. I got it from Trader Joe's

538
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,740
The platinum reserve sirah from Trader Joe's I love this one good for wine

539
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,300
Feel like it's good for one. It's bad for beer good for one

540
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,360
It's grapes. I have wine. It's great. We bought a wine bottle

541
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,400
it must have been like almost a month ago now and we don't have a

542
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:01,580
The court thing to take the cork out. So that was sitting my stupid fridge

543
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,600
We came across this problem because we bought the wine and then realized that my wife's parents are very

544
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,840
Religious and have never drank anything and they did not have a wine bottle opener. One is the religious beer

545
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,880
Basically, they don't do and and then

546
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,240
My wife's dad was like hovering around the wine. It was like I

547
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,320
Wish I could have a glass of wine man

548
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,680
He's like nope, I swore to God 40 years ago that I would never have a single drop of alcohol ever again

549
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
That is crazy

550
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,920
He's like 60 something so what are you so

551
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:48,260
Let's it's so funny to be a sober guy at like 23, you know, yeah

552
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:56,720
I'm done. Yeah, one year of going crazy. Yeah, and then I went hung out with my dad

553
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
1130 p.m. lunch

554
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,460
Margarita halfway finished when I walk in the door of the restaurant and I was saying yes

555
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,080
This is more my kind of thing. That's what that should be like. Yes, dad should be red

556
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,940
Right dad should be a full red. They should be like shrimps. They should be over

557
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,880
Completely pink. Yep

558
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,320
Just floating around

559
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,240
That's the fucking truth of the matter. Yeah

560
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,480
Really small hurry definitely smaller than you because you know what you don't want a dad that's bigger than you that sucks

561
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,840
I remember him being bigger than me when I was growing up, but now I'm larger than him. Yeah, that's weird

562
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,940
Dad's shrink because they get old and old people and boys grow. Yes

563
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,600
Here's a problem that I had when I was home in

564
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,040
My my younger brother my youngest my youngest is

565
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,180
He just turned 13 years old he's six foot one

566
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,400
Dude it was making

567
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Mad dude

568
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,200
He's six foot and not six foot one like he's like he's like, um, he's like a huge man

569
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,240
Yeah, he was like we were like wrestling

570
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,220
Like he came up to me and like kind of wrestled me when he saw me and I felt like I in danger

571
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:26,100
I was like, I need to take an MMA class to defend myself from my my child brother who started

572
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,220
a yellow exclamation point above his head. It's not red yet because he's not

573
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:38,540
Yeah, it is bad dude, and he's like sitting there at one point dude. He did something that pissed me off so bad man

574
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:44,260
We're sitting there talking to my mom and he fucking put his arm and rested it on

575
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,300
Dude, I just had to sit there and take it this kid will kill me

576
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:00,440
Kiddies huge Jesus Christ, man. He owns you. I used to wipe poop off his balls when he was a baby

577
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,560
And he'll put you in the toilet and now he'll he'll kill me. Yeah

578
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:13,160
Dude, it was crushing. It was completely crushing. That's horrible. Are you gonna try to lure him into joining the NBA soon? I

579
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,580
I have told him that he needs to join sports, but my mom won't let him because she's, you know,

580
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:28,060
he's the youngest. She's afraid of him getting concussed and adding to any sort of brain damage

581
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:35,100
that he probably already has. Yeah, right. But he has a lot of potential. People are saying

582
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,300
questions. Okay, he was the reason I wiped poop off his balls is because he was a baby

583
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,940
when he was born and I was 14 or 15 and so of course I had to change his diaper and he would

584
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:54,540
have poop all over his disgusting balls and yes I had to wipe that up. Now given this experience and

585
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:05,900
just extrapolating from the memory of that time do you think he is also you know bigger than you?

586
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,660
Do you think his member is larger?

587
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
That's what I'm asking.

588
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Because he's taller.

589
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
Do I think that my...

590
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Yeah, Rex, I'm not going to answer that man.

591
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
That is an odd question.

592
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,660
My 13 year old brother, you're asking if he has a larger member than me.

593
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,660
I think it's a valid question.

594
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
It's just a thought.

595
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,660
This interview sucks, dude.

596
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,660
Yeah, you're not really...

597
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Can you move on to the next question?

598
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,660
I don't really speak to that.

599
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,500
career or some shit but his next moves

600
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
what's next for Caleb?

601
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
what's next for Caleb Piz?

602
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
what's next for me?

603
00:36:43,500 --> 00:37:02,540
well, persona 3 just released today, the reloaded version so now I'm entering back into Japan

604
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,420
in a major way and uh

605
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,420
I feel like they've released 20 versions of the same game over the last like 5 years.

606
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,600
That one got, it was like originally a PSP exclusive or something and then they like

607
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,500
released it somewhere else, I don't know.

608
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,940
So FES is the PSP exclusive and in that one you play as a girl.

609
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,020
Or you have the option to.

610
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Yes.

611
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Yeah.

612
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,100
Yeah, so this is not, this was just the normal one I guess.

613
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,100
But um.

614
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
We're going back to the regular one where you play as a boy.

615
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Yeah, so it's better.

616
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Right.

617
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,840
I don't want to play the Persona 3 P P 3 P or whatever

618
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,260
I wanted to wait for the boy one the fully a boy no option to be a girl

619
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,780
Awesome rap in that game when you go into the dorms

620
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,020
It's like yo, I'm persona I got

621
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:02,480
Guns and I it's like that. It's awesome. It is you know, so in all the other games they they call their ghosts

622
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,940
I call them ghosts

623
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
for by saying

624
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,780
Persona yeah, and in this one they have to put a gun to their head and pull the trigger

625
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,300
Whoa for some and I when I heard about this I was like, that's badass

626
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,640
But then I played that I've been playing the game and it really is kind of I don't really like it very much

627
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,940
I think it's a little too much for me. What is that?

628
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:30,780
Because every single time I'm starting to love these characters and they're putting a gun to their head and every time I think that it's gonna

629
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,100
Come out the other side red instead of blue

630
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,620
It hasn't yet

631
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,860
but I think one of these times one of these things you're gonna put a gun to their head and pull the trigger and

632
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,420
It will be a full bullet that destroys their brain

633
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,500
This is crazy, I don't know I don't like I don't like violence

634
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,300
very much and

635
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,780
That kind of thing. I like cartoonish violence. I do not like dismemberment. I do not like

636
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,340
suicide, squidward suicide is still scary to me as an adult

637
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,840
right

638
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,340
and

639
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,460
i just don't like, i don't like the image of it

640
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,580
but i'm gonna keep playing

641
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,160
i'm gonna keep playing, don't you worry

642
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,500
because i need to develop relationships with every single girl in the game

643
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,640
and hopefully a teacher too

644
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,440
mr. robot

645
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,320
yeah this boy went completely robot

646
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,120
dr. robot's

647
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,400
did i rob- did i robot?

648
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:20,900
yeah

649
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,500
i think you're fine now

650
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,840
i understood what you were saying though

651
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,260
you said you needed to fuck

652
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,760
you needed to get your fuck on

653
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,380
I don't want to have sex. I just I want to

654
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,160
bashfully hold hands

655
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:40,100
Well, that's what Japanese sex is apparently. Yeah, so I like that kind of thing. Yeah

656
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,300
You know what? I've been thinking about recently these past couple days

657
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,980
What's that? I need to drop back in into Metal Gear Solid

658
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,760
So this is a game. I have to go back. I want to play this game so badly

659
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,320
But I don't know PlayStation and I don't really know how to do anything

660
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:05,240
It's not hard man. No, it's pretty easy, but I don't really know how to do anything. So it's hard for me

661
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,540
It's easy for you guys because you guys are nerds

662
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,520
I'm a jock so stuff for you hard for me

663
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,360
I need a persona over the past two months and you talk about it constantly

664
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,160
That is you also yeah, you've gone to the point where you

665
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,360
You try to repress it so hard during when we're recording the the regular

666
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,580
Podcast the the other one and then you come in here you go like, alright guys

667
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,200
I need 15 minutes before we even start going live you go guys

668
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,740
I'm gonna need my 15 minutes person in the corner stuck about it for 15 minutes. Nothing really happened

669
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,860
It's just the same shit the same girls running around and I'm talking to them

670
00:40:46,620 --> 00:41:06,440
a

671
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:13,440
was

672
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,440
And it turns out guys, high school, you're going to different noodle cafes and eating with your friends.

673
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Yep.

674
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,440
And you are, all the girls are wearing very high skirts, the boys are wearing full suits everywhere.

675
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Yep.

676
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,440
And you have to battle a demon and find out kind of the secret to the world.

677
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,440
And I just had no idea I guess. I thought that it was a lot simpler than that.

678
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,440
So these games are replacing my high school experience.

679
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
What's the point of a Persona game?

680
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,640
to beat the game. There's an end to it.

681
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,560
What is the point? Well, okay. Let me tell you about Persona 4.

682
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,160
The point of Persona 4 is that the demons that lay within you

683
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,280
that you are afraid to confront,

684
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,760
the most powerful thing you can do is look them dead in the eyes and say

685
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,680
"I am this. I have this in me.

686
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,920
I fully embrace the dark sides of my personality."

687
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,640
And Persona 5 is about fucking your teacher.

688
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,840
And Persona 3, we don't know yet.

689
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Because I haven't finished it.

690
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:25,080
But I have a strong feeling that it will have a very meaningful ending.

691
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,080
Right.

692
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,120
I guess I'll just never play these games and I'll just go back to playing all the Yoshala games again.

693
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
They're 100 hours long.

694
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,320
They're really long.

695
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
They're not very fun, to be honest.

696
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
I love 'em, man.

697
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,120
I'm becoming addicted to that game Vampire Survivors.

698
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,240
That's what I've been playing a lot of.

699
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,200
You should, uh, you know what game I think you would really love?

700
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
What's that?

701
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Danganronpa.

702
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Danganronpa?

703
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,960
I've heard this name before.

704
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah.

705
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,640
It's another high school style game.

706
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,640
I think that's like the- OH!

707
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,920
Don't get the wrong idea here, fella!

708
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,760
I don't like it!

709
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,200
I would like Persona just as much if it took place at a work event.

710
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,500
Right.

711
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,600
Where you had to go to class and you had teachers and you lived in dorms.

712
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,600
I would like it just as much as the ones that were you're in high school.

713
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,040
It's not the high school thing.

714
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,320
So as someone who's also like really so been outside of this like for years,

715
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,160
I've heard about Persona, Danganronpa,

716
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,200
and I thought that they were the exact same game when I heard about them.

717
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,920
Is this true, Rex?

718
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,760
they're completely different

719
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,320
do you believe the same one is a murder mystery

720
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,120
well it sounds very well

721
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,440
you all you know i've become obsessed with recently to done it films

722
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,640
like uh... i'd like to know if you would love

723
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,660
and i love who done it by just watched uh...

724
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,320
a haunting in venice the new uh... agatha christie

725
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,120
movie

726
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,920
uh... though hercule porro

727
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,480
with uh... kenneth brana

728
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,360
this movie

729
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,480
maybe the best movie i've ever seen

730
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,300
probably not but uh... it is fun it is very fun

731
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,600
i love

732
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,920
the who done it genre

733
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,320
and i think the next time you know what is clue

734
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,240
yeah we watched the uh... the nice out movies

735
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,280
i liked knives out i thought glass onion was essentially cringe

736
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,000
which is uh...

737
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,360
but just as somebody told me that

738
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,760
I actually liked it, but because someone said that, I now think it's cringe.

739
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,760
Oh, dude, yeah.

740
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:43,160
Death on the Nile is one of those movies that came out recently and it seemed to really suck.

741
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,760
Yeah, so apparently the other two sucked.

742
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,760
I know I watched the Murder on the Orient Express in theaters and thought it was kind

743
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,960
of crappy, but didn't see Death on the Nile, but Haunting in Venice, I really enjoyed it.

744
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,840
I watched it on a plane.

745
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,840
I also realized I watch 90% of the movies that I watch in a year on a plane.

746
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,840
That makes sense, I guess.

747
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,840
Yeah, watching a movie on a plane feels natural.

748
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
There's nowhere for you to go.

749
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah.

750
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,840
If I watch a movie at my house, I don't want to watch a movie.

751
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
It's the same as watching a season on a TV show.

752
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
That's good too.

753
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
That's awesome.

754
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
That's very good. That's where I watch the rehearsal.

755
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I watch, I think, all of the rehearsal on a plane.

756
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
But I watched um

757
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,640
I've watched some of my favorite movies ever on a plane. I watched the player the robert altman movie. I watched chinatown

758
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,520
on a plane

759
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,760
What else have I seen on a plane i've seen so many movies

760
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,160
I I mean, I really think 90 of the movies i've seen in the last like five years have been on a plane

761
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,800
I saw the uh, the cyberpunk anime on a plane

762
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,760
That's that's a good that's a good one to watch on a plane. It's not that long

763
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,560
One one thing that made me laugh really hard was um

764
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:01,160
I watched a woman with an hour and a half left into a flight start the movie Heat, which

765
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:03,160
is a three hour movie.

766
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:10,200
I just get like kind of pissed when it didn't, wasn't even close to ending when we were landing.

767
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,960
Dude, that just happened to me before.

768
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,480
Then you have to try to find the movie later.

769
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,040
Yeah, that's too much, man.

770
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,800
It made me smile so much.

771
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
Oh, dude, you know what I've been doing, or what I did last night and now I will do again

772
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960
tonight?

773
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,920
Guys, this is crazy. You're not gonna believe this. I

774
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,640
Have convinced my wife

775
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,520
To play Halo combat evolved co-op with Wow

776
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,840
That's crazy. We are about two hours in and I finish we finished last night

777
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,880
No, it's like thank you so much for for playing that game with me

778
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,520
I know that you would hate you hate that kind of thing and she was like no, I actually really enjoyed it Wow

779
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,800
Yeah

780
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Isn't that fucking isn't that crazy?

781
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:59,640
This seems like you're laying the seats to fully moving out into a bigger apartment and having a gaming room. That's what okay

782
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:10,120
So here's my plan, uh-huh

783
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,280
plan hamebo

784
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,960
I invoke all that involved.

785
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
Sorry, the Bitburger got to me, man.

786
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
We're playing Halo Combat Evolved, okay?

787
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
And we're playing it with the old graphics.

788
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
We're playing it in the Master Chief Collection

789
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
with the old graphics selected.

790
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
So it looks shitty.

791
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
Doesn't that like change the click of a single button?

792
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
Yes, but she doesn't know that.

793
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
She thinks that I had to hack it

794
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
to make it look like that.

795
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,960
That is so strange.

796
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,960
When I was playing that shit, I clicked it by accident

797
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,960
and I didn't know how to switch it back.

798
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,600
off putting. The new graphics look like shit. The old ones look amazing. And I um, so we're

799
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,080
playing on the old graphics. And we have this little TV, this baby TV, and you guys know

800
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,940
I bought a new TV. Right? I didn't know this, no. I bought a 55 inch TV from Sam that I'm

801
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:10,880
keeping at the office as like the office TV. But here's what I'm doing. We're playing this

802
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,760
and then we're gonna play through all what now she likes it quickly to come

803
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,140
about the play a little too that will play a little three

804
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,400
ods t

805
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,260
and then once we get to the new ones

806
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,840
hello for a little infinite

807
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,020
she's gonna notice

808
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,780
that the game is looking a little small because it's built for a bigger t_v_ at

809
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,000
this point

810
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,240
and i will say you know what's crazy

811
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,260
we have a t_v_ at the office

812
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,320
that i can bring here right now

813
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,200
that is giantly huge and we can play in 4k

814
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,320
and then she'll make me some dinner

815
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,320
well

816
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,240
uh... yeah

817
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,360
so this is a true husband of yours

818
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,320
we're talking about a three or four year plan here

819
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,920
that is

820
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,880
yeah

821
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,460
three or four years

822
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,460
uh... at the rate we're going

823
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,600
we'll probably play

824
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,280
an hour and a half every three weeks of these Halo games so it'll take some time

825
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,800
i think but it'll be worth it in the end i think

826
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,200
you have a fifty five inch tv

827
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,640
i tried to get i'd try to she played out of that harry potter game

828
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,480
and she really liked it i was like

829
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,300
i guess is kinda like

830
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,200
dark souls kinda thing you know to some extent

831
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,720
yet is it's a it's a review role

832
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,260
it's got no combat is going to like that

833
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:32,540
and

834
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,800
eyes i tried to get her to play elder ring but that that gave her a little bit

835
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,300
That is crazy because you haven't even played

836
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
You didn't even like Elven Ring

837
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
You played 20 minutes of Elven Ring and you were like

838
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,300
Elven Ring was too hard for you

839
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,300
It wasn't too hard

840
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Play it and stream it with me right now

841
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,300
Not right now

842
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,300
I just don't like that kind of game

843
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,300
I do not like those like

844
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,300
I don't like RPGs at all really

845
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,300
It's barely an RPG

846
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,300
It's more just combat and learning the world

847
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,300
It's still like open world stuff

848
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,300
I do not really care

849
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:13,300
not

850
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,020
and played all the way through that was like a 3D one like that

851
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,580
like a open world RPG

852
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,340
was like Breath of the Wild and I got really bored with that

853
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:24,740
and that was like 10 years ago now

854
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,180
this is really sad dude

855
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:29,620
why? cause I don't like your stupid game

856
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,500
no because you won't give love a chance

857
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,780
I played like an hour and a half of Elden Ring dude

858
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,600
no

859
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,740
it's just not my kind of game bro

860
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,940
it's too hard for you

861
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,620
if that's what you need to

862
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:43,740
to say

863
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,660
then i'll let you say that

864
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,660
you can't gaslight us in the thing that we don't like that kind of game

865
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,620
you watch people i don't like that kind of game i've never liked that kind of game

866
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,220
i like games

867
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:00,500
open world rpg i do not like this kind of game

868
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:07,140
it quite literally is i think that it does count as an rpg

869
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,300
it is an rpg

870
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,640
I'm not, I am amazing at pretty much every game.

871
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,680
I got my girlfriend to play Nier.

872
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,680
She really liked that.

873
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,760
The automata one with the butt cheeks out?

874
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
No!

875
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
The original.

876
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
The old one, oh I see.

877
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,680
She liked that one, the automata, didn't really get into.

878
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
Which I found fun.

879
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,880
That one's for guys for some reason.

880
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
Yeah.

881
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,000
Can't quite place why.

882
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,640
Yeah, cause see, the automata you play a girl with her ass cheeks out, and the original

883
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,080
you play a guy who talks to a girl with her butt cheeks out.

884
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
Very different.

885
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,760
It must be hard to be a girl and want to play video games and there's nothing, no kind of

886
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:49,760
cock stuff.

887
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,880
You don't get to see a lot of cock in video games.

888
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,880
Yeah.

889
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,880
Yeah.

890
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,880
Which is what they want.

891
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Except for Baldur's Gate.

892
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,880
Yeah, girls are addicted to cock.

893
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Cyberpunk 2077 you see cock.

894
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
Oh really?

895
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,240
Yeah, you get to customize the cock.

896
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:22,240
is

897
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,240
I don't like exploring at my own pace. I have a very bad pace.

898
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:33,240
I see what you're saying, but you also like Persona, which is maybe the worst at that.

899
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Well, but Persona is about... I like the...

900
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,240
High school aspect of things.

901
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:49,240
No, it's not... I don't only like RPGs that are in high school. I like the atmosphere stuff.

902
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,240
The LSU of high school.

903
00:52:51,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Because if you are like, open world games feel like a job,

904
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,240
Persona is the worst at that.

905
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:12,240
It's a school thing.

906
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
It's pretty open.

907
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,240
It's not an open world like those though where you're like

908
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:22,420
You're they sit you in the thing and you have to walk for 10 minutes to get to the next thing

909
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:30,240
Shit when you that's what I quit Elden Ring is when you have to get on a horse and go to another world

910
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,100
Fairly popular in other rings you think you pick the worst argument

911
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,420
No, no, no, cuz I would I do the next thing

912
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,720
I remember when I quit Elden Ring the next thing was to get on a horse and go to a different place and

913
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,080
That place was too far. So I just started fighting a giant because it was closer

914
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:54,460
And I fought the giant like five times and just died every time and I was like, well, oh what they're making me

915
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:59,040
Fight this fucking giant because the other things too far away and so I stopped playing

916
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,580
right, so

917
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:07,040
You are just simply stubborn and we as you know as people who love you

918
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,380
We just have to like keep working at it trying to teach you new things and trying to open your your you know

919
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,020
expand your horizons like how you were so close when I would talk to you about

920
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:22,000
music and you'd be like you you tell me you listen to kids music you're gay

921
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,840
whatever and then two three years up three years after knowing us he just

922
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,740
texted me out of the blue yo he is fire and then a week later he goes like

923
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:40,260
Peso Pluma is it. You never told me about Peso Pluma. Did I not? No, no, no, no, no, lie.

924
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:47,940
I found out Peso Pluma from another Mexican guy. I love Peso Pluma. I got roasted in the

925
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:53,980
work group chat the other day because I was logged into the eBay, the work Gmail eBay,

926
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:00,060
and Patrick could see that I was looking at Peso Pluma t-shirts. I'm pulling up this email

927
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,060
That was such a funny email to get.

928
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,420
Just in the middle of the day, just like, eBay, from eBay, like, "Oh, remember this?

929
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,420
Don't miss out.

930
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,420
Pezza Pluma."

931
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,420
Don't miss out on this Pezza Pluma tour shirt.

932
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,420
And I was like, "Dude, what?"

933
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,420
And then Cam sees a screenshot of someone just looking for Pezza Pluma stuff.

934
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,420
Oh, that's what it was, Cam.

935
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,420
Yeah, I'm going to look Pezza Pluma in our email right now.

936
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,420
Yep, there it is.

937
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,420
Listen.

938
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,420

Make it yours.

943
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,420
But imagine how cool I would look at that shirt.

944
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,420
I would be like, "Oh, that's so cool.

945
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,420

946
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,420

Let's make it yours.

948
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,420
But imagine how cool I would look at that shirt.

949
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,420
I think you should go for it.

950
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,420
I think I'm gonna get that shit.

951
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,420
Do you like the latest album? Genesis?

952
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,420
I have not listened to a full album yet.

953
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,420
I just listened to his top 5 songs on YouTube Music

954
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,420
that have Spanish names I can't pronounce.

955
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,420
Ok, that's fine.

956
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,420
And they're pretty good man.

957
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:59,420

958
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,020

963
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,440

00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,860
a brit will bring the throes back this weekend maybe a

968
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,420
i think i'd be a good move

969
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:26,940
uh...

970
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,060
Dude, I found out the kid who made Lethal Company,

971
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,900
do you know that he's 21 years old

972
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,820
and that game sold $52 million in copies?

973
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,180
- No, I didn't know that. - That makes sense.

974
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,140
- Is that crazy? - Yeah.

975
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,900
- I knew that he made like Roblox maps

976
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,980
and basically he started Lethal Company

977
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,620
as like a Roblox mod basically.

978
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:53,060
- He did, I mean, even with like Steam taking a cut,

979
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,060
He made 30 million dollars, 30 something million dollars.

980
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,320
My thing is, if you're this kid, why would you ever make a fucking game again?

981
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
You're done.

982
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,800
Yeah, no, I think he's just been updating it.

983
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,940
I think that's what people that find themselves in that scenario do.

984
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
Yeah.

985
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,280
Because here's the thing, right?

986
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,280
He could turn into Notch.

987
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,940
He could turn into Minecraft Notch.

988
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,900
He just sticks it out for 10 years.

989
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,900
Yeah what a right wing piece of crap

990
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,840
Yeah

991
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,780
Is he dead?

992
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,600
Did he die?

993
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,100
Notch?

994
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,900
No he got

995
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,900
He got ousted from the company I believe

996
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,640
Yeah well

997
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,600
Yeah well that was like

998
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,100
One of the first

999
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,440
Microsoft bought it for a billion dollars

1000
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,100
That was like a

1001
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,800
The first or second thing that happened to him

1002
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,300
Like

1003
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:37,940
It was

1004
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,280
He got a million dollars

1005
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,580
A billion trillion dollars

1006
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,740
He got bought out by Microsoft

1007
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:42,580
He got ousted

1008
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,540
He had his mansion with all the candy walls

1009
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,940
That he invited people into

1010
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,440
What?

1011
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,900
Yeah did you know that?

1012
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,780
He had a candy wall?

1013
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,440
Yeah

1014
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,640
He had a candy wall in his mansion.

1015
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Yeah.

1016
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,640
What do you mean a candy wall?

1017
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,640
Candy dispensers.

1018
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
Oh.

1019
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,640
Just hella candy in his mansion for some reason.

1020
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:10,640
I thought it was like, like Jack Bensinger has a wall, or he used to in his old apartment.

1021
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:17,640
I think the first time I ever FaceTimed him, I don't remember why, I saw that he had like a bunch of different candies that he had eaten.

1022
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,320
he had pushpinned the packaging to the wall.

1023
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:28,000
And now I think he doesn't because he has a girlfriend maybe.

1024
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,840
But that's what I thought you meant when you said candy wall.

1025
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,600
And I was like, that guy, Notch, probably has a much crazier candy wall than Jack Bensinger

1026
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,640
because of Notch's giant body.

1027
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,000
It's a little crazier because it's the real candy, not just the packaging.

1028
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,720
And you can get the candy if you're a guest at his home.

1029
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,940
And then he got, now he became like a racist and then he fully disappeared off the face

1030
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
of the earth.

1031
00:58:52,940 --> 00:59:02,240
Dude, that guy Kim.com, it's so funny that he is like a billionaire dude who had this

1032
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,840
whole thing, went to jail or whatever, and then now, I don't know if he still is, but

1033
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,660
at some point he was just like one of the guys in Trainwreck's stream who like just sits

1034
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,340
in the Discord call and goes like, "Oh yeah, give me some grapes, yeah, go do max multi

1035
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:28,820
the

1036
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:43,540
to

1037
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,540
gambling website.

1038
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,540
- Yeah, he's--

1039
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,340
- God bless him.

1040
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,260
- He's like six, seven, 400 pounds,

1041
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,880
rich, got nothing to do.

1042
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,720
- Yep.

1043
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,420
- And just, what would you do if that was you?

1044
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,580
- That's the thing, the same shit.

1045
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:02,420
- Exactly.

1046
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,060
- I would 100% find, if I had a billion dollars,

1047
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,420
I would find a way to be friends with TrainwrecksTV,

1048
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,160
Aiden Ross, Kyson Att, right now.

1049
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,000
- So which of us do you think is the closest

1050
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
get into that point. Who do you think is the closest to getting into the Discord call?

1051
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It's gonna be Rex. Rex is gonna abandon us for a train.

1052
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's what I was thinking.

1053
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Any day now. Any day.

1054
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I mean, and I, you know I love you guys, but if a bigger content creator came to me and

1055
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,240
was like, "Will you be my goon? Will you be my 24 hour a day goon?" who just sits there

1056
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,000
and says, "Yeah, grapes!"

1057
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,400
Do you understand how badly that would hurt my feelings?

1058
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,600
I would still try to find a pre-game.

1059
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,880
You guys know more about Train than I do.

1060
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,720
I remember tuning into one of his streams like a couple years ago.

1061
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:01,120
And he was just like silently not even doing anything, just looking at the slot go.

1062
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,920
And then he had goons in the background and there was a different POV from the slot in

1063
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:05,920
the corner.

1064
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,600
Does his goons, do they gamble with him?

1065
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
Is that what they're doing?

1066
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,600
Are they telling him?

1067
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,600
Sometimes they do.

1068
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
Is that what goes down?

1069
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Sometimes they do.

1070
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:20,320
Okay, sometimes they do sometimes they'll have somebody else that he will like stream their thing, but he doesn't he hasn't streamed in months

1071
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,440
I think yeah, I don't think he streams very much

1072
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:28,720
Yeah, I think he made a bunch off of kick. He's probably has like equity in kick. It was like the fate

1073
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,080
Oh, he certainly does dude, dude. I is kick losing like a million dollars a day

1074
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:40,640
Probably I mean they all lose money. It's so expensive, but they use em. They use AWS

1075
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:47,840
Video hosting yeah, which is like I for like a 5,000 people watching the stream costs

1076
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:56,500
$5,000 for every like six hours streamed if they watch in 480 P and 15,000 if they watch in 1080 P

1077
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,360
like

1078
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,980
They have to be losing a massive amount of money. Yeah

1079
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,400
Well, that's that's the thing right? It's like

1080
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:11,760
They're doing the uber model which is all tech is you just take a bunch of money until you can

1081
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,520
Get people sucked in and then just flip

1082
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,800
Your incentive model so that you start making money again

1083
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,160
What is uber gonna do that?

1084
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:26,200
And what how is this possible because isn't uber in like 30 million or 30 billion dollars of debt or some show?

1085
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,280
It's like when it started out like years ago. Yeah, I think I think uber makes a profit now

1086
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,800
Under net profit, let's see

1087
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:46,200
I don't know man, I think they make money now, but in the early days they just burnt like

1088
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,080
ten billion dollars.

1089
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,680
We need to have an idea like this.

1090
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
Do you think it...

1091
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,120
That's all tech is dude, you just burn money until you can make a billion dollars.

1092
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,120
And then you go to jail.

1093
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Yes, too late.

1094
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:04,920
Yes. Yeah, that's kind of the end of the career. It's about a 10 year cycle.

1095
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:12,600
Right. You just have to, you know, get big enough. It's like if you made 10 cents on

1096
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,960
everything, but you lost like a billion dollars until you had 10 billion

1097
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,280
customers. Well it's just having an OKADA and putting in front of

1098
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:29,120
someone now. Well, I guess you have to put, eventually you run out of money.

1099
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,820
There's not like, I do this shit, I do this shit almost, well not every day, but

1100
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:36,240
whenever I get an idea I just email this in to Rex and he goes like, yeah man,

1101
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:43,640
whatever. When are you going to invest in one of Julio's ideas man? When I, when he

1102
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,080
has a good enough idea. What was the last idea that you had for him? I'm gonna look

1103
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,320
- I haven't sent him one recently.

1104
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,280
I think I told, what was it?

1105
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,080
I had a Twitter idea.

1106
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:01,400
Like a Twitter, but it's kind of like a--

1107
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,920
- Like a private, like your tweets get deleted

1108
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,060
after a month.

1109
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:08,360
- After a day. - An idea for a social media app.

1110
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,200
- Yeah. - Yeah, that's not a day.

1111
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,960
- That's not so good of an idea, I think.

1112
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,600
- Here's the thing, social media apps--

1113
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,760
- Dude, we talk too much, man.

1114
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,400
- You have to, you can't even get funding

1115
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:31,400
for

1116
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:51,400
*Rex talking about dating apps*

1117
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:57,640
I like this one. I like this one. I said this one on the street before it's PC part picker but for groceries. Oh

1118
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:04,220
Wait, you already have what does that mean? It's a grocery list app

1119
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:10,920
Yeah, you know how you build your your computer on PC part picker and it gives you like the like the best prices on the best

1120
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,200
sites

1121
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,200
You do that shit. Oh

1122
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,720
You're gonna go to 40 grocery stores so you can get bananas

1123
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,040
the apples

1124
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,660
Basically, you're gonna sit in something fucking slave to go and buy one thing at every

1125
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:28,880
It's not fully

1126
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:34,760
Budget and then it builds a grocery list. It's also that's good. It's how it's it's not fully fleshed out

1127
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,040
It's more like the idea of like having that information in front of you because sometimes I feel like I'm getting the worst deal

1128
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:46,420
Possible when I go grocery shopping I did it. I did an order from Costco on instacart per Rex's recommendation today

1129
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:52,020
Okay, so in the cart $130 and I'm like that's a good amazing deal right then it's asking me

1130
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,000
Do you want no dude? It's saying do you want to get a Costco membership? I say no

1131
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,780
It adds the automatic tip to the driver delivery fee service fee

1132
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:04,220
225 dollars

1133
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:11,580
Yes, and did I order it yes, I ordered it what you get pad Thai

1134
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,540
That's history chicken. No, I got a bunch of shit. Yeah, this is okay. Yeah, but

1135
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:22,660
Yeah that that really made me mad. So I need to figure out groceries. That's the

1136
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:29,760
Idea is amazing. It's gonna be heartless of me to see don't tip them

1137
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:46,700
Thank you for watching Rex who by the way has Uber Eats a Taco Bell order at 3 in the morning

1138
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,700
And we know that he didn't tip

1139
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,700
You did that for my phone!

1140
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,700
In a hurricane he'll order Uber Eats

1141
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,700
Won't fucking tip a single dollar

1142
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,700
And goodbye

1143
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
Thank you for watching and goodbye

1144
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
I'm your host, goodbye
