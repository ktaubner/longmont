Yeah, that does sound yummy.

149

I don't really put tahini on my mango, even if it's like acidic.

Not me, man.

153
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,780
I'm one of those suckers who buys that really, really hard mango

154
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,820
on the side of the street.

155
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,640
Whoa.

156
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,940
Because if you go to a mango--

157
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,100
I never trust those.

158
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,180
If you go to a fruit cart, then they give you the good stuff.

159
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,940
Because if you don't like it, you can throw it in their face.

160
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,480
But if they sell it to you in a bag on the side of the road

161
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,420
while you're in your car, you're way too far away on the highway

162
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,860
to complain.

163
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,700
They're selling you the worst mango of all time.

164
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Wait, first sip review.

165
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,460
When you're first sip review of this salsa.

166
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,780
Oh, it's spicy.

167
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
It tastes--

168
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,520
I can tell you're kind of jittering.

169
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,940

It's spicy.

174

175

Mm. I love tajin and I tell you what this is.

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,740
You know, guys, can I?

180
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,220
I know this is unorthodox for this show.

181
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,220
I would like to motion for me to be able to skip directly to my second drink and put this

182
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,220
away and never even look at it ever again.

183
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Please.

184
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,620
I would like to confer with Rex before we take a decision.

185
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,140
Yeah, no, take all the time you need.

186
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,740
Rex, I think we should make him chug it before he skips.

187
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,620
We should make him chug it after it gets warm, after he finishes the second drink.

188
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,620
Wait, you're right.

189
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,700
I'd like to say something really quickly.

190
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,140
It's been warm this entire time.

191
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,900
It's probably a big reason why it's not very good.

192
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,100
I didn't put it in the fridge.

193
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,800
Okay, motion to allow Caleb to put it in the fridge and then drink it later.

194
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,500
In front of us.

195
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,000
I I we gotta go to it right now.

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
I don't put it.

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,900
Okay, wait, hold on.

198
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,200
You got it wrong.

199
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,300
Can you do that to him?

200
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,200
Let me just drink a warm drink.

201
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,300
I don't know what he I don't know.

202
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,100
We told him a time.

203
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,800
I don't know why he just pulled it out of his fridge and just like looked at it on his computer.

204
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,420
this entire time. He's so stupid. Yeah guys, by the way,

205
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,180
wireless headphones, completely wireless headphones.

206
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,940
So I can hear every single word you're saying.

207
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,340
No, I can still, and now I'm in front of you and I can still hear everything you're

208
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,260
saying, but it's good to know.

209
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,340
That's how you guys talk about me when I'm not around. Listen, okay. All right.

210
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,980
Here's my second one. Okay. Is it also hot?

211
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,060
That's completely hot. Check this out.

212
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,720
What's that?

213
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,500
Back to the world of mixology.

214
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,440
The Manhattan.

215
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,460
Bottled Manhattan cocktail.

216
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,700
And here I am, I poured over ice.

217
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,460
I have some ice here, but I was saving the ice for this because I like, I knew I was

218
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,420
going to like this because I've already had some of it.

219
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:59,860
So this is something that I thought was a single serving, but it turns out it's like.

220
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah, that's like a giant, it's basically a little bottle of whiskey.

221
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,080
and I poured a giant glass of it.

222
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,160
So cheers, my friends.

223
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,120
Cheers. Cheers.

224
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,520
Cheers, my friends.

225
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,360
Shall we?

226
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,180
Now that's good.

227
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,180
That's much better.

228
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,760
That's much, much better.

229
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,760
I saw a post on Twitter about a guy that was like,

230
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,680
"I order weird drinks at the bar

231
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,440
"and the bartender gives me free drinks."

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,940
'Cause you order the weird ones?

233
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,000
'Cause he orders the weird drinks that are fun to--

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
What's a weird drink?

235
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,280
Salty dog.

236
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,600
Pee and soda.

237
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
Yeah, it's a salty dog.

238
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't know if that's actually,

239
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
that's like a gin drink with salt on the rim or something.

240
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,320
It's like grapefruit juice, gin, and like salt.

241
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,040
That seems kind of like a double-edged sword.

242
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,240
Like you're getting a free drink,

243
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,840
but it probably just sucks shit.

244
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,760
Wait, I've never had a salty dog.

245
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,560
I was thinking of a rusty nail.

246
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,520
Rusty nail has drambuie in it,

247
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,360
which I think is some kind of sleep aid.

248
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
It's when I need to talk to.

249
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,280
I wasn't that alcohol and used to be medicine.

250
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,260
It is. It's still fairly recent.

251
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm using it medicinally right now because I'm going to make myself

252
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,920
go to sleep in a normal time.

253
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm going to use this like morning drinking for me.

254
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,920
That's what weed is for to me is to knock yourself out.

255
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
But you use it in the opposite.

256
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,420
I go insane on weed most nights. Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,960
Well, see, here's the thing, right?

258
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,720
is if I smoke weed, then I'm double dipping

259
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,640
because this is an excuse to drink beer.

260
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,360
If I smoke weed, that's just me doing it because I want to.

261
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
This is an obligation.

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,320
- I see, I see. - This is a job.

263
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,680
- You're at work right now. - This is your job.

264
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,280
- Right. - Yeah.

265
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,360
Well, we could do like a Rex smokes weed corner

266
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,560
where you just stand up and go over there

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
and you smoke weed on your band.

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,920
- I considered last week when I did not have a beer,

269
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,840
I considered smoking weed, but then I was like,

270
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,600
I know for a fact that we just have to delete the episode because it would be,

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
I would pretend that I would, I know exactly, I know myself too well.

272
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,600
I know that we would get 20 minutes in. I'd smoke weed five minutes in,

273
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,840
at 20 minutes in, I would start losing my mind.

274
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,080
Your face has just stopped making sense to me. Right.

275
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,360
And then I would pretend that I got a phone call from my mom,

276
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,320
even though I have a black screen on my phone and I would do a really terrible

277
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,080
act out where I say, no, my sister, my sister, I don't have a sister.

278
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,320
And then I would say, guys, I have to leave right now.

279
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
And then instead of hanging up,

280
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,600
I would just turn off my computer,

281
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,360
press the button on the tower,

282
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,920
and just hold it until, or I would maybe unplug it.

283
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
- Right.

284
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
- That's how scared I would get.

285
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,460
And I do that.

286
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,160
Basically, every night is a race that you smoke weed

287
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
and then you fall asleep before you get high.

288
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
Because otherwise, I'll stay up all night

289
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,080
if I don't have a looming physical and mental threat.

290
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,400
- You do that every night?

291
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,100
Not every night, but...

292
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,340
- Like six out of seven?

293
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,840
- Six out of seven nights a week.

294
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
(laughing)

295
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah.

296
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,040
- That's awesome, man.

297
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,640
- I watch YouTube videos to just fall asleep,

298
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,800
and it's really--

299
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
- Well, but I also watch YouTube videos.

300
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
I also watch a couple of YouTube videos, yeah.

301
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
- See, what you're doing is you're having your cake

302
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,600
and you're eating it too.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,760
You want everything in the world.

304
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
- And I eat a slice of cake every night

305
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,240
before I go to bed.

306
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,000
(laughing)

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
I'll admit it.

308
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,040
- Every time I smoke weed now,

309
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,080
I have to watch Rick and Morty.

310
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Otherwise, I lose the last--

311
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,600
- No, you did that with everything in your life.

312
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
You take a shower, you're like,

313
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,440
oh, I got some downtime.

314
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
I'm gonna watch Rick and Morty.

315
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,240
- Yeah, you just love Rick and Morty.

316
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
- No, I haven't watched Rick and Morty

317
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,840
since the allegations dropped.

318
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,600
It's kind of ruined my life that he did those things.

319
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,120
- Really? - Yeah.

320
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,960
- Really? - He's a moral watcher.

321
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,080
- Yeah. - Wow, I didn't know

322
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,720
that about you.

323
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,240
I honestly completely forgot about all that.

324
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,640
It wasn't intentional.

325
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,100
It was like I finished rewatching every episode

326
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,000
like two days before that happened.

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
- Oh, okay.

328
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
- Yeah.

329
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,480
No, I mean, it's not like I actually care.

330
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Come on.

331
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
- You care?

332
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,980
- No.

333
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,240
- You're basically a secret SJW

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,440
and you care about stuff like throwing women downstairs.

335
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,480
You think that's wrong?

336
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,720
'Cause you're an SJW.

337
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,560
- No, I think it's good.

338
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
I think it's good.

339
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,440
Don't say that about me.

340
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,880
- Didn't he hit a woman though?

341
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,240
- Yeah, he would just like.

342
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,560
I don't think he shot her.

343
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Speaking of shooting.

344
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
He cut her head off and her friend's head.

345
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
No, he would just search.

346
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,800
He would go on Twitter and search.

347
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,760
I'm a 16 year old girl on Twitter, and he would message every girl.

348
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,360
No, no, no. He used to be he was a birthday clown,

349
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,040
and then they found a bunch of bodies under his house.

350
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,500
And but he was like this.

351
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
He played this clown character.

352
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,840
And that's why I was so surprised.

353
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,400
No, he went to Paris.

354
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,140
So he went to Paris.

355
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,500
It's like Fashion Week event.

356
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,200
OK, he snuck up all the way to the top floor.

357
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Yeah. And he killed the producer, the main producer.

358
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
It's a woman producer.

359
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,200
Oh, he's also bald.

360
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,280
Completely unseen.

361
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,340
Charlie Hebdo, they drew that Mohammed picture and he went in there

362
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,940
and he just started busing shots at every single person in the building.

363
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,280
And he also did 9/11 or something like that.

365
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,820
Yeah. Anyways. And and he gave

366
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,800
and he created the greatest cartoon of all time.

367
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Yeah. Six seasons.

368
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
Can you imagine finding out that he gave Eve the apple, though?

369
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,600
That would fuck me up badly.

370
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,360
Yeah. But you know what?

371
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,700
Not my problem.

372
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,400
That would be crazy.

373
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,100
You ever seen Interdimensional Cable?

374
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,400
True. Yeah, that's what I would say.

375
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
That's what they're going to call me to the stand.

376
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,660
And his girl, his girlfriend's going to be there.

377
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,060
And she's so black and blue, she can't open her eyes.

378
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,460
And I'm going to say, objection.

379
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,820
Have you seen ants in your eyes, Johnson?

380
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
Are you in the audience?

381
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,300
Yes.

382
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,260
Okay.

383
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,900
But I do a full object.

384
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,700
I'm a character witness.

385
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,600
Yeah.

386
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,740
Because I witness, I tell them about every one of my favorite characters on Rick and Morty.

387
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,200
I witnessed the TV show.

388
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,080
The president is funny as a motherfucker.

389
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Okay.

390
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,440
He even kisses on that show.

391
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,180
And plus Mr. Meeseeks.

392
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,380
Oh my goodness.

393
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,820
And Mr. Poopybutthole.

394
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,060
Where does this guy come up with these crass names?

395
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,760
So that's enough for my character witness.

396
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,920
Yep, and then they would probably it would honestly probably stone

397
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,760
the woman to death for sure, and she would deserve it.

398
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,120
Yeah, exactly. Because they would be so upset that she dare go against.

399
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,220
What's another guy from that show?

400
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,120
Birdman Rick Bird.

401
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,060
Yeah, Birdman.

402
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Birdman.

403
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,480
Isn't Birdman going out with a high schooler?

404
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,080
Yes. No fake high schooler.

405
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,360
OK, we're not going to go.

406
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,780
We're not going to do the talking dead about Rick and Morty right now.

407
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,460
I don't want to do it.

408
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,160
I just want to ask this question.

409
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,100
Who is your ideal casting choice to replace Justin

410
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,500
Roiland as the voice of Ricky Jackson?

411
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Just just to be very great choices.

412
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,040
Yeah, I think they should do Tracy Morgan again.

413
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,100
Tracy Morgan be great way again.

414
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,280
He did that for squid billies when the.

415
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,680
Oh, yeah.

416
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,480
Early was racist on Facebook.

417
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,740
That would be so funny if they got him for Rick and Morty.

418
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
And he just doesn't.

419
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,540
He's still doing the Tracy Morgan voice for both characters.

420
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,740
God, no different.

421
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,540
No different.

422
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,180
And then they stopped writing them as different people even.

423
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,480
Yeah, there's just one just basically like twin comedy stand up.

424
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,440
Yeah, it'd be perfect.

425
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,880
Yeah, we got to go to the poop universe.

426
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
OK.

427
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
You disagree.

428
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,940
They start agreeing about everything.

429
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,680
Perfect.

430
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,160
- That sounds like an awesome show.

431
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,520
- It would be perfect.

432
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,500
- I would love to watch it,

433
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,520
but "Cancel Culture" just ended the show

434
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,840
after seven seasons on air.

435
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
- No, it's coming back, dude.

436
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,240
- That kills me. - It got canceled.

437
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,120
- It's back. - No, it didn't.

438
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,560
They're bringing it, they're redoing it, man.

439
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,120
- Yeah, they're gonna redo every episode

440
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
with a different guy.

441
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,680
- They're gonna go back and they're gonna dub over him.

442
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,760
- They're gonna make every character a woman

443
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,120
and it's gonna be called...

444
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,880
- What's it gonna be called?

445
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
You better stop.

446
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,680
(laughs)

447
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,080
- Mary and Ricky.

448
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,160
- Still Ricky?

449
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
- But like R-I-C-K-I.

450
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,800
- Oh, okay, like Ricky Lindholm.

451
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
- Yeah.

452
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,460
- Yeah.

453
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,360
- Ricky and Mary, that's the new guys.

454
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,200
- Okay.

455
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
- But they're girls.

456
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,520
- But they're girls now.

457
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,560
- Yep.

458
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,000
- They have pussies and they're always like,

459
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,520
"Oh, my pussy hurts."

460
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,520
- Oh, come on, why does it have to be about somebody's pussy?

461
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,040
- That's what they have.

462
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,880
How many episodes of Rick and Morty have they gone?

463
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,040
Oh, my fucking cock and balls hurt.

464
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
There's literally five.

465
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah, it's like not that many.

466
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,880
There's one. Why would they if they did a gender switch version?

467
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,160
Why would they just rehash the same shit of, oh, my fucking pussy hurts.

468
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,520
I mean, I think it's a good show.

469
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
It'd be funny. No, no, no.

470
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,680
They would go to the even says at the end of the episode, you ever watch to the end

471
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,520
the credits, get the little teaser for the next episode,

472
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,640
and they say, "It's a good show."

473
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,640
- The idea of a female teaser is driving me completely loco.

474
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,560
- And do you believe him?

475
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,400
- I'm gonna scratch my head.

476
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
- I agree with everything I hear.

477
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,400
- Skin off.

478
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,940
- So if someone tells me it's a good show,

479
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm gonna believe them.

480
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,600
- Yes it is.

481
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,440
- Wait, you're right.

482
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,160
- My TV tells me everything I need to know.

483
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,000
- That's true.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,380
I hope they do another child incest episode.

485
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,400
- What's up with that?

486
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,260
I don't think you realize what the fuck you just said,

487
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,100
motherfucker.

488
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,420
Child incest, you just said that.

489
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,620
And you said you like that kind of shit.

490
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,660
- Wait, I hope they don't do that.

491
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,860
That's what I said.

492
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,060
- That's what I like to hear in a better way.

493
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,580
- I hope they don't not do that.

494
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,140
- I honestly just like when they,

495
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,600
I like when people get their heads cut off in the show.

496
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,140
I don't care about any of the jokes.

497
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,780
I really like that there's blood all the time.

498
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,660
And if they could be a full show of blood and farts,

499
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,000
kind of doing a yin yang symbol,

500
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,660
and that guy's funny voice,

501
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,100
or Tracy Morgan's funnier voice,

502
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,660
that would be fine by me.

503
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,860
That'd be completely fine with me.

504
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,620
- It's the perfect sensory overload show,

505
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,860
because it's got all the, you know,

506
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,680
crap you wanna see visually.

507
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,100
It's got lasers, it's got blood.

508
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
- It's Cocoa Melon.

509
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,260
It is Cocoa Melon for 29 year olds.

510
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,020
- Right, it's Cocoa Melon for adults who smoke weed.

511
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,540
- Yeah, and I'm fine with that.

512
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,380
- Yeah, that's what I want.

513
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,820
- Do they stop trying to make it like a edgy,

514
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,820
funny kid BoJack Horseman, like the first couple seasons?

515
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,940
- I have not seen anything past, I think,

516
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
the first season of BoJack Horseman.

517
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,620
- Well, the thing is, he's just like a sad guy.

518
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,860
- I thought he was a horse.

519
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,700
- Yeah, he's a horse.

520
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,180
- He's a sad guy horse.

521
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,620
- But it's way more that he's a horse

522
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,240
than that he's sad, right?

523
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,440
- Well, that's the funny part, that he's a horse.

524
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,260
That's why they don't write any jokes for him

525
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,440
because he's just a horse.

526
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,300
- Is that show still on or is it off now?

527
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,480
- It's over, they finished it.

528
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
- Oh, maybe I'll have to finish every single episode.

529
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,600
- I don't think you should.

530
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
- Just to make fun of it.

531
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,240
Maybe I'll have to.

532
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,680
- It's a really good show to do laundry to.

533
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,720
That's how I watched every single season.

534
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,240
- Awesome idea for next episode.

535
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,880
We all watch BoJack Horseman and we discuss

536
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,480
the entire show on the show.

537
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,200
Ain't nobody got time for that.

538
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Remember that?

539
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,300
(laughing)

540
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,260
How many episodes is it, do you know?

541
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,400
(laughing)

542
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,240
10?

543
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I think it's like 400.

544
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,520
It's really long, I think,

545
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,400
'cause they made a bunch of 'em.

546
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,280
No.

547
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
Here's my problem, bro.

548
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,880
Paul F. Tompkins, you made bro a dog?

549
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,000
Bro, chill.

550
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah.

551
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,720
Why'd you make him a dog?

552
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,440
There's humans in the show.

553
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,880
Speaking of being a guy, have you heard the Gucci Mane song?

554
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,320
I'm a dog. No, no.

555
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,540
This is a line.

556
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
Sing it right now.

557
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,980
No, but there's a line in it where he goes, My girlfriend, 21.

558
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,240
And I know that's kind of young, but I only feed her crumbs.

559
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,820
What did he mean by that?

560
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,620
He's trying to keep her skinny.

561
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,980
Yeah, yeah, because he thinks it's the smaller she if she stays the same size,

562
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,140
then she'll be 21 forever. Yeah.

563
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:35,740
And he's right.

564
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,840
It's kind of young, but if I don't feed her anything,

565
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,100
she's going to stay 21 for the rest of her life pretty much.

566
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,500
True. Yeah.

567
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,980
How late, how old do you two want to live to be?

568
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,000
3000 years old.

569
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,600
30 years, thousand years old.

570
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Yeah, it sounded OK.

571
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,740
I heard you say 3000.

572
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,240
Julio, it really sounded like you were going to just say 30.

573
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,940
And I think you're 26.

574
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,880
I'm 27, I think.

575
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,040
How old are you?

576
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm 27.

577
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,900
So you're less than three years away

578
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,640
from what you think is like...

579
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I don't want to die.

580
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
You'll be good, ready to go.

581
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,180
What do you mean you want to die?

582
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,400
I said, how old do you want to live to?

583
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
You said 30.

584
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,640
I want to live to a...

585
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah, I want to make it to 30.

586
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,380
I'm sure you'll make, but that's like

587
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
the highest...

588
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,380
What is the life expectancy in Mexico?

589
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,980
Probably four, five maybe.

590
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,340
What is it like walking through Mexico

591
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,860
like a 3D platformer, just avoiding machetes

592
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,020
that are just right at neck level.

593
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,860
Oh, that's why you've survived so long,

594
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,220
'cause you're taller, so the machetes just hit you--

595
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,260
- It's right big in the shoulders.

596
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,340
- Right in the shoulder, you go, "Ow, fuck."

597
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,600
But it's not that big of a deal,

598
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,300
because it doesn't just chop your head off,

599
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,140
and the cartel guy goes--

600
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,700
- No, no, no, no. - Oh!

601
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,540
- We can't reach the eye.

602
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,220
- Yeah, and they get on each other's shoulders

603
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,140
and try to cut your head off.

604
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,200
- Listen, I told Rex this, but I think,

605
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,360
As soon as one of you makes it to me and visits me,

606
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,520
you're gonna change your whole tune,

607
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,480
and you're gonna be like, "You know what?

608
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,880
"Mexico's the best country in the world."

609
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
- Yeah, I'll change my tune.

610
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,440
Yeah, it's like, (imitates trumpet)

611
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,120
Nah, I'm kidding though.

612
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,760
- My throat will be cut, my voice will change.

613
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
- Yeah. - That's not true.

614
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,040
- I'll change my tune 'cause it'll just be,

615
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,280
(gasps)

616
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,240
coming out of an open throat hole.

617
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
(laughing)

618
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,360
My exposed trachea.

619
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,720
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.

620
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,800
You guys are gonna eat the most delicious food.

621
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
- You know what that sounds like?

622
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,580
A cartel trap.

623
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,420
- It was the opening. - Nothing's gonna happen.

624
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,240
- The cartel killed those guys and then they apologized.

625
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,600
They were like, "Yep, black guys."

626
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,560
- Is that what happened?

627
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,400
- Yeah. - The recent--

628
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,640
- Yeah, they did.

629
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,440
- The four people from Houston who went missing?

630
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,840
- So the funny thing is--

631
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
- Who were they looking for?

632
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
- Some Haitians or some shit.

633
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,620
- They were looking for me.

634
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,760
I get it.

635
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,840
So that shit happened and then as soon as it happened,

636
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,160
like Cam texted me like,

637
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,620
oh, it's so funny how you keep telling me and Pat

638
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,120
that we should just like some medical tourism,

639
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,160
which is, I still think they should do.

640
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,560
But they just killed these four guys or whatever.

641
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,960
And I was like, I don't,

642
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,180
that's a different part of the country.

643
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,920
I'm like, that's not under my jurisdiction.

644
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,640
I can't save those tourists.

645
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,980
I can save you guys.

646
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,320
- Okay, so if the cartel pulled up AK-47s, bazookas,

647
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,080
just straight up grenades.

648
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,480
You, if they pull up to your house

649
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
and try to take away Cam and Pat,

650
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
you would stop them.

651
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,040
- Yeah, I would stop them with the power of friendship.

652
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,400
- I don't think that they believe in that shit.

653
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,920
- I would teach them about money laundering.

654
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,040
- Yeah.

655
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
- I'd become their court judge.

656
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,240
- I think, yeah, Rex would be a good asset.

657
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,080
- Yeah.

658
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,160
- It's all about being a good asset to the cartel.

659
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,080
- I believe full-heartedly that if I was captured

660
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,280
by the cartel, I could befriend them,

661
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,560
with my knowledge.

662
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,160
- That would be so sick.

663
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,060
That'd be so fucking sick.

664
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
- Yeah.

665
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,860
- Do white men can't jump.

666
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,280
- Right, white men can't jump

667
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,360
for helping the cartel launder drug money.

668
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,260
- Yeah, well no, maybe just straight up white men can't jump

669
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,600
and you're just doing moves with a human head

670
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,260
and just like fucking fade away threes into a basket.

671
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,720
- They're like, "Yep, you gotta cut this guy's head off

672
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,100
from all the way across the court."

673
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,100
A half-court decapitation.

674
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,100
You know what, I never watched any of those ISIS beheadings or the cartel beheadings.

675
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Why?

676
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I think that's because I really don't like violence.

677
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
I hate violence and I hate death.

678
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Didn't we just talk about how you love seeing people's heads cut off like ten minutes ago?

679
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I like toons getting heads cut off.

680
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,100
I like happy tree friends because I don't think toons should be around whatsoever.

681
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,640
human beings that have,

682
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,860
that could be distantly related to me.

683
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
I really hate seeing them suffer.

684
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,100
- So, what ever happened to Happy Tree Friends?

685
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,040
Who made that disgusting show?

686
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,420
- Well, they had, they,

687
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,580
who did, whoever made that was just sick.

688
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,420
- Yeah, they were ahead of their time.

689
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,540
- They were sick.

690
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,580
They were sick, if you ask me.

691
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,780
- Yeah, they were dope.

692
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,620
I agree.

693
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,220
- No, no, no, no, they were wrong.

694
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,180
That used to scare the shit out of me when I was a kid.

695
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,660
That's probably why I don't like gore videos.

696
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,300
It was funny how there was always like the one guy who was just like an army vet,

697
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,860
and it would just like loose it and kill everyone.

698
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,300
And that was like literally like every, if not most episodes.

699
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,540
I think that show blends together in my head with Codenamed Kids Next Door.

700
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,020
That is the craziest shit I've ever heard.

701
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,220
Because Codenamed Kids Next Door was actually about two by four technology.

702
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,740
And Tappetree Friends was about decapitating children squirrels.

703
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,340
Yeah, that is so crazy.

704
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,820
There's not even animals.

705
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,100
That's not true.

706
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
I don't know what to do.

707
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,440
I had an era of psychosis as a child

708
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,520
where I fully believed that code name Kids Next Door was real.

709
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,460
And I thought that there was a tree stump in my backyard

710
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,380
that if I stood on it the right way, it would suck me to end into a layer.

711
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,860
No, that's why you became out of it.

712
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,200
But my teacher, I did become number one.

713
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,260
Yeah, exactly.

714
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,700
I became a total number one.

715
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,900
No, you did number one.

716
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,360
I forget.

717
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,040
Juvia's the number four.

718
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes, yes, fully number four.

719
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,500
And you are the Asian girl.

720
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,240
You're number three.

721
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,880
OK, with your sleeves or maybe five, I don't remember.

722
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,540
I think I think that is the black girl.

723
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,120
Yeah. Number four is the black girl.

724
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,980
Number five is a black girl.

725
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,180
Get out of town.

726
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,580
Number four is the no force, the blonde kid.

727
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,020
That's like cool.

728
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,720
No, you know, that's completely true.

729
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,560
Google it right now.

730
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,300
It was back to the Australian.

731
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,100
You were right. That is number four.

732
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,360
No. Yeah.

733
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,700
Number four is the cool number.

734
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,540
Number four is the Australian boy of kids next door sector.

735
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,040
He has close friends with Hoagie and he has a crush on his teammate Kuki.

736
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,000
It's Kuki three.

737
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,740
Kuki is three and number two is the fat one who I forgot.

738
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,380
Number three is the one that I was thinking about.

739
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,180
The girl with the green shirt.

740
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,580
Yeah. Green shirt. Long sleeves.

741
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,020
Yeah, I was really much in love with her at the time in my life,

742
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,780
but no longer.

743
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,020
I remember what was like Power Rangers pretty much.

744
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,220
just like was that like Power Rangers?

745
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,980
Yes, it's the same show.

746
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,620
Was that like Power Rangers?

747
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,380
Did they fight monsters?

748
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,580
Yes, motherfucker.

749
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,620
But OK, you remember Power Rangers?

750
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,420
What they fight in Power Rangers?

751
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,980
Robot aliens.

752
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,340
What they're fighting?

753
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,300
Codenames kids next door.

754
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,180
Probably adults.

755
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I don't remember.

756
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,060
Adults ended at 1.6 other children

757
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,340
who were tied together as a six

758
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,180
person twins.

759
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,140
I remember that.

760
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,980
- That was weird.

761
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,800
- Called The Kids,

762
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,340
or I don't remember what they were called.

763
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,180
But they were probably--

764
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,420
(laughing)

765
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:02,260
Some kind of The Kids thing.

766
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,500
So I bet now you got a little bit

767
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,620
of a TV Tropes education from me.

768
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,820
- Thank you.

769
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,660
- Yeah, you're welcome.

770
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,580
- I came up, nope, I still don't know anything

771
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,420
about the show.

772
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,020
I forgot completely about the show.

773
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,360
Eddie and Eddie, that's basically the Power Rangers too.

774
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,200
- I love that show. - Eddie and Eddie,

775
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,660
that's basically us. - That's not true.

776
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,160
- That is true.

777
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm Double D. - Yeah, and we're just--

778
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,420
- And I'm Double D, wait.

779
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,960
You think you're Double D?

780
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,920
- I'm obviously Double D.

781
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,760
You're Eddie.

782
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,200
- I would heavily disagree with you.

783
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,620
- You're Eddie. - You, wait, okay.

784
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,900
We can say this. - You're completely Eddie.

785
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,960
- I'll be Eddie, you be Double D,

786
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Jubio's Plank. - Just go with it.

787
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,560
(laughing)

788
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,600
- Yeah. - No.

789
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,960
You are the piece of wood with kind of an eternal forced smile

790
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
right on your face in blue crayon.

791
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,880
You're the Welsh kid that tries to eat goats.

792
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,080
The Welsh? You think he's Welsh?

793
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,560
He's Scottish, isn't he?

794
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,600
Is he? I don't know.

795
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
-Wolf? -Wolf?

796
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
I watched it in Spanish.

797
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,320
Oh, true.

798
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,920
-So he's eating weird stuff. -I don't think he was Scottish.

799
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,320
I think he was Middle Eastern.

800
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,160
-No. -Yes.

801
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,480
- Go look up a picture of him right now.

802
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,320
Rolf.

803
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,880
Ed, Ed and Eddie, he's definitely Middle Eastern.

804
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,160
- Drinking, just drinking, just mixed drinks.

805
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,920
- He's an immigrant from a far and distant culture

806
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,980
known to us only as the old country.

807
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,240
He's Borat.

808
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,400
That's what he is, he's a hunter.

809
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,240
- He is Borat.

810
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
- He's Borat, dude.

811
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,920
- What an awesome show.

812
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,400
- What's another cartoon that we can Google right now?

813
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,760
- Another cartoon?

814
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
- You know which one I liked a lot?

815
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,480
I liked Billy and Mandy.

816
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,060
- Billy and Mandy was, did you ever watch,

817
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,060
what was the one before Billy and Mandy

818
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,560
that had the Grim Reaper in it?

819
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,340
You remember what I'm saying?

820
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,480
Grim and Evil? - No.

821
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,540
- Mm, I don't think that was before Billy and Mandy.

822
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,880
- Yeah, it was.

823
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,720
- What is that?

824
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,320
- You don't remember Grim and Evil?

825
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,200
- I have no idea what that is now.

826
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,660
- Well, it basically came out in 2001.

827
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:17,980
And they were eventually spun off into their own series, Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy

828
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,700
and Evil Con Carne.

829
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,620
Evil Con Carne, let's be real guys, flop.

830
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Giant flop.

831
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,620
I don't even worry about that.

832
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,380
Yeah, but Billy and Mandy, they had everything.

833
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,420
They were on top of the world at one point.

834
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,500
Billy was basically unstoppable.

835
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,140
Mandy was like a classic bitch.

836
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,460
Yeah, true.

837
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,940
They make Mandy a hundred times a year now.

838
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:45,820
what Wednesday is. Wednesday is just true. Mandy. Aubrey Plaza ripped her whole

839
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:51,960
shit from Mandy. Yep, that's true. And some say that that Patrick ripped his whole

840
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,440
shit from Billy. I would never say that about him. Yep. Do you think Patrick and

841
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,840
Cameron listen to these? No, no chance. I think they do. No, I don't think so. I

842
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,840
I think Pat does.

843
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
That's cute.

844
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
He's listening right now.

845
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Well, that's fine because we...

846
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
Well, you banished both of them.

847
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Did I banish them? I don't remember that.

848
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
You took an official decree, I think...

849
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
I don't know if it was on the stream or on a meeting,

850
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
where you said,

851
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
"Cam and Pat are never allowed to come on the show."

852
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
Oh, yeah, they're never allowed to come on the show.

853
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
No doubt.

854
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Yeah, so they're completely banished from the show.

855
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Yeah.

856
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
So I don't think Cam would...

857
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
I think Cam doesn't care.

858
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
He would respect that.

859
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
He would respect that also, that boundary that I've set.

860
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,760
that I've said of this is a man, this is a men's space.

861
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Yeah.

862
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,120
But Pat, I think you setting that boundary would make Pat want to listen to it.

863
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Exactly.

864
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
He's such a, oh, he's a boundary pusher.

865
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,160
I think if one person on like the Discord on Twitter just messaged him and was like,

866
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,080
"Yo Pat, they talked about you on Bruce Willis," he would listen to all five episodes in a

867
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
single day.

868
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
That's okay.

869
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Yeah, I mean, what else does he have to do?

870
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Get hit by a car.

871
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
He will die by a car.

872
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
It only takes like 10, 15 seconds.

873
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,360
It only takes like 10-15 seconds.

874
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,360
You got your whole day ahead of you after that.

875
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah, he's got a personal assistant.

876
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,840
It's like, Patrick, we have a car hitting scheduled for about 10-15.

877
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,600
Can I talk to you guys about my diet that I've been doing that I'm too scared to talk

878
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,960
about on the normal show because I think too many people hear it?

879
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,160
I've been doing a diet.

880
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Okay.

881
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Where I eat only.

882
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm sorry.

883
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
It was a joke.

884
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,160
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

885
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,160
You're ruining the reveal, dude.

886
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Yeah, by fucking guessing it instantly.

887
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,160
No, I only eat fruit,

888
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,160
veg, as my brothers across the pond might call it.

889
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,160
I call it vegetables, but they may say veg.

890
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,160
And red meat. That's all I've been eating for three days.

891
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
That sounds fine.

892
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
And how do you feel?

893
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Here's the fucked up part.

894
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
That's a stupid diet.

895
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:03,080
A lot of people do this diet and they start selling pills on Instagram and they have brown

896
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
white bodies.

897
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,620
They're white people who have completely brown bodies and they say it's completely because

898
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,840
of the meat that I've been eating.

899
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,680
So the horrible thing about this is that I don't know that I've felt better in my life

900
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,920
in the past three days that I've been eating just meat, fruit and veg.

901
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
I can't believe it.

902
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
It sounds really healthy.

903
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Healthy diet.

904
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Yeah, I don't know what's...

905
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
It sucks.

906
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Yeah.

907
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
It sucks.

908
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
That's a normal diet.

909
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,600
The only difference is that there's no bread and cheese, which I know as a mouse is like

910
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,080
got to be really hard for you, but...

911
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,360
You're not eating any cheese?

912
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:45,040
Yo, I would be lying if I didn't say that I had one tablespoon of blue cheese today.

913
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
I had one tablespoon of blue cheese in my salad.

914
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,360
Isn't that just keto?

915
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,040
Isn't that what keto is?

916
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,600
I never learned what keto is.

917
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,480
I thought keto paleo carnivore were all the exact same thing.

918
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,280
I thought they were the same thing as vegan.

919
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,640
What's keto?

920
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,380
Me, you know what I've eaten past day?

921
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,180
What?

922
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,820
I'm going to write it down.

923
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,020
Hit me.

924
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,680
Handful of peanut butter pretzels.

925
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,600
Six freezer burned meatballs.

926
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,960
Is that the brand?

927
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,500
No.

928
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,840
Just found them in the back of the freezer.

929
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,500
Okay, Rex's personal brand to I would lowkey believe that monsters.

930
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,980
Two of them.

931
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,480
Okay.

932
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,580
A coffee and a diet Coke.

933
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,220
You ate two whole monsters.

934
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,980
I did.

935
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,820
It wasn't in a single day.

936
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,220
Were they

937
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,920
about the size of this can?

938
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,060
I would barely call it a monster.

939
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Yeah.

940
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,520
More like a critter.

941
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,760
So I got a brown sugar pop tart.

942
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,460
That's gotta be one of that's gotta be the worst diet I've ever

943
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,900
heard anybody say.

944
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,060
And also not that's the kind of diet that I can't believe you

945
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,740
remembered it beat by beat.

946
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,320
Yeah, like it's you really only remember the good diets like

947
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,420
that. You should have said what I've been eating the last few

948
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
days, whatever.

949
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,900
I don't remember. Who cares?

950
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,500
You also you live in a place where there's like a million

951
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,700
people who would just come to your house and give you an

952
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,300
influencer.

953
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,660
I'm not rich.

954
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,260
You're rich enough that you can eat like broccoli and grilled chicken every meal.

955
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,260
You can have a slave that delivers you a healthy meal once a day.

956
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
No, I can't.

957
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Yes, you can. What do you mean you can't?

958
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,260
I was. You know, I go to the grocery store, I buy a bunch of

959
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,260
brussel sprouts and chicken, things like that, and I eat that.

960
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,260
And then I run out of that, and it just becomes chaos.

961
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,260
Get what you can get.

962
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,600
Kettle corn, boogers off the wall.

963
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yep.

964
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Just keep going, just eating whatever.

965
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Yeah.

966
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,600
I've been there, man.

967
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Just licking the inside of a beef jerky bag.

968
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,600
See, and if you can get some of those little specks, where you're like, "I don't know if

969
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:07,200
this is like silica stuff, like gel, or if this is actual beef."

970
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I think that I permanently destroyed my gut microbiome by being the worst version of a

971
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,700
a vegan for until I was 17.

972
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,060
I just ate mustard and bread until I was 17 years old.

973
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,860
Never once in a while I'd have an avocado.

974
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,100
I'd be like, well, that's that was spinach.

975
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,700
Yeah, I have been shitting

976
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,600
so bad my ass.

977
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,500
Let's talk about it.

978
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,600
Your ass burns all the time.

979
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,860
It hurts. It hurts. Yeah.

980
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,200
And because and it's partially because I'm in there

981
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,700
after taking a shit four times a day,

982
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,040
full blast bidet on my hole.

983
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,140
Just the strongest jet of water.

984
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,480
OK, I would like anybody listening to go back, I think two episodes

985
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,920
and hear how these goons laughed at me when I said that I,

986
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,180
every once in a while, would stick my entire finger up my asshole.

987
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,320
And this guy,

988
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,500
this guy, by the way, this guy, his own finger isn't enough.

989
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,760
He needs an element that goes into his asshole.

990
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,600
That's what he needs.

991
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,120
- We already talked about how you need a bidet.

992
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,320
You would actually, after you told us about the finger

993
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,160
and the ass, I think you would really enjoy it.

994
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,440
- If you saw my ass, you would not be saying anything

995
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
about a bidet.

996
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,920
You'd say, actually, it needs more shit on it.

997
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,160
That's how clean it is.

998
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,640
- Okay, now walk us through your ass cleaning technique.

999
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,480
- Yeah. - Okay.

1000
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,600
I take five baths a day, right?

1001
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,360
One after every single shit.

1002
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,560
And with my face under the water,

1003
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,560
I viciously scrub my ass with steel wool to get all of the poop

1004
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,860
particulate away and floating around that pool.

1005
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,020
But it's out. It's it's balanced out because I put Epsom salt in it.

1006
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,500
So then I'm in there.

1007
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,520
And then while I'm in there, I'm training to become the first person

1008
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,700
to be able to breathe underwater.

1009
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,020
So I'm inhaling every single one of these poop particulates

1010
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,620
because I think that it might make me stronger.

1011
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,120
And you're right.

1012
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,820
OK, you are becoming stronger.

1013
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,860
Look at you. I know.

1014
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,300
I was a little flexed today.

1015
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,100
Buddy, I have a...

1016
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
I have a...

1017
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,760
Actually, you know what? Never mind.

1018
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,380
This is how ripped I'm getting.

1019
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,100
This is the color of my skin now.

1020
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,220
This is just purely my skin.

1021
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,060
I don't have anything on. I'm shirtless.

1022
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,560
What's that on your chest right there?

1023
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,280
That's a new tattoo that I got.

1024
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,140
What does it say?

1025
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,320
It says, "Port City Tattoo, Port City."

1026
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,940
That's in Wilmington, North Carolina.

1027
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,280
Mm-hmm.

1028
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,900
Okay.

1029
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Because I put "Port City" and I was like,

1030
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
"Well, I want people to know it's a tattoo."

1031
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,120
So I put "tattoo" underneath it.

1032
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,620
Okay, is there anything on the back?

1033
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,120
On your back?

1034
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Yeah, there's a giant eye.

1035
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
That's dope.

1036
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,120
A couple months ago I was in Chicago

1037
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,120
doing stand-up and I got off stage

1038
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,120
and I was wearing this sweatshirt

1039
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,620
and this lady came up to me.

1040
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,620
She's the drunkest I've ever seen somebody be at a comedy show.

1041
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,620
And she grabbed my ears.

1042
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
Like grabbed my head like this and went,

1043
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,620
"Do you like Tool?"

1044
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,340
And I was like, yeah, I like tool. This is how,

1045
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,720
if a woman hurts me in public, I won't do, I can't do it. I won't do anything.

1046
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,540
And why would you, I really will just sit there and I'll take,

1047
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,740
like a woman can abuse me on the train or whatever.

1048
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,940
She can yell straight in my face. She can throw things at me.

1049
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,900
And it really scares me the idea that I would ever react at all. Yeah.

1050
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,180
I just sat there and she screamed in my face. She said, do you like tool?

1051
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:34,580
And I, she's holding my ears and I go, uh, yeah,

1052
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,020
"Oh yeah, I like Tool."

1053
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,700
And she was like--

1054
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,540
With a smile?

1055
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,780
Yeah, I was like, "Oh yeah, I actually do like Tool, yeah."

1056
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,100
And then she was like, "Good."

1057
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,700
And then she kinda like threw my head away from her face.

1058
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,940
She was like, "Because your shirt

1059
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,660
"reminds me of a Tool album cover."

1060
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,880
And that was the shirt?

1061
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,740
It was this one that I have on right now.

1062
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,940
And it doesn't look anything like a Tool album cover.

1063
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,360
But I think it was more that she saw me on stage

1064
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,800
She saw my big ears come out of the side of my bald head.

1065
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,960
And she said, I need to grab those and try this face like a steering wheel.

1066
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,520
And so she did.

1067
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,800
That was the first thing that she could think of.

1068
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,860
Yeah, she was like, yeah, he probably likes to.

1069
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,720
It doesn't matter what she says at all.

1070
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,500
Yeah. You'd remember it no matter what.

1071
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,660
Mm hmm. She could ask you how your day was. Exactly.

1072
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,260
Tools, tools, dope.

1073
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,820
I got into tool way too late in life.

1074
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,820
I got into Tool three years ago and I was babysitting.

1075
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:40,220
The last one, really?

1076
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Fear Inoculum, huh?

1077
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Yeah.

1078
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:48,420
It's better than people say it is, I'll say that much, but I don't want to get too controversial.

1079
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,100
I like that album a lot.

1080
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,900
I got into Tool and I was babysitting these...

1081
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I was...

1082
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
I was...

1083
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,060
I would, like, nanny these kids who were, like, really rich and they would go to, like...

1084
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,300
I'd, like, drive one to fencing all the time.

1085
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,700
But I kind of took it on myself to, like...

1086
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,820
Because these kids just had the most busted home life.

1087
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,140
Like their dad is just, like, the biggest wimp in the world and their mom is, like...

1088
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,020
Their mom had a full mustache.

1089
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,780
I swear to God, she had, like...

1090
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Like the same level of mustache that I have right now.

1091
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:31,280
She was like a crunchy Massachusetts, like a rich hippie.

1092
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,280
And I was like, I need to show these kids one cool thing.

1093
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,280
And for whatever reason in my brain, I was like, this is perfect.

1094
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I'll play tool, like over our conversation, like really loudly over our conversations

1095
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,780
when I pick them up from fencing class.

1096
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,280
And I tried it three different times and every single time

1097
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,880
they told me to put on Happy by Pharrell instead.

1098
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,800
(laughing)

1099
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,480
'Cause that was their favorite song.

1100
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
- That's a good song.

1101
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,000
- And every single time I was like,

1102
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,080
"You know what, I actually wanna listen to Happy."

1103
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
That's a fucking dope song.

1104
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,000
- That is a dope song.

1105
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,040
Pharrell, that's a genius.

1106
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,880
- Yeah.

1107
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,120
Wait, where does he keep that big brain?

1108
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,200
- Probably in his big hat.

1109
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,040
- No!

1110
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,600
- He doesn't wear that anymore, I don't think.

1111
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,440
- That's why he hasn't been anything good since Happy.

1112
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,640
- He wears it every day at Stapledoo's head.

1113
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
- That's not true.

1114
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,080
- Okay, Mythbusters, shut the fuck up.

1115
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,920
- Yeah.

1116
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,500
- Wait, I wanna talk about,

1117
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,640
no, we're talking about morality earlier.

1118
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,880
I wanna talk about how Rex got banned off Twitter.

1119
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,240
- Oh, I did, I got banned.

1120
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,840
I'm currently serving a seven day ban.

1121
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,200
- You're banned for what?

1122
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,020
What did you do?

1123
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,480
I'm looking right now.

1124
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,880
- It's gone already, but--

1125
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,320
- Listen, do long story uncensored of what you said.

1126
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:58,700
I'm not gonna say what I know Jordan Peterson is back on Twitter this week

1127
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,240
okay you're already in the clear in my eyes yeah you I don't care if you called

1128
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,600
him the most despicable racial slur on earth he was posting some shit about

1129
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,880
like AI like he's asking like chat GPT to say good things about Donald Trump

1130
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,960
and then good things about Joe Biden it used more words to talk about Joe Biden

1131
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Oh God making some points about how this is like proof that it's woke AI or some shit.

1132
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Yeah, yeah, and then he at Elon Musk and Lex Fridman two smartest men in the world.

1133
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,960
He says, you know, like, you know, paging these two.

1134
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,960
What's a what's a rational minded person to think about all this?

1135
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:51,200
and I said that you are in r/fslr and Twitter immediately was like are you

1136
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,880
sure you want to send this tweet? And he said yes sir I do! I was like a hundred percent I know I'm in trouble for this.

1137
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,880
You're right I'm not sure I'm very sure let me click the green button right now.

1138
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,900
And like that it was like all right delete now. Wow and they gave you an

1139
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,460
- Instantly, within like 10 seconds I was serving a seven day.

1140
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,660
- I just remember I woke up, I think it was on a Tuesday or...

1141
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,660
- Oh yeah.

1142
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,900
- I woke up to four Discord messages from Rex, where his appeal being...

1143
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,900
- I appealed it.

1144
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,340
- You want to go through your appeal?

1145
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,700
- Yeah, I appealed it.

1146
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,700
So I sent this to Juby, I'll read it verbatim, give me a sec.

1147
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:41,500
So what I said was, you know, "I was suspended for seven days instantly for calling Jordan

1148
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,820
Peterson an r-slur f-slur.

1149
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,740
I understand this can be shocking language.

1150
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,420
However, Jordan Peterson is an advocate for free speech and I believe he would not like

1151
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,420
it if I was suspended.

1152
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:56,100
Just as I advocate for his right to spew things I disagree with, I think context matters."

1153
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
Completely true.

1154
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,060
- That's absolutely true.

1155
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,500
- I submitted that, and you'll never believe it,

1156
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,820
I was not immediately unsubmitted.

1157
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,660
- Context matters.

1158
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,260
That is a bold, bold defense, I'll say that much.

1159
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,340
- I'm right.

1160
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,900
I stand by that I'm right there.

1161
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,540
- I think you're right. - I think you are right.

1162
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,900
- But the context there is just that you think that,

1163
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,060
like, it's just that Jordan Peterson

1164
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,260
is exactly what you said he is.

1165
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,100
- Yeah.

1166
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,420
- Like, the context is like, oh, but if you look at it,

1167
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,900
I'm actually completely right about what I said.

1168
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,180
I should not have been...

1169
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,180
Obviously I get that you can't say that shit on Twitter anymore.

1170
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,860
Arsler, Efsler, whatever, you can't say either of those really.

1171
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,420
The issue I think was that he had tagged Elon Musk and therefore Elon Musk was tagged in

1172
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Arsler.

1173
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,620
Oh, everything always, yeah, just gets instantly...

1174
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,580
Even though it was not directed at Elon.

1175
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:56,740
I have no, you know, there's no love laws between Elon and I, but not directed at him.

1176
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,460
He has a beast.

1177
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,700
Yeah, Elon's dope, dude.

1178
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,380
Yeah, he would love our style.

1179
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,300
I honestly, the one I thought he was so whack until he fired every single person.

1180
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,340
Yeah, that shit's dope.

1181
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,940
That is so cool.

1182
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,380
I think the funniest one of those, one of those firings was the one, the woman that was like,

1183
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,260
captures like sleeping on our office, like,

1184
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,800
oh, yeah, I got to like put in the time or whatever if we want to steer the ship.

1185
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,000
And like two months later, she was fired and she was like, listen,

1186
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,160
I know I was fired, but I'm sure it was for a good reason.

1187
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,400
I would love to become Elon Musk and have you two as my like handlers

1188
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,020
to stop me from being retarded and I wouldn't do shit.

1189
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,100
This would be full devil and angel.

1190
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,720
This is like I'd be like, yeah, say the guy was gay

1191
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,320
because he was in a wheelchair.

1192
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,900
And that's why that was the fun.

1193
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,740
That was dope.

1194
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,780
That was like he was like, by the way, the guy was in a wheelchair.

1195
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,940
Yeah, he doesn't even fucking work.

1196
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,780
Oh, yeah. Good fucking fire.

1197
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,580
Yeah. Literally like won four awards for being the best guy in Iceland.

1198
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,820
The best guy in the entire country.

1199
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,780
He's like, no, you don't understand.

1200
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,620
His legs were not.

1201
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,020
They were not good legs. Yeah.

1202
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,980
So I like how he's like, oh, he says he can't work,

1203
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,780
but he won't stop treating me.

1204
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Yeah, I don't know.

1205
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,280
Yeah, you can just yell at your phone.

1206
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,520
I can tweet while I'm driving.

1207
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,620
In fact, I do.

1208
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,920
In fact, I do. Yeah, I scream at my phone.

1209
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,060
I have awful news about New York City,

1210
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,660
New York.

1211
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:34,160
They have stepped up the traffic patrol

1212
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,740
to what I would say is a CCP communist China level.

1213
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,140
No. OK.

1214
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,140
What do you mean?

1215
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,740
Somebody the other day, they dropped me off in front of my apartment, right?

1216
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,100
And you guys know I live right next to an intersection.

1217
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:59,580
So they drop me off, they pull into the intersection, and I see them instantly get pulled over, like

1218
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:06,100
literally 15 feet away from me, get pulled over by a tiny NYPD traffic car and get a

1219
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:12,020
$140 ticket for texting while driving because they were putting in their home coordinates.

1220
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:17,020
to their home planet on their phone.

1221
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,360
- Yeah.

1222
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,900
- While they were in the intersection.

1223
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,780
- That's so sad.

1224
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,140
- And I've heard three more stories like that this week.

1225
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,100
So I would like any NYC motorist to know, it's not safe.

1226
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,500
We used to think, oh yeah, it's fun.

1227
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,260
You go, you have 10, 12 drinks over in New Jersey,

1228
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,060
you can drive all the way back to Long Island

1229
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,580
and nobody's gonna bother you.

1230
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,900
The pigs are out, they smell blood.

1231
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:40,740
- Oh yeah.

1232
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,300
Cut the race arms.

1233
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,260
It's time. It's time.

1234
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:43,840
You know what it is?

1235
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,540
It's time to race them.

1236
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,880
Yeah. If the if the cops start following you, floor it.

1237
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,540
I'm going to erase them.

1238
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,380
I don't think that's right.

1239
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,120
Could you run?

1240
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,580
I don't think you can outrun the cops in the New York City cops.

1241
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,980
You can because they have they have smart cars.

1242
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,060
And I have a kick ass 2009 Ford Focus that has the

1243
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:05,820
has the hood zip tied down.

1244
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,020
Yeah. So I feel like after a few blocks,

1245
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,880
you'll just like end up like hitting,

1246
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,440
like there's a woman like spilling out her car

1247
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,160
in the weirdest way possible

1248
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,660
and you can't move for five minutes.

1249
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,920
- Well, that's the inevitable thing.

1250
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,240
You could absolutely do like a burnout paradise style.

1251
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,560
- That's what I was thinking is just like,

1252
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,160
- Jump through a billboard.

1253
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,000
- Anything you could say.

1254
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
- No, you could just fucking just run them off the road.

1255
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,040
Just, you know, have them go into like a stoplight.

1256
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,280
- Anything you could say,

1257
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
oh, what if this happens on the road?

1258
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,360
Buddy, I'll drift.

1259
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,200
- Yeah.

1260
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,260
of drifting because I'll just drift.

1261
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,760
I just destroy every billboard in the city.

1262
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,200
I do like driving like that complete shit.

1263
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,200
I love scoring it and just love being a traffic driving like shit,

1264
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,800
because it's awesome because you still can think you're a good driver

1265
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,840
for the rest of your life.

1266
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, I see it in in women when they drive and they like,

1267
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,640
like, dude, oh, my God, when

1268
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,540
when when wifey drives, oh, I am a

1269
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,520
I am a menace, bro.

1270
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,120
I'm saying, Mr.

1271
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,860
Turn signal.

1272
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,900
Right.

1273
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,760
I'm like, don't look at your phone.

1274
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,040
Look at the road.

1275
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,120
Oh, there's a pedestrian.

1276
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,920
The pedestrians, they have the right away.

1277
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,800
Dude, when I drive and she's not in there,

1278
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,480
man, I literally I'm not kidding.

1279
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,600
I've been on the highway and I've said I've said to myself,

1280
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,520
I've been like, I wonder how long I can drive with my eyes closed before it scares me.

1281
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,120
By the way, eight seconds, eight full seconds.

1282
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,580
Mississippi seconds.

1283
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,880
Damn. Before I went, Oh, I got to open these again.

1284
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,920
I used to be such a menace on the road, dude.

1285
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,800
Running red lights just the hell of it.

1286
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,220
I would go 100 plus miles an hour all the time.

1287
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,920
Cool car. I had a Lincoln LS.

1288
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh, look like a BMW.

1289
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,060
Fastest car ever.

1290
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,180
Yeah. What's your dream car?

1291
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,100
We keep talking.

1292
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,820
I'm going to go get my my Aperol Spritz. Um.

1293
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,520
I'm not sure.

1294
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,240
Yeah, I don't really have a dream car.

1295
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,640
I used to when I was a kid, I really liked like Jaguars

1296
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,440
because of like, there would be like some like racing game

1297
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,040
and like a PS2 game that my cousin had.

1298
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,680
But I got to like, I think I googled it and I think Jaguars

1299
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,080
are like notoriously bad to own.

1300
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,400
Yeah, when I when I was looking for cars, and I went to like

1301
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,560
this used car place, I got to sit in a Jaguar.

1302
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,360
It's like Revit and it was pretty cool.

1303
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,960
Like the car is like looks awesome or whatever,

1304
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,560
but I could tell that it was like it was going to be expensive to buy and like upkeep.

1305
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:53,660
Yeah, so I think just like I don't know like like an 86 maybe I would love to just have like a small sports car that I can just drive on the weekends.

1306
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,660
So for me this is this is a story.

1307
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:04,660
So when I was a kid, I was friends with this like there was like one kid in my neighborhood that had a PS2 and I would go to his house.

1308
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
like every day to play like Crash Bandicoot.

1309
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,660
'cause like my mom didn't let me have video games.

1310
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,540
They were too mature for my nine year old brain and.

1311
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:20,200
He like his parents opened a sushi restaurant that became

1312
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,600
like a huge like thing like they got like really rich from

1313
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,940
opening like a sushi chain.

1314
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,880
No boo.

1315
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,620
It's called raw and whoa.

1316
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,920
No, I know it's like local to Arizona.

1317
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:40,640
But I remember he like moved and then he was like neighbors with like like the

1318
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,160
pitcher for the Diamondbacks which is like Randy Johnson and then like his dad

1319
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:51,640
bought a Lotus Elise and I would see his dad driving around and to me that was like

1320
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:56,960
that's what making it is is when you can... That's a Lotus? Yeah like a Lotus you know

1321
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,920
just like a stupid sports car that only you drive. So that is kind of the dream

1322
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,800
right is to get a car that you don't allow anyone inside.

1323
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,160
That is sick.

1324
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:12,040
I saw today I saw a Maybach parked on my block

1325
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,300
and I had I don't think I've ever seen one in real life before,

1326
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,840
but I kind of was it was like parked in front of a Chase bank.

1327
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,980
And I was like, it was parallel parked.

1328
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,980
Of course, dude, pay for there's a parking lot

1329
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,240
like two blocks away. Go pay for a parking.

1330
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,920
I'm going to break into your car.

1331
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,520
Yeah, I should break into your car. Yeah.

1332
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,120
It was like it was like a 2003 Maybach, though.

1333
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,120
It's like not that good.

1334
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,720
Oh, not impressive at all.

1335
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,320
Yeah, it's like probably 100k or something.

1336
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,220
I love the I love the parallel parking situation in New York.

1337
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
But it's not.

1338
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,620
It's not good enough that it's impossible to find a spot

1339
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,960
that you can't even keep because the street sweeping.

1340
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,320
You also have to worry about every week.

1341
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,620
You also have to worry about every single driver in the city bumping,

1342
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,260
just hitting your car in the bumper.

1343
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,820
And so you have to buy special shields for it.

1344
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,860
Like for. Yeah.

1345
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,660
Oh yeah, the dino bumper and stuff like that.

1346
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,160
Yeah, the bumper bulldog.

1347
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,360
I think it's awesome, but I just accept it to that part

1348
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,860
where you have to buy armor for your car.

1349
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,960
I think it's cool, man.

1350
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,860
Yeah.

1351
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,860
I think it is cool.

1352
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,160
I just think it's really funny.

1353
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:24,160
I could buy a 2006 Maybach 57S for $69,000 in Miami, Florida.

1354
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,860
Yeah.

1355
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
Wait.

1356
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,460
And you know there's no rust on that.

1357
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,060
I have 1,500 bucks in my bank.

1358
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,060
That's a down payment.

1359
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,060
This is easy.

1360
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,060
It is crazy.

1361
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,060
And it's got that early GPS.

1362
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,060
Yeah.

1363
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,060
That has way too many buttons and a really tiny screen.

1364
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,060
And it doesn't work anymore.

1365
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,060
Yeah, exactly.

1366
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,060
It just stays in Miami, Florida for the rest of the car's life.

1367
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,060
Yeah, it's got like a red triangle with like a circle around it.

1368
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,060
That's so cool.

1369
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,060
You know what you should buy, Caleb?

1370
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,060
You should buy a Citroen AMI.

1371
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,060
I think that's what it's called.

1372
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,380
called. It's a micro car that's

1373
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,780
essentially just like a scooter.

1374
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,740
And I've been seeing so many videos

1375
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,420
about these like small cars just like

1376
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,740
flipped over.

1377
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,780
And like one of them was like in

1378
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,260
Monaco, just like drifting it and

1379
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,260
like falling over.

1380
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,920
And they're like so cheap

1381
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,580
and so small. People just like buy

1382
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,580
them just like you treated them like

1383
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,340
those like scooters that

1384
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,500
not sold in the United States.

1385
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,740
No, you can only buy it in France.

1386
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,500
That's all.

1387
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,220
I think I'm going to import one into Mexico and have it explode.

1388
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,220
How much does it cost?

1389
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,420
I think it's like less than $10,000.

1390
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,940
I think I'm going to buy, I really want to buy a Maverick.

1391
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,180
What's that?

1392
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:42,860
It's like one of those really, it's a Ford.

1393
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:49,260
It's like a really small pickup truck that like is made for guys who coach soccer teams.

1394
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,340
I know what you're talking about.

1395
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:50,940
Like the C10?

1396
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Wait, they discontinued it?

1397
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,740
No, they didn't.

1398
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,660
Well, maybe they did.

1399
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,680
But I really want one because they're like pretty cheap,

1400
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,780
but they're really shitty.

1401
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,640
And you can get them, you get like a new one for like $20,000,

1402
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,980
like a brand new one.

1403
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,940
That's you know, I found out in electric cars,

1404
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,180
they have a little speaker that like makes engine noise.

1405
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,540
Yeah, because like, yeah, they're silent.

1406
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:19,180
But like people need to feel when they're like pressing on the gas.

1407
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,440
Well, they also you need.

1408
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,680
Do they have an external speaker to know?

1409
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,920
No, just some of them do. Some of them do. But there's one like

1410
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,840
in the in the cabin. And it's funny to imagine some guys just

1411
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,120
being like,

1412
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,960
well, the funny thing about that is it's not only electric

1413
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,720
courses, like a lot of modern cars. I think when I was looking

1414
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,180
at cars, I was looking at the what's the the fucking the

1415
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,240
Volkswagen one that's like based on the Jetta. Oh, the GTI golf.

1416
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,420
Yeah, the the the the July. So you can buy buy one of those

1417
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,420
like brand new and it's like a nice looking car, whatever.

1418
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,300
But it has like exactly that for like,

1419
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,660
even for like a car with an engine that takes gas,

1420
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,580
it will pump in like fake engine noise into the cabin.

1421
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,180
So you don't think that you're driving like a--

1422
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,380
- That's adorable.

1423
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,940
That is so adorable.

1424
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,780
- Right?

1425
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,620
- Yeah.

1426
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,440
- That's literally putting a--

1427
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,280
- That's a feature for boomers.

1428
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,160
- You might as well put a soda can

1429
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,380
between the spokes of the car.

1430
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,220
- Literally.

1431
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,760
like a motorcycle.

1432
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,900
That is so fucking cool.

1433
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,940
- Yeah.

1434
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,780
It's so cool how fucking, that's like a brain parasite.

1435
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,740
- Yeah.

1436
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,420
Dude, I think I have to buy one of these,

1437
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,560
one of these Ford Mavericks.

1438
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,580
I would look so gangsta in this.

1439
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,420
- Yeah.

1440
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,820
- It's between for me.

1441
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,660
- You should get a skull tattoo.

1442
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,340
- I definitely need to buy a new car today.

1443
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,340
A skull tattoo?

1444
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,180
- Yeah.

1445
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,420
- Buddy, I have a skull tattoo.

1446
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,220
- This thing is huge. - On your head.

1447
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,260
- What the fuck?

1448
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,180
- That's dope though.

1449
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,300
- What, the Ford Maverick?

1450
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,980
The Maverick is, what the hell?

1451
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,820
These are biggest fucks.

1452
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,140
It's like a tiny version of a,

1453
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,300
it's smaller than an F-150.

1454
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,140
Oh.

1455
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,540
Yeah, that's why I want it.

1456
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,300
I might be looking at the wrong one

1457
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,140
because these are like double, double cabin.

1458
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,100
Maybe you're looking at the XL, XXL,

1459
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,420
or XLT or the Lariat.

1460
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,300
Yeah, I might be looking at the biggest car of all time.

1461
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,140
It's double cabin, it's a cruelly they call that.

1462
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,500
Or maybe that's a dually, I don't remember.

1463
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,940
No, dually's the double wheels.

1464
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,780
Yeah, dually's it.

1465
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,620
It's a cruelly, but it has the--

1466
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,940
Yeah, dually has two wheels.

1467
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:19,940
Dually, duels.

1468
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,940
Okay. Oh, okay.

1469
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,660
But it has the,

1470
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,820
it has a very short bed,

1471
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,780
I think, is where they cut the space.

1472
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,860
Because, listen,

1473
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,980
I'm going to be real with you.

1474
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,820
I'm not going to be walking around moving two by fours, right?

1475
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,220
I'm not in Codename Kids next door.

1476
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:35,140
I'm not trying to make a gun that shoots rubber bands.

1477
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,940
Yep.

1478
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,060
I just want to move,

1479
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,740
I want to go and do 500 Uber Eats orders at once.

1480
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,620
And make 60 bucks

1481
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:46,460
in 14 hours and then go to sleep.

1482
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,620
You know?

1483
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,020
That's, you know what, what that is, that's perfect dog space.

1484
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:54,620
I would yeah, exactly. Just put the dog in there. He immediately

1485
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:54,980
jumps.

1486
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:03,180
I, I did see a video earlier today about a guy where he was

1487
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:06,740
like, you may have seen this. It's this like, model dude, this

1488
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:10,220
like really good looking like middle aged black dude who is

1489
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:15,580
like, he was talking about the least money he's ever made in a

1490
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:19,420
year was $100,000. And he was like, I had,

1491
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:24,920
I had four jobs and one of them was, I was like a fitness trainer,

1492
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,620
a tutor, a, uh,

1493
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,180
restaurant manager on the weekends and an Uber Eats driver in every spare moment

1494
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,920
I had. And I did have a moment yesterday where I was like, man,

1495
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:39,920
maybe I need to start just driving Uber Eats right now and just fucking crushing

1496
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,260
it, making six bucks an hour. Yeah. I tried,

1497
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,980
I did it one time in college, I did Postmates, but I activated it and then I got

1498
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,340
one order and I got way too nervous and I just turned off my phone.

1499
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,300
I did it for a little bit when I didn't have a job. Yeah. Yeah.

1500
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,980
They send you a Postmates credit card and then they send you the bag.

1501
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,940
I have the bag sitting in my car. I have the bag sitting in the back of my car.

1502
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,180
It was fine. I mean, that's what it is. Everyone in my house did it.

1503
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,940
So I was like, well, I'll just do it.

1504
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,220
Every once in a while I get one of those like TikToks where it's a guy just like

1505
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:20,340
doing like DoorDash, like some city in Texas for like a full 10 hours.

1506
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,340
Yeah.

1507
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,380
And be like, "Oh, I made like 500 bucks," or whatever.

1508
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:30,100
And I'm like, "Dude, I need to move to the US illegally and do this right now."

1509
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,060
I felt it not even like, there's no reason that I need the money.

1510
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,260
I just honestly was like, "Maybe I'm not grinding hard enough right now.

1511
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,620
Maybe I need to be doing construction during the day and doing Uber Eats at night."

1512
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:43,620
I mean, you're doing the

1513
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,780
show, the equivalent of that,

1514
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,540
which is doing two podcasts a week.

1515
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:51,340
It does like I got the fuck of truth.

1516
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,380
I'm waiting more than that, actually.

1517
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,380
I am hurting.

1518
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,420
No, I see.

1519
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,260
Now you guys are starting to get it right.

1520
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,340
How so?

1521
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,720
We're five weeks into this.

1522
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,920
How hard is this?

1523
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,720
It's hard.

1524
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,380
It's hard.

1525
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:02,960
It's hard.

1526
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,140
It's fucking hard.

1527
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,720
It's hard because I have a full time job to also.

1528
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,640
I also have no.

1529
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,600
I also have a job.

1530
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,300
Sort of.

1531
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:13,800
No, it's not either of those.

1532
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:19,300
It's hard because it's exhausting physically and emotionally and mentally exhausting.

1533
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,300
That is true.

1534
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,100
You do have to, you have to come into a...

1535
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,000
It's basically the hardest job on earth.

1536
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,500
Yeah, I do feel like this one's really fresh because we took so long to record it.

1537
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,100
I think the next one, I think the one after this one is going to be complete shit.

1538
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,300
Nah, it'll be great.

1539
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:39,800
What we should do is we should always delay, it should be an every nine days podcast.

1540
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,960
The first of its kind.

1541
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,800
Yeah.

1542
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,560
Well, it's like getting off of the base 10 system.

1543
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,400
Yeah.

1544
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,120
Move into a whole new reality.

1545
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,960
Yeah, I'm gonna move into Rex's reality.

1546
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,800
Into his house.

1547
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,400
Can I ask you guys one question before we wrap this up?

1548
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,120
How old do you think the earth is?

1549
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,440
Probably 10 years, 30 years maybe.

1550
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,120
I think seven billion.

1551
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,920
Very funny, I'd actually like you to take this seriously

1552
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,480
for once in your fucking life, Rex.

1553
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,640
Probably 5,486 years.

1554
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,680
That's what I like to hear.

1555
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,960
I've been getting very into these guys who keep going on Joe Rogan and being like,

1556
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:23,800
yeah, basically the earth is like 50,000 years old.

1557
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,880
And from the very first second the earth was made, there was guys who were making

1558
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,680
cell phones in Egypt, which is very cool.

1559
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,360
And that's true.

1560
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,400
I've been pretty obsessed with those.

1561
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:35,920
That's true.

1562
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,120
Graham Hancock.

1563
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,760
You know that guy?

1564
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,440
No.

1565
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,760
That's a fake name that you have to get into.

1566
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
It's not someone you have to get into Graham Hancock.

1567
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:48,100
He's he claims that Joe Rogan immediately dies after they go in there.

1568
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,200
Well, I'm really getting scared for this guy who ate woolly mammoth meat.

1569
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,100
Is he sick?

1570
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,260
You know about that guy?

1571
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,460
You told me about him, but is he OK?

1572
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,240
What happened to him?

1573
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,700
He's completely fine.

1574
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:06,000
But it does worry me that I feel like that's the kind of thing

1575
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,300
where like the FBI gets that

1576
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,340
that that facts that a man ate woolly mammoth.

1577
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,380
And they say that's a flavor

1578
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,880
that nobody should ever experience.

1579
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,920
And they maybe do an MLK to him.

1580
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,800
Right. Well, they're going to bring him back.

1581
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,260
You know that.

1582
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,260
They're willing to bring back that guy.

1583
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,560
They're going to clone him.

1584
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,800
Yeah, I don't give a fuck about.

1585
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,180
Dude, why are they trying to play?

1586
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,900
They're going to drop new woolly mammoth.

1587
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,860
Woolly mammoth 2 dropping in 2024.

1588
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,820
Do you guys join?

1589
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,320
Do you guys join me in hating

1590
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,860
when humanity plays God?

1591
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,860
Now I love it.

1592
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,860
Oh Christ.

1593
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,860
Now I love it.

1594
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,540
I hate that shit.

1595
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:47,260
If somebody ever tried to create a second Earth, I would probably try to stop it.

1596
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,300
I would help them.

1597
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,300
You're an asshole.

1598
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,300
Nope.

1599
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:52,300
And episode done.

1600
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:56,140
And episode done.
