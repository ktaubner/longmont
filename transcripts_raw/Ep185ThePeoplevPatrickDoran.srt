16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Uh, I don't have a coin

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
Uh, anyone have a coin?

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,440
I don't have a coin. Okay. Well, okay, I guess we're using a starbucks lid. Okay, this is gonna make a coin

00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,760

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:15,400
who flips the coin. It was heads. All right. I want first. All right. I want to

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,360
come at you with the strong arm of the law right now. The long strong arm of the

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,560
law. Your Honor and people of the jury including Alex Forrest and Jungel Skog.

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,880
I would like to establish today that there is beyond reasonable, beyond the

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,360
possibility of reasonable doubt that one Patrick Edward Doran violated New York

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,800
City's first-degree kidnapping penal law code 135.25 which states

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,840
kidnapping in the first degree essentially amounts to the broad crime

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,320
of kidnapping in the second degree with one of a few aggravating factors which

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,840
also serve to narrow the kinds of circumstances where the crime is charged

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,440
by police departments. Kidnapping in the first degree is an A1 felony

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:08,120
punishable by life in prison. Do you understand me? This sounds serious Mr. Doran. He spent all

34
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:16,760
Saturday writing this. There's no way I'm gonna win. A person, a person can and I

35
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,800
believe this day will be charged with kidnapping in the first degree when they

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,220
commit the crime of kidnapping in the second degree in that they abduct the

37
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,160
person or junglescook and either when their intent is the whole is to hold the

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,400
person for ransom or compel someone to do or not to do something what might be

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,600
called traditional kidnapping or when the victim is held for more than 12 hours

40
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,440
with intent to inflict injury on them sexually abuse them advance some other

41
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,280
felony or terrorize the victim or another person and your honor I'm here

42
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,800
today to prove that Patrick Edward Doran used his his captivity of Jungelskoog

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,120
to inflict terror on the employees of this office building. With his penis.

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,360
And also he stuck his penis in Jungelskoog. I did not stick my penis in Jungelskoog.

45
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,520
So let's start with the facts okay? Let's start with the facts. Order!

46
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,480
What did we get out of here?

47
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,000
Jungelskoog... I'm gonna give you guys a quick glimpse into

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,840
the jungles Cougar's life youngle skug was born sometime on Saturday or Friday what

49
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:39,960

looking, I mean, dare I say adorable. Any objections? No, I didn't think so,

56
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,740
adorable. So what is the last thing that he thinks in that moment? "I'm going

57
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:34,320
to get kidnapped and sexually assaulted by one of my dads." Can we agree on that?

58
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,480

59
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,480

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,500
young. Young uncle Scoob was here. He was sitting on our equipment

73
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,900
rack where we went. You went right to that. What you went right

74
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,000
to sexual assault and it was about kidnapping. I've I kind of

75
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,100
I got lost and I'm doing a kind of a dramatic lawyer thing. He's

76
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,300
trying to scare the people who choose if you listen it whether or not I can prove

sitting on the equipment rack Patrick comes in and we can prove by the way

ladies and gentlemen that Patrick did in fact come to the office do we have do

84
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,100
we have evidence for that - let me tell you what I actually do have evidence let

85
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:20,140
me see this and I can not only the judge of I can prove that Patrick is Joe

86
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,260
hasn't said a thing on a cross-examine I thought we'll get to evidence later but

87
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,740
okay ladies and gentlemen the point is please wrap it up Patrick Edward

88
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,140
please wrap it up. I'm wrapping up Patrick Edward Doran Doran didn't did

89
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:38,540
did in fact come in on Sunday, March the thirteenth grab young school from the

90
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,740
equipment rack grabbed leading what the word grabbed is no

91
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,540
overturned.

92
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,140
It makes rules. He's making a an accusation that is it's an it's opening

93
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,340
statement. He did, but how did okay, we said we're not doing evidence yet, so

94
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,140
can say whatever he wants that's right placed him in a box at the end of the

95
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,780
other end of the office wrapped him in a green screen cloth and left a menacing

96
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,940
note that read and I'd like to just finish my my opening statements with this

97
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,220
the haunting chilling note that he read or that he wrote which is I mean it's

98
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,340
really it's terrifying if you're sensitive to things like this you may

99
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:27,020
want to cover your eyes. Junglescoog is gone. Sad face, sad face. Do not look for

100
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,460
him. He does not want to be found. Now look look at young Junglescoog and tell

101
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:39,420
me that this face wouldn't want to be found. Your Honor, I yield my time.

102
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:50,060
Okay. I close my statement. All right. Mr. Gleason, representing Patrick

103
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,580
Doran. You gotta hold the mic closer to your face. I am Joe Gleason, I'm representing Patrick

104
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:02,260
Doran, who I know to be a very kind and sweet and generous man. Yesterday at 830

105
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,700
p.m. Sunday, Patrick Doran arrived in the office ready to get some work done at

106
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,660
his new setup desk monitor. It's an exciting time to be Patrick Doran. That

107
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,740
sounds fun. He walks in with his bag of Burger King and he is repulsed and

108
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:26,740
astonished by this haunting chilling note that the prosecution just read. Before

109
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,020
even sending any evidence he said "who did it? It wasn't me."

110
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:40,940
Patrick knows the manner in which his closest friends treat him, antagonize him,

111
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:52,420
and berate him regardless of any evidence in any way shape or form. He sends a

112
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,580
picture of the sign which does read "Jungle Skoog is gone.

113
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,900
Sad face, sad face. Do not look for him. He does not want to be found." That is met

114
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,900
yet with a response by our current judge who said you will never get away with this.

115
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:16,900
Which I think throws this whole trial into green.

116
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,540
If you can find another judge in 30 seconds then we'll switch him out.

117
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,060
You have to give it to Alex.

118
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,740
He's not trained to be a judge.

119
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,540
I've actually trained a lot of time at judge school.

120
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,860
He's done bias training.

121
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,340
yeah i'm willing to forgive and forget i'm willing to trust cameron on this

122
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,100
thank you i'm not willing to forgive and forget anything today okay i'll prove it

123
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,540
i'll prove it to you

124
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,180
uh... patrick responded with i'm being frightened

125
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,740
i'm serious

126
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,800
patrick has maintained his innocence from the very beginning of this entire

127
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,420
unjust much like oj simpson

128
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,980
innocent

129
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,760
i'm proven by a court of law to be innocent

130
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,260
i'm not saying

131
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,660
i said w_t_f_ with a crying sad face

132
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,040
cameron said why are you in the office them patrick said i'm working on my

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,500
power point

134
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,920
i'm working on my power point for uh... show them to be on at life world on the

135
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,420
seventeenth

136
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,260
uh... there's tickets online objection

137
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,220
objection to the same love sustained

138
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,860
they can't do that

139
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,140
court

140
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,020
what it all boils down to is that patrick is being blamed

141
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,300
for reporting a crime

142
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,460
you mentioned jungle skus fathers you mentioned

143
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,280
at two points

144
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,340
at many points

145
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,300
you mentioned on the school's scoops fathers

146
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,660
jungle school is a very unorthodox

147
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,940
kind of parents situation his five different fathers

148
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,000
and this is all being pinned on one of the five

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,340
and i would say that patrick doran should not be on trial

150
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,380
we should be having an open-ended discussion on which one of us

151
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,580
all of whom have access to this office

152
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:05,340
could have come in in the time frame before 830 and since Thursday, whatever, Thursday

153
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,020
at 8 430. Patrick Doran is not on trial. The office is on trial.

154
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,180
Well, that's not true. It's the people versus Patrick Doran.

155
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:21,740
Or I'm saying shouldn't be on trial. Also, I would just like to kibosh any SA claims that

156
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:27,340
have been heinously levied. I dropped it, okay? I got a little bit excited.

157
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,060
You seem really fixated on this. I'm not. Caleb is. I haven't talked about it since I said I wasn't going to.

158
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,500
Jungle Skoog is just like us. He has two eyes, he has a nose, a mouth, he has two arms and two feet.

159
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,260
But he has no butthole and that drove our defendant insane.

160
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,260
[Laughter]

161
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,260
I would like to point out to the jury and to the prosecution that Jungle Skoog has no holes.

162
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,340
he has no holes that have been made

163
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,660
since his birth he is he looks exactly the same

164
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,460
and if anything he was he was swaddled

165
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,460
in a little blanket as if he's a small little baby Patrick Doran

166
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,540
is one of the kindest sweetest man I know what is it smell like

167
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,860

168
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,060
penis objection

169
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,060

170
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
(laughter)

171
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,060
sounds like a penis

172
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
ok so what happens after the opening statements

173
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
I'd like to call to the stand Patrick Doran

174
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,060

175
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060

(laughter)

177
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060

179
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,060

182
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060

183
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:52,180
Hi Patrick.

184
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
Hi.

185
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
So Patrick--

186
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
It's my old roommate.

187
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
Hi.

188
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,660
We used to be roommates but now we're not.

189
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,380
Patrick what were you doing yesterday?

190
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Yesterday--

191
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,060
How did you let your day begin?

192
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:12,300
My day began, I woke up, I was with my girlfriend and then I walked her to the train.

193
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,060
What time is that train?

194
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
At 12.

195
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
12 noon.

196
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:23,420
Proceed what happened next okay, then I went back home and I took a shower. Do

197
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,820
you have proof perhaps pictures of you in the shower? I have a picture. I do I

198
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,180
do I have a picture of me after the shower because I was going to wear a

199
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,100
crazy outfit.

200
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,620
I have a photo picture. Can we have a photo of the crazy outfit? Can we see

201
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,340
the crazy outfit here? Yes,

202
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,020
is there a time stamp with there's a time stamp on the crazy outfit?

203
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:55,900
It is at exactly 1 p.m. I wore a shirt a sweater that says golf on it with real

204
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,980
tree pants and I sent a picture of that to my girlfriend and I asked does this

205
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,220
go?

206
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:10,700
Continue. It did it go? She said I looked handsome enough that she didn't care.

207
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:18,060
I did not wear the outfit I switched because I felt that it looked it was too

208
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:25,540
much so Patrick is Patrick is under the impression that wearing a fun you know

209
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:32,980
exciting outfit is too much business for just a normal day let alone a kidnapping

210
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,380
and a crime and I had plans to go skateboarding which again there are

211
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,100
receipts there are pictures

212
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,980
if you have a look at the door he loves to skateboard

213
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,940
he's a he's great at it he's the best reporter i know

214
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,620
we've established that he already commits crimes on a daily basis objections

215
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,660
skateboarding is in the olympics

216
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,460
skateboarding school yeah in china

217
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,340
well and there are a couple of people who have a skateboard

218
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,580
objection racist

219
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:09,580
I... yes.

220
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,220
Patrick Doran is guilty of...

221
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,740
Yes!

222
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,060
Reporting a crime.

223
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,500
What the fuck? Patrick Doran was just reporting a crime and we also have

224
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,660
a statement from Patrick

225
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,620
that goes through his day. I said this, I said it already, I said the same thing.

226
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,020
Okay, he said the same thing.

227
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,620
Yeah. Okay.

228
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,320
So I went, wait, I left out, so I went,

229
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I did that.

230
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
You left out when you kidnapped Rumpelstiltskin.

231
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:40,560
No, I went to, I have an actual receipt of a purchase that I made.

232
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,160
I bought new trucks.

233
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Let's see it.

234
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,440
I have, well, there's a, it's right there.

235
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,960
Okay, well that's not a receipt.

236
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
That's a skateboard.

237
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Okay.

238
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,720
I'll pull up my Discover Card account.

239
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,000
And can you read the card number out to the, for the...

240
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'd like to be in cross-examination when you get a chance.

241
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think you can cross-examine Patrick as much as you want, but I think that you will have

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
to find him.

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Okay, it has a transaction date.

244
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He is kind.

245
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He is sweet of heart.

246
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And he doesn't want to hurt anyone.

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Patrick, how are you today?

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm good.

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah?

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'd be better if I wasn't being framed.

252
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You got a smile on your face?

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'd be better if I wasn't being framed by my closest friends.

254
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,500
closest. I'm gonna ask the questions okay and you're gonna answer them. That's how

255
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,920
this works. All right. Would you say hmm if you could describe your Sunday

256
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,040
afternoon with one emoji what would it be?

257
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,640
Can I look through the emojis? Nope. Nope.

258
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,520
Probably just the the one that's like this. Which one is that? I can't see your

259
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,960
your mind can't see your straight the straight line on okay the gym face

260
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,080
emojis yes the gym so a day where you kidnap someone is a normal day for you

261
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,960
you're the judge and you're not allowed to order order you're not allowed to

262
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,960
speak or listen I'm the one who tells you you're not allowed to speak you're

263
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,880
not allowed to speak for the rest of the cross-examination oh that fucks me up

264
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,960
okay okay so you said the gym face one okay and where where does Jim Halpert

265
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,400
work. I order you to speak the office mmm Thunder Mifflin gotcha so what I have so

266
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,800
far from what you've said it just this short time that I've had you is you've

267
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,480
mentioned emojis and you've mentioned the office you were leading as in that

268
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,160
objection leading is completely fine and you do it all the time I'm looking up

269
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,200
the rules of court right now there are some courts that let you lead and some

270
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,560
that don't and we're the one that lets you lead. And I'd like to ask you... It's just

271
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,980
based on the court. I'd like to ask you a few more questions here Patrick. What

272
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:06,040
time did you arrive at the office on March 13th? 8.30. 8.30. Gotcha. So 8.30 is

273
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,080
when you say you arrived. Around 8.30. Around 8.30. Okay so now anywhere between

274
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,320
between 825 to 830. Okay, all right, so you're changing the time a lot, which is

275
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,600
which is perfectly fine if you're a huge liar, like I wouldn't do it, but if you

276
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,920
want to that's fine. By almost five times. No, here's my big question. The photo

277
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,040
composition of the photo that you took of the ransom note, we'll call it a

278
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:43,200
Ransom Note for now, is so kind of perfect. It follows every compositional rule of

279
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,360
photography, rule of thirds, background foreground, you even added a little flare

280
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:55,080
of your Burger King bag in the back. Okay? So my question is, if you, if any

281
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,980
reasonable person arrived, excuse me, if any reasonable person arrived at the

282
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:08,420
office and saw the horror that Patrick witnessed on that day, allegedly, that he

283
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,860
alleges he witnessed and did not cause, would you be able to even take one

284
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:21,380
second of a break from crying your eyes out-- nope-- to take a perfect photo like

285
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,660
that? Because I'm gonna speak for myself and I think the rest of the office when I

286
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,340
say no. No. I would be losing my mind, it would look like a still from

287
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Cloverfield there's no possible way that I can take such a perfect photo.

288
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
You can't say anything to him.

289
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,340
He took time to put the Burger King bag down behind the sign.

290
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
That's a good point.

291
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,340
And you did not, and you, listen, I'd like to make one more point.

292
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Before even looking for Junglescoog and worrying about his well-being,

293
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,340
you were taking photos and messaging the group chat to establish your innocence

294
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,140
innocence before you even looked for him.

295
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:07,260
Your instinct was to protect yourself before your child.

296
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,500
- He's not my kid.

297
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,340
- Whoa!

298
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,940
- I don't care if you move to the dock.

299
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,740
- Can everyone gasp for a sound bite?

300
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,380
(gasps)

301
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,640
- What did you just say?

302
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,560
- What did he say?

303
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,340
- I've played the fifth.

304
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,500
- I've played the fifth.

305
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,060
default himself and i missed it

306
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,180
that's what we need to cross examinations

307
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,760
patrick

308
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,140
i'd like to ask a question or questions yeah

309
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,040
first of all i would like to point out so jungle skunk

310
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,800
the the branson note was found by patrick at eight twenty seven p_m_

311
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,100
which is in line with when he arrived in the office

312
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,780
it takes you it takes him two minutes to walk from the door to the table

313
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,660
statement

314
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,980
and said to you said arrived at twenty four

315
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,900
i spent spent the first couple seconds looking for jungle skunk

316
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,020
and then i i took the picture because i knew i was immediately being framed

317
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,380
and jungle school was found by patrick

318
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,460
i might add

319
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,740
amir nineteen minutes later

320
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,140
uh...

321
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,100
it's a lot of that

322
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,980
uh...

323
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,540
and that's what i think that i have to do that

324
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Mr. Doran, were any of those 19 minutes spent consuming Burger King?

325
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:32,260
Yes they were. Yes they were. I had a Whopper with fries and a small onion ring

326
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,580
and a Dr. Pepper. So again you're worrying about yourself before

327
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,660
Yunglescoop. Because I knew I was being framed and I knew that he was okay. So your

328
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,140
proverbial kind of last meal you're enjoying. I knew that he was okay. Why did you know he

329
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,900
was okay is it because because one of you was because you were the architect of

330
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:59,500
his fate no because I was being framed I'd like to call to the stand one an

331
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,340
expert witness just one just one okay and that would be truthologist Cameron

332
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:16,180
better here Alex you have to be the judge now can you slide this around hi there

333
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,460
okay we have a new we have a substitute judge judge how are you your honor I'm

334
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,620
good I had a heavy night last night judging a lot of cases but I don't think

335
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,140
it should interfere with my judging I agree thank you for that hero guilty

336
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,220
- Cameron, oh. (laughing)

337
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,480
Mr. Cameron Fetter, how are you today?

338
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,920
- I'm doing well. - Okay.

339
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,960
- I'm hungering for vengeance. (laughing)

340
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,960
- And Cameron, how long have you studied

341
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
the art of truthology?

342
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,200
- Practically my entire life.

343
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,880
- Okay, as if you can't remember a day

344
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,240
when you weren't a truthologist.

345
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,520
- Basically. - Okay.

346
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,360
And just looking at Patrick, could you do,

347
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,680
I'm not sure if you do this. Could you do a quick truth analysis of just kind of

348
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:09,480
his body and his body language and kind of give me a percentage point? Okay, so

349
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,320
for the audience he does have his hands behind his back. He kind of a

350
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,760
Matthew McConaughey pose. So there are several key points of truthology

351
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,200
that are kind of tenets of the study that let you know whether or

352
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,680
not somebody is telling the truth and one big point that we always

353
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,080
look for is smiling too damn much and he's got a little bit of a smirk here as

354
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,400
we can see so that's that's one point of of the liar of of liar dumb. He does

355
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,480
look disgusting. He's smiling a little more here. Another another sign that we

356
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,440
look for in liars is earring on the right side and he does possess this

357
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,520
trait right now, which is the second major point that we as truthologists

358
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,080
look like and something that we see with liars a lot too is that they after they

359
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,480
lie they attempt to hide themselves away and they try to but to become elusive

360
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,920
and as you can see he is wearing camouflage on his shirt, which is a

361
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,520
hallmark of trying to hide or disappear after you've been discovered or caught

362
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,720
in a lie. So those are three main points and it only takes half a point to be

363
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,120
deemed a liar under truthology. So he is really six times a liar. Yeah, oh my

364
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,320
goodness, okay on based on hard science. So now quick question about yesterday

365
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,720
So you were obviously involved in the group chat.

366
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Oh yeah.

367
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,800
You know, and we commissioned you to do a truthology review on a video that Patrick made where he

368
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,360
professes his innocence.

369
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Yes.

370
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,440
Okay, and could you very quickly recite what you said in response to that video?

371
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,560
Okay, let me, I have to find it.

372
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
One second.

373
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,920
video is way too long we're not watching it guilty okay and then could you very

374
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,400
quickly for for for reference I also made a video professing my innocence

375
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,520
because it was a lot of accusations being levied at the time you tell me

376
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,040
what you said about my video yeah I said I just analyzed that video and it has a

377
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,600
truth reading of over 100 points hashtag where's Patrick's video hashtag guilty

378
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:25,240
yeah okay you said it has over 100 points you said it only needs six to be a liar

379
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:33,280
truthology is not real objection truth all I've studied truthology for over 20

380
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,400
years and this clown probably been a lawyer for what five minutes wants to

381
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:44,200
tell me it's not real if truthology so fake who invented it not true

382
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
it was John truth.

383
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay, and

384
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,800
can I submit evidence to while I'm not the judge. I really want to submit

385
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
a piece of evidence.

386
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
Listen, this is huge. Actually, it's a huge breakthrough the case. We're

387
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,100
having a piece of evidence submitted live. Okay, by our truthologist. So

388
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:09,300
Patrick here, give me this Patrick. Do you remember making this post on

389
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
March 12th,

390
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,900
2022

at 2 42 p.m. on are you at lunch enjoyer on Twitter yes do you remember making

392
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:32,480
this post quote jungle skug will go missing end quote no hit can you

393
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,680
refresh the page I'm actually I've already archived the page so if you've

394
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,280
deleted it that does nothing for your case and actually we're gonna include

395
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:50,680
that that includes a charge of tampering with evidence hmm it does yes hmm so do

396
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,920
you don't remember making this post I remember all of the posts I make online

397
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,920
are done in a character okay all right with that in mind let's go through some

398
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,240
of these no no no no no no if you insist that that day that this is all a

399
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:18,200
character let's check this out it's actually it's all me it's 100% real it's

400
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,160
all you and it's 100% real so you so including including the the the jungles

401
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:34,920
post no that was done facetiously on this same on this same facetious means just

402
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,240
kidding

403
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,520
Patrick a tweet from Patrick's Twitter account yesterday yeah I got a BAFTA big

404
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,040
ass fucking Toyota Avalon I just I'm trying to can we quickly just give a

405
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,240
a rating of this post. I'm gonna give a round of applause for this post. I mean this has got to be one of the best posts of all time.

406
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,940
I think it's funny. That's a funny tweet. It's timely. The BAFTA Awards happened.

407
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,340
He doesn't have a Toyota Avalon. He doesn't have a car. Patrick does not have a driver's license.

408
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,140
So I think this just goes to show that Patrick is tweeting

409
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:18,440
in said character, not tweeting the truth. He is not, you know, his retweets are not necessarily endorsements.

410
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,840
So if you have, if you tweet in this kind of character as you say it, we'll call it

411
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,640
we'll call it an alternate personality almost. Do you ever find yourself losing

412
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,840
time to this alternate personality? Maybe becoming him kind of a la Jekyll and

413
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:44,860
Hyde? No. Okay. So there's no possibility that this character took over your psyche

414
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,980
as you entered the office that day filled you with so much non-sexual rage that

415
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:58,860
you snatched Junglescoog, wrapped him up in a green thing, and put him in a box.

416
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,380
I'm actually also a snatchologist and Patrick's fingers actually have the

417
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:12,060
perfect articulation for snatching. Patrick does love to talk

418
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,020
about his his his large hands he I don't love to talk about my large he brings it

419
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,460
up all the time I was like a girl does at a bar I'm hearing in sizes I told you

420
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,700
yes I did compare hand sizes with you both of you and how many times I would

421
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,780
say three or four times in the past couple months and what I've noticed is

422
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,740
that you have very large kind of snatchy grabby hands you're you're just a grabby

423
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,740
guy his hands his hands he has bigger hands and then either either me or Caleb

424
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,300
look my hands don't even fit around him I'd like to ask for a hand comparison

425
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:53,660
between the five of us okay are you sure Joe oh wow Patrick's hands are

426
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,340
approximately the same size as mine which is and he's and he's six five yeah

427
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:06,700
I have the hands of a six foot five man bigger than mine snatch ability snatch

428
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,700
ability. Yep. Okay, continue the test. Let's go. Oh, no. Alex is bigger. No. No, they're

429
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:24,700
not. They're the same. Alex has bigger hands. I have longer fingers. Okay, but I can't,

430
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,400
my, I can't. I'd like to call Alex to the stand. I'd like to, I can't lift him up. I'd

431
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,400
like to call, I'd like to call Alex to the stand. Let's all call Alex to the stand. You

432
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,680
You are no longer the judge.

433
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
Okay, I'm back to being the judge.

434
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
I'm being examined?

435
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah, you, yeah.

436
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Okay.

437
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Fine.

438
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Alex, Alex.

439
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,360
Hit me, hit me with it.

440
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,160
Alex, you have the biggest hands in the office.

441
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Thank you.

442
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
Would you say that this helps you with snatching things?

443
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,640
Um, no, because I, I, while my hands are big, they're not very agile.

444
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,680
Look how long it takes me to lift this, lift up Jungle Scoog.

445
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,760
Okay, you've been holding Jungle Scoog this entire time.

446
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
It's 'cause...

447
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,160
Once I have him, I can kinda do whatever I want, but like I...

448
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
You can do whatever you want?

449
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Whatever I want in a...

450
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Alex, where were you yesterday?

451
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Where were you yesterday?

452
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Yesterday I was at work. I worked a double.

453
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:22,160
And then I arrived home at approximately night at 8.30 and I...

454
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Okay, so you arrived home at 8.30...

455
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Wait, no, no.

456
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Patrick found...

457
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Sorry, I'm...

458
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
And you live 10 minutes away from here.

459
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Shut up.

460
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
You have any proof?

461
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
Yes, I do.

462
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
I can show you.

463
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,440
I arrived home on the train.

464
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,280
I went to Queen Restaurant and I bought a chicken shawarma and I have the email or I have the

465
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,920
text and order confirmation from this restaurant.

466
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
It was sent.

467
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,760
That's so far from our place.

468
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,600
I was coming back on the train and I stopped.

469
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I got off.

470
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Or coming back from here.

471
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Which one was it?

472
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Coming back from work.

473
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I work.

474
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
You work in an office, no?

475
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,680
No, my other job I work at.

476
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:12,220
I was I was your other I got a I got a text at I had sex 715 that my order was

477
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,040
ready we'll be ready at 730 and I went and I got my order and then I went back

478
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:22,160
to the apartment took a shower I believe at about your painting a very wide open

479
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:28,800
window. No, no, no. I have an alibi. Let's see. At 843...

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,360
Oh. So I went home at 843. I received a text from our roommate Neil Linsky. He

481
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,600
said, "Anyone home?" I said, "I am home." Patrick said, "I am at the office." And that

482
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:49,400
was at 845. So there's no way I could have done it. And I'm too slow. I can't

483
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,120
pick things up. I would like to... Next question please. You've given us...

484
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,440
You get off of work around 6, right? 7. I got off work at 7 and I arrived

485
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,560
home at 7.45. Alex, I have seen you leave work a lot. Let the record show I

486
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,840
recently got in trouble at work because I don't stay late enough. So now I have

487
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,520
to stay an extra 30 minutes. The record will show that. Thank you. So I stayed

488
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,600
late at work. So yes you may have seen me leaving work earlier but I

489
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,360
don't leave them see okay all I'm trying to say in this analysis of Alex is that

490
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,360
if you put schedules enough schedules together enough anyone could have come

491
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,440
into this office kidnap jungle school including Patrick including Patrick what

492
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,840
yes I'm saying anyone hypothetically could have come in with the same amount

493
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,520
of evidence that we are throwing towards Patrick I would like to I think you're

494
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:53,280
right Joe I think you're right anybody hypothetically could do this but it is a

495
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,580
matter of motive what did what have we illustrated what is Patrick illustrated

496
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,040
about himself time after time when I got my dog okay mm-hmm what did he say he

497
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,760
said he's getting more attention than me he said he was jealous mm-hmm jealous

498
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,200
jealous my dog was getting more attention than him that the dog is now the

499
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:22,300
recipient of belly rubs and tummy scratches from me from me and cam from me

500
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,500
was what he was complaining about he doesn't care about your belly well

501
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,000
that's that you know that hurts my feelings but it's okay but what and what

502
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,040
did he say what what what refrain did he echo once more when we got going to

503
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
kidnap and molest your dog.

504
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
(laughter)

505
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
If my memory serves me correctly, I think...

506
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
The judge was joking on that one.

507
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
That was a joke.

508
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Strike that from the record.

509
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
I'd like to ask the judge to not make jokes.

510
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Well, it seems you don't really have the authority to ask the judge to do anything.

511
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
I have the authority to ask.

512
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
I asked the defense to go outside.

513
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
(laughter)

514
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
The door locks. I can't do that.

515
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Oh, listen.

516
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Perjury.

517
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,440
And I would like to say that he said almost the exact same thing

518
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,040
when we got Jungelskoog, that he was jealous that Jungelskoog was getting the attention.

519
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,840
If you remember correctly...

520
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,440
The judge remembers that correctly.

521
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,040
And if you remember correctly, judge, the first time that he saw Jungelskoog,

522
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,440
he grabbed him and would not let him go as you and me chased him around the office.

523
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,640
I believe that we have audio evidence of that occurring.

524
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Yes, we do. It's on an episode.

525
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,040
We tried to free him from Patrick's...

526
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,840
But that is on the premium feed.

527
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,720
Patrick's touchy-feely clutches and he was running around the office with

528
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Jungleskoog. Okay, so we've established that you have a you have a pattern, a

529
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,840
history of Jungleskoog abuse. If we're talking about if we're talking about a

530
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,840
period of or a pattern of Jungleskoog abuse I would like to highlight

531
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,760
immediately bringing Jungleskoog back from IKEA, our beautiful Judge Cameron

532
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,800
proceeded to put him in every doorway and shut repeatedly we put him in a closet

533
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,160
he liked it we put him in multiple closets shutting the door we put him in

534
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,080
drawers oh did I hear the word we here interesting party to this but Cameron

535
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,080
so you did this also refused to let me hold jungle school that's not true you

536
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,040
hold you several times you seem I have also also I hung him up on the lights

537
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,440
first with you instructing me how to do so if you remember correctly and it was

538
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,320
after that I hung him up on the lights that you took him and you it seems like

539
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,120
I was why I was here has participated in jungle skook abuse no what I was doing

540
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,840
was not abuse I was propping him up in doorways very cutely and what Joe was

541
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,240
doing was rubbing him in the corners of the ceiling and getting spider webs and

542
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,040
bugs all over him objective I did not rub him I tried to hang him because he

543
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,560
has a velcro feet and you try to hang him interesting no no okay

544
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,800
thereby murdering him I would like to call to the stand the prosecution Joe

545
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,080
Gleason objection you can't object you know come on come to the I just have a

546
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,760
couple of questions ask okay call him to the stand and then give him jungle skoog

547
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,080
and then see what his eyes look like okay all right well thank you for thank you

548
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,160
for giving it up out loud so that he knows exactly what to not do that is

549
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,620
great Joe Gleason we hold on to him for a second so I just like to see okay Patrick

550
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:31,360
immediately violently reached for him so you look very at home with the uncle

551
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:38,540
scoog in your hands I love jungle school of course who doesn't can you tell me so

552
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,180
when I came in today I young go scoog was recovered right he had already been

553
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:49,060
unrecovered and we we I basically took the ransom note and I rearranged the

554
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,540
letters to be a little bit sweeter so tell me what could you read this for me

555
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:59,180
yes it says jungle skug is fine winky face tongue-out face tunes are good he

556
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,940
do want to be found so he do want to be found I think we think we all agree

557
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,740
that's a very sweet kind of nice message that I left right you do want to tell me

558
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,820
This is kind of what I want to focus on here. These two, you mentioned them, the

559
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,500
the emojis, okay? So these were at one point a double sad face emoji in the

560
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,900
original Ransom Note. I believe a double crying face. Okay, so you know the

561
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,140
specifics. Would you consider yourself an emoji user? I'd say I use my fair share

562
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:33,700
of emojis. Gotcha, because I would like to bring to the attention of the court, back

563
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:41,780
to the group chat okay in the first two messages that Joe Gleason says in

564
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:48,540
response to the photo okay the photo is it the photo is sent by Patrick right of

565
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,980
the note Cameron says you will never get away with this

566
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:03,180
Patrick says I'm being framed I'm serious Joe Gleason says WTF sad eyes

567
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:11,700
emoji and let me tell you what it gets even worse for one Joe Gleason Cameron

568
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,180
no but I just I just I'd like to pique the interest of the court on this on this

569
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,180
one possible suspect not even a suspect yeah I just want to I kind of just want

570
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,300
to bring this up Cameron says why are you in the office then Patrick says I'm

571
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,300
working on my PowerPoint for my show on the I'm gonna show you know plug

572
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:34,020
sustains no plugs Patrick no plugs mr. Doran Pam Cameron says you have the

573
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:42,900
motive means and no alibi and here comes Joe poor young sad face emoji - sad

574
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:51,940
face emoji emojis - two messages I dented you you you often find yourself

575
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,500
using emojis how about so often that in the two messages after we get the first

576
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,940
piece of evidence both of them contain emojis almost as if you're seeding as if

577
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,780
you're leaving a breadcrumb trail directly to yourself

578
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,060
Joe I would like to know what you were up to yesterday so my friend was in town

579
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:21,100
at my house at my new apartment okay in the morning I friend or accomplice friend

580
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,460
friend does not know of Jungle Skoog.

581
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:31,100
I would like to say that earlier when we were discussing going into this court case.

582
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
Hold on, hold on.

583
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Let him finish this.

584
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,220
Okay, okay, sorry.

585
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,340
I drove my friend to his home in upstate New York, going out of my way.

586
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
What time?

587
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
Let me see.

588
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,260
I have a, I think middle of the day, about three.

589
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Two to three.

590
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,360
And three around the time where I was in Midtown.

591
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,080
And would your friend corroborate this?

592
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,720
Yeah, I have a...

593
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,700
Would you mind giving him a phone call?

594
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
I have a...

595
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,020
You know, he works.

596
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,360
But I do have a receipt for a gas station.

597
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,800
He works in upstate New York?

598
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,100
Yeah, he lives there.

599
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:15,060
I have a receipt of $35.93 at the Millwood Market gas station, the Exxon.

600
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,060
Wait, is that right?

601
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,620
These gas prices are crazy.

602
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,140
$35 to fill up a...

603
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:28,340
probably buying black trash bags and gloves and then I was driving back here

604
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:36,180
to New York to go back to my house and when you say here you mean the office

605
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:45,700
well so I was driving I I had to head to poop and my house is about ten minutes

606
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,860
from here. So I decided to stop through here.

607
00:43:50,860 --> 00:44:03,140
What? I decided to poop here because there's the squatty potty and... At what time?

608
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,820
At what time were you here using the squatty potty? I texted Kara.

609
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:14,380
you're burying yourself right now. I texted Kara and said I just went to the

610
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,080
office to take a poop. Gonna drive back home in a few minutes. What time? I don't know.

611
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:26,780
At 530. At 530 when I was on I there's there is photographic evidence I can

612
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:33,140
prove this I was with my friend Blaine. So at 530 there was what was you what was

613
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,940
young school doing at this time while you're proving he was here we played

614
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,660
you play

615
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,700
at five oh six i have a way with his permission yes jungles jungles good and i

616
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,340
i would say have the strongest relationship

617
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,140
in the office i think i was going to die let's ask you know

618
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,660
yet

619
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,660
dot but the culture of the school to the stand

620
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,660
he's nodding

621
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,660
(laughter)

622
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,660
leading the witness

623
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,660
Joe is nodding his head

624
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
he's playing with his head

625
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,660
he's puppeteering him

626
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
(laughter)

627
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Jungle Skook just shook his head

628
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,660
so I guess Joe has nothing to do with

629
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,660
ok so let's ask Jungle Skook some yes or no questions

630
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,660
ok

631
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,660

Yunglescoot took the gavel and he's bashed Crazy Frog in the head.

683
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,620
He's bleeding all over the place.

684
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,620
Bling!

685
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,620
What does that mean?

686
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,620
Bling!

687
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,620
We have to operate on Crazy Frog.

688
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,620
We have to operate on him.

689
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,620
Oh my god.

690
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:35,620
He said, he said, well he said, "Thank god I'm wearing this helmet."

691
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,620
Why would Yunglescoot do this?

692
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,620
He's shrugging.

693
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:47,340
Younglskug, you, you, oh no! He can't even stay, stay up, he's dead.

694
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:52,540
Crazy Frog, is he? He's alive. Okay, he looks dead. He's, he's, okay. Yeah.

695
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:58,540
Alright, Younglskug, stop, Younglskug, stop. I, you are being restrained. He's trying to

696
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,340
grab the hammer again. Okay, Younglskug, you're gonna have another trial later, I think,

697
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,140
because you just did a way worse crime.

698
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:17,300
okay so crazy frog I just have one question for you okay who did you see

699
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:26,340
kidnap you uncle skook yesterday afternoon Bing and Patrick what does

700
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:34,460
that say that says he says I don't know I looked it up I thought that being means

701
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:42,700
me what I just looked at well yeah I've just studied a lot of linguistics I'm a

702
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,980
linguist ologist wait crazy frog crazy for you saying this to cover things up

703
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,740
so you can still hang out at the office why would we you're gonna get crazy frog

704
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,980
I want you to know we're going to sentence you to death if you are the one

705
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:05,300
who kidnapped you uncle skook and what does that mean Patrick that's another I

706
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:15,580
don't know ladies and gentlemen I my hands are tied I think that at this

707
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:22,460
point I think that all we can do is closing statements some deliberation and

708
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,900
than the verdict I think that's basically all we do. That will take up about nine minutes.

709
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,900
We also didn't get, hold on, Joe clearly was here playing hide and seek with Jungle Scoog.

710
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:43,220
And tell me, do you remember, give him the microphone, give him the microphone. Joe,

711
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:50,060
do you remember where the last hiding place that you and Uncle Scoog had was?

712
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,780
i do remember i would also first before i answer the old no okay no no no let me

713
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:58,700
answer the question before i answer no as a judge you can't you're a witness

714
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,620
right now before i answer the question i would like the record to show

715
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,740
that patrick offered me the herman miller chair if i can prove beyond a

716
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,660
reasonable doubt that he did not do the crime of putting jungle yet you pay you

717
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,140
pay your lawyer that's normal

718
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,140
but if you're his lawyer right

719
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,940
i saw that the thing you can't you can't get bribed your low he's he pays you to

720
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:22,580
to help prove the case. That's my payment for proving him, his innocence.

721
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,380
Yeah, so answer the question. I came here, the little board said, "Mmm poop"

722
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,180
I believe. "Mmm poop" Wait, actually it did not. It said, at the

723
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:39,260
time it said, "Mmm ooo pee pee." "Mmm ooo pee pee" which was a variant of

724
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,380
"Mmm poop" before. Yeah, okay.

725
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,300
I saw that the boards were still in, the boards with all the little letters were still there.

726
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,820
I had to take a poop as I previously stated.

727
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,140
I like to play around with jungle skunk.

728
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,300
I think he has a funny face.

729
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,300
It's a very funny object.

730
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,620
Yes, it's a very funny.

731
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,980
It really looks good no matter what he always looks like he's giving whatever emotion you

732
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,780
need him to be giving.

733
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
He's happy.

734
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,780
He's scared.

735
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,780
He's sad.

736
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
He's excited.

737
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
He looks he looks rageful right now.

738
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,700
He looks murderous.

739
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,700
I came to the office.

740
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:39,260
I'm

741
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,260
Alright, so what's your point here?

742
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,900
Give us, put us through this whole rigmarole, Joe.

743
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,740
Just spit it out.

744
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,500
What is your point?

745
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,340
- I did it.

746
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,100
(gasps)

747
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,980
I was playing with Jungle Skoog.

748
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:53,700
- Did you do this for the Herman Miller?

749
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,540
- Yeah.

750
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,220
Well, you know, you didn't--

751
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,060
- I mean, I did it now,

752
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,900
I defended you for the Herman Miller.

753
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,420
- I need a microphone.

754
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,940
- Cameron's been talking.

755
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,340
I'm holding a microphone.

756
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,380
- No, no, no, earlier, when you didn't have one,

757
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,580
you were saying stuff.

758
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,420
- Yeah.

759
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,760
can you hear me screaming probably faintly yeah it's like court flavor.

760
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,100
You know if you yell stuff yeah, it's like sounds like there's a big court

761
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:19,340
with people you know that you mean there is a big court with people. Oh

762
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:24,900
yeah, it sounds like it because it is yeah exactly, but it sounds to me like

763
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:31,260
now as the judge as a judge, I'm an expert on deals and rules and it sounds

764
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,100
to me like Patrick promised the Herman Miller to Joe. If Joe was able to

765
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:41,200
successfully defend Patrick and this actually does count as a bribe now and I

766
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,600
would like to make one I would like to ask one question how can we know that

767
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,600
you are not just taking the fall so that you can get the Herman Miller at this

768
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,600
point please speak into the microphone because if you're taking the fall to do

769
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,840
it that I don't think that's successful because then that leaves the case open

770
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:02,280
ended do you have any hard enough Patrick did not go to IKEA with us Patrick was

771
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:08,640
here yes waiting for the optimum man Patrick does not know where the little

772
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,440
fits like letters are to put on the jungle school he does not know which

773
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,080
cabinet those are in Patrick also not very good at spelling we can say that

774
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,600
too Patrick does not know the spelling of jungle scog scoog potentially it is a

775
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,280
it is a strange swedish spelling

776
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,720
uh... i don't know that he knows it

777
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,400
uh...

778
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,280
you

779
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,740
don't you're hurt you're hurting your case i think it's also on this also on

780
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,560
the tag it is on the tag

781
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,040
uh...

782
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,700
he did and what was your motive

783
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,680
he didn't do it he says he's taking the floor i thought it would be kind of

784
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,600
funny

785
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,080
i think jungle school looks funny in the little green blankets while like a

786
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,320
little baby

787
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,900
and i kinda wanted some

788
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,700
some fun excitement. I was like whoever's gonna find this is gonna be kind of

789
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,020
funny.

790
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,540
So you did this all just for entertainment value. I did it for fun. I

791
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:07,340
think jungle school had a good time as we kind of he had a good time jungle

792
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,100
school is a you think you showed jungle school a good you gave him a real good

793
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,780
time. I'm

794
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,260
I'm like a

795
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,460
I'm not an evil person.

796
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:24,580
It's very kind of Machiavellian of you to do all this just for a chair.

797
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:25,580
Well that was...

798
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:26,580
It's like you set up the entire thing.

799
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,340
I did the original thing for fun because I thought it was kind of fun to change the board

800
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:36,300
and you know have some office drama as we enter this new office phase of our lives.

801
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
Which I think is a nice thing.

802
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,580
I think we all appreciate it that we're having fun talking about this fun thing.

803
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:45,180
Jungle Skooge I would like to point out is a stuffed animal.

804
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,820
does not have a traditional brown you

805
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,260
jack time from the court

806
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:55,540
okay I love jungle skunk

807
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,220
I love playing games with them I love having fun with them I did not do

808
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,500
anything sinister with him

809
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,580
I'm Patrick I understood Patrick

810
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,180
would likely get you know like

811
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:11,020
whoever came and found it would probably

812
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,620
blame Patrick because that's I mean I wouldn't personally

813
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,520
But you too, I think, definitely would blame Patrick.

814
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,320
You wouldn't blame Patrick when he tweeted the day before "Jungleskoog will go missing"?

815
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Well, I wouldn't blame Patrick because I did it.

816
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,820
You didn't do it. It was Patrick.

817
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,320
I fully take the blame. I did do it. I did take a poop here.

818
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,020
And I'm sorry for any hardship that it's caused.

819
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:43,320
Mainly Patrick, who had to go through the brunt of being, you know, guilty before proven innocent or whatever.

820
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:50,040
I think it was funny. I think it was a fun time and I have the I get the chair and

821
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,120
will you submit to me taking a black light to jungle squeeze body

822
00:57:54,120 --> 00:58:02,560
yeah I yeah I stand by stand by I would never ever ever do anything to physically

823
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,040
harm jungle school and you also stood by well Patrick physically harmed young

824
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,280
school Patrick and I were not here at the same time I cannot speak to any of

825
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,000
those. Patrick could have done something. Patrick probably did it after Joe

826
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,640
faked it. Patrick probably saw that Junglescoog had been missing,

827
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,200
realized he was being framed and decided I might as well attack him and touch him

828
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,520
all over. No. Well I have the chance. That's not what happened. You saw Junglescoog, you

829
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,600
found him and you were so excited you kind of you couldn't control yourself. No.

830
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:42,240
you saw him restrained by a green blanket no said you're mine out loud I did not

831
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:48,320
say that and you gnashed your teeth and licked your lips I and you put and you

832
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,440
took you used the green blanket as a green screen on photo booth and put a

833
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,280
roller coaster behind him and scared him I did do that but these other claims

834
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:02,360
about gnashing my teeth I would like not true I would like to take it whoa he's

835
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,040
He's, oh my god, he's holding Crazy Frog hostage.

836
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,320
He's holding him hostage.

837
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,160
- Yungleskug, no.

838
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,000
- No.

839
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,640
- Why do you hate Crazy Frog?

840
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,240
- Oh my god.

841
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,240
Whoa!

842
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,000
He put him in Phil's crate.

843
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
- Oh, now the ravenous monster that lives in that crate

844
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,280
is gonna eat him.

845
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,120
All right, that's fine.

846
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,200
I don't really like Crazy Frog,

847
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,200
but I would like to take this to a vote.

848
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,360
- Yeah, well, it's a jury.

849
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,800
- A jury, a vote, Joe to vote a jury.

850
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,640
- Yeah.

851
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,480
- We're basically in this--

852
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,720
jury yeah us five are the members of the jury okay we'll just start we'll just go

853
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:43,880
clockwise from the judge here just who's getting the blame it I don't care who

854
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:54,360
did it anymore yeah okay I would as one last piece of evidence I would like to

855
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:00,640
say that Joe told me he did it ten minutes before and I heard Joe say that

856
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,880
(laughing)

857
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,440
- I heard Joe say that.

858
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,940
- His entire thing was just for fun.

859
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,200
(laughing)

860
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,360
- Yeah, Caleb said, "Yeah, we got the wifi."

861
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,720
I was like, "Oh yeah, I saw."

862
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,040
And then I realized, "Oh wait, how do I see it?"

863
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,880
- He gave himself up, yeah.

864
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,280
- I pretty quickly gave myself up.

865
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,640
- And then you started laughing really hard.

866
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,480
- Yeah, 'cause I did that.

867
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,060
- And I heard all of this before we started,

868
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:24,800
and I told you guys I heard it.

869
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,280
And then Joe said, "Why are you so quick to blame me?"

870
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,400
- All right, what's your vote, Caleb?

871
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,900
my vote knowing what I know it's got to be Patrick definitely Alex I think Joe

872
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:45,320
guilty of hiding jungle suit Patrick Patrick guilty of hating jungle scoot

873
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:54,600
daddy being jealous - yeah yes all right Patrick your vote I don't I don't

874
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,440
remember after I ate the Burger King I don't remember what happened you blacked

875
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,520
blacked out I blacked out after I ate Burger King I don't know what happened

876
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:10,120
okay so that's a vote for Patrick. Okay so that's two votes for Patrick. Two for Patrick, one for Joe.

877
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:16,600
Yep. All right Joe what's your vote? I'm gonna vote for myself I desperately want

878
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:21,720
this chair and I did do it. Okay so that's two votes for Patrick and two for

879
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:29,020
for Joe and now I'm the tiebreaker. You're the what one two three four. I

880
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:31,440
voted for Patrick. I voted for me too.

881
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:38,360
Alright, you so not only am I the tiebreaker, but my vote actually counts

882
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,440
100 times as much because I'm the judge and you have to come up with the

883
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,960
punishment as well. Yeah,

884
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,920
and I am going to vote

885
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,320
for Patrick because I believe that he did it and Joe is lying to get his

886
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,520
hands on a really nice really low chair. Maybe his punishment is that he has to

887
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,820
give Joe the chair

888
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:05,920
that is one part with one part of the punishment. I sentence Patrick to

889
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:13,360
payment of a fine to Joe of one fucked up Herman Miller chair that the it's

890
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:20,560
broken that one both the chairs to give Joe both your chairs and you have to

891
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,240
sit on the floor and one hundred years in the dog crate. I will not be going in the

892
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:25,860
dog crate.

893
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:33,320
Court is now adjourned. Do you guys want to go get pizza? Yeah, let's go get some

894

895
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,560
