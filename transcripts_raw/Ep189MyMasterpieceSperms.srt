When they hit your tongue, they weigh it down.

40
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,560
Your tongue just droops out of your mouth.

41
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,240
It unrolls on the ground.

42
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,480
My sperms will make your mouth go numb.

43
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480

53
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040

60
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,680
colanders. My sperms are so strong that they force their way out of my

61
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,800
pee hole when I'm not even touching my thing. They just crawl out and they go

62
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,760

Hugh Grant is the one, he got caught with a sex worker.

109
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,180
And then Jay Leno was like, "What the hell were you thinking you stupid idiot?

110
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180

I don't remember this story.

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
And that's not what Jay Leno says.

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,980
He doesn't curse like that on TV.

115
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
Yeah he does.

116
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,980
He doesn't swear.

117
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Jay Leno swears like a sailor.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
He's polite.

119
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
No he's polite.

120
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,860
Jay Leno's like, "What are you looking at this fucking fat piece of shit on my couch?"

121
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,860
He doesn't do that.

122
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,860
Where are you from?

123
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860

What are you gay?

125
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
He didn't say that.

126
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
Are you gay?

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,860
You're gay from the toilet.

128
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
He didn't say that.

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Now, now, now let me.

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,620

131
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Who was on the couch when he said that?

132
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,900

Oh my god.

136
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,500
Jay Leno had Dame Judi Dench on the couch and he said, "Let me turn around.

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,340

Does he know that she's my treasure?

141
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340

184
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,180
IHOP, so fucking shit man. Terrible, one of the worst restaurants ever.

185
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,980
The worst restaurant ever. Literally the only time it's excusable to go there is if it's

186
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,660
4am. And even then, even then. What? You go to McDonald's after your theater. Oh my god,

187
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:58,740
after your musical. Uh huh. I was never in theater but I went to IHOP. My bad. I went

188
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,060
to IHOP one night-- Take it back. I take it back. I went to IHOP one night after a

189
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,300
musical had like been let out and that was like one of the worst things. Is that

190
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,760
a tradition? Mm-hmm. Theater kids go to IHOP after and then they go to each other's

191
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,780
houses and they all have freaky sex. I would have been an amazing theater kid, dude. I would have been perfect.

192
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,740
Dude, we went to a theater college. My mom tried to get me to go to 50 different times and I was like, "What? You want me to dress up and be gay on stage? Hell no."

193
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,360
I was like I probably would have been a superstar if I did that dude I was almost

194
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,400
if I if I had seen cannibal the musical when I was younger that would have done

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,860
them theaters actually kind of cool yeah you man oh fuck if I was a theater dad

196
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,100
be fucking crazy I would be the worst person that would be fucking insane yeah

197
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,740
thank God I wanted to be cool yeah I'm dude that's all setting to think about

198
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:58,740
me in a theater meet me like the Sun will come out you really want to cut the

199
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:09,900
acting bug just you think oh crap you think you'd play yeah we should raise

200
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,540
the money on like go fund me or some shit so we can do like a stage production of

201
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,060
Annie where I play and it literally it doesn't take any money to do a stage

202
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,340
space production the budget of a gee-haw the budget of a play is just for the

203
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,140
the director's bail yeah for one of the actors do you get a little it's free

204
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,540
what do you think that we could how much you think it costs to rent out Madison

205
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,060
Square Garden for a night like ten bucks yeah if it's if it's like a night

206
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,180
where nothing's happening I bet it's if it's ten thousand dollars should we

207
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,280
should do it we should do it I think carmine was pretty cheap into Carnegie

208
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,980
it's gotta be Madison Square Garden. Dude, Madison Square Garden would be so fucking funny.

209
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,780
Yeah. We just have like that it's completely empty. Two rows of people.

210
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:59,460
Like there's 150 people there and we're just doing also like the same volume on the speakers

211
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,180
as if like Kevin Hart's doing like a packed fucking stadium. Dude, that's so fun. That's

212
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,820
crazy. Doesn't it? Getting it like pro shot, like getting like all the cameras that like fly in.

213
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah. Have the fire. Yeah. I've never thought about that, like how weird that

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,940
Dane Cook special is where he's playing TD Garden.

215
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Where he's in the...

216
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Yeah, TD Garden.

217
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Yeah.

218
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Where he...

219
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
What is that?

220
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,940
Vicious Circle.

221
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Because he's on...

222
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Because the stage is a circle.

223
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Theater in a round.

224
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,460
Yeah, the theater, that's a circle.

225
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,460
Is this supposed to be Dane Cook?

226
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,540
This is the vicious circle that I'm in.

227
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,540
It's in the BK Lounge.

228
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
The terrible...

229
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
That's a good Dane Cook.

230
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
That's a really bad Dane Cook.

231
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
That's a good Dane Cook.

232
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
No.

233
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
Back me up.

234
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
I don't know what Dane Cook sounds like.

235
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Fuck!

236
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,540
No, that was not...

237
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,540
I got a boost of energy all of a sudden.

238
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
You did.

239
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
I think it's because you zipped your jacket up.

240
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,320
What?

241
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,820
You're gonna scream?

242
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,020
We just gotta power through sounds here.

243
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah, you can't.

244
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,580
Because there's so many of them.

245
00:10:52,580 --> 00:11:02,380
You, I, literally, I am mentally incapable of not get it, like, that, there it is again.

246
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,540
I think there is a, I think there is a fight.

247
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,420
I think they're watching videos in this part of the office.

248
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:07,920
Right.

249
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,340
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you headphones to just play white noise all the time.

250
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,840
Yeah.

251
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,900
Maybe I should be the one wearing the headphones.

252
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,540
No, you should be wearing earplugs.

253
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Yeah.

254
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Yeah.

255
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I just never hear a thing you guys are saying.

256
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Do you guys do that?

257
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,740
I've become an earplugs at concerts, man.

258
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Yeah.

259
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
Yeah, I have too.

260
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
They just prick my ears, man.

261
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,660
I like going to a comedy show that has earplugs available.

262
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
That's hilarious.

263
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,820
Like at Union Hall where you can buy them and then buying the earplugs and putting them

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
in.

265
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Just in the middle, yeah.

266
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Sitting front row.

267
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,700
If somebody goes too loud a laugh and just shaking it, ugh.

268
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,220
putting the earplugs in. It does the thing that sucks is it real like I remember

269
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,220
when I would go to like loud shows or whatever as a kid my parents would

270
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,460
always tell me like you have to put your plugs in because like you're gonna lose

271
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,960
your hearing and it sounds you're still gonna hear it it sounds the same or

272
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,460
whatever it does it sounds like shit with your plugs in. It does sound so bad. It's horrible it's it's like so

273
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,420
much less enjoyable. I just don't care. Yeah. Well that's you got to get close to

274
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,980
the stage. I just rather not be at a concert than be at one with earplugs.

275
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
I don't like live music as much as I used to.

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
I don't go to concerts that much.

277
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Yeah, I know, me neither.

278
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
I haven't been going to stuff because it's like, yeah.

279
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
Remember when we saw Have a Nice Life?

280
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Yeah, that was sick.

281
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Yeah, and it was like, I mean, what was it?

282
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
That was, what's that place?

283
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
Great Scott.

284
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Great Scott, yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Good venue.

286
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Yeah, but it was like punishingly loud.

287
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
Yeah, it was sick.

288
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,980
That was like the first time I ever did consider buying it, but it was like, that show was

289
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
at like one in the morning.

290
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
Yeah, it was like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

291
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
I don't know.

292
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,980
I don't know.

293
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I don't know.

294
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,720
Punishingly loud yeah, that was sick. That was like the first time I ever did consider buying it

295
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,660
But it was like that show was that like 1 in the morning. Yeah, that was weird

296
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,060
I hate when you're at a show like that you go outside to smoke a cigarette

297
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,880
And then everybody everybody's talks at such a loud volume because they're all fucked up in the ears

298
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,260
Yeah

299
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Hey, can I bum a cig up you?

300
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Let me get a cig!

301
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
You smoking Camel Blue?

302
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,260
Oh dude, love it!

303
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,260
The show is awesome!

304
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,260
It's not a guy from the show, it's just a guy who walks up to you on Instagram.

305
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
Hey!

306
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Can I have one?

307
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
What's up?

308
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,260
What's that?

309
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,260
I learned to speak from a bird!

310
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
What's that in your mouth?

311
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
You wanna buy a taffy?

312
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
You sound like the taffy salesman.

313
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,260
Peanut brittle?

314
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Can I interest you in a gumdrop?

315
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Here's a CD!

316
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
It's me and my friends, we're in a barbershop quartet!

317
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:33,660
listen to it. But it ain't free though. You listen to it. Hello. Hello. It's getting louder. Do you want to buy toffee and sweets?

318
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,460
You want to come to my house? We are the four sweet boys. We can't hang out in my house. We can sit in my car.

319
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:46,560
The four sweet boys from Dorchester. We need to become a... And we're a barbershop quartet. We need to start doing

320
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,860
Candy Grounds. And that's their only original song and then all the other songs are E40 songs.

352
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,500
something. I don't remember. You wrote an article called like the E40. E40 actually

353
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,900
doesn't like butt meat. What E40's butt smells like, an investigation. I would investigate

354
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:54,860
yeah yeah probably smells like enormous yeah 40s day yeah 40 pound but yeah you

355
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,080
know he has I got a 40 pound boy he has he has he has wine he has like his own

356
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,420
vineyard Oh Earl Stevens Reserve and I he's got Santana DVS guess it makes you

357
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,380
wanna have sex he I got a bottle of his wine and it's like it's like supposed to

358
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,420
be like a red wine like a Pinot Grigio or whatever and it literally tastes like

359
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,900
lemonade it's like it's sparkling it's like soda yes fucking delicious I bet

360
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:26,460
that's so good it's so good like a wine bottle yeah but it's like wine is one of

361
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,620
those things where I feel like if I drank enough of it I would start to like it

362
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,940
but I don't why would I want to drink enough wine I'd get addicted to it I

363
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,540
probably like get really drunk if I drank enough wine I don't like it's the

364
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,580
same thing as like like growing up and drinking tasting coffee and being like

365
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
"Bleh!"

366
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Yeah.

367
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,580
And now it's like, "Oh, I like it."

368
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,580
Or beer, dude.

369
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,980
My dad used to give me sips of beer every day.

370
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,780
I hated beer until I was like 14.

371
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
Yeah, same.

372
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
And I was at a party.

373
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
I did not like beer for a very long time.

374
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
I was at a party.

375
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,780
It was all they had.

376
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
And then I just kind of like, I looked at it and I was like, "Hmm, well."

377
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,780
And then like took a big, I think I chugged the can.

378
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,660
Because I was like, "Oh, if I just chug it, then it'll go down faster."

379
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,300
What's the first drink you ever had?

380
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,660
I think mine was Mike's Hard.

381
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,220
Pineapple soda and vodka.

382
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Mine was vodka.

383
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,920
I don't remember what was mixed in,

384
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
but there was something mixed in.

385
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,320
- Mine was Mike's heart when I was like

386
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,520
something pretty young. - Crazy like soda.

387
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,360
- It was just something from a convenience store.

388
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
- And then I remember being like,

389
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,000
oh, that's awesome, I like drinking.

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,420
And then like the next week, I filled a Solo cup,

391
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,280
I like raided my parents' liquor cabinet,

392
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,320
filled a Solo cup with half vodka, half Hennessy.

393
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
I was like, that's a mixed drink.

394
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,480
- Yeah. - And I just, it was awful.

395
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,040
- I would drink straight vodka too

396
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,640
when I was starting to drink.

397
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
- My uncle-- - It's cool.

398
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,520
- My dad's uncle, so my great uncle,

399
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,980
- Donald, no, Dennis, I don't know if it doesn't matter.

400
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,740
- Donald Dennis Draco.

401
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,800
- My uncle Denise.

402
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,640
- My uncle Draco.

403
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,840
- My uncle Denise, he came over one Christmas

404
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,760
and left like a handle,

405
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,200
like this had to be like $100 worth of Bacardi.

406
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Like it was like the biggest handle

407
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,440
I think I've ever seen in my life of Bacardi.

408
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,940
And he left it, my parents hid it under the kitchen sink.

409
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,180
And me and my like two brothers would like sneak,

410
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,620
drinks we would make ourselves like mixed drinks and then just use the computer

411
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,940
you know like we would do like you know we didn't have cars or anything. You're just drinking to sit in your house.

412
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,140
Yes when you're like 14. Which I would never do now. Yeah no oh no believe me I would not have

413
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,820
two beers and fall asleep around the TV. I hate drinking and just sitting in my house watching TV.

414
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:28,460
But we would all like sneak drinks and then like not together so none of it we

415
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,140
didn't organize this at all so each time someone would sneak we would fill it up

416
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,260
with water. So by the end, we just had a Bacardi thing full of water.

417
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,780
Yeah, I got in trouble for... I didn't fill it up with water, but I got in trouble.

418
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:46,460
My mom got mad at me because the vodka was gone and stuff. Yeah, it's

419
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,380
bad. Because you're also a little too young to get away

420
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,980
with that. Yeah, yeah. Where it's like, "Oh my god, my son drank half a bottle of

421
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,060
vodka." I went to this kid that I didn't... I stopped really

422
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,860
hanging out with him after this happened.

423
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,380
But we were at his house, I went to his house after school

424
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,340
and we like drank some of his parents vodka

425
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,420
and we're sitting in the kitchen and then like cleaned it up

426
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,940
but then like some of the vodka spilled

427
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,620
onto a paper towel roll and then he picked up

428
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,980
the paper towel roll and just lit it on fire.

429
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,020
So the whole thing of paper, like it lit on fire

430
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,980
and then it's like two minutes at like, not even,

431
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,260
like he was just sitting there standing

432
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:33,060
with the thing on fire and then his mom walked in the back door and looked at

433
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,460
him and it's like what the fuck are you doing and then me and my other friend

434
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,300
just bolted out of his house and I don't really I never really. I've never had

435
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,100
one of those drinks where they set the top on fire. Oh, I want to have a

436
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,580
flaming most so bad to just get your mouth flaming hurt your mouth drinking

437
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,560
it. I think you maybe would flaming. What's the one where you where you you

438
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,440
drink it and then you light the like trail into the cup and it like dynamite

439
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,100
dynamite. Yeah, what's the one where you only drink a little bit of it and then

440
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,780
you put like a cloth into it and you shake it up, you light it on top and you

441
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,840
soda, you throw it at a Coca Cola, a British guy's car. Molotov cocktail.

442
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,780
Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah. No, but I've never, I've always wanted to have

443
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,040
one of those drinks, they light on fire. I'm not a fan, I don't want my food to

444
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,380
be on fire, I'll say it. Then you've never had baked Alaska. Yeah, somebody

445
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,660
never had baked Alaska. What's baked Alaska? Oh, nothing. Remember that Betty

446
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,900
- It's like a rocker cake commercial with the molds.

447
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,400
It's like the three-tier mold system.

448
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,080
- I do not want to eat a moldy cake.

449
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,100
- Oh, hell no.

450
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,940
- No.

451
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,780
- But it's like the mold thing where it's like,

452
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,280
"You can make ice cream cake.

453
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,260
"You can even make baked Alaska."

454
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,340
That's how I found out about baked Alaska

455
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,300
and I wanted my mom to make that so bad.

456
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,900
- They catch on fire a cake.

457
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,740
- A catch on fire cake.

458
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,940
- It's a cake on fire.

459
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,780
- It's an ice cream cake and it catches the top on fire.

460
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Yeah, candles if you're fucking stupid.

461
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,340
This is an ancient Inuit tradition.

462
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,820
would make an ice cream cake, they'd cover it in vodka, and then they'd catch it on fire.

463
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,160
Yeah. I wanna eat fried ice cream so bad. Fried ice cream is so good. We used to make

464
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,060
fried ice cream when I was a kid, but it was just corn, you just put it in corn

465
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,260
flakes. What? You just roll around a ball of ice cream into corn flakes. I wanna eat the fried

466
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,980
ice cream from Whippersnappers in Londonderry, New Hampshire right now. How

467
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,980
do you fry ice cream? How does that make any goddamn sense? It's great, it's so good, you fry it.

468
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:25,980

there's a kid in it yeah, which did you you're the michael from wayfair what the

501
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,580
hell is a bed yeah. What the hell there's no damn kid in this. I'm sending it back

502
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,660
yeah. That was the funniest conspiracy. That was the telltale one was when was

503
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,920
when I saw the the the bed frame that's that was called Luke Skywalker. I was

504
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,860
like I know they're sending me Luke's yeah Luke's in here. John's all the other

505
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,680
ones that come you know

506
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:43,780
grown woman. Hey, how you doing? You want to buy me cigarettes? I don't know how old I am.

507
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:51,780
You've been sitting in a cabinet for fucking 20 years? Yeah, they fed me beans most of my life.

508
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,140
What do you guys think happened with her? I think a lot of the consensus by like women with

509
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,860
bangs is that Burke Ramsey did it. And that's a professional wrestler? Burke

510
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,200
Mark Ramsey is like the brother. I think that the whole family did it and they

511
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,300
were alien robots. The little, the like young brother? The older brother. But

512
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,560
he's still young, right? I don't know. How old was he? People think that he was

513
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,620
like a psycho and then he killed John Bonnet and then the parents covered it

514
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,920
up. In that book I read, they said that the parents- They never found her bones

515
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,760
or anything, right? The parents did it because they were like, they were like

516
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,720
connected to the CIA or something. Yeah. Yeah. I personally think that she was a

517
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,440
vampire. Mm-Hmm. I see they thought she ran Z. Yeah, there's no way yeah, she's

518
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,260
actually a mummy.

519
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,460
Scary mz. Yeah, yeah, and she was not dead. She was actually beginning her

520
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,620
life. I think it's a honey. I shrunk the kid situation. Yeah, do you think they

521
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,480
shrank her? I think they shrank her and she's been living with ants and little

522
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,860
tiny pieces of doesn't be crazy. If it's like

523
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,500
John Bonet just grew up to be Amanda Seyfried or something

524
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,980
I feel like that's like a fantasy you're having.

525
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,700
No.

526
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,820
Wouldn't it be crazy if she grew up being a manatee breed?

527
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,140
No, it's like crazy she's like-

528
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,160
I grew up to be Justin Long.

529
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,980
It's a little too specific.

530
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,400
Yeah.

531
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,920
Wouldn't it be crazy if, I don't know, I was married to Nelly Furtado?

532
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
That would be- I would not marry her.

533
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,120
She has a whole song about her being a promiscuous girl.

534
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,140
But she also has a song where she's like a bird.

535
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,140
That doesn't balance promiscuity in a marriage.

536
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,660
You would-

537
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,680
She also has a song about being a man eater.

538
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, she's a man eating bird. I would-

539
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,460
Look out, Haji Beats.

540
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,920
your other son, right? I am a man eating bird. You know that Haji beats is

541
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,640
married to Nelly Furtado. They have a kid really yep. Wow congrats. Yeah, I'd

542
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,360
like to smell her stodgy feet.

543
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,520
I would actually yeah, I bet she wears wooden sandals and I'd just love to

544
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,840
peel them off and yeah that hey that child I'd hate to say that she's

545
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,160
probably going to have an odd future.

546
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,680
That's right,

547
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,440
probably go up to be a rescue a scroll

548
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,080
the that shows that we're gonna grow up into a long

549
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,160
you won't give a fuck

550
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,640
man the trust and wolfgang

551
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,120
and you're calling out with uh... at at a camp flocked out of all of my bed last

552
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,400
night with my nightmare

553
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,240
yeah

554
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,360
it's not a prior right now i had a dream about that i had a dream but trunkett

555
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,400
i have a full

556
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
hoping that i have a look at that

557
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,800
i think that i have a good

558
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,360
I had a dream that I was the cockroach from Yonkers.

559
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
I got eaten.

560
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,960
I got eaten by this gay guy.

561
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,640
And you screamed in your pants.

562
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Yeah?

563
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Mhm.

564
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
You did when you got eaten.

565
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
You made scream out your thing.

566
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,160
Do you guys remember how awesome it was when Tyler the Creator ate a bug?

567
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I know.

568
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,960
It was like, "I'm a freaking sweet bug eater.

569
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,120
I'm a guy who eats a bug.

570
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm a hot eating, drinking, blood eater."

571
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,760
I thought it was really gross when Tyler the Creator ate the bug.

572
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,920
I was happy that he knew he did was right and he hung himself right after that's

573
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,720
right. That's what he did was wrong. I a guy who eats a bug. I'm a free

574
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,000
you

575
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,320
I'm just the guy who died and hung himself because I ate a bug again.

576
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
That's

577
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,280
you know that's why he hangs himself in the video, because

578
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,000
the bug he still had the bug taste in his mouth, couldn't get rid of it.

579
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,960
Rather die than have a bug in that video dude. I saw when I saw that so

580
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,840
13. Oh my God, changed my life. Yeah, me too. I was eating bugs left and right.

581
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,240
I wanted to buy that stupid Odd Future Cloud button down, remember that? As soon as Earl

582
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,880
got out of, as soon as Earl got out of bad kid school. That, that. It was so fun, people

583
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,760
were like, "Free Earl!" We have to save him from high school. Yeah. His mom sent him to

584
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,560
like a, a. His mom sent, yeah, because he made 50,000 songs about rape by the time he

585
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,280
was 13. Yeah. I would have done the same thing, dude. Me too. I would have been like, "Get

586
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,040
the fuck out of here, dude. You're not living next to these kids, dude." She was just being

587
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,400
responsible parent probably can you imagine if you're a bit it was a

588
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,560
knowing Tyler the Creator yeah like from a play date he's eating bugs in your

589
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,400
living room feeling not did you're going to be a school bro yeah but it was

590
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,320
annoying like having to go to oh I don't know Samoa I was probably beautiful

591
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,520

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,960

596
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:36,240
he kind of that's how I found out about sexual assault it is so fun I again is

597
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,960

to sleep once upon a time not long ago when people wear pajamas in them.

621
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,880
That song is in Tony Hawk's proving ground. That's Lincoln Park jay-z

- It's not about guns or sex or any of that stuff.

633
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,120
It's about crawling in my skin.

634

- I saw a frog that was weird, it had a beard,

647
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,120

657
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,600

661
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,600
- The king, the king dude, he's like the best.

662
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,100
- I love Billy Brown.

663
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,940
- The best ever.

664
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,200
Remember when a lady sucked his penis when he was on stage?

665
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,040
- Yeah.

666
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,120
- And remember like, what's her name, Kitty Pride?

667
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:34,960
- Yeah.

668
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,560
- A thing that was like, that was actually not very cool.

669
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,200
And you see the video and he's like pointing at her head

670
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,040

671
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,560

672
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,120
He's like, she's like, that's my friend.

673
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,700
And actually he hated that and it ruined his relationship.

674
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,320
And in the video, the girl starts sucking his dick

675
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,400
and he's just pointing at her head like, oh yeah, fuck yeah!

676
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,280
So cool, dude.

677
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:02,360
He's the man. He had the funniest tweet I think I've ever seen where it was like, "Grand Theft

678
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,120
Auto Ballad of Gay Tony, what am I going to do commissions for a peep?"

He is?

684
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
He's obsessed with persona. He's the best.

685
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120

outside when they're in the hospital area and now the girls like I don't

it's

713
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,160
so fucking funny dude. The fact that like they hired the most annoying guy in the

714
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,240
world to be the one who talks over the entire movie. Well, that's that's the

715
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,840
guy who would have the can yeah, no it works. I hate him yeah, that's the guy

716
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,160
who would have the camcorder yeah, yeah, because he's just he's so it's so funny

717
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,560
on knowing he isn't that because the for the whole beginning of that movie is him

718
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,860
was going to people be like say something to the camera and they're like

719

791
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,480

792
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,700

793
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,540

794
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,380
- I have spikes on my head.

795
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,780
- I had a fucking dream last night that I had no more hair

796
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:29,940
and then the top of my head was all zits and pus and cysts.

797
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,380
- Cysts too, really?

798
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,920
- In addition to the zits and the pus?

799
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,760
- Yeah.

800
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,580
- No way.

801
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,780
- God damn that's disgusting.

802
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,040
- I tried to look up--

803
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,780
- Zits and pus on hair, my dream.

804
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,080
- A dream, yeah, like one of those dream analyzer things

805
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,020
and I realized, oh yeah, I'm literally having a stress

806
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,020
dream about getting a zit on my head.

807
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,780
I know myself well enough that I would be so neurotic.

808
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,980
Yeah, if you have to look up what a dream means, it doesn't mean anything

809
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,740
exactly. Yeah, it's all either. It's either yeah, you have a dream that you

810
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,460
have a dream where your boss says you didn't do your work right or you a

811
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,880
dream where you are a dinosaur. Yeah, yeah, I don't think dreams mean

812
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,900
anything. Yeah, the older I get, I don't think that, but then it will be

813
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,020
like I will have a dream where it's like where I have a dream where it's

814
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,860
like I need to do something and then I wake up and like oh, I forgot to do

815
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,520
thing yeah like I've fought Megatron and I wake up with a puddle of nuts I'm like

816
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
what does this mean that means you have to fight Megatron that means I have to

817
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,120
fight Megatron and when I do it's gonna be so awesome that I get hands-free nut

818

where you suck you do that and then and then you pull out the lips show up.

like a mummy in here. It's literally every, all of our poops mixed together.

905
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,720
it's not only the smell to the density of the air and there is different yeah

906
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,900
because also when somebody it'll be like someone takes a really smelly shit and

907
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,700
then then lights three candles and closes the door and you walk in and it's

908
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,520
like ten degrees warmer in there and it's like it's like a poop fog. All the

00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700

914
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,700

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:35,520
network right wash no smosh cast no they can't make this much you can change the

952
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,560

953
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,200
Smosh is owned by cheeseburger network. Smosh is stronger than ever.

993
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:55,780
You know when people are like, "Oh, when I turn 80, I'm gonna start doing poop all the time. I'm gonna start sniffing poop and piss all the time. Who cares? I'm 80 years old."

994
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:09,780
The drug kid at your school? You know the kid that like, he hangs out with, like you hang out, you let him hang out because he will buy you, or let you buy, like, he has the like connections, but he always has the worst shit.

995
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,280
and he's always telling you about like the like,

996
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,980
like, oh yeah, like there's this drug called this

997
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,800
and it makes you do this.

998
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,640
There's this kid--

999
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,040
- Whoa, this drug called this and it makes you do this?

1000
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,880
- There's this kid, his name was Brent.

1001
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,120
- It's a recursive drug.

1002
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,040
When you take this, you do this.

1003
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
- There's this kid named Brent,

1004
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
he sat at my lunch table and would like,

1005
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,880
I think he sold weed to like two of my friends

1006
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,440
and he ripped them off so bad

1007
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,800
that like they stopped hanging out with him.

1008
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,520
But he told one of my friends

1009
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,000
that if you hold your fingers near your butt

1010
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,120
or something like that and hold it there for long enough

1011
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,000
and you sniff it, it can get you so high it'll kill you.

1012
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,240
(laughing)

1013
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,880
And I remember-- - Near your butt?

1014
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,300
- You hold it like, you hold your fingers on your taint

1015
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,340
and the smell can get you so high it'll kill you.

1016
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,560
And I remember one of my friends telling me like--

1017
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,400
- He died.

1018
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,520
- Like Brent told me like this, and I was like,

1019
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,920
Yeah, Brent's a fucking liar.

1020
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,400
He died from sniffing his taint finger.

1021
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
You could die from that.

1022
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,600
Maybe that's what stink finger is about.

1023
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,360
It'd be cool.

1024
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,720
Stink fist. Stink finger is Limp Bizkit.

1025
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,720
There's a Limp Bizkit song called Stink Finger.

1026
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,520
Maybe that's what it's about.

1027
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Stinky finger!

1028
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,520
Chocolate starfish, bitch!

1029
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,720

I know you be smelling my tits!

1031
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,920

1032
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,220
that like when I turn eighty, I'm going to do like a million drugs and you turn

1033
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,940

00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,160

00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,880

I used to wear so many joggers.

1077
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,740
Joggers are the fucking worst pair of pants in the world.

1078
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,260
They suck, bro. They break all the time.

1079
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,260
If you wear-

1080
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,260
What are joggers? What's joggers?

1081
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,700
Joggers are like the pants with the elastic cuffs.

1082
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.

1083
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,180

00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,180
Yeah.

1085
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:50,580
I had a pair- dude, I bought them because I was like, "Oh, this is like- they're like

1086
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,780
like ten bucks. They were jean material with like elastic like things. I wore

1088
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,180
I was like.

1089
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:05,500
I also have some joggers. Joggers I feel like are nice if, not for jogging, but if

1090
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,460
it's really, if it's cold. That's nice. It keeps the heat from your balls and

1091
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,700
wiener and, and, well yeah, it's like sweat pants.

1092
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,420
I'm very pro wearing sweat pants out and about.

1093
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,420

00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,420
I hate sweat pants.

1096
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,420
I love sweat pants.

1097
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,220
Yeah, when I was in high school, I literally would wear pajamas to school

1098
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:27,580
every day. I do that great sweatpants challenge fairly often. I don't know what it is. I literally

1099
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:35,900
if I'm not wearing something with a belt on it or whatever. I hate the way that any clothes

1100
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:41,660
that aren't pajamas, I hate the way they feel on my skin. I can't stand it. I'm the exact
