1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,580
Well, on the way here is what is what I saw. So we were talking about now.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,420
Well, you were gone Caleb, but the ridiculousness of these twenty twenty

3
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,320
four glasses. They don't know where to put the circles. I mean the holes well

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,420
like circle. It seems like they figured it out that no. I saw the craziest

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,460
twenty twenty four glasses on the way here, sitting on someone sitting on

6
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,020
someone's

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:37,240
dashboard, dashboard, so basically it was imagine it was it said the circles.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,900
It was two circles for the eyes, two o's, so it's two zeros, two zero zero

9
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,140
right all on one line and then above off to the right of the other zero of the

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,540
second zero. It said twenty four, so it's two hundred to the twenty four

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,740
two hundred to the twenty fourth power. Holy well, how do you know that they're

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,480
got a geek or a dork and or they're from the future. Yeah, I think twenty

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,280
thousand and twenty four person, but it was crazy to put the extra zero and

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,600
then put the twenty four off to the side. That's the craziest solution I've

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
seen yet. Yeah, that's the like this. I just felt like I have to share,

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,520
because we talked about this at length before, but it's just I just saw. He

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,640
said that this was a dying puppy and you got to feed it the Big Mac and put

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,040
it to sleep. Why do people do that with their dogs? Feed them a big man, but

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
they're not going to remember they're dead. You know who I was thinking about

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,220
it last night in bed, Liz Warren, letting her dog eat a cold burrito off the

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,860
floor for its birthday. Yeah. What the hell? Why do people do... You don't

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,940
remember this? Fed on the floor. Did everybody fucking... Fed the dog on the

23
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,180
floor. Did Liz Warren get a fucking memory hold, y'all? She got a fucking

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,320
memory hold, bro. Not the memory hole. She... But she put... Don't throw me in

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,580
the memory hole. She put a cold burrito on the floor, on the rug.

26
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,460
she's not going to heat it. A rug is a crazy move. It's on the road.

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,940
From across the room. When you say

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,820
you're getting heated, it's a weird video. You're getting heated about a

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,660
thing to do, but it also you can do that with a big dog. It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,220
A big dog dog is not on the rug. Put it on the hardwood. It

31
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,820
reaches. She has a cleaning lady buys another

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,420
wood for even then it's the principle. She has a fully carpeted house. She's

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,940
the day principle. She looks like the principle. That's like my principle.

34
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,280
that's fire and I'll pound that shit out. We almost pulled a prank on you guys

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,700
today, me and Jonah. Yeah. 'Cause I went to this thing, did this work for him

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,800
and most of it was taking up all this carpet. He said, "What if we go to the

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,080
office and we put 300 square feet of carpet down in every single part of the

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,340
office?" Oh, I brought a rug. I got a rug. I know, I saw that. But I said no

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,660
because I thought that you would... I thought you would think it was funny and

40
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,460
I thought you would be really mad. I wouldn't be mad at all. I thought you'd

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,640
be really just carpeting the office, just carpeting the entire office and then

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,760
imagine this you get here. Oh, I was at the gym all day and I'm so tired. Open

43
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,120
the door, me and Jonah sitting there

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,500
holding our faces like this going

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,540
and you see you at first again. I site is at a head level, so you're seeing me

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,380
and Jonah were two different heights. So you look at Jonah's very tall. Then you

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,980
look at me and then you look down carpet all over the floor. I don't think I

48
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,660
would even be mad at. I'm not sure I would react. I would be like oh, that's

49
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,700
kind of weird. I don't think I would like it, but I think that I wouldn't like it.

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,060
I guess I could tell you're mad. Maybe I have another question. Do you guys

51
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,860
fucking hate me?

52
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,260
You guys fucking hate me. Wish I was fucking dead. Bad prank. That is a bad

53
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,860
prank. I'm not good at pranks, man. I'm famously bad. I don't have a prank face.

54
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,820
I haven't is this. I haven't done pranks since when I was a kid. I did the

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
bucket of water on the door to my brother and he cried. You do this when

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,420
you're my older brother, six years old. You have no poker face for pranks is

57
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,100
when you do a prank, you have a little you have like a bobble head thing. I

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,080
don't bobble my

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,900
this you go.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,060
I don't double it

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,980
all my head the other day. I got a fake poop and I put it on my kitchen

62
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,500
counter as soon as I got it. I zero planning put it on my kitchen counter

63
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,940
and my wife walked in got home from work and I said I'm so bad at pranks. I

64
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,620
said Hey baby, can you get me a glass of water and I was closer to the kitchen

65
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,700
when she was I was doing nothing. I was just sitting in the hallway. Can you get

66
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,740
me a glass of water?

67
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,040
It didn't work man. She walked in and she was like yeah, there's there's a fake

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,940
poop on the yeah. I'm also pretty bad. We were talking about the master troll

69
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,980
the other day. I remember I was trying to think of of trolling I had done in

70
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,540
the past, and I remember something I did in college that I completely forgot

71
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,700
about the people got mad at me for what which was you remember how college it

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,100
was like they had the it was like a TV net like a school TV network where you

73
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,720
get shows and there's like they have a staff and you make like you know,

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,760
however many episodes or whatever, and I never did any of that, but on Facebook I

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,060
posted I made a fake poster for a show for that call. I remember this shit

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,340
fucks and I said

77
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,100
I'm excited to announce I'm making one of these shows.

78
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,320
Please message them on Facebook and ask to be if you want to be on the crew

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,260
and like we're going to have a meeting in this room on this day at this time,

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,900
and it was completely not true and fake and a bunch of people messaged the like

81
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,540
the school organization and be like hey. Can I work on this shit fucks and

82
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,680
everyone got really mad at me because it wasn't real. We used to be more into

83
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,180
trolling and back row. My God, that was how I think that's how we how we all

84
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,720
started hanging out sign that said. If you see something in appropriate of

85
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,960
trolling, yeah, we did, we did, but the master trolls, yeah, the master troll.

86
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,560
Do you submit to him? I did a prank in college where I stole somebody's

87
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,840
headphones, very expensive headphones. I remember that prank. I remember that

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,080
That's a prank. That's not a prank. I you know, it's a prank that we did in college.

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,520
Someone pranked me today. I stole my wallet. What? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I fucking I was coming

90
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,040
back from that thing. I stop in the smoke shop. This this is why I know this is why

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,840
I drop my wallet. I walk in the smoke shop. I hand the guy my or I walk up to the thing

92
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,600
and there's nobody behind the counter and I am like hello and I see movement in the

93
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,100
at the corner of my eye and they have a the door to the bathroom is open and the

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,260
mirror is

95
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,440
like I can see in the mirror. The guy who's supposed to be running the front

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,940
is wiping his ass and running off the toilet. He's like taking a shit

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,020
actively and then he comes in and I was like okay man. I just want to pack us

98
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,860
in and he like walks up to me and he goes like this

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,460
and he fits he wants a fist bump. So I gave him the limpest least contact

100
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm why did you want a fist bump for because I saw him take a shit that made

101
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,340
no sense. I've never fist bumped anybody at any cash register ever a prank do

102
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,400
and then you have this guy or something theory and then, so I was so flustered

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,080
that I guess I dropped my wallet on the way back. I got a call from a barber

104
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,740
shop. They googled me and found my phone number and called me. Oh, my God,

105
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,960
that's crazy. That crazy. I don't even know I had lost my wallet. They saw

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,140
your crazy videos. They saw all my videos exactly. I walked in and they

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,640
said, are you the master? Trey, you the master, they would not know he's the

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,620
master troll. He's not the master troll. Also, I used to be. I don't you don't

109
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,060
at all, bro. You're a zero. You literally you're a little trolled in

110
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,180
the wire dot com. Look at me in the wire dot com has been completely trolled.

111
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm looking at you. You're a zero. You're I troll you're trolling me right

112
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,500
now. You're attempting you're failing. I'm looking at you. I'm looking at

113
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,680
doesn't troll at all. Oh, you are not a troll. You know, I am the man. I'm the

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,380
name name five trolls. You've done five right now. I told okay speaking of the

115
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,820
same thing, the same group on Facebook. I told all of them that I would I would

116
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,700
buy. I pretended that I was going to buy every single kid at school

117
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,940
menthol jewel pods because I said I commute from New Hampshire and I'll buy

118
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,340
them for you. Even if you're under age, I don't care and I put it in the group

119
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,180
and every people got mad at much, much closer. People got by the way. I got

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,700
messages that said I think you shouldn't do this much closer to a

121
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,160
crime than a troll. That's most much closer to a master troll knows that

122
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,840
crime not eater on so trollers on crime years on crimes. I would say yes,

123
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,640
that's what I just said. I rolled in that scenario. The trolled yourself.

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,540
Seems like you trolled yourself. Congratulations. You told you troll the

125
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,400
admins of the group. Thank you very much. That was the master troll at

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,040
work. They have a way that admins leave alone. I rather what else out. What

127
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
leave out the admins from the troll.

128
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,760
What else

129
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,460
there was one okay, but there was a very there was a comment from I remember

130
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,200
sending this to you guys, because they sent this one really long paragraph about

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,940
how they said, like he

132
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,280
he's so deeply irony

133
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,180
they seem like you got this. I got this. I got this. I still listening the

134
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,120
first, all the one troll. No, so you still have one more seven years ago.

135
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,140
What else did I do? Four more trolls to describe. Four more trolls, okay.

136
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,740
One of my master troll things I did in high school where I made a folder on

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,860
the computer at the school, it was all the same JPEG,

138
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,000
and it was two gigabytes big and it said, "Important documents," and the

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,920
computer teacher went through every single one to make sure that there was

140
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,540
no important documents is what he told me. You stole this from like a

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,520
green text screenshot. That is not a green text. No, that is not a

142
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,500
master troll. That's no. You're just jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,180
you're jealous of you. You haven't trolled in years. And I'm not saying

144
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,420
I put that I put those days behind me. So you're not the man. You're not the

145
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,660
best.

146
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,740
You're terrible. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

147
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,180
because I put the it's like when a cowboy hangs up his gun, we have some

148
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,980
meaning. He's done. He's not a cowboy.

149
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,940
like John Mars, Cowboys, go. It's like when Cowboys Cowboys and then they have

150
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,460
one. That's my only real. So your one last thing about Cowboys, by the way,

151
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,060
in context, I gotta be honest with you. That was not a troll. They just find

152
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,580
tweets that are in

153
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,020
a relation. I wrote for the Golden Globes. They put funny thing. They don't

154
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,380
think, they never said, and writer Patrick Doran. No, no, and the bottom,

155
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,620
at the bottom of it, at the bottom of it, it said, "He threw his writers

156
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,340
to the wolves."

157
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,580
but you read the article, but it didn't say anything about you being a writer.

158
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,860
Yeah, the tweet said that I was a writer on the Golden Globe. They just put that

159
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,060
in because they thought it was funny. I don't think so. You're the master of

160
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,420
funny. Yeah, we can agree with that. Yeah, you're the master of the master

161
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,980
jokester. You're the master jokester. Okay, maybe I'm less of a troll and more

162
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,620
of a jester, I guess. You're the master jester. Master jester. I'll accept master

163
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,020
jester, but do you submit to the master jester? Yes, I submit to the master

164
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,500
jester. Why do I have to submit? But sure I do. Okay, alright, that's all I

165
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,780
wanted to know all week is do you submit to the master troll, but now it's

166
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,740
Master Jester. Master Jester is a really cool name. Master Jester is a better name.

167
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,540
Master Jester. Kind of hard to say. Damn, Master Jester. I think there's a secret troll

168
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,900
among us though. And who disses? Who is the actual master troll, Kaiser Soze style.

169
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,460
Aye. And he's sitting behind the production computer right now. He barely

170
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:05,060
trolls. He doesn't troll that much often. DJ Jubio, by the way. DJ Jubio? DJ Jubio.

171
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,940
I like DJ Jubio. DJ Jubio does not troll. Well, what's going on? He could troll us

172
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,460
right now and we don't know. He could make the episode really fast.

173
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,860
A troll is not a troll if nobody knows. Interesting. That's true. But what if it's the long troll?

174
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,500
What? What if it's the long troll? Well then someone will eventually know and then it becomes

175
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,620
a troll. It's just what I think. This is a trolling 101. Trolling 101. Trolling 102.

176
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,160
This is a troll like 102. An advanced troll, 201. Let's be real. This is a major one. Speaking

177
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,080
of getting, of trolling yourself, last night I finally learned you put the zins in the

178
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,620
top lip, not the bottom. It's called an upper decker for a reason. Yeah, but it says it

179
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,940
on the tin. It says it on the tin, put it on your top lip. Really? Because if you put

180
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,820
it on the bottom, there's too much saliva. You put it on your lip? That ain't gonna work,

181
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,820
man. You put it right here. I was putting it right there. You put it on your lip. You're

182
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,740
You're kissing the zin. I'm kissing the zins. Yes, I am. You're not supposed to do that.

183
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,260
Oh, I need to. Why? Because I love them. Well, that's sweet. Well, that's actually very sweet.

184
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:15,820
I actually completely love them. Guys, can I tell you something? Yes. I'm sick of birthday

185
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:26,380
parties. Wow. That's the wrong one. Wrong one. Thank you. I'm sick of birthday parties.

186
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,180
and here's why

187
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,740
what yeah you're sick of birthday parties. Oh

188
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,480
and it's not the people's parties. I'm sick of the what has become recently a

189
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,740
birthday party. So I've been getting these emails, these messages, these text

190
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,140
part of all nestles party fall. I'm sick of party for I do not need to RSVP to a

191
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,860
birthday party. It's that simple. Here's what used to happen. Okay, you get a text

192
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,900
used to people used to throw birthday parties when you're a little kid.

193
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,980
people would say it's your it's my birthday. It's your birthday. I'm

194
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,260
throwing a party. It's my birthday. I'm throwing a party. They would invite

195
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,220
people and then they don't know if people are coming until the day of the

196
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,700
party, and then either people would show up, you'd have a grand time. Right,

197
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,220
this is before telephones. Nobody would show up and then that's good because

198
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,180
kids are losers and that's what they deserve. If you don't have any friends,

199
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,340
you shouldn't have a birthday party. You learn from that. So that's what I

200
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,420
think is so disgusting about this is the fact that I have to say, and I always

201
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,720
maybe yeah, I know and then you feel bad because you hit maybe and then I never

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,040
go and then you see the comments on it. Yeah, the comment thing and this is

203
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,060
everyone else. I'm gonna be there ever and I'm bringing a million beers. Many

204
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,380
things should have stayed analog in this world and should not have gotten

205
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,360
technology involved in it. Are you about to pull your tooth out? Oh God, why

206
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,760
did I just have a fear? You think that my teeth are that bad? Yes, yeah, I saw

207
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,620
him earlier when you're showing me your lip and I was like any any second one of

208
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,940
these could pop out. These are the hippo game where you touch the teeth. That's

209
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,000
it's not a hippo. It's a crocodile. It's a crocodile, though. I played the hip over

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,040
the hippo is the hungry one. Yeah, he's hungry for your finger. Yeah. Well, no,

211
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,160
he's not. I told you to scare me so bad.

212
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,460
I was going to bring

213
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,320
why did they invent this startling game that game? That's the fun of the game

214
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,460
and that game, I think, is the reason why we're afraid of crocodiles in this

215
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,100
country. I would think it was more of dentists. Maybe that's the fear that I

216
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,140
got from that you're afraid of dentists because

217
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,320
because of the game because of this crocodile dentist, I think that is

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,300
afraid of powering to the dentist user because you bite that you can just bite

219
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,040
well when you play when you play as the evil dentist to this lowly crocodile,

220
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,460
you realize how evil the dentist is.

221
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,060
He's so mad at you that he's biting you, but he's not even but you're not trying

222
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,340
to help the crocodile. You're not trying to help him. You're trying to touch his

223
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,540
teeth. I could see dentists being the next thing like clowns where it just

224
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,080
becomes full evil pedophile vibes. Yeah, I think dentist what's that thing about

225
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,320
dentists that they kill themselves more than anything? That's toll booth

226
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,940
operators.

227
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,020
Toll, but I don't think there's that many of those around. Yeah, but they have

228
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,580
the highest suicide rate. Oh yeah, that seems like the absolute, that's why

229
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,780
they're not around. Worst job of all time. My sister told me that, my sister

230
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,220
told me that toll booth operators have the highest suicide rate. But isn't that

231
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
just because? Oh no, I think it's... You're supposed to say more than eleven

232
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,980
towards to them so that they don't feel bad. I think the high suicide rate is

233
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,500
depressed people. Yeah, well, that's what I was gonna say.

234
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,580
Tobu's operators skew probably pretty stupid and stupid people kill themselves.

235
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:31,520
You can't even go to the bathroom. You can, but it's not pretty. Yeah. You

236
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,020
can't go. Do they just have a little toilet in there? I think you're supposed

237
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,060
to pee out one molecule at a time and wipe it on the dollars.

238
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,100
So you get pee on your fingers. Just little tiny amounts. Is there, I guess,

239
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Can we go to a toll booth real quick?

240
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
No.

241
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,100
Can we go check one out?

242
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
And do what?

243
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Just to see if they have a bathroom on site.

244
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
You want to go to the toll house, Fatso?

245
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
What the hell?

246
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm going to the gym, I'm working on myself.

247
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
You didn't go to the...

248
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Well, I just had to say that.

249
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
You didn't have to say Fatso.

250
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,100
It would not have made sense if I said skinny, Mr. Thin.

251
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Mr. Sweet Tooth.

252
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
I've had a bit of a sweet tooth recently.

253
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Me too.

254
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
And I've been eating a candy...

255
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
I had a Rice Krispies this morning.

256
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Haven't had those in forever.

257
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
That's what I eat sometimes before I go to the gym.

258
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
That's what I started because Noah said that's good.

259
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I learned this from Sam Sulek that you're supposed to eat Rice Krispie.

260
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Oh, interesting.

261
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,100
A Rice Krispie treat before the gym because it's carbohydrates that is fastly available.

262
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
So says a 21 year old on YouTube.

263
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Yeah, he's the smartest 21 year old I've ever seen.

264
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,100
There's absolutely no discussion about that. It's completely true.

265
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
Oh yeah, he's incredible.

266
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,100
We should start making gym vlogs.

267
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Yeah.

268
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Speaking of vlogs, you know what I have is our Applebee's vlog that I never edited.

269
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,540
I never edited. Do you remember this? We made an Applebee's. No, I don't know. It

270
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,700
was a video of us. We went to Applebee's in Astoria because you were going to get

271
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,300
a TV for Black Friday and we filmed ourselves. It was the worst Black Friday

272
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,840
ever. Yeah, it was. It was the worst Black Friday on record, but we filmed

273
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,260
this vlog and I just have all the footage on my phone of us eating the food

274
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,580
and going,

275
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,340
"I don't remember this at all." We filmed it. I remember going to Applebee's,

276
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,660
but not filming the vlog. I'll put it together after this. I'm getting on my

277
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,060
PC after this and I'm editing together our Applebee's vlog. We're hitting the

278
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,440
six month mark where I need to go to one of these restaurants again. Oh yeah,

279
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Olive Garden, Cracker Barrel, Carrabba's, Applebee's, TGI Friday's, Red Lobster.

280
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,400
There's a... You know what we could do? We could get on the Q58,

281
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,920
go to the

282
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,040
Olive Garden at the mall. You're 58 and you're Q. Q anon. Guess what that

283
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,200
Q stands for. Q.

284
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,840
What the hell? What?

285
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,740
It's not that strange. You think that we're... He said, "Do you guys hate

286
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,880
my guts?" I think he thinks we're mad at him. Are you mad at me?

287
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,280
Are you mad at us? Yeah,

288
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,880
I just woke up on the wrong side of the fucking you did. I woke up on the wrong

289
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,440
side of the truck bed this morning. You did not wake up on a truck bed, woke up

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,400
in a truck shut up. Oh, you didn't work a work up on a truck. Lady kicked me

291
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,760
out.

292
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,480
Shut up. My old lady came on. I was drinking and and sleeping and drinking

293
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,080
and drooling. That was drinking and drooling. You got a

294
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,800
you got a rule if you drink because then you get the liquid out of you and you

295
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,700
can drink more. I liquid is not supposed to stay. No liquid is not supposed to

296
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,920
stay in your body. Get all the liquid. Get that shit out out of liquid equals

297
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,960
time as fast as you know. It is a way you can die liquid in your lungs.

298
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, yeah, you can die from this scared. That's going to happen to me. I

299
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,640
think it happened. I think I have you ever

300
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,720
the stuff there's some stuff that gets in your lungs. Maybe breathe in a

301
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,080
the yeah, I imagine just getting something really small and you're like

302
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,240
small, not small enough, not big enough to choke you, but you can just breathe

303
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,140
and it just goes in. If you breathe in a cheerio, does it just stay there for

304
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,880
your entire life? I was literally thinking about this yesterday, really,

305
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,980
because I was trying to get a tonsil stone out of my throat. You have a

306
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,480
tonsil stone? Oh, not anymore. I got it out. Whoa, you got that little poker.

307
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,600
You know, my girlfriend's got those. My girlfriend's got a tonsil stone poker.

308
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,320
Really? I don't use a poker. I just like it's a little piece of metal. You lick

309
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,340
You lick the tonsil stone until it comes out?

310
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
Yeah, I push it with my tongue and I don't lick it.

311
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Wait, you have amazing tongue dexterity.

312
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
We were all talking about this last night at dinner.

313
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
I don't know why I didn't know it was crazy to be able to do that.

314
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,340
He left. He left when we talked about tongue stuff.

315
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh. My bad bitch.

316
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
You missed out on big tongue conversation.

317
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Big tongue conversation.

318
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,340
But you can't do that? You can't?

319
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
I can't do that. All the way back?

320
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
Kind of.

321
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm worried that will happen too when I do it.

322
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm worried because it's so small and I'm like I'm not going to choke on this,

323
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,560
but if it comes out and I breathe it in, is it there? I don't think you

324
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,300
breathe it. I think when you breathe in something, it still goes down your like

325
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,740
your throat. I don't think it goes to your lungs, but air goes to your lungs

326
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,880
air goes to your lungs, but I don't think that food goes in your lungs. I

327
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,900
think that the the lung hole is too small. I think maybe if you like so

328
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,800
little, I think maybe a sprinkle could get in there. That's what I'm scared of

329
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,140
man. A toss of stones is like the size of a sprinkle, but I think a sprinkle is

330
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,620
small enough that I think there's probably something a fail safe in the

331
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,540
lungs to the puzzle zone is a body sprinkle. It's just food and oh my God,

332
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,020
you know they call sprinkles a silent killer. Yeah,

333
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,560
thousands of people every year. One

334
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,500
that's why people, you know people, you

335
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,700
you're more likely to be killed by a sprinkle than a shark attack. Absolutely

336
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:14,940
have

337
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,420
something. You used to put sprinkles on mashed potatoes. Yeah,

338
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,820
one one called chives subreddit. I always like to look at on reddit.

339
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,620
is very funny to look at our slash, our slash sharks, because it's all is it

340
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,580
ante or pro it's mostly pro right. The the majority is people who are like you

341
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,800
know they like sharks even too much. They're like sharks. If you kill get

342
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,140
killed by a shark, you were doing something stupid. You shouldn't be out

343
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,660
in that far out in the ocean. Stop making excuses for these fucking sharks

344
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,060
man like and they're they're they're front. They're basically dogs is that

345
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:52,260
ever they run defense, but every single every single day somebody comes into the

346
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,260
a bread it who's like twelve years old or thirteen years old and

347
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,960
link that is like someone got killed by a shark. So it's like look at this

348
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,400
this guy got killed by a shark. Sharks are evil and every you fucking idiot.

349
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,060
You're probably twelve years old. Get the fuck out of here. The trucks are

350
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,600
not even they're saying they constantly that's all it is is just people

351
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,760
fighting about. I'll be like like saying like how do you how can you explode a

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,980
shark? If it tries to attack you get the fuck out of

353
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm not rocking with sharks. No, I love sharks, but I think a distance yeah to

354
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,140
look at in a video, you love sharks the same way you love a celeb and I love

355
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,140
the sun from my distance with the celebs you're up in. I don't I doesn't know

356
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,620
any sharks. He knows plenty of so yeah, as a rule, I do not watch celeb videos,

357
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,100
because it makes me gives me FOMO yeah, yeah, fuck I can't wait for fucking

358
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,940
Friday night. You see if I had a text, I would have been there. Well, no, it's

359
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,520
it's like Golden Globe. I'm going to be up with all rolling with all these

360
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,220
these people on Friday nights. So I don't I'm not going to watch on a

361
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,140
Tuesday. I think they had a lot of random people at the Golden Globes this

362
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,460
year. I think you could have gone. I was at the Golden Globes. They whoa really

363
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,560
did you see the sandwich guy from the Instagram? He went there. Yeah. I saw

364
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,840
the sandwich guy from Instagram. Oh, and on the fat Jewish. I saw the fat.

365
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,880
He's still around. He's still around.

366
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
No, he got deployed.

367
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,920
that is really getting you that much. The fat Jewish is in Israel fighting a

368
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,500
horrible war. This is making you die laughing. Okay, imagine him with his

369
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,140
big Pikmin ass haircut. Imagine him being hung by Hamas by his giant fucking

370
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,300
rat tail somewhere in the street, Old West style. Is he has a tail like a

371
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,740
rat? Yeah, what the hell? Just because he's Jewish? No, because he's fat.

372
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,420
He's more fat than he is Jewish, if you ask me. What if the fat Jewish

373
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,260
got on... Fat Jewish, stay away from Ozempic, okay? Yeah. You are not...

374
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:51,120
you will lose everything about you and I'm sick of Osempic and what govy.

375
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,600
This is actually to have friend pics in baloney

376
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,020
Osempic and bulgogi. Well, govy, that's the other one. It's what govy you

380
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,560
govy. You never heard of that. No, I know two people. That's a Harry.

381
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:17,060
that's a Harry Potter. I know somebody who overdosed on will go be and had to go

382
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,880
to the hospital and eat food. That was the cure.

383
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,780
I'm not kidding. You had to eat food. Oh, my God. This is an article that I

384
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,460
would click on from Facebook, a click bait article. It would say, you know,

385
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,740
top ten celebrities from the seventies if they were on Ozempic

386
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,020
Dom Delos through the power of AI. We've worse in Wales. Yeah, exact Orson

387
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,220
Wells is good. Dom Delos

388
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,920
Chris Farley, Chris Farley, Farley is a great that's the name. I was trying to

389
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,680
norma from tears, John Candy, John Dandy yeah, he should have been John Kale,

390
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,160
John to save his life yeah. Well, that was already taken yeah. You can't have

391
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,200
to John Kales. I found out they would fight to the dude, John Candy and John

392
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,560
killer kind of opposites, aren't

393
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,460
I

394
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,920
amazing wow

395
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,700
we're going to write a book about this called the kale and the candy

396
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,400
the kale and the

397
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,720
by I never seen John Candy pick up a violin. Maybe that would have changed

398
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,260
his life.

399
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,880
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, he lived a sad life. Did you want to be? I found a

400
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,460
crazy, I found a crazy, very funny. I found out a crazy name thing was the guy

401
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,780
who made Gary's mod his name Gary Gary Newman, Gary Newman, his last name's

402
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,220
Newman, but suppose it different fucking Gary Newman, the singers and you

403
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,460
whatever asshole ruin my old day, ruin my whole life. No, no, since you ruined my

404
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,900
day, I'd like for you to go ahead and ruin my entire life.

405
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,260
Yeah, go ahead and just go and get ten steps ahead of me wherever I go and

406
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:00,040
just ruin it. Just throw things anybody I'm about to talk to hurt them, abuse me,

407
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,460
ruin my life, throw away my shoes, throw away everything, throwing away your

408
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,620
shoes. I guess I have a life that would ruin your life. Unless you don't have

409
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,780
another ruin your life. Speaking of I okay, well, you don't live in

410
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,720
Taktown. We are we live in a total shoe desert. Yeah, we do. Actually, there's

411
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,800
a shoe store near me and a shoe repair. There's a trillion shoe stores here.

412
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,320
Yeah, yeah, so nice try Cameron, but a shoe desert just means they're more

413
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,480
expensive. They have become more expensive. Is that is that what what is

414
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,080
Food desert really food desert means that there's only cheetos around.

415
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,840
You only have delicious food around.

416
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,560
There's only snack foods, no meal foods.

417
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,480
So they have to ship in the meal foods so they get more expensive.

418
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Got it, got it.

419
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Okay.

420
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
So spaghetti would be expensive.

421
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
Spaghetti would be expensive.

422
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,360
In a food desert, hypothetically.

423
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,240
I'm learning about food deserts now.

424
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
But also a food desert, a normal desert is also a food desert.

425
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
I was just about to say that because we're going to eat.

426
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,520
A scorpion, a viper, some sand.

427
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Oh wait, what's that?

428
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,020
it's a

429
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,360
lobster. You know, I can eat that giant cheeseburger. Oh, let me just get closer

430
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,600
no man. Mirage Yeah, have you ever experienced a full on Mirage where you

431
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,080
thought that there was something so amazing in front of you, but then you got

432
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,680
closer completely. I've only been only puddles of water. What if that happened

433
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,800
in your house water Mirage? You see that yeah, of course, yeah on the end of the

434
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,960
road, yeah, yeah, wow, I really cool to realize that it's real. It is real. It's

435
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,360
lot of cartoon. It's completely a true thing. I don't know what this is. I've

436
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,240
never experienced. Are you serious? You'll drive and you've never been in a

437
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,080
car. I guess you've never been in a car. I've been in a car, but not in the

438
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,580
summer.

439
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,760
It's crazy to me that you don't know, you don't, you know, you haven't

440
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,100
experienced this. No, I don't know what it is. Sometimes over yonder, you will,

441
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,960
because of the heat, the shimmer, the shimmer of the concrete, the stuff that's

442
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,400
like when the, like when the, when this it's so hot out that it looks like the

443
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,000
whole world is boiling, you know. Yeah, so that's the same thing. Yeah, like a

444
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,740
water. It looks like water. It's shimmer, heat shimmer. Oh, oh, that's a mirage.

445
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,660
That's what a mirage is. All right, I guess I get that. Yeah, I've seen that

446
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,580
before. Yeah, I used to think on the cicadas would make that sound. I used to

447
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,060
think that that those were correlated, and I used to think that that, that that

448
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,620
was the street boiling. The, the boiling was, yeah, like it was like a lobster and

449
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,260
the, like the shimmer, because it's kind of sinks up. What are you fucking talking

450
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,720
about? It sinks up. It doesn't happen all the time. The cicada sound and then the,

451
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,580
Well, I guess it's because whenever you see them cicadas in a minute, thank God,

452
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,180
I think they're disgusting. I hate all big. They are very discussed. I had a

453
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:35,340
dead cicada that I collected. Wow, you need to be hospitalized for odd. I

454
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,300
don't have it anymore.

455
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,500
Why not?

456
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Probably somewhere in my old house. Yeah, it's mummified. One time, one time my

457
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,540
wife got me when we were in high school, one of these

458
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:50,980
boxes, frames, they call them, but it was deep box style, glass pane on the

459
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,460
front bunch of fucking disgusting bugs all in it and I had to pretend I liked

460
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,760
it. My dad got me

461
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,380
framed dead scorpions like that when I was a kid and it scared me. I didn't

462
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,020
want it in my room. I was like it's going to come to life, come out of it.

463
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,740
My ex had a death's head hawks moth in a frame. That's the one from

464
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,220
when you're a kid. That hanging up on the wall in the house.

465
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
Fight Ants of the Lambs?

466
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Fight Ants of the Lambs.

467
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
Fight Ants of the Lambs.

468
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Reboot it.

469
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Ian, if you're watching.

470
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Reboot it with Ian right now, man.

471
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
It puts the lotion in the basket.

472
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Please, God, make that movie.

473
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
That was the best idea we've ever had on the show.

474
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
That is so perfect.

475
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Holy fucking shit.

476
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Okay.

477
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
That's funny.

478
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Yeah.

479
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
I've never experienced a mirage, though, but that would be sad as fuck.

480
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
We used to put our face in elements of the movie.

481
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,300
We used to put our face in elements of the movie.

482
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
We used to put our face in elements of the movie.

483
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,300
We used to put our face in elements of the movie.

484
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
We used to put our face in elements of the movie.

485
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,100
fucking shit. Okay, that's funny. Yeah, I

486
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,100
never experienced a mirage, though, but that would be sad is to put our face in

487
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,100
elementary school used to put our the side of our face against the brick wall

488
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,420
and you could see the the heat shimmer. You and I also I've never experienced

489
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,260
how I think about it.

490
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:00,500
Desert Island with one tree. I've seen that way. I've never experienced the

491
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,100
coconut for lunch either a coke. Well, that you get trapped on the Desert Island

492
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,180
one tree. Here comes the coconut and also there's a treasure chest there, but

493
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,860
what the fuck you gonna do with treasure? Yeah, you're on an island.

494
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:16,140
Nobody's coming to get the you. They want, they're gonna get the treasure,

495
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,000
even if they show up, they're gonna get the treasure, they're hauling it back

496
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,200
back way over. The saddest part about treasure is it brings out man's worst.

497
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,220
If you were on the desert island with the one tree and you were trying to

498
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:32,060
spell out a word with the sticks to make the plane see you,

499
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,100
but... Swag. But, but...

500
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,600
but

501
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:41,620
you only have enough sticks for two letters. So you can't say help and you

502
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,860
can't say s o s me me

503
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,660
I'm on this. I'm

504
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,260
well, could

505
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:58,740
couldn't you just like use the sticks to if you are in the sand, if you use the

506
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,540
sticks to draw in the sand, the wind will pick up and blow it away. It's a

507
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,620
Windy Island. You can only write two letters using this. It's an island

508
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,420
outside of Seattle. If you try to break the sticks to make smaller letters,

509
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,820
they won't be visible from the plane. Chicago, yeah. What did I think Seattle

510
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,660
was the windy city? It's the rainy city. 'Cause that's the rainy city. Yeah.

511
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,940
Son of a bitch. So if I was stuck on an island in Lake Michigan... I would do

512
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,660
O. Yo. Yo. Yo is good. Yo is good. Yo is good, but they would think that you

513
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,180
would be... They would also think that you were a pirate because of Yo Ho

514
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,700
Ho. True. Two letters is so fucking hard, 'cause if it's three, SOS,

515
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,440
it's so obvious, but with two, what do you say? So so because then they're just

516
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,520
gonna be like, oh, the guy doesn't even want to get off. He's like, yeah, I'm on

517
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,240
the island, so

518
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,460
who cares?

519
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,280
Fucking get out of here, leave me here. What if you did F law law would be good

520
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,120
because they go, wait, there's an amazing singer on the

521
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,860
drop down the parachute, the reverse parachute. Don't put F you, they would

522
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,420
not, but they come down, they come down there.

523
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,180
We gotta give this guy a piece of our fucking mind.

524
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's get this

525
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,300
oh my God, it work. I need to get off. You fucking stupid bastard

526
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,980
P, you have you

527
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,980
flying the plane all the way yeah.

528
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,440
Fuck you,

529
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,080
fly back

530
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,900
you can do P you they would be you. They would want to rest. I mean, because

531
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,000
it smells bad and pick up yeah, the smells bad they're not going to come to

532
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,760
the island. You could do okay, here's another one T, Y and it's like thanks in

533
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,520
advance. So they feel pressure like when you put that in an email, you know

534
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,060
six and a bass. I have to do it. I also could think why you're like being

535
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,060
passive aggressive. That's good. You want if they then again, they'll do it.

536
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,140
Yeah, I guess it's kind of that's why you're you're so afraid of being

537
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,460
passive aggressive. You put NP yeah, no, it's not a big problem. Don't worry

538
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,520
about you. I'm on you know what I do. I put

539
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:47,080
maybe like some famous persons initials like with

540
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,640
TC Tom Cruise Cruise TC.

541
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Wait, I think Tom Cruise is on this island!

542
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Oh God.

543
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
JT, John Travolta.

544
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
It's Terry Caleb.

545
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
JT could be Justin Timberlake too.

546
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Yeah.

547
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
JT would be a good one.

548
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,640
JT would be a lot of different people.

549
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Exactly.

550
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,640
So even if they say Justin Timberlake, I said Justin Timberlake, Justin Theroux.

551
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Holy crap.

552
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Whoa.

553
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
It might be him.

554
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah, PP.

555
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,640
Doesn't he own that, he owns that bar, Rays, with the guy from Succession, Cousin Greg?

556
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
I don't fucking know.

557
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,640
I actually don't even know who Justin Theroux is now that I say this.

558
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,640
He's in Mulholland Drive and I think he was married to Jennifer Aniston.

559
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Lucky bastard.

560
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,240
I have a new fucking stupid enemy that I hate.

561
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,440
Well hey, there's a bar you can find him.

562
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,240
Jennifer Aniston, he's been married to her since she had jigglies out on TV?

563
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Yes.

564
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Wow.

565
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,440
You can go to his bar and you can give him a piece of your mind.

566
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,080
I'm gonna go in there and say, "Cousin Greg, Justin, stop the sex at this bar."

567
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,120
the same up stop the set of twenty one year old. I pick it their bar with a

568
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,860
son. It says stop the stocks, stop the sex. Y'all I've been thinking recently of

569
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,080
going in it because the thing is there's all these problems. The mailman wants me

570
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,280
so

571
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,160
speaking of the mailman, I got a I got a package right. Yeah, I got a found that

572
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,720
out big ass dick ass on you fucking hung like a horse. Yeah, that was loud. That's

573
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,640
loud, very loud as a I got a package that was supposed to be delivered. I go to

574
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,860
tracking I've been looking at this because I did 10 day shipping because I

575
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,320
was like I want to save a little. I'm looking at this I'm getting it's 10

576
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,540
days that's today is day 10. I look at the tracking and it says some kind

577
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,500
of error happened. I didn't answer I was out doing errands. I didn't answer

578
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,140
the door but it's the parcel service that my father works for so I

579
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:46,500
call him up and I say you need to sort your fucking company out or I'm gonna

580
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,300
I'm going to take it down from the inside. You said I'm going to pretend to

581
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,200
be I'm texting him all day. I'm saying I'm taking down your company. Really?

582
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,400
He said you're going to have to pay my rent and I said fuck you. No, I'm

583
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,500
pretending to be you. I'm going to go on your LinkedIn. I'm going to post

584
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,400
the ASCII middle finger shit. I just remember it is something. I just

585
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,300
remember something that made me feel even crazier that you were trying to

586
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,600
claim to be the master troll. You were too even afraid to do a prank call.

587
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Oh, this guy calls. It just made me remember that this guy is not a prank

588
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,640
Trolls aren't trolling. It's breaking bro and also I already rescinded my my

589
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,940
throne as the master troll. I am the master. I'm just putting in context. I

590
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,560
make the troll last. You make the you calm the troll.

591
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,580
The troll's about to do something bad yeah, he's about to cross the line and

592
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,520
you kind of make light of it. Yes, I make light of trolling get off of that

593
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,640
yeah, what you troll, but sometimes I go the troll.

594
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't do that. That's a that's a bad idea. You don't that's a very dangerous

595
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,900
doomed to many greater man than you have died playing that game. That's how not

596
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,840
me, because I'm the master jester. That's how Harry Houdini died. Yeah,

597
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,400
yeah, exactly, but that the other yeah,

598
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,800
we were talking he died because someone punched him in the stomach. So funny

599
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,800
way, yeah, and then a guy who locked himself into a bomb every day.

600
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,100
When we were talking about it before, I was telling you how there's like a

601
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,940
museum. There's like a magic shop. That's like also is like a few like

602
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,640
magnesium items or whatever in mid town, and I went to it. My family was here

603
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,220
like a year or two ago and they have this. I just I was talking to you and I

604
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,720
didn't realize how ridiculous this sounds, but but now I was thinking about

605
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,220
it. It's very funny. What the like main attraction, the main thing they have

606
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,360
there is that it's a bathtub that Houdini escaped from

607
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:34,900
lame as fucking stuff. What are you doing? Where you escape from a bat? I'll

608
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,880
now escape from my bed, even though it's very comfortable.

609
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,320
so that early in the morning, I really escape like well when we see I will

610
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,720
escape from this bath. I'm now escaping from the pantry.

611
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,120
Here I go. Was he around when taft was president because maybe everyone

612
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,820
thought that like I was like Oh, my God, the president got stuck in the

613
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,000
bathtub. Is that maybe that's the classic taft? Did he fatly die there?

614
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,640
He fatly got stuck in die, but he just got stuck and it was a story. I

615
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,080
they had to cover him in lard to get him out. Well, doing some math in my head.

616
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,320
How do you get into the bathtub if you're that fat versus he got fatter?

617
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,120
It's easy to get in. He got in, it was fine. They handed him one donut,

618
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,320
stuck forever. Well, you can kind of just jump in, you can just jump in and

619
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,040
you'll just... He took his corset off. There's the force of gravity will push

620
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,160
you in. Yeah, like you can put a bunch of kimchi into a jar,

621
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,240
but you can't shake it out. Exactly. Well, I've been defeated and I'm back

622
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,640
thinking you two hate me. You know who else hates me? My dad, I found out.

623
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,240
Because you didn't call him to tell him you were going home for Christmas?

624
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,240
No, no, no. I talked to him about that. In the past four days, my phone screen has been

625
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,320
crazy wigging out and I've butt-dialed my dad six times. He hasn't answered a single

626
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,080
time, but I've been waiting. I was waiting for the call. I was like, "Fuck it. He's going

627
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,760
to call me and then he's going to be like, 'Hey, what'd you call me?' six times, whatever."

628
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,120
But way worse than that, he has not made contact with me about this at all. And then I texted

629
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:07,620
I was like, hey, I but dialed you again zero contact. So he doesn't even care

630
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,720
that I but dialed him or he doesn't even he didn't even think that this or

631
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,820
something. Maybe your dad got stuck in the bathtub.

632
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:19,820
He is not fat. My dad did P90X. So did my dad, my dad and your dad. Same

633
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:25,120
shadow. Yeah, same exact silhouette. Yeah, they look like my poor character

634
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,220
design. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very copied and pasted. Yeah, guys. My dad was

635
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,500
younger. My dad looked like human Shrek. Human Shrek? Yeah. The good looking Shrek? When

636
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,580
Shrek turns into a human in Shrek 2, that's what my dad looked like. What a doll. He's

637
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,380
a good looking guy. Let's get him. Let's go get him. Well yeah, I'm getting him. I'm at

638
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,820
war with his company. I don't think you could escalate. And by the way. He's given me a

639
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:58,980
lot of free merch from his company. So and you're going to betray that? Well I'm going

640
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,580
to impersonate with all this merch, I'm going to wear the socks that he gave me from the

641
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
company.

642
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,660
They're not going to be like, "Hey, you, do you work here?"

643
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,140
Oh wait, you have the socks on.

644
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,420
You have the socks on.

645
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,940
You only get those if you're an employee.

646
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Of where?

647
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,940
Of FedEx.

648
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Is it FedEx?

649
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,940
I thought he was a UPS guy.

650
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
No, no, he used to be.

651
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Then he switched teams.

652
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
Wow.

653
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
That is crazy.

654
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Yeah, that's a double crosser.

655
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
That is some crazy shit.

656
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,940
That is spineless.

657
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
That is spineless.

658
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,860
That is Babe Ruth from the Red Sox and the Yankees.

659
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,960
Go to a minor, go to a DHL.

660
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,820
He was about to. That was actually.

661
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,380
He wanted to switch again.

662
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:34,820
No, no, no.

663
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,300
This guy's the biggest snake ever.

664
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,340
No wonder he was your dad.

665
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
He was a free agent.

666
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,300
What are you talking about?

667
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,460
You fucking snake.

668
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I'm not a snake.

669
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:41,980
Yeah, you are.

670
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,340
Snake.

671
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,140
I'm not a snake.

672
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,020
You're going to hop ship.

673
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,860
I'm not going to hop ship.

674
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,620
Or jump ship.

675
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,500
What do you think? I'm going to join.

676
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,420
You're going to turn tail.

677
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,620
I'm going to join some different podcast.

678
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,900
Turn coat. I mean, turn coat.

679
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,100
Yep. Being Ian with Jordan and Patrick.

680
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,780
I'm going to become Ian now.

681
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,980
Yeah. Or no, you're going to go join that.

682
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,800
Yeah.

683
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,200
I have them on my mind.

684
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,300
I have them on my mind. I love him. Yeah, me too.

685
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,900
He was a free agent for a little bit in all these... And they're throwing

686
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,500
contracts at him. He was having meetings with the executives. He's so good at

687
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,900
shipping and logistics. He's so good at shipping and logistics, bro. Did he do

688
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,400
like a DeAndre Jordan in Dallas situation where he told, he maybe told

689
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,300
UPS like, "Yeah, I'm gonna resign with you. Yeah, yeah, 10 year, $50 million

690
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,800
exactly what it was, but I remember when I was a kid. And then the UPS guys

691
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,900
driving around. And when they see him. New Hampshire, looking for him. Well,

692
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,500
he worked at a UPS in Massachusetts, so. Oh, boy. He actually just probably

693
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,180
moved to a little closer to home. Not even loyal to a location. And let me

694
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,540
guess, let me guess, your dad doesn't stay in the same place all the time.

695
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,860
He doesn't just sit there. He betrays his area by going by walking around.

696
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,140
Betrays his chair for the couch. Oh, my God, your dad's an ultimate piece

697
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,160
- You have not moved from this chair.

698
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,880
This has been your chair.

699
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,960
- No, and you know what?

700
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,800
And you know what?

701
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,920
Maybe FedEx deserves to be taken down from the inside.

702
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,840
- I think that is a bad beef to make

703
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,300
because I think that they could get things to you.

704
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,140
I'm just saying FedEx--

705
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,400
- They can get anything to you.

706
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,680
- You might think that you're not,

707
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,800
but FedEx could get you touched.

708
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,640
- We could all get--

709
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,520
- They know your address, bro.

710
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,200
- We could all switch up to Green Mountain Express,

711
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,600
which is a local personal service

712
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,080
in New Hampshire and Vermont.

713
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,280
Sounds like coffee to me.

714
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,120
So he's not even putting on for his city by working for the local companies, working for

715
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,160
this big disgusting national change.

716
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
Change?

717
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Change.

718
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Change.

719
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
This is Good Burger.

720
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Remember Good Burger?

721
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
This is Barbershop.

722
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,400
I remember genuinely when I was a kid when he told me he was leaving UPS to go to FedEx,

723
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,560
in my head that was as big as like the Alex Rodriguez trade.

724
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
He didn't even like...

725
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
I mean it's the same thing.

726
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,480
I was like rumored that a rod was probably going to go to the Red Sox and then he went to the

727
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,920
Yankees. I was like, this is like pretty much the same thing as my dad switching shipping

728
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,960
company. Yes, a huge fucking backstabbing snake betrayal. It's not a snake betrayal. Benedict

729
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,080
Arnold. This is like a snake. Benedict Arnold is crazy. Full Benedict. Complete Benedict.

730
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:15,320
That's crazy to call my dad Benedict Arnold for switching up shipping. Okay, Benny Doran.

731
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,200
Full hollandaise bro. You hear Benny Dor is switching sides? Who's Benny Dor? That's your

732
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,700
Ben Doren, Ben Dick Doren, like a rod be door.

733
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:30,300
What like a rod? That's not his name is not Benny Bennett. Are you dumb?

734
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,700
Ben, as in Benedict Arnold,

735
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,200
which he would have been being old, being old, being old. Yeah, being old.

736
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,700
You can't call it a barn. I feel like I've given away too much information

737
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,700
about my father's. Okay, well, give and he could probably fake stuff in there.

738
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,740
My dad is five foot one, ninety pounds. Red herrings. Okay, five foot one. What

739
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,700
else about him? He's sixteen.

740
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,280
Okay, yeah, I know that about him. I'm helping you out. Yeah. My dad is five

741
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,680
foot one. No, but you have to sprinkle in real fact to make it so that people

742
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,040
can't tell his address. He's been married to my mom since 1995. Something

743
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,900
more personal about his body.

744
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,980
What's his shoe? Grower.

745
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:20,400
That's awesome, man. That'd be a little bit of a disappointment to find out my dad was a grower.

746
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah? For you?

747
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Let me see it in the gym shorts. I don't want it to be gone when you're walking out into the living room.

748
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,800
Right.

749
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Let me see that, Dad.

750
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,600
I guess.

751
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,000
Have you ever, have you seen your father's penis as an adult? Because I mean, you see it as a kid.

752
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,500
He was an adult when I saw it.

753
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,900
Well, yeah, same.

754
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,000
He was, that's, well, no, when you're a kid and you see your dad's penis, it's like, you know.

755
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,660
"Whoa!" "Oh my gosh!" It's awesome, right? That's what you're saying.

756
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,920
It's not exactly like the Hearthstone announcer when you open a booster

757
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,620
pack. "Whoa!"

758
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:59,460
Legendary. I used to... I just feel like if you see

759
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,040
your dad's penis when you're a grown man and he's also grown... You have.

760
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,060
What's the limit that you have? I never have. I never have. I think

761
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,120
the limit is... But I feel like you would be seeing an old friend.

762
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:15,860
The limit is exactly this. The limit is if the kid gets to the height where

763
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,700
potentially without jumping, it could hit his head,

764
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,660
that's time to put it away.

765
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,700
Yeah. No, but I'm just saying... If he can't clear under your legs,

766
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,800
just walk under, you're not even real, it's completely oblivious. There's a

767
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,460
dick on his... That's when you can't show it anymore. But once,

768
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,060
as soon as it touches his head...

769
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:39,060
Enough. I'll say it, when you touch your kid's head with your penis,

770
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,540
you should start wearing clothes.

771
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:49,620
That's what I think, man. I don't know if that's crazy. That's the line that I

772
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:54,420
think should be established. Don't touch your head of your child with your

773
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,340
penis. Don't touch your child with your penis. Yeah. And that's a... And you can...

774
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,460
And you take that to the bank. Yeah, that's a... We'll put that on a shirt.

775
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,780
Yeah. We're gonna put that... No, not don't do it, but like when it happens.

776
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,700
Wait until it happens. Wait until it happens. Because... That's how you know.

777
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,940
that's how you know it's when it happens. That's how you

778
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,780
not a big deal. It's just a sign and you can and you can let your

779
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,380
kid walk through your legs. If you have pants on yeah, yeah,

780
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,600
of course, everybody does that yeah, yeah, come on walk through

781
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,820
yeah, go ahead and this you know what this does. I'm playing

782
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,140
London Bridge. This is going this this

783
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,380
punishes

784
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:32,780
dads with large ones. Yeah, or short dads or short dad short

785
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,700
dad dads with maybe short legs and I don't like short. That

786
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,440
should be taller than some. Dad should be taller than some. With a small thing.

787
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:42,200
With a small thing. Yeah, tall, big and lanky. Your dad should be a grower.

788
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,780
It keeps him humble. Your dad should be a samer. Exactly. Yeah, you should have

789
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,840
the same penis as your father. A samer is a small shower. Yes. Your father and

790
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,960
you have to have... It doesn't move at all. It doesn't change. Completely

791
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,600
identical penises that you could not even tell in a line up that they're any

792
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,560
different. Is it true that skinny guys have the biggest rods? No. No, I think

793
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,360
with guys with the biggest rods? No, because I was thin in high school.

794
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,760
Are surgically changed to have that? Yeah. Guys with giant penises have

795
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,460
probably short legs, longer legs. Well, I guess what they always say is if you're

796
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,240
fat and then you lose weight, it makes your dick look bigger because there's

797
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,640
like less fat around your groin. What was the name of that porn star that had

798
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:26,300
the fake penis? OG Mudbone. Was that OG Mudbone? Yes. That was so funny,

799
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:30,240
man. That was so fucking funny. Speaking of a troll, this wasn't... That is a

800
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,080
huge troll as a troll, but also as a troll to the school, my friend's

801
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,000
dodgeball team,

802
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,640
they named themselves OG Mudbone. Yes, yes, yes, and then the assistant

803
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,840
principal looked it up in her office and almost and almost came yeah, and

804
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,880
almost and I was a to the picture of almost completely jizzed, but who

805
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,280
they also put fake nut in that yeah, but do they have I mean who's is I

806
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,200
am building this prop for him. Yeah, that's got to be a fun thing to

807
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,560
invent because the guy I'm willing to bet the person who invented that that

808
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,900
machine is a millionaire is not only a millionaire, but was not trying to

809
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,260
probably not yeah yeah, and then a

810
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,700
porno company trying to build like it was like you've done what we're looking

811
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,920
for trying to build a new like

812
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,180
exactly

813
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,620
you know the push catch up dispenser that they started. It was around the

814
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,880
same time. It probably was the same technology

815
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,320
and he had a very Oppenheimer type thing where he was like looking he's looking

816
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:28,640
on the barrel of it needs just going like my God, it was

817
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,000
like cake decorators like a frosting mechanical piping bag and for some

818
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,500
reason this kind of looks like a nut that they were putting in. That was not

819
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,680
convincing man now and also by the way, if I was a female porn star and I was

820
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,160
drinking nut all day and night right, I'm used to it at this point. If I get

821
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,560
to a porn shoot and they're saying this time it's fucking yogurt now,

822
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,400
you know, that's what they put real in it. It's not real. I feel with the real

823
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:00,120
not maybe they tried that cold real not that why well that probably better to

824
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:03,480
have it's all this stuff. They like they would still like some sperm banks,

825
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,600
which is let like little ug knots go in and just little what's an ug not not as

826
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,120
a star wars creature. Okay, sounded like a slur. Can you just when I guess it

827
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,200
okay, when you when you start what's the slur for ugly people, because I'm not

828
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,400
this kind of sounds like ugly. Now, what is it? What kind of star wars creature

829
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,280
is it? You know the little guys on Bespin that take apart C-3PO and Star Wars

830
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,840
5? I don't know the names of the planets. Cloud City. When you go into this

831
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,240
Star Wars shit, can you please... I have not talked about it in a long time

832
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,440
because I'm a grown man now. I'm asking about it. Can you just stick to the

833
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,000
things that we would know, John? Okay, Star Wars Episode 5, they go... C-3PO

834
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,720
gets taken... Which movie is that? Which movie is that? Empire Strikes Back.

835
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,400
Okay, thank you. Empire Strikes Back, C-3PO gets taken... The Vampire Strikes

836
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,640
back. He gets taken into the Empire bites back will be a good. That's a good

837
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,140
parody.

838
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,080
He gets taken into that room. Let's go to you to the 2007 taken apart. Remember

839
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,000
what do the guys look like? They're little tiny guys. He said this man's

840
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,920
receding gray hairlines. They look like humans and they have the bulldog faces.

841
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,240
Okay, I don't do it. A bulldog. Did you guys know this about bulldogs? Bulldogs

842
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:12,520
have the attributes of a real bull. Really? The other day I was walking. Phil,

843
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,760
we see a bulldog. Are you just going to say that it charged it literally charge

844
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,840
didn't try to bite charged it into the side. It has the attributes of a real

845
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,260
bull. Yeah, you think that's funny

846
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,360
the

847
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,240
of a real bull. Is it right? It charged him and did not try to bite did not try

848
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,520
to jump. Not normal dog stuff rammed him in the side and knocked him over for zero

849
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,000
reason completely unprompted. It's because he's red. I just realized they

850
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,440
probably thought he was a skateboard. They probably thought that he was one of

851
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,180
these flags that are red. That too. You know what I would do an amazing

852
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,640
protest about? What? Or not a protest, just some kind of art piece.

853
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,460
I would go out into the bull pit, bull pen,

854
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,940
that's baseball. The bull zone. I think it's called the bull pen in baseball

855
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,000
because of... The ring, it's a bull ring. And I would pull out the red

856
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,200
flag, he comes, he shreds it apart, destroys it, there goes red. Yeah. I'd

857
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:02,680
pull out

858
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,760
the American flag, it's got red on it, here it comes,

859
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,760
ripped apart. You let it get ripped apart. Well, first, I will get to the

860
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,220
part. Listen, I do that the bowl rips or the American flag. I obviously cry

861
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,700
patriotic. Okay, and I pledge of allegiance real quick, but then I pull

862
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:25,300
out the LGBTQ plus. There's red on it. I cover up the red, but not in a way

863
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,540
where I'm disrespecting the red. What does the red mean on the flag? Red

864
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:34,620
stands for red, ready or not. We hear we're here.

865
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,700
And then I would hold it and then the bull would do nothing. And I would say,

866
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,420
"That's what the American people need to be like with these bulls."

867
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,380
Destroy America.

868
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,580
With these LGBT people.

869
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,060
But do not destroy the LGBTQ community.

870
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,700
Rip down America built by...

871
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,660
But leave the LGBTQ out of it.

872
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,900
And bulls, stop charging.

873
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,660
And I would hold up the asexual pride flag to this bull and the bull would just

874
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,500
get confused.

875
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,140
It's never seen...

876
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,180
The bull would say, "What? Do they have sex? Do they not have sex? Do they have

877
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,820
sex that they're in relationships. If I was I would just have his head would

878
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,700
explode. I would have a shot gun and I would just shoot the bowl if it came

879
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,500
after my would you kill you don't want to you don't want to eat. So it doesn't

880
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,660
hit me. I'm calling bull shit. The point is that the bull doesn't get you.

881
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:25,540
The point is to go. The point is to wait is to zone out to the clowns come out.

882
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:30,520
You just yeah. So if I the master, I blow its head up. It's not I can just

883
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:30,860
wait.

884
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:36,520
I don't like this plant is killing a wild animal. I really kill it. This

885
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,620
plan makes the shot gun

886
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,860
in the head. Maybe it will live in what were resident evil. It's got a

887
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,340
bones on its head. You think that it would wipe away all the skin in the

888
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,560
re sound bones on its head. Maybe I could just bring in a video of a

889
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,500
bull. It's no, you know what I would bring in one of those files from jail

890
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,980
and I would file its horns down. That's all I weren't sharp

891
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,460
This is a video of a donkey getting hit by a train on a Pakistan railway.

892
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:10,460
This is a video of a Chinese factory worker getting flayed to ribbons.

893
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:18,460
Yeah, I would like to see, do they still do the bowl thing or is that illegal now?

894
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Yeah, they still do it. They have it on Pluto TV, man.

895
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,460
Oh, I forgot you told me about this.

896
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,460
Oh, yeah, they do.

897
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,460
Which America, though?

898
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,460
Native America.

899
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,460
Well, I respect that.

900
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,460
reservation. Do they both?

901
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
Bullfighter shoes are

902
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,460
like really weird like cowboy boot meet sneakers, right?

903
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,460
Is this something that I just saw?

904
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,460
You said meat sneaker?

905
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,460
Cowboy X sneaker.

906
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,460
Oh. I don't pay attention to

907
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,460
fashion so much. I more pay attention

908
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,460
to the athleticism. Fashion's a

909
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,460
big part of bullfighting. It is.

910
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
Well that is true. It's probably one of the bigger

911
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,460
fashion sports. Bullfighting is

912
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,460
essentially ice skating. We talked about it before.

913
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,460
Their fashion is crazy. They have

914
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,100
crazy style fashion. They starch their pants. Monster Energy cowboy clown

915
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,500
combination three-way combo. You ever seen how they do these pants?

916
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,900
I don't watch videos about how they make pants. They take their jeans,

917
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,500
these cowboy guys, they take their jeans. They take their jeans, give them back!

918
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,860
They take their jeans off, put it on the ironing board, pour out like a whole

919
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:20,260
bottle of spray starch on it, then iron them so that when they walk around

920
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,740
they're stiff as hell. I saw a video of a guy doing this the other day of

921
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,740
I'm gonna start starching up the jeans and I really want to try that actually.

922
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,740
I have it at home now. I bought it after I saw it.

923
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,740
You bought it? Really? Do you want to borrow it?

924
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,740
Fuck yes. Borrow it. You use it.

925
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,740
We can bring, I can bring the starch here.

926
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,740
We can turn this into an ironing board.

927
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,740
We can do the clothing episode.

928
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,740
That's gotta be the first episode.

929
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,740
I need those smelling salts so bad man.

930
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,740
What do you got going on the rest of the day? You gotta be all piped up for it.

931
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,740
No I just need them. I have no...

932
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Will to live? I have no electricity in my brain.

933
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,740
You can smell my...

934
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,740
You can smell my finger. That's him.

935
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,300
yet he reacts to scares. I'm going to scares me. I don't he's the scare. I'm

936
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,920
not going to scream, but I don't like it. Yeah,

937
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,340
okay.

938
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:06,040
Well, there was an attempt made to be a better. I do think that I have a

939
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,900
big

940
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,380
way.

941
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:17,540
You're back, man. You're way back. You're back. Did I get away? We're scared

942
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,440
of you. I don't want to go against you, so I'm going to go ahead and stop

943
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:26,840
talking talk. You need to talk. Why man? I have nothing. Don't say there's nothing

944
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,680
coming from me.

945
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,120
It's because you went to the gym before this. You used up all of your energy. We

946
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,560
had a big pasta dinner last night. You used up all that. I didn't have time to

947
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,720
have my leftovers before this. I was already gonna be late. I didn't have time

948
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,480
to eat. You made a crazy move to me at the pasta restaurant. What? You got the

949
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,240
fettuccine alfredo with broccoli instead of chicken. I saw that. I wanted the

950
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,160
veggie. I didn't want chicken. Also, chicken was a little more expensive. I

951
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,060
I didn't want both. I wanted to have I just have them don't eat that much

952
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,420
veggie. So I always try to get something green, even if it's simply a broccoli

953
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,020
and I'm not both adding both the broccoli and the chicken was like

954
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,860
twelve dollars or so. Now that I'm not going to do that now that you are in

955
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:08,060
the gym, I am going to have to put you through a full. We're going to break

956
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,500
down your diet. We're going to go to you eating zero things, eating nothing,

957
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,580
going days without food, days without back up and then slowly build it back

958
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:22,640
reintroducing things like beef jerky until you have a fully protein rich diet with iron.

959
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:30,340
Have you ever made a steak at your house? No. I'm going to get you making some of the most

960
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,160
disgusting well done steaks ever. Don't make much meat because I'm the only person who

961
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,400
eats meat. Here's what you do. Oh yeah, that's a good reason. You can eat tofu. Tofu's good.

962
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,520
I eat a lot of tofu. I like tofu, fair amounts. If you can make it in all different styles.

963
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,680
I know a way to make tofu. I eat a lot of tofu and a lot of fish. There's a way to make tofu

964
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,960
feel exactly like McDonald's chicken nuggets. I like putting it, we bread it with panko

965
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,080
and we do all the types of things and it's nice and crispy and good. If you want to know

966
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:04,800
my chicken nugget secret, I'll tell you after the show. Send it over. They're chicken C-H-I-K-N.

967
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:10,920
Back in my day, there was a C and an E and no apostrophe in the word chicken. And they

968
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,620
and they also do what's his company, Gardein, they do that with every single

969
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:21,720
type of meat, B, E, apostrophe, S, F, S, S, S, Bs, listen, Gardein, you better

970
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,840
Bs, Bs, you bring it home and you open the bag and all the Bs fly out of

971
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:25,880
you.

972
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,560
So what you get for not eating meat? Gardein, you better be Gardein your

973
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,160
headquarters, because I'm coming after you for you bastardizing the flesh of

974
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,680
our animals. That's right. You better have a sniper on a turret. A sniper,

975
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,860
apostrophe are no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

976
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,400
it's a snipe apostrophe are a K apostrophe forty seven yeah, yeah, instead

977
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,940
of the instead of the dash.

978
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:56,340
They have F F F apostrophe. This apostrophe is flustering me. That's okay.

979
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,980
I can't even think about what even the spelling is because it's light rhyme F

980
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:08,120
apostrophe S H. When you get the fish fillet really B E apostrophe F P

981
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:15,660
apostrophe RK wait. They went for the funniest one to me is F, but F B

982
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:20,060
apostrophe F really you haven't seen that F. It's so funny. Yeah, but I go

983
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,100
for B. F. It's funny F, but F go for maybe make it out of beats. Call it

984
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,220
beat. Beat is good. You can use beet roots to mimic the look of blood and

985
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,740
fake meat. But this is exactly the point I'm making. I used to watch my

986
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:37,540
exes vegan, so I'd make vegan food. Now we had watch a lot of this cool shit

987
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,460
when I was young and vegan food videos. It's crazy how far it's come. It's all

988
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:46,420
it all basically tastes pretty close to what it is. But I think being in fish is

989
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,600
like spot on. I am a little bit. Vegan fish is like so good at being the worst

990
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,040
fish you've ever eaten. I am a little bit convinced that the fake meat stuff is

991
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,200
really bad for you. It tastes a little bit good. He's went like this. He said

992
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,060
vegan fish is spot on. I was like, oh cool. And then he said it's spot on at

993
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,380
being the worst fish you ever tasted. And then he I said what? And he said it's

994
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:12,000
okay, master troll master, what are these people doing? Kaleb go kill them

995
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,040
their little kids. They're just sitting there. We're the go kill them. I'm not

996
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,440
gonna kill up, kill them.

997
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,040
Okay, I guess I'll kill the chill go kill them. No, it's making me laugh to

998
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,000
say that when there's kids.

999
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,640
Why do they do that? I don't know. I think it's because it's the only cultural

1000
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,480
thing in New York. All these kids who live in New York, literally think the

1001
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,640
work. Well, they just think that every building is their house. They think of

1002
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,520
the city belongs to them. Oh, I hate the children of New York. I think I agree. I

1003
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,300
don't think that it's possible to have a good child. No, yeah, I went to Wendy's

1004
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,020
after the gym

1005
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:49,920
on we, we, we went to the gym at two, got out at three. I can't go anywhere. You

1006
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,720
can't go, you cannot go to Wendy's at three PM. They're infesting the streets.

1007
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,000
They're too many of them. It was literally, it was so, I was the only one

1008
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,400
in there. I'm at the kiosk, I'm waiting, I order, I wait for my food, I turn

1009
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,480
around whole fucking school in there. Yeah, it was like a field trip to

1010
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,880
Wendy's. It was fucked up.

1011
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:13,440
The thing about kids in New York is none of them are the silent loner nerd

1012
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,320
types. No, no, they're all, they're all, they're all like a public library.

1013
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,360
They're all adventurous. Having the most fun day ever. Shut up, you fucking

1014
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,400
kid. They all have 12 friends. It's crazy. I'm sick of these kids having

1015
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,600
friends. I hate it. I don't want them to live here. They all have these

1016
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,040
cliques, they call them. And so basically the jocks. Some are goths, some

1017
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,000
more jobs, the gods, the teacher, the lunch, this is what the world is like

1018
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,080
which is different from the nerds, the wolves, the wolverines,

1019
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,660
the farmers and the red coats, the red

1020
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:51,800
they were so fucking the red coats in school were so fucked. The king's guard,

1021
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,120
their slang was all weird. They'd already hard pack the teacher's guard

1022
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,140
for the teacher

1023
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,140
my

1024
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,960
so

1025
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,240
decking

1026
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,860
just a bunch of thirteen year old kids holding Spears

1027
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:14,500
I've been obsessed with those videos. Neil Neil before the teacher

1028
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:20,640
now he's such a teacher's guard, a fucking guard at looking garden,

1029
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,980
teacher, but that kids such a teacher's guard even guards a substitute. Do you

1030
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,440
always have a patrol or hall not call monitor. He said pop patrol yeah that

1031
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,600
Bob patrol on your teeth. We didn't have a hall monitor. No, no, it was just

1032
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,880
well. If it was it was an adult. We had a hall monitor in my middle school man.

1033
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,240
Why don't they give a kid that middle school? I went to middle school asshole

1034
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,600
stop trying to monitor at your home school. Yeah, it was a disgusting robot

1035
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,520
tentacles. He was running around named Ethan. I we had a hall monitor and it

1036
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,840
was of course the biggest nerd in the entire school. Of course, why is me and

1037
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,660
I don't remember his name, but I think it was one of those guy girl names. If I

1038
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,900
ever saw Leslie back, I literally think it was Les back when I was in school or

1039
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,960
Cameron back when I was in school, if I ever saw a nerd, I'd fucking slap them

1040
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,340
in the face and stomp on their head and just fucking straight the fuck up. I

1041
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:13,060
used to kill nerds. I've fucking killed them. I used to fucking I used to hide

1042
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,480
behind shit and assassins. I thought you were pointing at somebody. I would

1043
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,900
stand inside. I would wait inside my locker for two to three hours at a time,

1044
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,240
skipping class and when I heard somebody walking by saying the approximate

1045
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,800
quadratic

1046
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,820
door door open arm around the neck pull them in close, shut the door, put the

1047
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,320
lock on from the inside, change the combination really fast, reset it to a

1048
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,900
different number and then you're in there sweating with that kid and then I

1049
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,760
be I kill the kid. I kill the kid bloody body and I say

1050
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,240
bite him a little bit and then I say the jocks in their regards

1051
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,640
Jack's know you're planning and that yeah it would be it's like a full mortal

1052
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,160
combat. If I tell he was with his little nerd click three friends, I pull him in.

1053
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,680
He doesn't know where he's in the darkness, the inky blackness, I'm

1054
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,960
strangling him, I'm biting him, I'm eating, I'm snapping his legs backwards,

1055
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,360
I'm doing all types. I'm giving it to him. I blown his back out and then is

1056
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,560
and then is and then isn't his friends. I just see they see, but they're

1057
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,760
saying us to the locker. They see the door

1058
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,880
from inside. They hear, but they hear

1059
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,320
man, the door slowly swings on

1060
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:25,960
skeleton. You ripped you picked him clean. Oh my God, full bone white yep

1061
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,120
a skeleton as white as a bone. I they should do a hit man game. They should do

1062
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:37,560
a as white brittle and bony as a clean bone as a clean bone of all. They

1063
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,480
should do a hit man style game for school where you are in school and you

1064
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,840
have to kill every nerve and by the way you go to a school that has piran.

1065
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,120
that's a good idea or you're the jock yeah, you're the jock, you're the jock

1066
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,640
or you're the nerd getting back at the job. No, it would be. I don't want to

1067
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,080
have nerds. It would be so cool video game programmers or nerds. It's the

1068
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,080
only way not to make a hit man called the human piranha and you're like

1069
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,360
trademark is that you to completely clean them off the book takes so long.

1070
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:08,960
It takes a full day every time yeah, this one looks like the work of the

1071
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,480
human piranha. I was one of the or other or it could, I guess, be normal again

1072
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,080
piranhas. This is a work of a copycat. It's messy. He didn't clean the plate

1073
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,760
and he cleaned the bones. Look, there's still there's still part of a leg on

1074
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:27,120
this. Yeah, there's still mostly leg. He left the grizzly bit at the nails on

1075
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,540
yeah, the real human brown eats to toenails to toenails is technically

1076
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:36,020
bones. That's not true. It's not technically hair jinx. What the hell the

1077
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,640
other day, Pat Patrick said jinx after I just said something and he didn't say

1078
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,440
anything. I said I'm on my way and he said jinx and I saw you replied and I

1079
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,780
said double jinks. I knew it. I still on double. I understood what it meant, but

1080
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:52,240
it made me laugh. Someone says something and he's like jinx, but I said double

1081
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,880
jinx and so you're still on double jinx. You've never got my double. You can't

1082
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,640
talk and you can't talk as much as I want. Well, plus that was a jinx over

1083
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,880
text, so I just can't text. You know every word is another coke that you owe

1084
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,540
him. No, it's not you'll be still. It's a how many words per hour does he

1085
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,180
usually speak thousands. I mean, I wish I have a soda party. You're gonna have a

1086
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,940
full so to have a soda party. Do you are never having a so? Oh my God, I'm gonna

1087
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,820
have a my water party. Not on my watch. You're having a soda party, but we're

1088
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:25,140
not bringing cups. That's the and you gotta you have to waterfall. Uh huh.

1089
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,420
Every single one having any so soda party, little kid, you guys aren't gonna

1090
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,420
fill up the pool with every single type of soda and it's gonna be the ultimate

1091
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,180
soda. Diet doctor, diet, doctor, lemon, coke tea. That's what we used to call

1092
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,280
that diet, doctor lemon Coke, tea, because you hit all the bubbles on the

1093
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,800
top of the thing and it reads diet, doctor, lemon, tea, their bubbles.

1094
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,580
What else are they? They're bubbles. You pop every bubble for every selection

1095
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,880
and there's different styles of bubble on it to

1096
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,080
remember. Not sure what that means. There's different types of bubble.

1097
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,500
There's the round one for Dr Pepper. There's the star one for diet. There's

1098
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,000
you went to a fancy cup. McDonald's has those. I didn't go to no make that. We

1099
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,860
didn't have McDonald. I didn't go to another Donald. I didn't go to make no

1100
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,780
McDonald's where I'm from. We don't have McDonald's where I was from.

1101
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,460
I'm done sounding like that. I'm Kylo Pets. We didn't have McDonald's while I was from.

1102
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,580
What accent is that? Why is it so alluring? I don't know. I'm trying to remember too.

1103
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,180
It's a little old. Like old. Some part of the South that I came from. It's a guy from

1104
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:24,860
Pet Sematary. Oh, it's John Lithgow? You don't want to go off that road. That does sound

1105
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:28,540
like John Lithgow more than I think about it. Well, I think the guy from Pet Sematary

1106
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,140
is John Lithgow. No, that's not John Lithgow. I thought it was. No, the old is maybe the

1107
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,380
the new one, but the old one, the guy what's his name? Judd Crandall

1108
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:40,980
Judd. Whoa, big time. All right, we need to end.

1109
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,960
I'm having fun, but we do need to end.

1110
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:48,940
What do we plug the Patreon right now? No, we're on the Patreon.

1111
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,020
Oh, we're on the Patreon. Just keep your eyes to the ground. Keep your eyes

1112
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:56,540
peeled, and by the way, we got... Oh, we get... Oh, Junior Associate. A short

1113
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:02,000
film that we were all in is coming out on the 2nd of February on Home

1114
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,280
- Planet's YouTube channel.

1115
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,200
And I'm gonna be in Tampa, Florida,

1116
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,680
the 19th and 20th, opening for Mr. Adam Friedland,

1117
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,120
who recently went on Hassan Piker's stream, guys.

1118
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,080
He just told me that.

1119
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,900
- Wow.

1120
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,320
- So, if you're a big Hassan fan,

1121
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,640
I'm sure we'll be doing that kind of political stuff.

1122
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,280
- Yeah, political material.

1123
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,120
- Yep.

1124
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,760
- And keep your eye out in the movie "Junior Associate" for--

1125
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,600
- An Easter egg.

1126
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,600
- An Easter egg-stra that you may remember from this show.

1127
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:37,420
maybe an episode of the show. I forgot we met him there. I met him there. Yep.

1128
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,780
Somebody at this table and he's not you guys his friend at all. He wasn't our

1129
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:47,500
friend. No, Alan, Alan. It was Alan. It was Alan from the focus group. We

1130
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:53,200
discovered him. Cameron discovered him on the shoot. Full scouted. We is the

1131
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,640
man. We love. We should have a premiere and have Alan do a speech before that

1132
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,440
would be. That's a really good idea. He would kill it. He would fucking kill. He

1133
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,580
that kills everything. I sat at the table. He's a monster. I pretended to eat.

1134
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,400
Here is

1135
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,800
the Junior Associates.

1136
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,480
All right, bye guys.

1137
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:20,000
Higher life. Oh, I just remembered something. Caleb, you died in my dream

1138
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,040
the other night. What?

1139
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,600
A big piece of debris hit you in the head and you died. They should make

1140
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,680
technology where I can go into your dream and stop that. That's a bad omen

1141
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,840
there's that big puddle thing that's forming over there. I had a dream that New York City was being

1142
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,800
nuclear bombed and there's explosions happening and I was hugging my fiancée and saying "I love you so

1143
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:44,280
much, oh my god, I can't believe this is happening, I'll always love you, I'm so sorry this world is

1144
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,680
ending like this" and I look over and Caleb gets hit in the head with a giant rock. Was I in the

1145
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:53,080
dream or was I implied to be dead for years? Just Caleb was in the dream getting killed for one

1146
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,960
second. At least I wasn't killed. I had a dream where I was a very bad guy and here's how you can

1147
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,960
tell. Number one I was involved in serial killing. Which is not that big of a deal.

1148
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,520
The only dream I've ever had like this. Yes. But number two, get my partner in

1149
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:16,740
crime Ellen Degeneres. Wow. And she, you and Ellen were just in love. I would bait people into this room and

1150
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,120
then she would murder them with a chainsaw. That's crazy. And that was my dream. Isn't that a crazy

1151
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,200
dream? I did have a crazy, not crazy dream, but last night I had a dream and it

1152
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,600
was you guys were both there.

1153
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,100
Whoa.

1154
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:33,600
And it was me remembering the time that we went to New York City for the first time we were at that Burger King.

1155
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,100
I remember that.

1156
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:40,000
But the weird thing in my dream, it was basically the exact same, exactly how both like we all remember it.

1157
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,900
But I went up to buy onion rings at the Burger King on that bus.

1158
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,300
You know, the bus would stop at the Burger King.

1159
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:46,800
Yes.

1160
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,000
I went there and I just wanted to get onion rings and zesty sauce.

1161
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,200
And the guy said, "One large onion ring, that'll be $18."

1162
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,840
This is such a funny dream.

1163
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,740
I said to him, I said, what the hell?

1164
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,840
$18 for onion rings.

1165
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,400
How big is the how big is the thing?

1166
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,340
And he shows me the size of the thing is like that big.

1167
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,840
And I was like, oh, I'll just get the medium.

1168
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,640
Then he said, oh, then that'll be $8.

1169
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,340
And he said, it's $8 for medium, but it's $18 for the large.

1170
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,840
Oh, my God. Inception.

1171
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,700
It's about dreams.

1172
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,540
But all Christopher Nolan could think about was a building spinning around.

1173
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:27,180
I would rather be a- die a von Ehrich style brother suicide death

1174
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,500
where I lose all my limbs and then I kill myself

1175
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
than be your therapist.

1176
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,100
