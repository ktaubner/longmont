1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We're on.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,560
I just made a stinky fart.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,720
So last time on Trebuchet Village, Tales from the Seabomb, End of the E-Bomb's World, you

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,760
guys finally made it to Hot Babe Island, where you were welcomed by Juniper, the right-hand

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,980
babe to the Queen Bee, the head babe of Hot Babe Island.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,300
You met the Queen Bee and she told you some interesting things about yourselves by consulting

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,500
a relic from, once again, another realm.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,940
In this case, the Realm of All-Knowing.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,460
Which is how Hot Babe Island has stayed so safe and protected for so long.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,580
Told you, Evil Steeble, that you don't belong here.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,940
But that it's more complicated than just not belonging somewhere.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,860
'Cause I'm a steve.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm a steeble.

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,860
What the hell am I doing here?

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm not going to join in guys.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,700
You're singing about my character and I'm not going to join in.

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,740
So you think your character is not a steeple?

18
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Did I say that?

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
I didn't say that.

20
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
Yeah, you essentially said that.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
That song was not accurate.

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,740
You're wasting our time.

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,740
He thinks the song is accurate.

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,420
Patrick is trying to explain the intro of the thing.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,260
Okay, let's hear it.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,300
And I'm not a teacher's pet either.

27
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,180
And Patrick Yodar, you were told, you were asked if you wanted to still be an adventurer.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,700
You gave a hardy affirmative and you were told that danger is following you.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,620
So I should have said no?

30
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,620
No.

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,940
I think you gave a farty effeminate.

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
What?

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
That's what it gave.

34
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,300
I like that.

35
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:45,780
And Dogen, you were told that the dirt cod still plagues you and that...

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,660
Yeah, like anybody have experience with an X?

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,660
No.

38
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,260
potentially traveling to the dirt lands could help you alleviate that if that wasn't an

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,260
interest.

40
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
Y'all ex-girlfriend ever plague you?

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
Nope.

42
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Plagues my inbox.

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Facts.

44
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,260
My email inbox.

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
See how's that?

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,900
Is that a better fax this time from yesterday?

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,220
Yeah, that was a little better.

48
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,380
There's still some work that can be done, right?

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,740
Yeah, still sounds sort of like a...

50
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
You sound unsure.

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
That's the problem.

52
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,340
Well, I'm not sure if it's a fact or not, I guess, is the issue.

53
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Oh, God.

54
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:26,780
So anyway, then you guys went from there to try to do sex trafficking and sell your were

55
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,780
dolphins as sort of sex slaves for Hot Babe Island.

56
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,300
Tried to get a permit and it didn't really work exactly as planned when Stevel shoved

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,100
cotton inside of a woman's mouth.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I don't remember that.

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
I do.

60
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
And then, but then she sort of said like,

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,740
all right, fine, just go play,

62
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,820
because Patrick, as we've learned,

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,700
is from this island, or at the very least,

64
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,140
was spent some time here as a youth.

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,340
- I was conceived here.

66
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,480
- Yes, and he has some memory of his time spent here,

67
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,100
and he is looking for his mama.

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,220
- Yeah.

69
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,660
- Who's actually my aunt.

70
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,900
- It's a little confusing.

71
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,940
- Yeah, we haven't revealed anything yet about it.

72
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
- It's not revealed yet.

73
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,980
- The genealogy is imperfect, but it is there.

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,620
- It's my aunt who might be my mom.

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,200
Or it's my mom who might be my aunt.

76
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
That's right.

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,940
Sort of a quantum uncle.

78
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,460
My uncle could be my daddy.

79
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
Right.

80
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah, if that were revealed.

81
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,260
It sounds like you grew up in damn Tennessee.

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
That's right.

83
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Yeah, because you're only a Tennessee.

84
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,220
Because I was ten when I saw it.

85
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,940
Yeah, that's pretty good.

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,300
So you guys said you already got your were-dolphin start building the thing.

87
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,040

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,400
so obviously you guys can go join the pillow fight tournament.

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,480
Am I at my coloring station? What? You had a coloring station? Oh yeah as a kid.

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,880
The Queen said that she still had his coloring station. She said I still have my

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,080
coloring station and I said that I wasn't gonna look at the pillow fight

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,760
because it was all my aunts. So I think I'm at my coloring station.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Okay, alluring station

So yeah, you guys you guys head over to the pillow fight and what the hell are you doing? I'm at my coloring station

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,040
He's pulling up some sort of website. Oh, you're gonna actually make something okay all right. Yeah, all right

109
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,080
coloring - for - kids - game

110
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,480
Okay, okay

111
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,200
you say you're an ass s okay okay so yeah you guys follow one of the streams that

112
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,320
sort of strewn about the hot babe island and you ride on one of them one of the

113
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,800
rafts there and you end up at the pillow fight it's another pool where the pillow

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,000
fight is and it's an arena it looks similarly sort of in this like lovingly

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,280
crafted arboreal sort of tree plant sort of style like everything else here but

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,040
it is still like an arena sized arena yeah and just a detail I want to throw in

117
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,160
because I think I got buried in the intro the sky above the arena right now

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,360
it's completely black because we built a factory oh yeah there's so much I know

119
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,040
you were trying to like distract us and make us forget that we did that I didn't

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,600
say but it kind of looks for building it all of a sudden it looks a little like

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,920
like you know when a movie takes place in like night 1890s London or something

122
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,260
yeah, just like black or it's like it's like yeah, like in like it's like

123
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,320
stranger things or something it's an evil dimension with cobblestone yeah,

124
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,840
just it looks like blood-borne kind of yeah exactly yeah, it's horror, it's

125
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:48,560
horrid looks really it's raining green and white yeah, oh, what is it we can

126
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,600
get back to the act. Yeah, I just needed to paint a picture of that. I need to

127
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,580
- We gotta make sure that we didn't lose our factory.

128
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,940
- Yeah, so your-- - 'Cause it got built.

129
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,780
- Your factory did get-- - It's pretty hard

130
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,600
to play on the phone.

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,700
But-- - The coloring game's

132
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,660
hard to play on the phone.

133
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,500
- Yeah.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,700
- Actually, it's perfect and normal to play on the phone.

135
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,020
- And you all should go play it.

136
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,180
- Yeah, you should all play it.

137
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,020
- We need to turn on ads on those games.

138
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,040
- They are turned on.

139
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,400
- And so you guys end up at the arena.

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,620
You see that Juniper is leading the yellow team.

141
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,260
There's three teams, red team, yellow team, and blue team.

142
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,620
Missy leads the red team and Mary Kate Ashley leads the yellow team.

143
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,060
You guys didn't meet Missy.

144
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,100
She's the head of the armed forces of Hot Babe Island.

145
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Oh wow.

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
They have forces?

147
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh wow.

148
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
They have forces?

149
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,600
Just in case.

150
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,300
So yeah, you guys see Juniper comes up to you guys and she says, "You guys are welcome

151
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,460
to watch or join in the games if you'd like to."

152
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,900
Okay, but my pillow is very small.

153
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
My pillow is my hand.

154
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
[laughter]

155
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
I usually sleep on my hand.

156
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Mine is very small and it's attached to me.

157
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Well, we'll give you guys pillows.

158
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
So you don't have to worry about that.

159
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Nope, I only will use my own pillow.

160
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
I don't like, I'm allergic to cotton.

161
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
Oh, okay.

162
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, we'll use latex pillows.

163
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Well, then you guys probably shouldn't play the games

164
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
because there are cotton pillows.

165
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
But I'm only allergic to cotton

166
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
when it touches me, when I'm holding it.

167
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,160
I mean, when I'm holding it.

168
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,540
That's funny, 'cause I would've assumed

169
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,460
that Hot Babe Island is all babes and women,

170
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,060
and maybe it might be a little PC,

171
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,740
and maybe accept people who are different

172
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,980
and need to use a latex pillow,

173
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,380
but I see now that it's actually--

174
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,940
- Well, if you wanna use a latex pillow, that's fine,

175
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,040
it's just there aren't also cotton pillows around.

176
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,140
- It's over my hand, my latex pillow.

177
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,580
I stretched it over my hand.

178
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,580
Okay, I lied about everything.

179
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,420
- Okay.

180
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,220
- I think I'm realizing I'm a liar.

181
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,060
- Yeah, I've--

182
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,740
lying a lot yeah that's okay okay I'll just play in the games okay here well

183
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,020
she gives you which team you want to be on red team yellow team blue team I want

184
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,140
to be on that same team yes do you want to help me fill up my pillow with spit

185
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,140
I'm filling mine with cameras.

186
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Mirrors.

187
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,140
Yeah, pinhole cameras.

188
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
Oh, wait.

189
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,140
You know, that doesn't make any sense.

190
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,140
What?

191
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Tell me.

192
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:25,140
I just remembered, obviously we don't have cameras, but I do have a funny ability, a

193
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
funny spell.

194
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,140
Yeah, once you're in the games, there's no spellcasting.

195
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,440
interesting. Well, it's an it's just an item, but before the

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,740
game's okay, well, what can I cast a spell right before the

197
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,840
game? You definitely can okay good because let me let me look

198
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,140
at my while you guys while you guys are strategizing this way.

199
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,540
I do I want to go to Pat and Patrick and where you are so

200
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,540
you guys strategize this. I'm at my coloring station. You're

201
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,240
at your coloring station. Your coloring station is inside of

202
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
the palace. You guys you had a little palace room and while

203
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,140
you're in there you hear a knock on your door while you're

204
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:05,900
coloring hello hello I can't hear anything I'm coloring Pat Patrick hello

205
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:24,340
and you someone walks in and it is a older Verdan who is a woman look at this

206
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,340
I don't know why you even came.

207
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,340
And you would recognize her as your mother.

208
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Hi, Mom.

209
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Patrick.

210
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,340
Literally no different than when he had the phone in front of his eyes.

211
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Patrick, I'm trying to find you. There we go.

212
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Oh, honey.

213
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
That sounds amazing.

214
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Right? Thank you. I'm just trying to do a girl, Alda.

215
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
That's pretty good.

216
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Right? Yeah.

217
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,340
That is pretty good.

218
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,940
Alice Alda. Alice Alda. That's my name. Try to make it a little bit more like this.

219
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Make it a little more like this. It sounds like my voice is cracking.

220
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,940
[Laughter]

221
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,940
What's the deal with you returning to Hot Pape Island?

222
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Um...

223
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Oh crap, I don't even remember.

224
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,940
I think I heard the name of the island and

225
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,940
completely forgot that this is where I was conceived.

226
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:27,140
hmm yes and that you told me that yes many years ago every single detail and

227
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,020
then you left with your uncle yeah on adventures is there gonna be a reveal

228
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:40,340
right now? maybe oh I feel like you decided that's up to you and not me you

229
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,900
did decide that so you're the drill. well mom I guess this is the reveal. you know everything and nothing so it's

230
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,340
really i guess this is the reveal

231
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,500
that he's actually my dad

232
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,580
my eyes go i'm in a completely different place don't hear any of this my eyes go

233
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,340
wide

234
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,260
and i'll it's like i've been struck by lightning i feel the reveal in my body

235
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,140
yes

236
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,640
he was your father

237
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,480
wow

238
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,500
but he wanted

239
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,220
that's what's great about dean you get to do these amazing character moments

240
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,720
It's a role play and just really dig into...

241
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,980
What I like about it is like Patrick just so fully just embodies a character like you

242
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,540
really like are thinking like him too.

243
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,180
You know and reacting like him naturally.

244
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,780
He wanted to seem like your uncle so he felt...

245
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,820
Well I already know I have a gem in my chest that tells me everything.

246
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,820
They felt more like he could get away with going on adventures and not being a father.

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,700
Yeah that makes complete sense.

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah.

249
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
But then he brought him with him?

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,500
Well, he brought him with him because he had, you know, complicated... why are you...

251
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
Why are you in my coloring station?

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I am the janitor.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh, I guess, I mean, if you wanted to ask that question you could.

254
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,300
It's really... I could tell you, I think he had complicated feelings probably.

255
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,200
He's like, "Oh, I love my son, but I also want to go on adventures.

256
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I'll say I'm his uncle and keep him around, but at arm's length and, you know..."

257
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
And so he could not be a good dad.

258
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,940
Hmm arms length is how it is a bad dad is a good uncle that's correct

259
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,520
True, that's a good point. Yes. That's a fine line

260
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,880
If we did if we got anything out of the last two years of doing this bad dad

261
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,620
We got a good uncle two sides of the same coin. Mm-hmm

262
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,600
And so we'll we'll zoom out from this reveal so you can finish your drawing

263
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,060
Okay, I got the drawing because the reveal has made me

264
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,800
This is right before the game starts. We're both prepping.

265
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,720
I reach into my pocket and I fumble around and I feel that I have my peephole ring.

266
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Oh, fuck yes. I forgot again.

267
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
And then I ask, "Who am I talking to?"

268
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Juniper.

269
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Is there a girls' locker room?

270
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
All the locker rooms.

271
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
All of them?

272
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Is there one that's got like the best girls in it?

273
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Well, I think it's my team.

274
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
What team is that?

275
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,820
- The yellow team.

276
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,220
- And where do they live?

277
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,060
- Oh, it's right over there.

278
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,900
- Okay.

279
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,720
- And she points to sort of--

280
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,540
- And is it like a fully nude locker room?

281
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,140
- Yeah, we don't care.

282
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,980
- Okay.

283
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,660
- Are you joining the yellow team?

284
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,740
- I gotta go do some reconnaissance first to decide.

285
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,560
- Yeah, sure.

286
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,060
- Or actually, nevermind.

287
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,060
I'm gonna put my people ring on the pillow, right?

288
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,660
- If you put, you could put on your eye

289
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,540
and just see through everyone's clothes.

290
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,860
What? Like an x-ray goggle? Yeah, that makes complete sense. I don't know how you don't get that.

291
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,940
You don't, you know, it only goes through like one surface. It goes through a layer.

292
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:49,860
Like a peephole. Then uh, what, then it's put it on a woman. Alright, I put it on

293
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:59,060
Juniper's stomach. You see sort of like... A baby? You see a, you see a stomach and

294
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,700
she's like oh oh is everything okay it's poop in here. I take it off. I don't

295
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,220
know what to do with my corn ring. I will find a use for this one day. All right,

296
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,540
so this is less of a free love kind of place about a pillow fights about to

297
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,340
start right yeah. I'll join whatever it what team did you join. Whatever team you

298
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,260
join okay, we'll join red team okay, red team and I cast I'm going to cast a few

299
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,520
spells right right beforehand. So first I'm going to cast I'm going to cast

300
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Thaumaturgy on myself. I'm going to use the option you alter the appearance of

301
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,360
your eyes for one minute. My eyes are going to be completely red.

302
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:50,080
I'm going to pick up my pillow and I cast Searing Smite to set my pillow on fire.

303
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
I

304
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:08,800
Mean I do you're gonna do something I guess the but urging again to alter the appearance of the flames and make them really huge

305
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,360
Look like I have wings made out of fire

306
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:20,960
And I would also like to cast okay blindness and deafness on on

307
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
on

308
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,280
okay. I think is that

309
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm going to cast I'm going to cast command where you can give a one word

310
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,080
command. I'm going to give you a command attack to myself.

311
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,880
Pray for myself. I don't think it's a command.

312
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,080
I don't think a man works like that.

313
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,920
I think you could just--

314
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,000
Become evil.

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,640
I think you could just convince yourself

316
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,720
that that's what you're doing.

317
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,520
Sin, that's good, sin is good.

318
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,800
Sin, sin.

319
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,080
So you're completely blind and deaf,

320
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
you have bright red eyes,

321
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,160
and your pillow's on fire.

322
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
Yeah, and it looks like the flames

323
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,240
are going all over my body too.

324
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,200
Yeah, yeah, so blinded, I mean,

325
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
you're not gonna, I guess you're not gonna

326
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,400
try to resist it, right?

327
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
No, yeah.

328
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,520
He embraces his new life.

329
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,540
Yeah, I mean, I guess like,

330
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,140
you're just not resisting blindness and

331
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,340
deafness it just happens to you. So

332
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,820
everything's black around you and there

333
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,260
are no sounds you just feel a tremendous

334
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,620
amount of heat. So you're drawing.

335
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,060
You're coloring. He's been eating something nasty.

336
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,140
There's a paper jam in the printer. Did you just draw that?

337
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,380
No. That's from swagpoop.com/coloring-book

338
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,620
You heard it here first folks

339
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,220
you can print out your coloring page.

340
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,460
print out your photo when you're done. Pretty cool. That's huge. Yeah. Okay, so

341
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:56,300
you're now some sort of demon. Not some sort of. I'm a demon. Okay, and what are

342
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,140
you doing besides casting blindness and deafness? You're just gonna hang out next

343
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:08,060
year? I'm gonna hop on his back. Okay, can you fly? I don't think so. Right, just

344
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:14,580
checking you can carry yes. Let me think if you can yeah. I mean you can carry

345
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,500
him that's about that's actually fine because you're a dwarf. It's just kind of

346
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,260
carrying another person yeah, because you're also like a little goblin. So

347
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,100
you're just like this like a little little or you know it never. I also will

348
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,740
cast. I get him on my I put him on my shoulders. Okay, so that he's like we're

349
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,620
tall. I'm going to use my final spell slot too, and I'm going to cast bless on

350
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,960
myself to give myself bonuses. Hold on, let me see if I can do anything for you here.

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,840
You're just blinded. Okay, you see Missy, who is the head of the red team, and she, again,

352
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,480
like I said, she's like the head of the military. I'm the head of the red team now. And she

353
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,360
sort of looks at you approvingly and is like, "That's what I like to see!" Like, she's like,

354
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,360
like, like. I'd like to create water in her brain. In her brain? Yeah. This is not going

355
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,760
This is not going to end well for you guys at a certain point.

356
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,240
But I am...

357
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,680
How's she going to even know?

358
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Just wat... it's going to... it's like the easiest way to...

359
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:09,880
Okay, fine.

360
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Also, I think you also need to be... is it where... doesn't it need to be somewhere you need to see...

361
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,960
you can see?

362
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,920
That would make sense.

363
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,320
No.

364
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,080
What if you create water...

365
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,120
Yeah, in her mouth.

366
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
In an open container. It has to be in an open container.

367
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay, as she's talking, I create water in her mouth.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,040
I didn't even think about that when we did the destroy water thing.

369
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,600
I just let you destroy it within a tube.

370
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,040
You create it in her mouth.

371
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,720
Yeah, okay, and not as an attack. It's not like I'm not trying to hurt her and

372
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,000
just a little bit of water. I just wanted to it will kind of wanted to just

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,560
interrupt her her like whatever speech she's about to give to the she was just

374
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,240
approving and thought it was cool what he was doing. Well, she's just as water

375
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,880
in her mouth. She needs to understand who the real leader is and it's the guy

376
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,560
with the red eyes. I'm blind and deaf. I assume the game has started. I'm a

377
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,840
swing. Yeah, she looks around who did that. She's like wondering who put water

378
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,420
Yeah, who put water who has a creator destroy water as a spell I

379
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,940
Don't know roll deception

380
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,080
Why would she why would I be suspected

381
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,480
Cuz you could just cuz you said it if you said nothing it would have been a lot easier

382
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,680
You're such a bitch yeah, I know

383
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,800
Well

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
You're a bitch.

385
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
You're a bitch.

386
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
You're just a bitch.

387
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,480
Wow, you guys got really mean.

388
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
No, I was--

389
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
That's a four.

390
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
That's a four.

391
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,480
Bitch.

392
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,800
She sort of looks at you and says, "That's a warning."

393
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Got it?

394
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I create water.

395
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
I go, "What do you mean?"

396
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,320
I create water in my own mouth.

397
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
I go, "See?

398
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,280
Why would I do that to myself?"

399
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,200
So you're just like using up all your spell slots to do this?

400
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Yeah, of course.

401
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200

Look, I just wanted to see how you were doing now that you're here.

438
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,000
It's good to see you're still doing your art. I always loved your coloring and your macaroni art you used to make.

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

440
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,400
Do you remember the one you made where it was you, you were climbing a mountain and you claimed it, you called it Mount Patridge?

441
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
I thought that was so sweet.

442
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
That actually happened.

443
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,900
You claimed a mountain?

444
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900

450
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:54,820
Look, I also wanted to talk to you about something. So, I don't know if your

451
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:01,420

452
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:08,140
about not being your uncle. Yeah. You see... We're cut away from that. You guys...

453
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,780
Okay, I also... I used up all my spell slots but I have one ability left that I'm

454
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:17,540
going to use which is my channel divinity which I can and I'm shaking my head

455
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:23,460
channel divinity dreadful aspect and every creature you can see me within 30

456
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:31,060
feet has to make a saving throw or be terrified of me. I'll roll I guess one for

457
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,580
I guess I'll roll one for each team because otherwise it's like 100 women.

458
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,940
dude within thirty feet thirty foot like radius. Oh my God, it's so funny.

459
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,560
Okay,

00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,860
you're team. It's not where you see. I think it's thirteen, but it's not fair.

461
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,340
If it's if they all pass it, you have to make individual once for every woman.

462
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,860
There's like a hundred people yeah, so just average it out

463
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,180

466
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,500
terrified of you.

467
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,940
How are the other women not terrified? I feel like I might get advantage or something.

468
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,980

504
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,260
I mean, yeah, you should, you should, what I will say is that like with this already is

505
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,340
a problem.

506
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,860
You should try to be wary about doing damage.

507
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
About hurting people?

508
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Yeah.

509
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,940
Besides, outside of the flaming pillow.

510
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Can I?

511
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,780
Cause you will just, yeah, you'll just be booted off the island, probably.

512
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,300
What is, okay, can I use ray?

513
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
That's obviously up to you guys.

514
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,740
What if I use ray of enfeeblement?

515
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,940
I mean that, right, so it's a debuff.

516
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,220
So it is a little different, but you are, at this point you will be like, there is, I will

517
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:06,520
say now that it's begun, like any spells you want to cast you would have to do like surreptitiously,

518
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,900
you know, because it's supposed to be a no spell.

519
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,100
All right, well then you know what I'll do?

520
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:19,920
I'll point, to make him even scarier, I'll point at him and like get everyone's attention

521
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:27,680
and be like everybody run for your lives. He's a crazy deaf maniac with red

522
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,240
abilities and a flames pillow roll persuasion because that's not even not

523
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,680
true at this point. It's completely true. He's a crazy deaf mania and not and

524
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,280
everybody's true.

525
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:45,600
I'm going to win this pillow for your

526
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,960
18 persuasion. Oh, wow. Yeah, I mean they were if they weren't already like

527
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,320
Focused on him because of all the ways that he is. How do you win the pillow fight by the way?

528
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,640
What are the rules here?

529
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,720
Do you I mean like if everybody leaves the arena?

530
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:10,020
Well, the original rule was gonna be like it's like three hits and you're out and so it's like you can deflect pillows

531
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,120
Nobody's getting close to him. Yeah. No, I mean this is a completely

532
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,400
This is why I didn't create the like create any

533
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,220
It's hard rules because I was like they're probably going to do some fucking so we win

534
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,840
by being the only people who aren't disqualified because everybody else ran out of yeah, absolutely

535
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,640
you can all right, so on their turn so you did that on your turn that was your action

536
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,040
9 that was the red team so on their turn I mean because they're terrified of you and

537
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,360
which actually can I can I see what was it just says there it doesn't say what they have

538
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,000
to do I assume they run their friends for one minute they have to move usually 30 feet

539
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
away from you. Yeah, that's what it is.

540
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So they're all going to try to move away from you,

541
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
whichever direction that is.

542
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So, that's not always outside the arena.

543
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But for a lot of them it is. How big is the arena?

544
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
What? It's like a

545
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
football field. How big is that?

546
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Like a hundred yards.

547
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It's more like a hundred feet around.

548
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's more like a hundred feet around than a football field.

549
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's too big. It's not that big

550
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
of an arena. Okay. It's like a hundred

551
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
feet circumference or something. Okay.

552
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
A hundred feet circumference? No, not me.

553
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Okay, okay, okay, that's fine with me.

554
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Perfect. You said it, you said it, you said it.

555
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
That's tiny.

556
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's do the math. What's the radius?

557
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If the radius is 30 feet or less, we win.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I have to Google it.

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Google it. 300 circumference.

560
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I can't do that math in my head.

561
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,000
300 feet.

562
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Sikinemephorus.

563
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
What?

564
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
- I'll let you, I don't look sometimes.

565
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,800
- Yup, okay.

566
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,640
All right.

567
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,880
- Circle calculator.

568
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,040
- All right, circumference 300.

569
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,620
Put it in, calculate.

570
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,440
- Right, it's 47.

571
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,680
- 47 feet.

572
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,520
- All right.

573
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,280
- So they use both their movement though,

574
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,200
which they all have,

575
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,280
if they all use both their movement, so.

576
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,560
- It's just slightly too big to instantly win.

577
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,400
- That's okay.

578
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,500
- So they will use their movement though to,

579
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,260
So I will say that like 50% of them are out.

580
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,220
- Oh wait, it's also, yeah,

581
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,060
because they move 30 feet away

582
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,260
and then they just can attempt another.

583
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,980
No, it says they attempt another saving throw.

584
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,260
So if they don't save, they just keep moving.

585
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,220
- Okay, so they move 30 feet.

586
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,500
So you've got like about, this is for the red team.

587
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,780
You got about like half of them out pretty much.

588
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,980
- That's our team though.

589
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,820
- That's right.

590
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,660
- Yes.

591
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,500
(laughing)

592
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,320
- Okay.

593
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,160
- I can't control this.

594
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,260
- All right, they still have disadvantage on this.

595
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,980
I'll say because you are actually.

596
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,860
- We just made you just a monster.

597
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
you just genuinely terrifying.

598
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
for like 5 minutes.

599
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
wow, yeah they failed.

600
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
so this is the red team losing.

601
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
except for you.

602
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
oh yeah, i'm also, i'm out.

603
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
i run.

604
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
because i'm also terrified.

605
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
oh wait, i got a roll of saving throw.

606
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
this assumes that he's directly in the middle of the field.

607
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
yeah, i'm also assuming that

608
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
they're afraid and they're not going to

609
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,860
try another action too.

610
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
like they can run and they can still be afraid

611
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,980
like do an attack or something or but they're not going to their constitution

612
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,820
saving their wisdom wisdom. Sorry. Yeah, like they're not really prepared for

613
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,380
this kind of moment. It's kind of creativity. Six. You are you go by

614
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,700
goodbye. All right, Alicia. Okay, it's my it's my turn now. Um, yeah, I was

615
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,340
just like swinging wildly around. Okay, you don't really hit anybody. Yeah,

616
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,060
that's what I was. They're all. Yeah, you're just swinging. I'm doing the

617
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,020
that Texas Chainsaw Dance, swinging the pillow in the air. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

618
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,200
yeah, no thing you don't hit anybody. Yeah, now we're going to do the this is

619
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,820
the yellow team. Oh, my God, please. Okay,

620
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:52,620
my God, please yep, they're gone and now the blue team.

621
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,260
Yeah, they're gone.

622
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,860
So you see, I'm still blind.

623
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,420
I just know he won swinging around. See the Queen bee who's been like

624
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,420
watching this for like Red Team wins

625
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,140
swinging a flaming pillow alone.

626
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,180
Just everybody just sits on the

627
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,060
all happened in the space of like six seconds. Yeah, like I walked out. I

628
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,060
just said a bunch of magic words and then suddenly just turned into a

629
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,700
monster and just everybody runs away. It's over. It's so I'm still a

630
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,980
for like what I think of another minute well let's just let him Tucker himself

631
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,060
out he'll fall asleep you've seen him do this before yeah pretty much yeah all

632
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,020
the time yeah he'll just he'll just calm down yeah I think probably him he got

633
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,660
another minute in him what's harm huh does he mean us any harm he doesn't even

634
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,580
know where he is he's completely blind and deaf oh poor thing just flailing

635
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,140
around in the middle the arena I walk out in the middle of the arena yeah so we're

636
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,440
- We're coming back to you now.

637
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,860
- We'll see this, oh no wait, no, there's something.

638
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,700
- Yeah, we're coming back to you.

00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,780
And your mom says-- - Oh, they get hit.

640
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,100
(laughing)

641
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,780
- There's still time.

642
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,060
- Your mom says to you, "Let's do it again."

643
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,900
- Yeah, wait, you have to walk out and get hit

644
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
'cause I have a bunch of weapon buffs on.

645
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,380
(laughing)

646
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,380
- Your mom says, "Patrich, I, oh, Patrich, wait."

647
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:20,140
- I gotta do the-- - Yeah, what's going on?

648
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,300
- Yeah, I gotta do the voice first,

649
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,260
and then I gotta do an eye, yeah, that's how I get into it.

650
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,340
"Patrick, um, here's the thing.

651
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,640
Your father and...

652
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
Sticky...

653
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,400
Fingers..."

654
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,360
And then...

655
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,820
"Was Sticky Fingers my uncle?"

656
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,560
Then, uh, you watch eyes roll in the back of her head...

657
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,300
and she dies.

658
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,340
"Holy crap."

659
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,660
And so you're right now alone in the palace... "Holy... What just happened?

660
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,980
What the hell, my mom is dead?

661
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,140
Another incredible character.

662
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,660
Sorry I put this on you today.

663
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,940
Ah, geez.

664
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,620
Ah, Jesus.

665
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,060
What are you gonna do? What's going on?

666
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,540
You said, "Oh my God, my mom is dead,"

667
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,260
then you picked up your pencil to draw one line on your...

668
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,700
Ah, crap.

669
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,020
There's so much going on right now,

670
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,720
I don't even know what then even know which way to go about this.

671
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,420
About I can I investigate the body. Yeah, absolutely.

672
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,320
Real investigation.

673
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:36,220
It's a good first instinct. I crap. Let me check her out.

674
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,020
Best to give you a dead body.

675
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,420
You might look at her eyes rolled in the back of her head.

676
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,920
She might have seen something back there.

677
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,520
There might have been a brain.

678
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,920
She was trying to look at seven might have been something so scary.

679
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,920
With the 7, you're not able to like, what you're able to suss out is that there's like, there

680
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,200
was no like, there's no entrance exit wound.

681
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
There's no like...

682
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,000
Can I roll perception to like, check the room out?

683
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,440
Yeah, you can definitely do, you can do investigation again for the room this time.

684
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,320
What'd you get?

685
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,640
25, but it was under perception.

686
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,840
We'll just add whatever your investigation is instead.

687
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Okay.

688
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
So what is that plus?

689
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
And then what was the original roll?

690
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,320
Well I rolled a 20

691
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,000
and then my perception is this. You rolled a natural 20? Yeah. So it doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

692
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,280
So you got a natural 20.

693
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,200
Uh... there's nothing in the room

694
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,440
that indicates it had anything to do. Great, what a fucking waste of a roll. So, um...

695
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,720
yeah, you can't, there's just like, you can tell very clearly, you've been in these,

696
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,640
you've been in situations where

697
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
you're a thief,

698
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,240
you're rogue, you've been in situations where people have been like, you know,

699
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,800
assassinated. She must have been poisoned.

700
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
There's no evidence of that.

701
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Earlier.

702
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Wait a minute.

703
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,480
I start hitting my, the gem in my chest.

704
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
My belly.

705
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm trying to think.

706
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Yeah.

707
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'm trying to remember.

708
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,640
I'm trying to see all past, present, and future.

709
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,920
You can just see your own past through this.

710
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Okay.

711
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,720
So while you're hitting this and thinking about your mom, you do have flashes of memories

712
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,880
of her being here, of your father who was Trump's.

713
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,400
Can I go back to the minute that she died?

714
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Can you go back?

715
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Can you remember that exact moment?

716
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Yes.

717
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
That's interesting. I like that. I do like a Batman Arkham Asylum. Yeah, I'm thinking

718
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,840
of I think what we can do with that is I think it's a good idea. I think Roll,

719
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:26,000
I guess this is really arcane. It's kind of your ability to understand the magic that's inside of

720
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,440
your tummy. That's an 18. Okay, so you're able to recall the moment when she died, which it's very

721
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:42,320
painful to see it, obviously. I'm remembering that and I go, holy crap. And Roll,

722
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:49,360
perception as you're in this sort of like memory state that you're in?

723
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Another 25.

724
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Okay.

725
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Wow.

726
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,360
What's going on?

727
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,880
As her eyes are rolling in the back of your her head you see very faintly on her around

728
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,600
her like sort of clavicle a rune glow.

729
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,760
She also swallowed a gem.

730
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
She like has a necklace on?

731
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,640
No like it's like a like a rune glow from underneath her skin.

732
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,600
Oh, what rune is it? What does it look like?

733
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:21,240
The rune, I don't know, you would probably know this as a rune that is looking for like a kill word.

734
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,800
You would know this.

735
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,120
Murder.

736
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,520
Well, like it's a...

737
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,720
Assassinate.

738
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,800
No, so it's like, what I mean is that like it's a rune that activates when you say,

739
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,440
like within certain contexts when certain things are said.

740
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,640
Oh, okay.

741
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,840
What did you say?

742
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,920
No, she probably tried to say something about...

743
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,720
about. She said sticky fingers and then died. Your father and sticky fingers. Oh shit. Somebody.

744
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,920
The reveal. The reveal. The reveal was a murder. Okay. There's a reveal here. And so what would

745
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Patrick Yodar say if he realized all this right then? Damn it. Perfect. God damn it.

746
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,200
Damn it to hell. This sucks. So we'll go back to the, I don't know if you're going to try

747
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,280
run to your friends at this point or if you're gonna like talk to the people.

748
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,080
Yeah, come run out into the arena and tell us.

749
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
Like a maniac.

750
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
You're not gonna stay power-dodged.

751
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Should I invest?

752
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,920
Well, I know that it's a rune now, so that's like everything else is.

753
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
Yeah, I mean you could talk to someone.

754
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,920
So yeah, I run down to the arena as fast as I can.

755
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,120
That's where most of the folks are.

756
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,340
I mean, there's definitely guards here.

757
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,720
You can like let them know that this happened.

758
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
But like you can also...

759
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,240
Hey, I tap one of them on the shoulder.

760
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,040
Hi, Patrick.

761
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:43,400
My auntie, who was my mommy, there's a rune for a kill word and it was on her neck and

762
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,200
I said, "God damn it."

763
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
She died.

764
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,200
She's dead?

765
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah.

766
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Where is she?

767
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
She's in that room.

768
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Oh my God.

769
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,380
Thank you.

770
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,360
Can you inform the Queen?

771
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,920
Yeah.

772
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:09,840
yeah I was like I was gonna say like no she just died she's not the queen okay

773
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,520
so she she calls over one of the other guards and it says tells him to go get

774
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,280
like a paramedic and like the the and then like female guards and then never

775
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,360
thought I'd see the day world come to this so you now you've been like I you

776
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Maybe there's long enough left if Patridge Yodar wants to run up and tap me on the shoulder to tell me any news.

777
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,360
In one minute. He's not going to be here in a minute.

778
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:39,360
I jump off the stairs very, from a very high.

779
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,360
I need to hit one person.

780
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Okay.

781
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
Steevel, that's on you.

782
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
What do you mean that's on me? I'm terrified still.

783
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Well, that's what I mean. You can enable him to hit one person.

784
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Does the Queen maybe walk up to me and try to hand me a trophy?

785
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,800
We're in an initiative right now. So it's a minute left. So you have basically

786
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,360
Like nine more tries to not be afraid and then try to get someone to hit him him for him to hit

787
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,720
All right, cuz you I'm gonna try you are well, I mean you can try to get somebody to hit you

788
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Yeah, just start running straight. I

789
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,180
Will people just move aside? Oh, I'll roll a wisdom save and see if I'm still terrified

790
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,000
hmm

791
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,560
16. Okay. You're not yeah, not terrified anymore. Oh, come on

792
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:36,480
I'm gonna see what's going on with it. Just walk directly towards him

793
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:47,280
Listen dog it just stop just be you it's over you won you won. Okay. Yeah, and also

794
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,080
So while you can't hear him and as you've been raging and it's been like a lot of fun

795
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
You also hear hasn't been fun

796
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:02,840
Program my brain to sin you also hear a

797
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:11,680
Coughing sound I hear it how oh in your mind whoa and you hear a woman's voice

798
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,200
Ooh-la-la and you hear you hear her say

799
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I

800
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,720
Know a dirt man when I see one

801
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,120
I

802
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,880
Instinctively, I don't like that. I instantly swing my weapon. Yeah, evil standing right in front of me. I'm standing directly in front

803
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,280
I'm gonna roll an attack roll here, and I get to add a d4 okay

804
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:42,440
I rolled a 14, but I get to add a d4 from bless think your AC is not is not even oh yeah

805
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,040
I think you might have higher AC when I remember my AC is 15

806
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,760
plus two, so it's a sixteen. Yeah, it hits you. Roll for damage. Okay, I have

807
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,000
to roll for damage and then I also have to add some stuff to that. Okay, that's

808
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,960
six damage plus hold on. I have to see how much damage

809
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,960
searing smite. That's

810
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,400
this is fun. I forgot to have the game log. I'm at seventeen HP right now. I

811
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:21,560
think I'm going to kill you. Oh. It deals an extra 1d6 damage and causes you to ignite

812
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:28,700
in flames. Don't worry guys, I'm going to calm him down. Wait, wait, wait, what level did

813
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,280
you cast searing smite at? Just one. Cast it at the maximum level. I couldn't, I didn't

814
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,840
have enough slots I don't think. I'm on stevel right now, sorry. It's plus 5, I don't remember

815
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,580
remember what number I said before plus

816
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,100
five

817
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,840
what I said I don't want I was looking at

818
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,360
your

819
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,360
oh yeah. No, you only have first level

820
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,400
here. We go right because you're

821
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,460
pounding okay is six it's eleven damage

822
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,760
and he catches on fire. Okay, yeah, so

823
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,100
it's really see what I have six HP. What

824
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,720
is catching on fire do at the start of

825
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
each of its turns until the spell ends

826
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,860
you must make a constitution saving

827
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,760
throw. If you fail you take another one

828
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,700
six damage. Yeah. So, yeah, you just got hit in the face. You hear the whole crowd go,

829
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,500
"Gasp!" And then like you're getting up and saying, "Don't worry." Yeah, yeah. "Don't

830
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,460
worry." "I'm still, I'm on fire." Yeah. "Nobody just, he's completely harmless."

831
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:27,220
All right, roll, roll. It's, I mean, we're back to the top of the order. So you roll again a,

832
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:35,860
a, a, a, roll a constitution saving throw. Constitution saving throw? Yeah. Three.

833
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:43,700
five. You take another one, do six damage. And you have six health, so if he gets max.

834
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:51,140
Let's see here. Rolling. It's a four. It landed on six and then tipped over.

835
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,340
Oh, the fire gets like one fire length higher on my body. You start to see where it used to

836
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,900
just be orange and red. There's a yellow layer in there too now. Patrick, you're showing up as

837
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,740
as we're looping around the order.

838
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,300
- I look at everything that's happening and say,

839
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,140
what the hell?

840
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,340
- Yeah, and then roll one more save.

841
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,180
- This is basically 2020 in a nutshell.

842
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,380
- This is the only time that create or destroy water

843
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,920
will actually be useful.

844
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,100
- I forget that I'm so focused on calming everybody down,

845
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,620
I completely forget I have it.

846
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
I got a 17.

847
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
- Okay, you passed.

848
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,460
- All right, cool.

849
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,280
- Okay, the fire goes away.

850
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,340
See what I mean, folks?

851
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,180
I mean, he's completely on.

852
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,780
- I'm just like, how can I swing again?

853
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm right in front of you, looking away from you towards the crowd.

854
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,460
He's completely, he's entirely harmless.

855
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:49,380
This attack doesn't have fire, but it's a dirty 20 plus 4.

856
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,380
Yeah, he's dead.

857
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,820
So yeah, he's like, "Don't worry, he's good, but I'm dead."

858
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,980
Like just knocked out from a pillow.

859
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,980
Yeah.

860
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,540
And Patrick shows up.

861
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,540
11 damage.

862
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,540
Yeah.

863
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,940
And then it shows up and what do you say?

864
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,940
You say, "Goddamn, this is 2020."

865
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,780
This is 2020 in a nutshell.

866
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,780
Damn this bullcrap.

867
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:18,820
My blindness and deafness ends and I'm like, "Oh my God, who killed Stiebel?

868
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,220
There's going to be hell to pay when I find out who did this."

869
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,620
Are you still have fire eyes and stuff?

870
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,420
I still have the fire eyes, but that's it.

871
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,420
As you say this-

872
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,420
Everything else ended.

873
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,420
You also cough up a bit of sand into your hand.

874
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,420
Uh oh.

875
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:41,060
And Queen Bee goes to you, Patrick, and says, "Patrick, I'm so glad you can join."

876
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:45,460
I had to tell you something, but I've--no, I remember.

877
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,860
My mom is dead.

878
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,860
Oh?

879
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,860
And so we'll take--

880
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,180
And it was a rune killing.

881
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,180
And so yeah.

882
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,580
it was a rune and it said glyphberg on it

883
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,060
now what?

884
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,620
evil stevel is going to end up in the infirmary slash hot springs

885
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,460
whoa

886
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,540
you two, all part of my plan

887
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,400
what prize do i get also?

888
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,300
i won the pillow fight

889
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,620
uh...

890
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,740
yeah you get to uh...

891
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,860

892
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,420
It was just fun. I did all that and there was no prize?

893
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,220
No, it was just a fun tournament.

894
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,420
It's Hot Babe Island, they have everything they want and need.

895
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,420
Ahhhh.

896
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,620
I'm sorry.

897
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,620
[Heavy breathing]

898
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Oh, he's getting my head.

899
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:44,620
You two are back at the palace as the Queen Bee is examining your mom's body.

900
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,620
And uh...

901
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Doesn't that look like crap?

902
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,620
[Laughter]

903
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:59,360
It looked like total bullcrap. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. It was a power word. Yeah, the word was

904
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:07,140
Glyfberg. Glyfberg? Ruin Glyfberg. What could that have meant? I'm so sorry that this has

905
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:14,060
befallen you in your visit here. Yeah, I mean, she has no reason to distrust you. I'm so

906
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,420
sorry that this has happened while you were here. Things like this never happen on Hot

907
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:27,220
Bay by than usually. Yeah I bet they don't. They don't? Yeah I bet they don't.

908
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,700
What's up? I'm just agreeing with you. I don't know what you're... No it just seems

909
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:39,420
like you're insinuating that they happen here. Nah. I'm just I'm just sorry I'm

910
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,980
pissed off cuz my mom just died in front of me. Of course your mom just passed of course.

911
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,500
look I don't know what we can do for you we can give her a proper burial but

912
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,260
something we set her on fire um would that be what she would have wanted I

913
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,380
think that's a ritual right you set her on fire in the ocean oh yeah I heard

914
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,140
about that that's what you're doing what do we put her in the hot spring and she

915
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:11,820
comes back to life I don't think that's on top of my body what about we bring

916
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:19,660
her back to life. Like Frankenstein. Please. Well, I don't think there's really any way

917
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,760
to bring her back alive. She's passed. We live in a fantasy world where there's literally

918
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,580
necromancy. Well, if you want to dabble in necromancy, you're welcome to. Get me alive

919
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,340
right now. I don't, but you just said there's no way. Make me alive right now, guys. Is

920
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:36,460
there a necromancer on the island? Not on our island. Like a female necromancer? Well,

921
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,060
the only person on the island. Who wears like a skull bra. I'd like for some of these females

922
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:47,680
Romance my neck. Oh, I'm playing. Oh, the only person on the island who would know about this would be Albert

923
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,660
Albert the witch

924
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:56,780
Albert she lives in a cove. There's a woman named Albert it happens. All right

925
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,540
Okay, you could go see her. I I

926
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,900
Don't advise going for neck. What about like a rune expert?

927
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,580
Well again Albert would be the one who has any real knowledge of this.

928
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
So we have to go see Albert, huh?

929
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,580
Well if you want to know more about this particular instance, I suppose, but...

930
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,580
*sigh*

931
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
What do you guys want to do?

932
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,580
Let's go to Albert.

933
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,580
You certainly don't have to. She might not be able to help you at all.

934
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
Then why did you say that?

935
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
I mean that's an option.

936
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,580
I'm sorry for snapping, I'm just pissed off because I'm looking at my mom's dead body.

937
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,580
No, I understand. I was being pretty immature earlier and I'm trying to reel it back now.

938
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
I also just quit drinking Diet Coke.

939

945
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:20,140
attending to her wound that's a nice thing to call that yeah attending to her

946
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:26,940
incision slot oh my god to the like third-degree burn let me see that grievous

947
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,620

948
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,500
so delirious from whatever they've been giving me or because I've never really

949
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,580
had real sex I'm completely convinced that I'm fucking these women. Like them

950
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,520
touching my skin is like intimate contact and I'm just like looking

951
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,300
directly at them but I can't smile or really move my eyes at all because

952
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,740
the burns hurt so bad. Glad to see you come to Steve.

953
00:50:52,740 --> 00:51:00,780
If any woman would be so lucky to see that

954
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,540
she said she goes to get you some more like some herb. She's putting in a like

955
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,220
a more pestle and putting in a fucking thing and like rubbing it ointment on

956
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,740

959
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,560
happening besides

960
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:34,860
she says trampoline. She just ask you questions. Where were you from?

961
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,860
Oh, you can't speak right now. I

962
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
- We'll get you up and out of here soon.

963
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,320
- That's what your doctor said.

964
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,660
- Get over here, don't crawl in the bed with me.

965
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,640
- Oh, that's funny.

966
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,600
You're, oh you, she's like just laughing.

967
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,840
- What's funny?

968
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,640
Bitch, I will fucking kill you.

969
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,880
(laughing)

970
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,440
I will fucking kill you.

971
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,040
- He's going under a lot of stress.

972
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,960
- Suck my dick or you'll die.

973
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,000
(laughing)

974
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,300
- It's like Michael Scott.

975
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,880
- Um, here, wait, hold on.

976
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,280
I would like to cast ray of sickness on this woman.

977
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,760
So that would require you to be able to like, there are like...

978
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,920
I'm creating, wait, never mind, I'm creating water in her pants.

979
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Whoa.

980
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Genius.

981
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,920
Next level.

982
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,920
Yeah.

983
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
It does...

984
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Next fucking level.

985
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,600
It does require some, so it's not just, it also requires somatic.

986
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,480
So you do, I usually don't, what I usually do is say, don't worry about material components

987
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,120
because that's very frustrating. But somatic means you do have to like sort of

988
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:50,120
move your hands a little bit. If you can try to move your like finger. I try,

989
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:56,380
okay, I try to roll a... My spells are broken also. But just constitution really to see

990
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:01,840
if you can get through the pain of moving your burned flesh around. Okay.

991
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Is his penis burnt too?

992
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,840
A little bit.

993
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
[Groaning]

994
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,840
I'm like having to

995
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,840
answer that question.

996
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,840
Nothing is working on my app today.

997
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Just roll a d20 and just add your con.

998
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
Add your head is what?

999

1024
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,160
Yeah, I mean, it's at the bottom. Listen, obviously you two have never been in the

1025
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,700
hospital, but it's basically the craziest sex party in the world. So, yeah. Oh, that's

1026
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,000
a sex glob? Yeah, it could be. And it's green. Probably a girl's sex glob though,

1027
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:03,480
and not my own. Nope. I love making sex globs with girls. Oh my god.

1028
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,560
exchanging sex clubs with each other. Check this out. I give him a piece of the hair for my teeth.

1029
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:13,800
It's so, you guys are like standing in front of the queen and just like having this

1030
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,760
talk and then she says, so you have a cough.

1031
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,720
Covid has come to Tribute Village.

1032
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,880
That's the big reveal.

1033
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,720
Holy crap, that's what the rune said.

1034
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,720
Oh my god, they weren't runes, they were Chinese characters!

1035
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,720
[Laughter]

1036
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,720
She says, um,

1037
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,720
"I don't know what the meaning of the rune is just yet, but

1038
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,720
I suggest you either go see Albert the Witch,

1039
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,720
or you continue the sail on your way and try to seek out

1040
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720
What was the last thing your mother said?

1041
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,720
Glyphon... Glyphon?

1042
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,720
No, the rune said "Glyfberg".

1043
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,720
But you said it was a power word though, right?

1044
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,720
She said "stick"... wait, I'm not saying it.

1045
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Well, if you don't have the rune on you, there shouldn't be any issue.

1046
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,720
How did she know she had the rune? It's better safe than sorry, right?

1047
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
Yeah, I think you should say it.

1048
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Yeah, why don't you just say it.

1049
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,720
I don't know it. Could you write it down?

1050
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,720
Okay, so it was...

1051
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
Use your coloring pad.

1052
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:29,520
She said y-o-u-r-f-a-t-h-e-r-a-n-d-s-t-i-c-k-y-f-i-n-g-e-r-s.

1053
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,620
He dies. He drops dead.

1054
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,120
No, no, no, he doesn't.

1055
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,520
Your father and...

1056
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,220
Sticky Fingers.

1057
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:41,220
You have to have the rune on you.

1058
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,720
Why do you guys think anyone just...

1059
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,220
You guys said Sticky Fingers a lot in the last campaign.

1060
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,120
You guys think just people...

1061
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,720
Well, we don't know. The thing is we don't know...

1062
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,080
I assume that the mom didn't know she had a rune on her or else she wouldn't have said it.

1063
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,080
Oh yeah, you guys were, you all have a rune on you, then you're saying.

1064
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,580
Okay, I get it.

1065
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,040
Yeah, well you have no idea, we have no idea.

1066
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,460
Why would we know if we had one?

1067
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,120
Whoever put it on would not tell us.

1068
00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,920
Alright, we need to test-

1069
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,560
If somebody says something and then dies, I wouldn't say that thing.

1070
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,760
Alright guys, we need to test to see if we have the rune so everybody needs to say it.

1071
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,260
Okay.

1072
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:08,760
One.

1073
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,880
Stinky fingers.

1074
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,380
You say stinky-

1075
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,280
Stimpy dinger.

1076
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:11,780
What?

1077
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,640
Did I say- no, we all checked, we don't have the rune.

1078
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,600
Simple thinker.

1079
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,960
Sticky binger.

1080
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,840
St-

1081
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,120
- Dippid lingers. - Sticky winger.

1082
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,840
- Sipping liquor. - I think we're probably better off not--

1083
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,340
- Prickly pringer. - Risking this.

1084
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,340
- Risking... - Pricky ringer.

1085
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,340
I'm a risky ringer, okay?

1086
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,640
- So I do stuff like that. - Chrissy Teagern.

1087
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,640
Yeah, you prissy queener.

1088
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,340
- So she had said your father-- - You're a bitchy wiener.

1089
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,840
Before she hadn't said...

1090
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,140
- Yeah. - Sticky fingers.

1091
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,840
Well...

1092
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,920
Does that mean that Sticky Fingers put a rune on my mom?

1093
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,200
I don't know what it means. I will say that I remember Sticky Fingers. He was a

1094
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
part of your father's crew before he was the famous Sticky Fingers.

1095
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:01,080
Yeah. I don't think he was part of this this

1096
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:05,480
group. There were there was like 60 tricksters.

1097
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:11,400
Or 50 tricksters.

1098
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,640
(laughing)

1099
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,960
- Am I missing this?

1100
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,880
What am I missing here?

1101
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,200
- Or 60 fifters.

1102
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,060
(laughing)

1103
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,300
- But there was, but he has 60 fingers, right?

1104
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,000
- Yeah, yeah, it was, his name was,

1105
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,440
he was in a group of 60 trickters.

1106
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,960
- I don't feel like I gave you guys a word game this time,

1107
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,920
but you still found one, I feel like.

1108
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,680
- That's all we do.

1109
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,160
- I'm gonna pick up a lollipop and say,

1110
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,720
should I lick these fingers?

1111
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,640
- Yeah, there he is.

1112
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:47,840
a lily pipper yeah they were called the 60 tricksters and they all ate chicky

1113
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:59,480
tinders what was and it was a co-ed group they were mixing genders what was

1114
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:08,800
trudge bowls crews name wasn't it the did we ever decide that no sticky fingers

1115
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,480
was part of like the Brave Lions. It was the 60 tricksters who had

1116
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,520
chicky tenders. This could be what it's called. The 60 tricksters was

1117
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:23,160
with 60 fingers doing their tricksters. They ate chicky tenders and they were mixing

1118
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:31,920
genders on the boat named... El Capitan. El Captain Royale. Bryan Singers.

1119
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:40,000
they can't do that the boat was called the SS Brian so the boat was the boat was

1120
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,160
you guys did call the boat um with stinky swingers the Caribbean Royale or

1121
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,480
the Royal Caribbean is the boat that he had all the El Capitan yeah and the

1122
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,160
Stinky Fingers was just a part of a thieving guild he wasn't like a line

1123
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,880
with the Brave Lions. He was a scaredy cat insofar as he was a gnome, but he wasn't like

1124
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,960
a lion with the Brave Lions. He was just a member of the Thieves Guild, or like the leader

1125
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,600
of the Thieves Guild by the time you guys were in Trebuchet Village. Since Trebuchet Village

1126
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:19,800
has undergone a bunch of stuff, you guys knew that Sticky Fingers got more recognition from

1127
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,080
the king, was promoted to some undisclosed position. And that's all you really know about.

1128
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,920
Like, you guys probably haven't kept up with him since then. It's only been six months,

1129
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:35,800
too since that happened. So that's about what you know about him. But he was part of the

1130
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,000
60... let's get it down.

1131
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
60 tricksters.

1132
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,360
60 tricksters eating chicky tinders.

1133
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,000
With their 50 fingers.

1134
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And they're mixing genders.

1135
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,960
60 tricksters.

1136
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,960
120 fingers.

1137
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,000
60 tricksters eating chicky...

1138
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Tinders.

1139
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,520
And they're mixing genders.

1140
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:00,520
And they're...

1141
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:01,520
And they're...

1142
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,520
Yeah, of course.

1143
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,520
And they're mixing genders.

1144
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,520
And I like...

1145
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,520
With their 120 fingers.

1146
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,320
Queen, I like your prickly stinger.

1147
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,040
With their 120...

1148
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,040
Thank you.

1149
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,360
With their 120 fingers.

1150
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,240
I think it might make a nifty dinner.

1151
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,240
And then I bite it.

1152
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,240
Ew, who's...

1153
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,040
Wait, so who's been ripping stinkers?

1154
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,320
Do they only have two fingers each or is it...

1155
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,960
- No, every single one of them has 50 fingers.

1156
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,440
- Who's been ripping sneakers, that's the big ass singer.

1157
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,280
- Big ass?

1158
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,440
- Big ass.

1159
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,480
- Biggest singer.

1160
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,560
- Biggest, bigly singer.

1161
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,800
- Bigly singer.

1162
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,480
The big league singer.

1163
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,240
- The singing singer.

1164
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,240
- Yeah.

1165
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,080
- Yep.

1166
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,200
- So we basically did our thing.

1167
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,000
- The S-T-E-C-T-A-T-M-G-W-T-1-20-F.

1168
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,840
(laughing)

1169
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,680
Of course.

1170
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,680
[laughter]

1171
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,680
That's some kind of acronym?

1172
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,680
Yeah, it means the 60 tricksters eating chicky tenders and they're mixing genders with their 120 fingers.

1173
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
[laughter]

1174
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,680
Okay.

1175
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:13,680
They were your father's adventuring party, yes, and well, I don't know why sticky fingers, if he had done that,

1176
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,680
but I don't know why that would be a power word unless someone's either after sticky fingers or he did that. I don't know.

1177
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,680
Well that's that's why we got to go see Albert.

1178
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,160
She could potentially help.

1179
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,280
Yeah I guess we gotta go do that.

1180
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,880
Yeah let's do that.

1181
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,920
She lives in a cove.

1182
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,920
Do you mean a cave?

1183
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,120
No.

1184
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,520
I wouldn't go if it's a cave but if it's a cove I'll go.

1185
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,240
Yeah it's a cove.

1186
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,400
Are you sure you don't mean a cave? What's a cove?

1187
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:36,960
It's like a cave.

1188
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,920
I think it's called a cave.

1189
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,640
It's a cave with an o.

1190
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,960
Are you talking about love like I love you?

1191
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,600
I cove you.

1192
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,120
I cove it you're wife.

1193
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,620
Cove it?

1194
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,660
Cove it.

1195
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,560
My god, it really is happening. Oh god. We sail to Wuhan

1196
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,560
We get it there

1197
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:01,480
He's done

1198
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,480
Tell the wrong one.

1199
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,480
Uh...

1200
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:03,980
Fuck yeah.

1201
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:21,980
