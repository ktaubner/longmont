1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
Or keep it, I don't- Everybody! It's time!

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,000
The Spy vs. Spy finales continue!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What you've been a long been a- long been a-

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What you've been a long been a- waiting for.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But now...

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Uh oh, we have a surprise guest.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Even though he lost twice.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's back, but now he's on the coolest team of them all, which is the Dungeon Masters team.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Somehow you're gonna make me fuck it, you're gonna rig this shit against me as an NPC.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't. I never- I've never rigged anything before.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's bull, that's a lie. Piece of crap.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Alright, that's not nice. So, last time we had White Spy and Soy Spy fought, or Gray Spy.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What did we decide you were Cam, Soy Spy?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was just myself.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He was Cameron.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He was Cameron?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, when I was versing Soy Spy I thought.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,440
Okay yeah so Cameron versus Soy Spy. So Cameron beat Soy Spy. Soy Spy put up a good fight

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,960
but then his sagging weight because he turned into Steven Seagal. I'm still

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,040
Steven Seagal. You're still Steven so now it's Cameron versus Steven Seagal. Well I

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,000
was Billy Eilish. And Billy Eilish versus Steven Seagal. Did you have sagging weight as well? No I had a

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,300
second sure yeah and so now the first round was at the bank and Steven Seagal

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,520
tried to use some some commando tactics he was doing very cool stuff jumping in

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,400
at a windows threatening to kill bankers but then Billie Eilish got the best of

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,320
him using her guile so now we're moving on to the next location that's right

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,160
Alright, it's a party.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,680
And what a party it is.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,020
So, it's a big house party.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,640
We got Cameron, you're up there by the bonfire

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,900
in the backyard.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,920
- Is this supposed to be on my screen right now?

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,480
- Yeah, it should be, is it not?

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
Does it do anything?

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,140
- No, I don't see it.

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,980
I only see Billy Eilish.

36
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,820
- It does.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,640
(laughing)

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
- I see a picture of Billy Eilish.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,880
- Alright, hold on.

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,120
It's gonna slowly...

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,940
- Oh, here we go.

42
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,780
I see it now.

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
- I still don't see it.

44
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,660
The way it does it now is you have a,

45
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,580
you used to be in, you had a players tag.

46
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm saving Juvio for last.

47
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,480
You used to have a players tag,

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,540
and then that would just move all the players over.

49
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,620
But Roll20 did something cool, which is good,

50
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,660
which is where they split it up

51
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,220
so you could have some players on some maps,

52
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,780
other players on other maps.

53
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,140
But now I forget that,

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,500
and so then I have to move each of the players

55
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,620
individually over.

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,960
- I'm liking the bottom of this map.

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,500
- Yeah, so something happened down there with Steven Seagal.

58
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,980
We can definitely get into that.

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,980
But yeah, and then, well, I'll get rid of Black Spy here.

60
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,180
Black Spy, you're not here.

61
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,020
Caleb, you're gonna be some of the NPCs that I have here.

62
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,020
So right now it is still Soi Spy

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,360
or Steven Seagal versus Cameron.

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,360
So Cameron and Pat, both of you guys roll 3D20s,

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,620
and let's see what items you get.

66
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,460
- Okay.

67
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,540
Can you, can you announce them so I can just message them to you quickly?

68
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,100
I got 15, 6, and 17.

69
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,060
I got 2, 1, 12.

70
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,460
Wow, I got, if you combine 2 and 1.

71
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,500
15, 6, 17, 2, 1, 12.

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Okay.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900
Cameron, I'm sending you yours.

74
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,900
Now Caleb, fill time.

75
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,500
Yeah, you gotta fill time while I do this.

76
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
God damn it, god damn girl.

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
God damn it, girl.

78
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
Holy shit.

79
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
I need you, girl.

80
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
You're three lovely girls in front of me.

81
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,500
And I need to see your, where you pee.

82

83
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Yes, 17.

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
17, thank you.

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Sorry, keep going Caleb.

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Need to see where you pee, right in front of me.

87
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Pee on the front of me.

88
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500

Uh, yeah I could sing.

Something happened.

121
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
And there's a toilet outside.

122
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Yeah.

123
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140

Wait, am I, I'm out right now?

I am.

135
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
I'm deafening myself.

136
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
That's smart.

137
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
Sorry.

138
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm going to investigate over here.

139
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm gonna go move right here.

140
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,140
- Where's right here?

141
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:14,980
Okay.

142
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,700
- This area where the woman is.

143
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,340
So I'm gonna move over there.

144
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,180
- Okay.

145
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,240
- Wait, I can't move my token.

146
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,420
- I'll fix that if that's how.

147
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,540
- Okay, yeah.

148
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,380
- I feel like that happens every day.

149
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,800
- Do I use this one?

150
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,900
- You should be able to move it.

151
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,740
- Okay.

152
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,580
I'll re-replace it.

153
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,900
- Well, I move over there.

154
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,540
- Try this one.

155
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,380
- Okay.

156
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,500
Nope.

157
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,340
- Really?

158
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,160
I'll move you.

159
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,000
- Yeah.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,300
Okay, and then I look at the toilet and I go,

161
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,600
my God, what have they done to my toilet?

162
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,340
- Nice.

163
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,180
- Whoever did this is gonna feel a world of pain.

164
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,700
- Yeah, are you investigating the toilet?

165
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,740
- Yeah, I'm gonna investigate,

166
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,340
but it's more of a general investigation.

167
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,180
- Okay.

168
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,940
Of just the surroundings,

169
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,780
trying to figure out what happened?

170
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,100
- Yeah, for sure. - For sure.

171
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,500
- Okay.

172
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
For sure, roll investigation.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,700
17, nice. - 17.

174
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,020
- Yeah, you definitely drove your car into the party

175
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,120
and definitely killed this woman who's lying next to you.

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,980
- Oh, my toilet flew out the passenger's side.

177
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,820
- And that is your toilet who was on the passenger's side.

178
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Get the woman in the head!

179
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
You figured it out very quickly.

180
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Oh!

181
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Alright! Well, time to kill this spy then.

182
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Or Cameron.

183
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Cool.

184
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
So yeah, um,

185
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
that's, I mean, there's other things you can do.

186
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
You can use your items if you want to, or whatever.

187
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Um, well the items that I have

188
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
are...

189
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Or, is it a talking toilet?

190
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Oh my god, I'm gonna say

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
"Hello, toilet!"

192
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
What does the toilet say, Caleb?

193
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
*fart*

194
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Yes, I know!

195
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
I shouldn't have...

196
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
I shouldn't have drove the car tonight!

197
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
*fart*

198
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

199
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
*laughter*

200
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,820
I should have never brought you on this mission!

201
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
*fart*

202
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
*laughter*

203
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Toilet's nodding in agreement.

204
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
But there's a score to settle!

205
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,620
This man killed your father.

206
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right, Cameron Fetter left the dookie so big in the toilet it choked.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,120
The toilet choked to death.

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,260
And so maybe you have a toilet ally now who can also take a turn.

209
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:00,480
I need you to go in there, because, well, for D&D reasons, I can't move anymore, but also

210
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm Steven Seagal and I'm winded.

211
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,660
And 30 feet was- I ran for 30 feet and that winded me.

212
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,620
So I'm gonna need you to go in the house and investigate and see where Cameron is.

213
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,660
I'm gonna help you- reset for a second.

214
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Steven Seagal, you sound more like this, man.

215
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,860
I do sound more like that.

216
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,580
Yeah, I got you, I got you.

217
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,260
I'm excited in the moment.

218
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:36,700
of

219
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
We not gonna tell Cameron.

220
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
It's gonna be our secret.

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Let me see if I can first find a toilet icon.

222
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I have to find a toilet asset.

223
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
I'm sure it's out there.

224
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
I think he's gonna notice.

225
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Oh, he won't notice.

226
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,700
How smooth are you with adding these assets in, man?

227
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
I'm not, I'm not actually.

228
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
It's not gonna be...

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,700
Oh, maybe I am really smooth.

230
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Look at that. He's not gonna see that.

231
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,100
That's so diff, that's basically.

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,980
Alright, where do you wanna go?

233
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,800
Where do you wanna go?

234
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,000
You could just be at toilets.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,840
You can block his path.

236
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
- I wanna go to the bathroom, man.

237
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
- Okay, cool.

238
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,080
Let's get you, start getting you over there.

239
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,080
So the bathroom is off the kitchen, it looks like.

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,920
I think that's the bathroom.

241
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,560
- No, the bathroom is right here.

242
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,000
It's got a toilet in it already.

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Here, let me ping.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
- Oh, I see it, I see it, I see it.

245
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,660
We'll get you moving over there.

246
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Well unless, do you want to jump through the window?

247
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
Yeah.

248
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
Okay.

249
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:45,300
Yeah, you jump through the window and crash in there and you just see two people there

250
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,940
and one of them screams like AHHHHH like in fright.

251
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,700
The other one is a little too drunk to really like take that in.

252
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,140
He just sort of like backs up and knocks into this case over here.

253
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,220
But otherwise there's been no alarm.

254
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Otherwise.

255
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:07,340
Patrick, try to get him to take a shit. Okay. You can use your dash action to do that.

256
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:12,300
Okay, I'm gonna dash and I'm gonna jump into the window. I get on all

257
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,620
fours just like the last game. I pounce into the window and I try to land my

258
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:24,980
butt on the toilet. Roll athletics or acrobatics.

259
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:35,500
Nat 20. That's pretty good. Yeah you gotta make a saving throw man. He's a big guy.

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,700
Yeah roll a strength saving throw. I think it's a good call. Do it whisper rule.

261
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:51,020
So do I do that again? It's a slash I think it's slash WGM. I mean you'll

262
00:12:51,020 --> 00:13:13,020
the

263
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,380
perfectly. It worked? It did, you just didn't roll. But you did just put this, just put the,

264
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,540
you did everything right except you have to just make, you have to put the R,

265
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,900
you have to concatenate everything, just put everything together.

266
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:36,060
Instead of like separating it. Like I think, did you put the slash after the R? Yeah. Don't,

267
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,420
don't put the slash after the R also. Just, just, just get rid of that and just do it Rd20. I think

268
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:54,380
the

269
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:04,340
roll for me man. It's just a d20. Yeah I will. Okay you got a 19. So you are able to hold

270
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:10,060
up his body. Amazing. As he sort of like, you like, Steven Seagal, you crash in and

271
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,500
sort of like, it's like your model resets so that you just land on the toilet perfectly

272
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:22,820
and the toilet's able to hold you. Sorry y'all. I uh, I needed to shit. Yeah roll deception

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,100
with advantage because you look so much like that's true.

274
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,460
19.

275
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,700
You look like a shitter, man.

276
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,180
Yeah, okay.

277
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
Nice, yeah.

278
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,100
Yeah, the woman there just sort of is like freaked out a little bit and just sort of

279
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,820
like nods and like walks away like, "Okay."

280
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
Do you love me?

281
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,940
She's out of your shot.

282
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Thankfully for you.

283
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,620
I think it's gonna get arrested again.

284
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,580
Okay, cool.

285
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
That's your turn.

286
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,020
Take off your headphones, Patrick.

287
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Or Deffin.

288
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
What if I just Deffin, yeah.

289
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
Oh yeah, Deffin, just Deffin, right.

290
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
So much better.

291
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,260
And then I'll do this.

292
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,500
This is the universal sign of let's go.

293
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Yo.

294
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Alright, what's up?

295
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,100
Yeah, so you're chilling in the back right now with Dylan and his wizard friend Marivelle.

296
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,100
Marivelle?

297
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,580
Yeah, that's his name.

298
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,500
Yeah, you guys are chilling at the bonfire right now.

299
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Cool.

300
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,220
Dylan's wearing his shirt. He's gesturing to it. What's up Dylan? How you doing?

301
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:29,620
Not good. How's life?

302
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,780
See you got your shirt

303
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,140
Best in the house. Oh

304
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah, best in the house, buddy

305
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,260
All right. Well, I'm gonna I actually had to talk to Maribel for a second

306
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,900
Hey, man, he's his own man. You can talk to him anytime you want

307
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:54,500
Yeah, all right nice nice chat Dylan

308
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,780
Maraville's trying to cast a spell

309
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,020
Okay

310
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,540
All right, I actually need to need it to go do something inside I think guys just

311
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,420
That I need to look for

312
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,360
There's a celebrity here, and I need to find them

313
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,500
Yeah, I mean you could roll deception, but it won't really matter if they believe you

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,780
I'm gonna try I guess I'm gonna try to spread a rumor that there's a celebrity at the party. Okay, then go for it. Yeah

315
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:30,280
Who should be there? Wait, where's my character? She'd go this new interface is always yeah, I know

316
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,620
They should have started again. What the fuck? What is a compendium?

317
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,560
Don't worry about it. Where's my character? It's the third

318
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:47,880
Tab now. Oh here. It is. Yeah, it's in journal. Oh cool. Yeah, it's in kernel. Oh, they have art library now, too

319
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,100
Yeah, don't pay attention to that

320
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Okay, here's deception. I'm gonna spread a rumor that

321
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,180
Steven Seagal is there potentially no

322
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,620
I'm gonna say that Olivia Rodrigo is at the oh my god. I got dude. I miss

323
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,420
Specifically okay, it's not that believable

324
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
Unbelievable.

325
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:16,180
11 is... but Marivelle doesn't know who that is.

326
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,420
Dylan is just kind of stoked in sort of the way he doesn't take anything really in.

327
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,180
And he's kind of like, please.

328
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,220
So you might have something going.

329
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,660
It's not going to spread like wildfire just yet, but maybe say it a few more times to

330
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
the right people.

331
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

332
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
It's planting the seeds.

333
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah, for sure.

335
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Okay.

336
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,700
I guess I'm just going to walk inside at this point.

337
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Let's see.

338
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,740
I see where the door is.

339
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,980
You can move your guy over there.

340
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm just going to go in here.

341
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
You can control your guy.

342
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Okay, good.

343
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,460
I just couldn't last time because Billy Eilish was custom.

344
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Yeah, no.

345
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,740
Pat's just been having trouble controlling his guy.

346
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,860
You still have a dash action.

347
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:03,460
You can also use one of your items.

348
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,100
For my teleporting umbrella, do I have to already have marked the location?

349
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Uh, yeah.

350
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Okay, before I leave, actually, can I write on this?

351
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Before I leave, I want to mark Dylan's back.

352
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
For sure.

353
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
For sure.

354
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
So I can teleport back to him later.

355
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Yeah, you like tap him on the back, like, "See you later, pal."

356
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Yeah.

357
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah, love it.

358
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
And then I will go inside.

359
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Cool.

360
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Awesome.

361
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And then I don't have any action left after that, right?

362
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Uh, no, yeah.

363
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
That's like your first use of the bell.

364
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Perfect.

365
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay, cool.

366
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Alright.

367
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Yo.

368
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Yo.

369
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:43,380
Yeah, I mean, nothing's really happened so far.

370
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
It's been about six seconds.

371
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,380
You've just been sitting on the toilet.

372
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Okay.

373
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,380
Ah!

374
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,660
Ah, Jesus!

375
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,660
You what?

376
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
They're believing me.

377
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,140
They're believing that I'm actually crapping.

378
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,540
You're trying to sell it right now?

379
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,540
Yeah.

380
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Okay, let me roll this out.

381
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
Okay, enough.

382
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:16,540
the

383
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,140
that sound is. Oh, it's just me yelling. Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. Alright, then

384
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,460
I'm gonna get up and I'm not gonna wipe, but I'm gonna tell them that it's 'cause I... that

385
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,460
I had a perfect ghost poop. Why? I mean, they're not gonna hear you wipe. Well, they... Are

386
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,700
you telling people why you didn't wipe? Nobody heard you not wipe. There's a woman in the

387
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,100
the kitchen looking right at me. I'm trying to convince her that-

388
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,940
She thinks she can tell that you didn't wipe? She's looking right at me! I'm on a table

389
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,300
on top of a toilet! Oh, I thought you were in the bathroom.

390
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:01,300
No! I'm on top of your face! Oh man. This is awesome. I actually like this

391
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,580
shit. Okay, then I- do I roll deception again?

392
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,260
Of- for what? To convince them that I don't need to wipe?

393
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
Yeah, go for it.

394
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,700
Okay, I just want to let y'all know that.

395
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
It's like this. I had, I looked down.

396
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Spalter the people out front.

397
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Like, basically out of your,

398
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
out of vision, they hear you yelling.

399
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
Okay, I don't need to wipe.

400
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
I don't need to wipe.

401
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
It was a perfect marble style poop.

402
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
And,

403
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,300
it's okay.

404
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
It's okay sometimes that you don't need to wipe.

405
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
*laughter*

406
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Yeah, you see one of them look over and go, "Yeah, I guess it's okay."

407
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
I just changed somebody's life.

408
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Yeah, somebody's like, "Yeah, I didn't think about that."

409
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Like, it's sort of a construct, you know.

410
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,300
Alright, so then I get off the toilet, and then I'm gonna...

411
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,300
So yeah, you're right now in sort of like the living room.

412
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Can I go upstairs? Do I have enough feet of movement to do that?

413
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
If you dash, yeah, you can.

414
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,860
Okay, I'm gonna dash, before I dash,

415
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm gonna look at everyone and say,

416
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,580
oh, somebody's asking me to have sex with them upstairs.

417
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,820
I gotta go.

418
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,020
19!

419
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,060
(laughing)

420
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,960
- That shit worked.

421
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,600
- Cool.

422
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,260
- Yeah, people are like, oh damn, Steven's a pro.

423
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,500
(laughing)

424
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,580
- Yeah, and so I'll move you over here.

425
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,180
So as you're moving towards upstairs, you see this guy sort of walk by you and this woman

426
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,180
walk by you and you see them like...

427
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
By you!

428
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
(Laughter)

429
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Oh, you're bringing me back!

430
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,580
(Laughter)

431
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,860
You see them kind of brushing themselves off and sort of patting their clothes down.

432
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,060
Excuse me, do you have condoms?

433
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,860
Somebody upstairs asked me to have sex with them.

434
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,260
You see the guy go, uh, no...

435
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Oh, 24!

436
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,420
You're having amazing rolls, man.

437
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I know!

438
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,460
Guy's like, "Um, no I don't have any condoms."

439
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,180
Ah, that was a test!

440
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,220
I know that you hit that shit raw!

441
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Ha ha!

442
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,220
Shh!

443
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Hey man, shh.

444
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,140
And this guy got herpes too!

445
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,140
You rolled deception!

446
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
12.

447
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,500
Yeah, you've been so truthful.

448
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,980
She's gonna be like, "Do you have herpes?"

449
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Like no, I don't, this is just Steven Seagal.

450
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,900
- Ha ha, okay, I'm gonna go upstairs now.

451
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,220
- Okay, cool, your next turn you'll be able

452
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,700
to use the rest of your movement.

453
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,660
Okay, Toilet, what do you wanna do?

454
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,340
- I'm trying to just make it to the bathroom, man.

455
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,660
I wanna go home.

456
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
- Yeah, all right.

457
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,140
- But I also think that that would be a good place

458
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,460
to set up maybe a thing where I could chomp Cameron's butt.

459
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,860
- Mm-hmm, yeah, you could use all your movement

460
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,520
to get almost there.

461
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:07,620
get right outside the door. Yeah, the toilet is 30 feet of movement. Alright, I'll do that.

462
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,380
Toilet's so fast. I'm gonna sit right out front of the door. Yeah, you see people like just

463
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,060
sort of watching that and they're like, is that a costume? Or... I'm trying to like figure

464
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,460
out why there's a toilet moving. Steven, you gotta cover for me, man. Say I'm a new model.

465
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:27,460
Say I'm a smart toilet. That's my cousin. That's not helpful.

466
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,460
23.

467
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:37,460
This guy's volunteering all this awesome information I believe.

468
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,140
23, cool.

469
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,700
Alright so you're gonna start heading upstairs.

470
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,740
Alright and that's the end of y'all's turns.

471
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,780
Or at least yours Stephen.

472
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,140
Alright, cool yeah.

473
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,940
You're just chillin' in there, making your way inside, you set up your umbrella teleporter,

474
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
what do you wanna do?

475
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
You set up an umbrella.

476
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,140
Can I ask, is there any, do I know anybody here?

477
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,140
Yeah!

478
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
Besides those guys?

479
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,540
Yeah, you know Matt who's been gaming in the room off over here.

480
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Okay.

481
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,540
There's Matt, there's a couple of dumb bitches in here you know.

482
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
What the hell?

483
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,620
What the hell I don't know any of those no beautiful Queens, okay, yep

484
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,080
Let him know Camry

485
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,980
You just know Matt it was gaming yeah, I guess I'm suffering from hella social anxiety

486
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,580
So maybe I'll just go sit and game with Matt who's my boy, and we basically game together all the time, okay cool

487
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
I see what he was playing earlier

488
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,020
This fortnight of course yo

489
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,300
Okay, I'm gonna go set some fortnight. We're gonna snag a victory royale

490
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,700
Okay, you can only make it to this Viking I have here

491
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,300
Okay, I walk up to the bar

492
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:12,580
Yeah, I'm like hey, who are you? Oh, I'm Cameron. I know Matt you seem awkward

493
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:17,500
Whoa this is a mean-ass Viking I slap him

494
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,060
Whoa we're talking talking to me like that all right roll intimidation

That is a 13 okay the Vikings a head whips back

497
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:41,460
You can talk to me like that one-on-one

498
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,140
We go outside you can say all you want against me, but you do it in front of people

499
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,140
I'm gonna slap the shit out of you.

500
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Damn.

501
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,580
And he gives out a hearty laugh.

502
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,180
I'm basically playing a character that's based on myself, that has some traits of myself,

503
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,260
but in some ways is wildly different.

504
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,100
Like, "Aha!

505
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Oh!

506
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,180
I respect that kind of thing!"

507
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:13,780
And he holds out his arm to give you like a Spartan handshake or whatever the fuck.

508
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,420
Can I take his drink from him?

509
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,020
Yeah, sure

510
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,160
Okay, you kind of pushing it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got like a respect for those horns. He's got one of those horns

511
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,740
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking Viking like to share their drinks drink from the horn. Yeah, I want to drink from the horn

512
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:33,580
The horn of Viking yeah, Danny Trejo Viking. I don't know. I can't find the accent

514
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,880

522
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,300

523
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,980
all by the way did you hear

524
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,420

526
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,060
and uh...

527
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,140
by uh...

528
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,580
uh... critical

529
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,180
just add another as they have to be other celebrities here to keep the light

530
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,860
going

531
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,780
yet or that's what i was going to say is good

532
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,660
yes she's outside i think she was talking to

533
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,460
said dylan and that other the wizard guy before so he would go out and ask them a

534
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,580
bit they'd start to believe because he was a uh... independent of me

535
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,080
way europe that was like that was kind of my brain engineer of the room genius

536
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,640
level i mean a brain level

537
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,840
brevard explains that

538
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,080
not everything

539
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,800
most ideas are pretty

540
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,000
no

541
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,960
and most ideas are brain level ideas

542
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,740
yet

543
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,840
swedish f_ is a year

544
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,100
he's saying i think you're mistaken

545
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,560
you're mistaken he's does not

546
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:12,020
think there's a celebrity here. Alright, no big deal. Let's see, I guess I'm just going

547
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,440
to keep making my way to the, I mean yeah, that's the end of my turn. As far as you can

548
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:24,840
go right now. However, you do see across the way, Stephen Seagal. Okay, I guess I'll shoot

549
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:32,200
him. You used your dash to get over here. Yeah, so I guess I can't do anything. So that's

550
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
that's that mattress man.

551
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Yut.

552
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,520
All right.

553
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:45,920
You see, as you're, you see Cameron, he's talking to a Viking.

554
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,200
I'm not upstairs?

555
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,440
Danny Trejo is a Viking, because I couldn't figure out how to do a Viking accent.

556
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,880
I remember the trailer for the Northmen, using that, but I don't remember how he said it.

557
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,080
So I'm not, I'm not upstairs yet.

558
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:08,480
my blood for my countrymen. Um, no you're not. You're about to be though if you want to.

559
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:16,880
Um, well no I was gonna go upstairs and then. Cameron sees you, you see Cameron. This is sort

560
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:27,440
of like a moment of like you can act, he can act. I am gonna drop a caltrop and then go into the garage.

561
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,720
Do you have caltrops? You don't have caltrops this round.

562
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,220
Yeah I do.

563
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,240
No, I think that was last round.

564
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,280
Wait, what do I have then?

565
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,840
Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna put...

566
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,960
All right, I'm gonna go into the garage and put tripwire down in front of the door.

567
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,800
Okay, nice.

568
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,040
I like that idea actually, it's pretty good.

569
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah, roll sleight of hand to see how sort of stealthy.

570
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,360
Eight.

571
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,920
Eight, okay.

572
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,560
It's not perfect, but if he goes dashing in there, you might be alright.

573
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,880
In there you see this guy, Mack, who's Matt's brother.

574
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Who's Matt?

575
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,720
Oh, you haven't met Matt yet.

576
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,880
Mack, who is building a race car here.

577
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,560
He's trying to build a race car.

578
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,360
He wants to win the big race today.

579
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,680
I look at him and say, "Does this car work?"

580
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Nah, man.

581
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Does the car run?

582
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Not yet.

583
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,320
Does the engine run?

584
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,660
Uh, well, the engine can work, but, uh...

585
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,520
So if I turn the key, if I turn the ignition on, will this car run?

586
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Well, hold on, man.

587
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,500
I don't know if I want you to be doing that.

588
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,980
I'm still building this thing.

589
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm not gonna drive away.

590
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
I have a ton of bread.

591
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,880
I don't even know if I want you to turn on the car.

592
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm gonna turn...

593
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
So what I want to do is I want to turn the car on and then shut the garage door.

594
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,160
And kill yourself, or?

595
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm gonna shut the garage door and then I'm gonna, I'm gonna shut the garage door, it's

596
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,500
gonna be really cool.

597
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:13,440
I'm gonna shoot the garage door opener with my crossbow and turn the car on so that smoke

598
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,560
fills up in the garage.

599
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,440
Okay yeah, roll a, okay roll an attack roll.

600
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,080
Okay that didn't work. Hold up.

601
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,560
That's your weapon proficiency.

602
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,080
Yeah. So I roll.

603
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,760
You attack. You'll see it. Oh you'll see it.

604
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,920
How do I... Oh there we go.

605
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,800
Wow it's a crit! You perfectly hit the garage door. It doesn't even slowly go down. It just

606
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,920
shuts completely.

607
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:53,460
And a bit of a tool, a wrench that was sitting in the way flings off in the air and knocks

608
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,540
Mac in the head and he falls unconscious.

609
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Dope.

610
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,540
Okay.

611
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Yeah.

612
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,540
All right.

613
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,620
So now I turn the, I run over to the car and I turn the ignition on.

614
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
Okay, cool.

615
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,620
Yeah.

616
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
You turn the ignition on, it's starting to run.

617
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,860
You got a trip wire in there.

618
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,020
You got a car that's partially made.

619
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,860
You came here in a car that was, and you destroyed it.

620
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
You're gonna destroy maybe this car too?

621
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,860
Um, nice. It's a good turn.

622
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,860
Let's go to the toilet.

623
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I'm back, baby.

624
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
Mm-hmm.

625
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Yeah, you head back in there.

626
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Let me just get...

627
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,860
Oh, fuck. Is there a way I can basically get rid of this old toilet?

628
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
Or, you know what I'll do?

629
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
I'm gonna... Can I make a little...

630
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Two little signs out of, like,

631
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
note cards or toilet paper,

632
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
and make one that says "women's"

633
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:46,860
one

634
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,300
And you wouldn't you know it, this is a girl toilet.

635
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
I knew it.

636
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,300
Wait.

637
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Wait, it's a girl toilet?

638
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Mhmm.

639
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
And it's...

640
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Alright, let me do my thing real quick.

641
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Ready?

642
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Okay, okay.

643
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Okay, I got you.

644
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,300
*fart*

645
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,300
*laughter*

646
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,300
*fart*

647
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
*laughter*

648
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,300
*fart*

649
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,300
*fart*

650
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,300
*fart*

651
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Okay, I'm gonna roll

652
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Persuasion

653
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,300
For you

654
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Thank you man

655
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,300
What'd I get?

656
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Okay, kill her!

657
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
*laughter*

658
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I kill her!

659
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Okay, roll an attack roll.

660
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
*laughter*

661
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Okay.

662
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
Nice, okay, yeah.

663
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
You just start beating up this girl, Toilet.

664
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
*laughter*

665
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Smash her to bits?

666
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Yeah, you try to slide in there and replace her.

667
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Alright, cool.

668
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,300
*laughter*

669
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
That worked out.

670
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:24,020
just

671
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:30,940
hello to me. Yeah he doesn't know. Alright. I think that he just invalidated the game,

672
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,100
he just cross pollinated, I think that he cheated by saying hello. You're supposed to

673
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,100
not hear each other man. Yeah, he ran away. He saw you and he ran. Alright. That's what

674
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:49,980
you know. Okay, and I'm kind of like, I didn't even realize he was at this party, and I'm

675
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:58,740
like damn that's my reaction yeah you also saw you also saw a toilet walk into

676
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:05,160
a bathroom toilet walk into a bathroom okay where's the bow is this the

677
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,840
bathroom right here yeah yeah okay a toilet there was it walking like with

678
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,420
legs or was it just walking it is right I'm sorry I realize it did happen in

679
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:30,420
of

680
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:45,180
was

681
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,500
about it yeah I did take a huge swig of that that Viking ale. My bladder's probably pretty

682
00:35:51,500 --> 00:36:06,500
full. I don't know I guess I guess I'm gonna go check the toilet. You can do that, you

683
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:11,300
can do whatever you want. You also got a mat you can play games with. I don't want you

684
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,060
to feel like you have to do that just because I gave you a new detail.

685
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:21,100
It is, okay, if I was at a party, I'm trying to figure out right now, if I was at a party,

686
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
me and I saw.

687
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,620
Everyone else seems kind of non-plussed by the toilet, by the way.

688
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:29,100
Right, but if I was at a party and I saw two things happen at the same time.

689
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:36,060
First I saw my sworn enemy who I've been trying to kill and who I have tools to kill, I saw

690
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,020
I saw him run away, but at the same time I saw a toilet walk in the other direction.

691
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,460
What would I do?

692
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,860
Which path would I choose?

693
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
It's a hard one, man.

694
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Really.

695
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,020
I'm really trying to play the character here.

696
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
I have no idea which.

697
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,540
It's amazing about roleplaying in Dungeons and Dragons.

698
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,940
It's just all those kinds of questions you never had to ask.

699
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,660
Okay, I'm going to roll a d20, and if I get above a 10, I'm going after the white

700
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
spot.

701
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
This is what you would do in real life.

702
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,980
you would see this happen in flip a coin.

703
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:12,340
I mean they're both equal importance.

704
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:22,020
Investigate yeah, trying to achieve my life's goal of murder or investigating something fundamental.

705
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,260
Something is wrong with reality.

706
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,740
Alright, above 10 is white spy.

707
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,140
Alright that's a 3, I'm going to the toilet.

708
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,220
Toilet time yeah, ok cool.

709
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,620
So yeah, walk yourself into the potty.

710
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,940
- Okay.

711
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,520
I'm gonna investigate the potty.

712
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,580
- Mm-hmm.

713
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,760
All right, cool. - Using my investigation.

714
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,100
- All right, yeah, roll investigation.

715
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,920
- That's a crit one.

716
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,680
(laughing)

717
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,420
- Nothing weird here.

718
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,100
- Oh, well.

719
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,920
- Looks like a toilet.

720
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,660
- Yeah, I guess I must have just been seeing things.

721
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,300
Well, you know, a party like this can be,

722
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,160
you know, it can be hard to get into the bathroom sometimes.

723
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
So while I'm here I might as well, you know, just take a leak.

724
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
Okay.

725
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,760
Alright, anything you want to do, Toilet?

726
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I CHOMP HIS DICK OFF!

727
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Okay, roll an attack roll.

728
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
With advantage.

729
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,760
I CHOMP HIS DICK OFF SO EASILY!

730
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
16, man!

731
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,760
16 is gonna hit.

732
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
Okay.

733
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Alright, roll 3d6.

734
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Oh my god.

735
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
My revenge, man!

736
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
Yes!

737
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
My revenge!

738
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
My revenge man, yes!

739
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
My revenge!

740
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
14 damage.

741
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Really? Yeah, what's your health?

742
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
13, bro.

743
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
[Laughter]

744
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm gonna tell Pat to put his head

745
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
[Laughter]

746
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Pat, come on.

747
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
He forgot where the button is.

748
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Okay.

749
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Dude, I did your job for you, man.

750
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,760
this is pretty good because you're just killing yourself in the garage

751
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,920
what

752
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,160
lately you killed him

753
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,800
charlie chapters did you call the park

754
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
are you guys working together

755
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,520
because he only i was a little bit and he hired me that i would have been a if

756
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,960
you have found a uh... that guy that could have been

757
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,720
and i would have been that he found a lot of talk to like four guys and i don't

758
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,680
know anybody bro i just i need to be the toilet

759
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,160
i think it is a little unfair steven seagal immediately started talking to a

760
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,500
toilet and i said what if the toilet talked back

761
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,840
is my thought

762
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,600
i've wrote i'm sorry i didn't but i i guess i i guess a viking or a wizard or

763
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,400
any of those people talk to you know i think it would be a bad

764
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,920
yeah immediately job okay i guess i'm just literally not played it because i'm

765
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,600
just a quick look at the

766
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,120
so i was fine

767
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,080
steven seagal at the meantime

768
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,060
uh... is to kill himself in this guy mac in the garage

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,840
'Cause he doesn't mute himself when he deafens, he wants everybody to be able to hear him.

824
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
I'll mute him.

825
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,760
He wants to enter everyone else's turn.

826
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I muted him.

827
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Attention.

828
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,320
He just wants the attention, man.

829
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,320
So yeah, where do you want to go, Toilet?

830
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,280
Do I know where Steven is?

831
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,120
No, I mean, he didn't tell you his plan.

832
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,000
You did see him run back towards the garage.

833
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,200
And you would have seen him put down the tripwire, too.

834
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,080
We're gonna head towards the garage.

835
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Me and Cameron.

836
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Okay.

837
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,460
Alright, there's a tripwire there, you know that.

838
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,120
And Stephen will have, we'll figure out a result in a second.

839
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,280
Oh, do you need me to send you my items by the way, to patch this in the video?

840
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
No, I did not.

841
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
You can just tell me what they are.

842
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Yeah, just tell him, yeah.

843
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,120
They're a portable hole, a teleporting umbrella, and a giant magnet.

844
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,240
What does a teleporting umbrella do?

845
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,080
It teleports you to where I previously marked, which was on Dylan's back.

846
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Oh, true.

847
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,480
Okay so, can a toilet jump?

848
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,480
You can roll athletics I think to jump.

849
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,980
Okay, because I'd like to jump over that trip line.

850
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,480
14. I don't have a character sheet so I'm just rolling.

851
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
That's fine, yeah. You shouldn't have any.

852
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Next time I'll make a character sheet.

853
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,800
Cool, alright, you jump over.

854
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,160
Yeah, and so now Pat is gonna undeafin him.

855
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,320
Because you're both in the same room at this point, and your turn's going on.

856
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,280
Oh, I need him, I just realized.

857
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Who?

858
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,280
For myself.

859
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,840
Um, yeah, you see a toilet come in with Cameron sitting on it.

860
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
Roll insight.

861
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,720
Well, do I roll with advantage?

862
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
No.

863
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,920
You know, probably disadvantage, you have Gat, you have fucking...

864
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
Well, I got a 23.

865
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
Well, you got a crit.

866
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,520
Cam is dead and he's on top of the toilet.

867
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,920
God damn it.

868
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
The jig is up, Cameron.

869
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Damn.

870
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Oh my god, wait a minute.

871
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
And then what I'm gonna do...

872
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Oh yeah, sorry, you also need to take...

873
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:58,320
No, I'm an idiot.

874
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Please tell me he's dead from the fumes.

875
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,920
He's only going to take 5 damage.

876
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,440
You'll take 1d6 damage every turn.

877
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,520
So you take 5 damage so far from the fumes.

878
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,560
I don't know why you started poisoning yourself.

879
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,920
Mack is dead at this point.

880
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,040
He's just unconscious and breathing in monoxide.

881
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,040
Well I see Cameron.

882
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,800
You're the second casualty today.

883
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,360
You're third actually.

884
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
Because you killed Cameron.

885
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,800
I didn't kill Cameron, I killed Mac.

886
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,640
So I see Cameron on the toilet and immediately I'm going to throw my exploding canary at

887
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
him.

888
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,360
Well you gotta roll for that.

889
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
What do we roll?

890
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Just d20s?

891
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,360
I dodge, I dodge man.

892
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,960
14.

893
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,360
You just roll a d20, he doesn't roll anything.

894
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,360
11.

895
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
14.

896
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,900
fourteen that is going to be the toilets a c

897
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,880
what's the other statement

898
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,780
ten

899
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,640
all right let's

900
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,340
and giving you a giving you any or so i was and that's a explosions are

901
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,240
incredibly damaging to toilets

902
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,480
you know they're not mad at what i would like to say to be

903
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,260
brooklyn has a lot of people have a lot of toilet has toilet has thirty h p

904
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,080
toilet is

905
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,280
toilet is not a bit of a tank

906
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
you do take eleven damage.

907
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,280
And then with my... can I do another action or is that it?

908
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
That's fine.

909
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,280
Wait, he didn't hit the tripwire?

910
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,280
Um, nah, that's it right now.

911
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
You can also run.

912
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
I jumped over it, bitch.

913
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
No, it's where it jumped over.

914
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Alright, then I'm gonna Aikido roll.

915
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
He knew about it, but he still had to roll to jump.

916
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

917
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:48,280
With my... using my Aikido ability, which Aikido you're supposed to use your opponent's...

918
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm going to use my weight against him.

919
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,320
I think that Steven Seagal could break a toilet because he had to roll a strength saving throw.

920
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,960
So I'm going to do an Aikido roll at him right now.

921
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,680
Like those videos, like those videos where they put the bowling balls.

922
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,800
No, you know the videos where they put the balls on the ramp and they go at the toilets?

923
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:36,600
on

924
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,720
would you double-cross me? No. I know I told you that Cameron Fetter killed you

925
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:51,600
killed your father with a giant poop that made him choke. He did tell him that.

926
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,280
Yeah but what I'm realizing is that Cameron's pee and poop is so delicious

927
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,900
that it's not because it's not that my dad was like being forced to do it my

928
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,880
dad wouldn't let him off the toilet and I'm sure Cameron if he were alive he'd

929
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,100
have some flashback to this sometime where he felt as if his ass was stuck to the toilet

930
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,100
yeah Cameron you wanna talk about that?

931
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,100
the toilet wouldn't let him go how that happened?

932
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,000
yeah that actually happened to me this morning it just happened

933
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,560
yeah I'm one day old I just got born

934
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,800
well it's a new how you gotta get a new toilet for the party bro

935
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,760

936
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,200

937
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,480

938
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,480
Sorry, I'm putting it all together. What he tried to flirt with a girl toilet. You got a one to kill her

939
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:44,880
You tried to flirt with your sister, I didn't know it was my sister

940
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,240
Gasps and this

941
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:57,260
Jalopy in this garage has been filling up the whole house making us all crazy. We need to leave together

942
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,080
I've always had your back

956
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
*silence*

957
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,160
I'm going to run up to him, well, right up to him.

958
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
And I am going to bite him.

959
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
Yeah, roll.

960
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160

That does hit.

963
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,160
So I have to roll a d6.

964
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,160
That's going to do 1d6 damage.

965
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
Okay.

966
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,160

00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
No, he does.

And he got 3 damage to you.

969
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,520
It is, well, unless he wants to move.

970
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:03,520

971
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,680

Well, I got two 18s.

Okay.

981
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,480

So roll for damage.

983
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:49,640
That's going to do half damage because he's a toilet, but still pretty good.

984
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,480
So that's five damage.

985
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480

Yeah, and you went over here.

When he shakes me off, can I fly off and land in the driver's seat of the car?

990
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Yes.

991

That's my gas and my hands on the steering wheel. Yes, and the garage door is closed by the way

Okay, I'm starting to understand how this is a car and not a submarine.

00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,680
So he just broke through the garage door.

Oh, you did

So what's my poison damage? Yeah, now there's no more.

1012
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,680
After this.

Wait, really?

1019

Wait, the toilet is awesome.

1020
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,680
Yeah, the toilet's pretty good.

1021
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,280
Alright, Caleb's starting to like the toilet now.

1022
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:59,880
This is the first time I ever won, I was a fucking NPC toilet.

1023
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
What the hell?

1024
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,360
And I wasn't even supposed to be playing, I was supposed to just be walking around.

1025
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:12,320
Alright, well, I will say that Pat basically won, so it is kind of a tie.

1042
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,240
- We're gonna roll for new items,

1043
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,080
but they're gonna be special items.

1044
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,900
- 11, six, nine.

1045
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,040
- Okay.

1046
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,140
- I got 15, 19, eight.

1047
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,280
- Okay.

1048
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,960
All right.

1049
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,980
yes

1050
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,320
to get my text that

1051
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,480
that is amazing

1052
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:36,480
when you think of it he has conspiring it's the toilet

1053
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,440
politics it to you to say you can see it

1054
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,100
to something interesting i saw

1055
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,620
nowadays

1056
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,400
that happened

1057
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,400
I'm giving you your items, Pat, and then I'll give you everyone else their items.

1058
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,400
[Humming]

1059
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Hi, hi, hi.

1060
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Guess the song.

1061
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,400
Travis officially has a nickname for Taylor and fans are losing it.

1062
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,400
So what do you guys think it is?

1063
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,400
Tee-Tay?

1064
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,400
Could be Tee-Tay.

1065
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,400
I think it could be T.

1066
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,400
Could be Baby Tim 15198.

1067
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Yeah.

1068
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Or it could just be something like Sweetie.

1069
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,400
Honey.

1070
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Baby.

1071
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,400
Yeah, Honey and Baby.

1072
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
I don't have enough items, but some of them will be special.

1073
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Or what if it's Mrs. Travis?

1074
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Oh shit.

1075
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,400
Mrs. Kelsey.

1076
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,400
But then she would have two girl names.

1077
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah.

1078
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,400
I never thought about how maybe that's why he's able to date Taylor Swift,

1079
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,120
Taylor Swift is because he has a girlish last name.

1080
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,400
Because she's so female.

1081
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Yeah.

1082
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:02,520
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

1083
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,520

1084
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,520

1090
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
It was worth a shot, man.

1091
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,520
But you have 30 HP and you have resistance against slashing and piercing damage.

1092
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,520
And I'm full of poop.

1093
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,520
And you're full of poop. And you have a poop shot.

1094
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:26,520
You have a poop shot that does 1d8 for ranged.

1095
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,520
And then you have a melee that does 1d6.

1096
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
I'm gonna keep it up. Buck with y'all.

1097
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,520
The toilet better be a problem in the octagon.

1098
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
Okay.

1099
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,520
Alright, you guys got your items.

1100
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:43,520
It's the octagon, but by the way it has only six sides.

1101
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
Yeah.

1102
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,520
All right, guys, roll your dice.

1103
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,520
I got an eight on this, dude.

1104
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,520
You got an eight?

1105
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,520
Okay.

1106
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,520
Yeah.

1107
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,520
18.

1108
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
20.

1109
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
Nice.

1110
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,520
All right, Cam, you're up first.

1111
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,520
Sorry, let me make you a little bit more equidistant.

1112
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,520
There you go.

1113
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,480
Don't call me gay for saying equidistant.

1114
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,480
Cam, go.

1115
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,480
Equidistant means equally distant.

1116
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,480
Let's see here.

1117
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,480
Thanks Cam.

1118
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,640
What's my weapons like?

1119
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:26,800
I guess I'm just gonna come out swinging and I'm just gonna shoot my short bow at the white

1120
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
spy.

1121
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
Nice.

1122
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,240
Do I do a saving throw?

1123
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,000
Have you guys noticed the toilet?

1124
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,200
I don't notice the toilet yet.

1125
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,960
I think it might be a part of the arena to demoralize us.

1126
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,200
(laughter)

1127
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,600
- Okay, hasn't learned a thang.

1128
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,240
- No, it just does nine damage to you.

1129
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,840
- Oh my god.

1130
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,680
- Do I have another action?

1131
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,500
- You know what I'm gonna do?

1132
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,700
- Or no?

1133
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,540
- No, I will say--

1134
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,920
- Just a move action?

1135
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,680
- Yeah, you have a move action, yes.

1136
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,560
I will say that I'll let you guys have,

1137
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,640
I'll let you guys have,

1138
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,400
just 'cause this is gonna be otherwise so brutal,

1139
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:09,440
I'll let you guys have one healing item you can use that does 2d4+2 healing.

1140
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Okay.

1141
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,440
I'm going for the throat, man.

1142
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,440
I'm gonna...

1143
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,440
Yeah, I can see that.

1144
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,440
Is this a rock?

1145
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,440
Or is it just a design on the ground?

1146
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,440
No, it's a rock.

1147
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
I'm hiding behind the rock.

1148
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
Nice, yeah, you get three quarters cover.

1149
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,440
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to use my spring shoes and I'm gonna jump all the way over

1150
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,440
to the rock.

1151
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:35,440
What do I roll for that?

1152
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,400
Yeah he got spring shoes this round.

1153
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
That far?

1154
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:43,780
You just have to roll athletics to see if you can make it over there.

1155
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:47,720
And then I am going to shoot my bow down upon him.

1156
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,160
You can get like here.

1157
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,960
Okay that is with disadvantage because you were very close to him.

1158
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,640
Why don't you just, you have like a knife.

1159
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Okay that does not hit.

1160
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:10,000
So you just spring over there and just like take out your crossbow and just like miss

1161
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
him wide.

1162
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,880
Okay, toilet.

1163
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
It scared me though.

1164
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,360
My character is scared.

1165
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:20,360
I'd like to go to this big guy in the bottom right corner and try to get him to shit in

1166
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,760
my mouth so he looks like he's taking a dump.

1167
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,560
He's like a big doughy kind of guy.

1168
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,960
I see him, wow I didn't even notice him before.

1169
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,360
I didn't even realize anyone else was here.

1170
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,960
I'd like to really eat his shit.

1171
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,000
Alright, roll persuasion and what do you say?

1172
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,040
I can't say anything.

1173
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,840
I feel like there's an implication if a toilet comes and sits behind you.

1174
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,920
12, good enough.

1175
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,520
He immediately starts to try to climb over the railing to shit in your mouth.

1176
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,480
He's gonna roll athletics to see if he can do it.

1177
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,640
you got a five he falls on his hands he's on the ground

1178
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,960

01:03:54,020 --> 01:04:01,020
homeless guy in the stall next to you saying "Damn you freaky bro" to the toilet.

1233
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:08,140
Yeah you dub Steven Seagal the toilet, upside down, his legs are kicking like Winnie the Pooh

1234
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:09,820
just flailing up there.

1235
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:15,320
Steven what are you going to do? I'm out now.

1236
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:22,320
I'm just going to swing my dagger around. Yeah you're out but you're in the toilet.

1237
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:29,320
He's upside down, just takes his dagger out, swinging it inside the toilet.

1238
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,400
He's got a 10 AC.

1239
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Roll an attack.

1240
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Okay, yeah.

1241
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,400
Four.

1242
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,960
Yeah, so that does hit the toilet, so roll for damage.

1243
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,960
Four.

1244
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,680
So he's just cutting you up on the inside.

1245
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,080
Wait, can I use an item now?

1246
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,800
He's slicing you up, but he only does two damage.

1247
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,800
No!

1248
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Can I retcon?

1249
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,520
I'm gonna use my explosive barrel.

1250
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,520
Yeah, you can wreck on.

1251
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,520
I'm gonna take the toilet out with me.

1252
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,520
*laughter*

1253
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,520
*laughter*

1254
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,520
Why?

1255
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,520
Dude, you don't- Cameron's gonna win, man.

1256
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,520
I just- and I don't need-

1257
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,520
Cameron is on top.

1258
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,520
So it'll be Cameron-

1259
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,520
I'm taking a sandwich right now.

1260
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,520
We're all going.

1261
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,520
It's a musical sandwich with a Cameron and toilet bun.

1262
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,520
Okay. Alright, cool.

1263
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,520
It's just gonna be a tie again.

1264
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,520
So roll 8d4.

1265
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,520
Oh there we go.

1266
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,520
Jesus Christ.

1267
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,520
Actually no, I have hella health.

1268
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,520
I'm gonna live.

1269
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
I'm at 28 health.

1270
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Oh wait.

1271
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Why do you always roll them separately?

1272
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,520
Wait, I'll redo it.

1273
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,520
What kind of strange world are you living in?

1274
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:38,520
20.

1275
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,680
Yeah, we'll make my life easier.

1276
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,800
So you and Cameron both die.

1277
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
The exploding barrel.

1278
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,160
the toilet is basically almost dead it's in like

1279
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,160
it's in this

1280
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,400
tired state

1281
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,480
he's an NPC guts and blood and shit is that a technical win?

1282
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,480
and these two fat guys are trying to climb over

1283
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,680
it's your fault man the toilet won two rounds in a row and it was clearly one person's fault

1284
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,080
just now it happened

1285
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,320
it was one person's fault both times man you killed yourself last time and this time

1286
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,900
one of them gets to be on top of the toilet

1287
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,760
one of them does manage to climb over finally so who is it if you know i want

1288
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,320
to give you my last i want to give you my last item i had a grappling hook i

1289
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,080
wanted you to grapple the fact that you

1290
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,280
elements we

1291
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,200
instead pat blue everyone up

1292
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,320
the into one then

1293
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:38,800
toilet the toilet one i i can't wait the whole point is

1294
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,780
i've heard it

1295
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,680
i've ruined it is the whole point of this was i was gonna be an n_p_c_

1296
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,340
but i'm so fucking amazing at this game

1297
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:51,280
yeah i just accidentally won both times as a toilet mind you i will say that

1298
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,620
probably cavern would have won if there was no toilet just based purely off the

1299
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,540
fact that

1300
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:01,720
steven seagal did just jump into the fray and get shot. no man the toilet

1301
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:05,960
the toilet won the first one and you were trying to be like oh it's a tie we

1302
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,500
can't really count that yeah and then you put it to sudden death the toilet won

1303
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,360
again that's a confirmation

1304
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,560
that's crazy to give it to anybody else i would really want to know how i first

1305
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,040
as well and the one that you said he has to figure it out alright

1306
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,840
that

1307
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,200
that's the

1308
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,420
and i was not a very suspicious by going for a couple months now

1309
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,400
the eight-week

1310
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,760
it's a constant confidence

1311
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,680
alright

1312
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,320
that's not what i thought

1313
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,640
not even me

1314
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,920
but we would

1315
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,960
This sucks!

1316
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,960
A toilet an NPC made an hour ago.

1317
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,260
Yeah.

1318
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,800
That can't speak!

1319
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,000
And only when a decent didn't even know where to set match.

1320
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,280
Good night!

1321
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,680
I think that is true.

1322
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,800
Thanks y'all.

1323
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,280
Bye bye.

1324
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:01,800
We need to go up to space, come back, become the Thoughtful Three.

1325
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,300
Yes.

1326
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,640
The Thoughtful- oh my god.

1327
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,600
The Thankful Three.

1328
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,600
The Thankful Three.

1329
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,520
What would your powers be in the thankful?

1330
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,800
Well, I'd be.

1331
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,320
OK, I mean I would be at a stretching ability.

1332
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,720
No man, you can't.

1333
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,360
You know whatever man stretching.

1334
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,240
What the hell do I be?

1335
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,200
Even new power?

1336
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,600
Yeah, OK, I would have acrobatic powers.

1337
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,000
OK, that's pretty good and I

1338
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,120
would be Mr. Thankful.

1339
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,120
Could I should be late?

1340
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,120
Have laser beams?

1341
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,880
We did it from where my hands,

1342
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,640
my fingers, 10 laser beams.

1343
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,080
Who and they come in a 10 fingers.

1344
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:33,600
That's too many.

1345
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,040
Mr. 10 fingers, Mr.

1346
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,440
ten fingers finger.

1347
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,240
The finger is good.

1348
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,940
Okay, I'll just shoot to from all.

1349
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:41,840
Okay, the finger.

1350
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,240
I'll just do you do this.

1351
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:44,940
Yeah, just yeah, you're the finger.

1352
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,740
Yeah, and I do this and it shoots it out of my ring finger

1353
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,240
or it's lightning bolts.

1354
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,740
Yeah, and it's the shocker that the shocker is a real guy.

1355
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:53,540
It's your right.

1356
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,440
So the finger would be real.

1357
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,040
I would have like the like like the human torch.

1358
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,640
I would have water powers and I would be the human drop

1359
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,640
And that would be the human drop.

1360
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,640
And I would turn into water.

1361
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
I'd be a water guy.

1362
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,640
I'd be the human drop.

1363
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
I'd be a water guy. I'd walk around.

1364
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,640
That's my whole power.

1365
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,640
Basically my power is that I give people cups of water.

1366
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
Who's a super villain in that world?

1367
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,640
Doctor Doom.

1368
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,640
Okay, so Doctor Doom comes up, right?

1369
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
Mr. Thankful, I'm acrobatic.

1370
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,640
So I do a bunch of backflips to distract him.

1371
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:38,640
him

1372
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,120
You get 'em wet, you finger 'em, and I amaze.

1373
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,120
