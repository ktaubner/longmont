Yeah let's hear this review.

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
So we got Doritos review right off the bat.

Doritos incognita.

61
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,480
So that means Doritos in disguise, right?

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Yeah.

63
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,840
Doritos disguised as another chip. I can't tell you what the flavor of these is

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,800
supposed to be. It's a secret. It's incognito. Yeah, but that chip is

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,120
completely brown. You did, you pulled one out. It's like a rust colored, it's like a

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,160
rust colored, like if you let blood dry on a white t-shirt kind of color. Yeah.

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:54,400
and it tastes like the best crunch I've ever heard we could probably sell that

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,400
crunch as a stock sound effect the first we can the first chip that you pulled

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,920
out of there I was impressed I mean it was very brown but it had one corner

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,920
that was black yeah so these are um are the blood chips this taste this tastes

71
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,920
like something. Do they taste like blood? Yeah. It tastes like, no, it tastes like a, uh, let

72
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,920
me see. Let me have another chip. That wasn't as good, but it was still pretty good. Okay.

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,080
So I'm reading here. Wait, let's make more noises into the microphones. I think people

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,080
really enjoy that. I think that's people's favorite thing. Yeah. I Googled Doritos incognito

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,640
because I wanted to see and Pat I hate to say it but you have some competition

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,480
here one of the top results when I googled I googled Doritos incognito

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,200
which is just the name of of the chip and one of the one let's see one two

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,840
three four the fifth result is from a Wix website called chip reviewer dot

79
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,900
Wix site dot com and it's a review of Doritos incognito and I won't read the

80
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:12,900
whole review here. Do you have the bro button on your phone? Pat, come say something. Sorry,

81
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,200
Chupio played the fucking bro sound effect. I'm going to need you to do that a lot more.

82
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,540
Do that at least a hundred times during this episode. I want to hear if you agree with

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,700
this review okay okay crunch is a 9.4 out of 10 that texture I mean crunch 9.4 for

84
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:41,660
sure texture is a 9.6 I'm seeing I'm also seeing flavor as a 7.2 and an overall

85
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,300
I would give it a I would give it a 7 they they literally it tastes like

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,220
ketchup they taste like ketchup yeah they taste like ketchup chips that

87
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,700
That doesn't seem very incognita at all to me.

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,320
Yeah.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,940
That seems like maybe the most direct and simple flavor you could have.

90
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
I uh...

91
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,220
I should have called it incognita.

92
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,940
They have ketchup flavored Doritos.

93
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,060
Maybe you got a mixed up bag.

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,140
What flavor is Doritos incognita?

95
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,180
It's a slightly spicy chili flavor that'll keep you grabbing for more.

96
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
Grabbing?

97
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,500
grabbing chips

98
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:29,200
is that a common thing down in mexico uh... to be a people are often grabbing

99
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,940
will group which is where we're sitting around

100
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,580

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,520
i know it was the grabber look like he looks exactly like he's in the heart

106
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,420
strangely enough

107
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,700
well i don't even know how they got the makeup on the grabber to make him look

108
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,340
that much like he's that so demonic and evil but he wears that he does look a lot like

109
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,380
he's an eerie mask and get this his mask can he can switch out the parts like it's a mix and match

110
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,540
oh i'm looking at that right now yeah oh you can i can uh you can buy a 3d printer version of that

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,620
mask wow it sounds to me like something only a grabber would buy the grabber is terrifying too

112
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,780
because he has a his he has a strong weapons for example he is one of his weapons that he can use

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:39,620
use

114

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,740
I did have a black phone.

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,400
- Okay, interesting.

118
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,340
- This is not looking good for Eric.

119
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,180
- I mean, if you were naughty,

120
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,420
you were playing the naughty boy game.

121
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,940
Were you ever naughty when you were a child?

122
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,860
- I think I was naughty.

123
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,020
- He was pretty naughty.

124
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,180
- Yeah, oh I know.

125
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,260
- I was smoking cigarettes.

126
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,940
- You smoked cigarettes as a child?

127
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,520
- I've been smoking cigarettes as a kid.

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,360
I was getting tattoos.

129
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,300
- Well, that's one of the things that Grabber hates.

130
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,140
- He hates tattoos.

131
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,620
He hates tattoos.

132
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,100
He hates when a little kid gets a tattoo.

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
Yeah.

134
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,580
He hates tattoos, he hates piercings.

135
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,580
And smoking cigarettes.

136
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,180
He hates the disrespect in today's society that comes from cashiers and waiters.

137
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
He hates loud music.

138
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
Really?

139
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,940
Well I do that all the time.

140
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,500
He literally has a second house so he can go there if there's loud music.

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,620
He has a house that he will go into for loud music.

142
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,620
That was crazy.

143
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
He has two houses.

144
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
He's so rich.

145
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
Why is he killing himself?

146
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,620
a black phone spoilers let's you know go ahead yeah you know you're fucking

147
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,460
spoiling the shit out of the black phone today yeah i i was reading about i

148
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,140
haven't even seen it once i've read probably 10 articles about the black

149
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,700
phone just uh because before and after watching it i just had kind of a hunger

150
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,300
for knowledge about this fascinating character the grabber and something i

151
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
didn't know so i guess the so the black phone is based on a short story that's

152
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,580
by steven king's son um and apparently in the original and the story and the

153
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,740
The story of, oh I just got it, that was a thinker.

154
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm the thinker.

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
The thinker.

156
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,700
In the original story, the grabber is really fat.

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,100
That's the only detail about it.

158
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,400
He's a really fat guy called the grabber.

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,260
So they couldn't have hired a fat guy?

160
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,540
No, they were like, we're going to have Ethan Hawke instead.

161
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,460
Why wouldn't they just hire like a fat bastard?

162
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,060
But I found that out because I was reading...

163
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,900
I've not seen fat bastard in a movie since probably 2003.

164
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,700
It has been a long time.

165
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,780
Yeah.

166
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,620
I would love to see fat bastard in a new movie.

167
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,140
I literally, the funny part, I was reading, I read that in an article, it was like one

168
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,260
of those articles, it was like every difference between the movie and the book, the black phone,

169
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,060
It's like the main difference is that the grabber is very fat

170
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:35,420
The fat grabber sounds like a like a product like Billy Mays would sell

171
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,460
The grabbers overall style and identity saw changes in the short story

172
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,620
The Galesburg grabber was a plus-sized guy named Al who dropped his groceries in the street

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,420
Wait, that's his origin is that he dropped his he dropped his groceries and he's like, oh, I wish I had some kind of grabber

174
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,020
Yeah, oh my god. I should become the grabber. Oh, yeah

Fat Grabbers is designed to support your weight management efforts.

183
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,700
Those are $33 a bottle.

184
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,380
And they'll make you kill a bunch of children.

185
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,020
So don't take these.

186
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,420
Is that what the Grabber does?

187
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,020
Explain, just tell me the whole plot.

188
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,340
So the Grabber, he's basically a magician.

189
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,500
He's a magician and he uses black, he dresses, he has white face paint and a black top hat

190
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,820
like a magician.

191
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,320
he drops his groceries in the street and and and white faces just okay nowadays

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,840
and we'll be okay yeah at least for the i mean the thing is he's a bad guy the

193
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,480
grabber so it's like you know most of the stuff is going to be like it's like an

194
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,960
always sunny when they were black it's exactly like i'm always sunny he drops

195
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,100
his groceries in the street and that but he does it next to a kid and then the

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,260
kid is like do you need help with that mister and he says yes i do in fact i'm

197
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,160
a magician would you like to see a magic trick and it says for my first trick i

198
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,960
I will become the grabber and he grabs the kid and throws him in the back of a van

199
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,200
and kids apps them completely and then he I guess hits them with a belt and calls

200
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,920
it says they're naughty and then he kills them and buries them yeah do you

201
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,600
think that that do you think that story was written about his father you think

202
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,240
Joe Hill was like yeah this is what my dad used to do yeah I think that that's

203
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,140
probably the case I think the grabber shares a lot in common with Stephen King

204
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,480
they're both terrifying, they both come up with horrific scenarios, and they both have

205
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
endangered children.

206
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,500
And they have a black phone.

207
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I think that the Grabber is probably going to be one of the great horror characters of

208
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,820
our generation.

209
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,580
I mean I don't want to over-hype him, but he is absolutely terrifying sitting in that

210
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,460
chair shirtless with his signature strong belt.

211
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,140
do you think they're gonna like a grabber cinematic universe I heard they're doing

212
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,700
the grabber - mm-hmm it's called grabber grabber origin I heard grabber origins I

213
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,420
heard they're making two movies at once grabber origins and they're also making

214
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,220
the grabber - twin grabbers that's about two what's that's so funny that they

215
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,640
like they made that movie X and then just immediately we're like yeah people

216
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,060

217
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,860
same time that's insane yeah and I think it's supposed to be a trilogy it's a

lady okay that's basically this movie

231
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Is the old lady Kid Cudi?

232
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
No.

233
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
The old lady is... if you wanted a spoiler.

234
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
No, don't spoil it! I wanna watch it.

235
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
The old lady is Pearl.

236
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
This is the movie spoiler, uh...

237
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Well, that's the thing, like...

238
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
Let's spoil every movie that we can.

239
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
I'm gonna spoil Nope now.

240
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Okay, so the plotline of Nope, essentially...

241
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
No, wait, don't actually spoil that. I haven't seen it.

242
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
There's a thousand aliens...

243
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I wanna see it, don't actually spoil it.

244
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
There's a thousand aliens that attack Earth and kill...

245
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
and kill 100 million people.

246
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,380
people. I'm taking my headphones off. I don't want to spoil that. Essentially

247
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:15,200
the spoiler to nope is that is that so that yeah, I mean there's these

248
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,360
characters. Yeah, this is what I'm done Patrick. I'm done. I'm done and then

249
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,920
they say nope when they get attacked by the alien.

250
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,700
Dude, you fucking spoiled the whole goddamn movie. You tricked me and

251
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,540
they're making a secret call and I don't want to and hey, they're making a

252
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,300
sequel called Yup and another one called maybe so

253
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,600
Yup.

254
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,660
There was a...

255
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,700
There was a sequel to "Nope" called "Maybe So".

256
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,920
Maybe.

257
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,980
A sequel to "Nope" called "Who Gives a Fuck".

258
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,780
Oh my god, nowadays that's how I feel with some of these movies.

259
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,280
Yeah.

260
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,340
The thing about that though, like if you genuinely don't want that movie X spoiled for you,

261
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,620
like the fact that the sequel is coming out and it's called "Pearl"

262
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,780
and there's the character named Pearl.

263
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,180
Like, the sequel's already spoiling it with its name.

264
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,980
It's a prequel.

265
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
Yeah, well, duh.

266
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,980
So what's the spoiler?

267
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,280
Is the character's name a spoiler to you?

268
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,580
The character's name is the spoiler for the big reveal in that movie.

269
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,380
I don't remember. I forgot that.

270
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,180
I forgot everything that happened in that movie instantly

271
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,980
after I watched it.

272
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,380
I've never seen it.

273
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh really? I saw it in the theater. I saw it in the trailer come out and everyone was like,

274
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,580
they're making a fucking prequel for that? Everything you need to know about that movie

275
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,460
is that it's one of the movies where if you went to see it in the theater, at least half

276
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:54,220
the theater would applaud for the Nicole Kidman AMC thing. I feel like you pretty much can

277
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,740
understand what's going on. Yeah, you're not a big fan of the Nicole Kidman AMC. I don't

278
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,300
- I don't mind it, I hate when people applaud for it.

279
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,020
It's like, "Shut up, why don't you applaud

280
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,260
"for the Coca-Cola part?"

281
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,960
- Yeah, or the M&M's.

282
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,360
- Yeah, those have been around way longer.

283
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,980
- And the M&M's are being way sillier than Nicole Kidman.

284
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,180
- The M&M's are fucking fire.

285
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,120
- They are putting their fucking life on the line,

286
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,500
on their line.

287
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,340
They're putting their life on the line

288
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,540
because if you remember the end of that commercial,

289
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,460
they get shot into space in a rocket.

290
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,620
- Yeah, they're in so much--

291
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,660
I don't want to spoil that commercial at the movies for you.

292
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,940
Yeah, we don't get any questions.

293
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,420
When the M&M's get shot into space.

294
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,100
I don't want to spoil that commercial either,

295
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,620
but it's really easy to get spoiled because if you see the rating for that commercial,

296
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,220
you can easily tell it's going to go on because it clearly and the rating says R.

297
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,140
It's rated R for M&M's in peril.

298
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,860
I hate when the ratings spoil the movie.

299
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,980
Yeah, oh my god.

300
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,500
I hate when the MPAA rating tells you everything you need to know about the movie.

301
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,980
movie. Just at the start of the trailer. God, we need to get rid of these ratings that are

302
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:12,860
spoiling the damn movies. Like seriously, what is this rated G for Winnie the Pooh? Yeah,

303
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:21,500
what's that G for? Tigger? There's two G's in his name. That doesn't make any sense. I

304
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,580
as we fit

305
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:27,100
uh... it's a very nice uh... didn't look at what it is a very big

306
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,980
they've been really quickly with the group is really

307
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,980
it was a really anything either i don't think it is to have to take the blame on

308
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,020
that one

309
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,620
paid

310
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,700
the g_-twenty-one or are you going to look at what you'd

311
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,820
can you fix this one of the future

312
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
but what's that what's that g_-four

313
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,340
the g_m_ pig

314
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,660
and piglet

315
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,260
- Come on, you have to salvage that, we're testing you.

316
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,100
We said complete nonsense as a test,

317
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,820
you have to figure out a way to make this make sense

318
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
and be funny.

319
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,660
(laughing)

320
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,500
- I took a fucking--

321
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,320
- Okay, you're the one who's,

322
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,300
it's your job to edit these now.

323
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,140
You gotta figure this out.

324
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,700
- What, is that public knowledge?

325
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,740
- I don't know.

326
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,580
- It is now.

327
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,660
- Should I have not said that?

328
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
- Yeah, it's a secret.

329
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,540
- Why, do you not want people to know?

330
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,380
- Yeah.

331
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,500
- You don't want anyone to know that we hired you

332
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,380
and you're our only employee?

333
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,060
So okay, G for Winnie the Pooh.

334
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,140
Just make this happen.

335
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,980
- Okay.

336
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,460
- All right, let's.

337
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
What's the G for?

338
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,140
Kangaroo?

339
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,640
As in Roo and Roo's mom?

340
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,380
Oh, I forget Roo's mom's name.

341
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,220
I think it's mommy.

342
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,460
- It's Kanga.

343
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,820
- Okay, so what's the G for?

344
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,660
Kanga?

345
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,480
- You know they're making a--

346
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,940
- In the G for Kanga?

347
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,440
- They're making like a gritty reboot of Winnie the Pooh?

348
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,280
- I did see that.

349
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,460
- Yeah, I saw that, isn't it?

350
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,500
They're making a gritty reboot of Winnie the Pooh

351
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,820
and then they're also doing like,

352
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,340
who is it, Daniel Kulia or whatever?

353
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Ariel Kalia is doing Barney.

354
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:48,840
Yeah.

355
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,340
What?

356
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
Yeah, he's doing a gritty Barney.

357
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,340
If he was a real fuckin' Barney fan, he would know that they already did a reboot like three years ago.

358
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Yeah, it was called Godzilla King of the Monsters.

359
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
Nah. Nah.

360
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Nah, but cameras playing.

361
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
Did I really just say that?

362
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,340
Real Barney fans know.

363
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,340
There was a really funny quote that he had about his Barney movie.

364
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,340
Yeah, it was something about the cleanup song, right?

365
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,340
Yeah, he also described it as heartbreaking.

366
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
His Barney movie.

367
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,340
His Barney movie is heartbreaking?

368
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Barney taught us, "I love you, you love me. Won't you say you love me too?"

369
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,340
That's one of the first songs I remember.

370
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,340
And what happens when that isn't true?

371
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,340
I thought that was really heartbreaking.

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:39,340
I think it's time we brought the conversation about how toxic Barney is to the children.

373
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Oh.

374
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Barney, yeah.

375
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,580
I think I I mean I think I mean far be it for me to claim that Barney is a saint

376
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,340
but BJ and baby bop you know need to answer for some of this too. Uh-huh

377
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,220
that's facts. Baby bop needs to sit down and listen. Remember that episode of Barney where

378
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,340
on set Barney smoked in this costume and that's why he got fired? I did hear about

379
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,580
that actually in kindergarten I heard that that happened. That's so funny that

380
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,840
that was like the big I remember it was like Barty the guy who played Barney

381
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,400
smoked a cigarette and and he was in the costume and that's why I got fired so

382
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,120
good that that's one of the like universal rumors to that like everybody

383
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,360
heard that did you do you did you guys you have any Barney rumors or I guess do

384
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,660
you guys do they have yeah we still have Barney but growing up we didn't have

385
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,280
any funny rumors now you guys just took Barney a complete face value and liked

386
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,200
him even though he smoked in the suit. We thought that dinosaurs smoked cigarettes back in the

387
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,800
day. That's true. They go down to the store and they buy the cigarettes and they're like

388
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,080
real people. And back in those days those dinosaurs actually liked having tar in their

389
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,840
cigarettes. Oh my god yeah. They're like hey give me some more of that tar. Yeah they said

390
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,200
hey can I get a cigarette uh hold the tobacco keep it extra yeah yeah and

391
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,760
instead of a paper i'll have um um you're gonna wrap this okay yeah they

392
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,360
go they call it the odd way where this is this is the episode where we're

393
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,000
training you how to yeah so we're gonna start here's what we're gonna do we're

394
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,680
gonna start a joke we're gonna start a joke or no listen we're gonna start a

395
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,320
joke and then i'm gonna say i'm gonna snap my fingers at you i'm gonna say

396
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,560
juveo go and you're gonna finish you're gonna make the joke funny okay for

397
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,980
for example like the other day i went to the store and i could not believe my

398
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,480
eyes and what i saw on one of the shelves there was a

399
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,000
to be a go

400
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,560
some uh... some tips

401
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,780
no is that would be in a store

402
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,120
what okay i don't know what i would already work with a story with this

403
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,920
i said some day and what flavor of the chips was

404
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,260
and canada

405
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,280
no that's from earlier that's from earlier that's not going to work and

406
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,340
they taste like blood

407
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,900
okay alright alright because cameras are vampire i've gone to have these chips

408
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,860
so that every okay okay this is working this is working that's one of the back

409
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,460
right there okay all right uh uh speed around let's go uh poop

410
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:23,180
you can just say poop what do you mean no it's called word association you got it

411
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Okay, poop.

412
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,980
Patrick.

413
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
Yo.

414
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
No.

415
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,980
That actually works.

416
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
No, that doesn't actually work.

417
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,980
He's actually really good at this.

418
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,340
That actually doesn't actually work at all.

419
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,340
He works.

420
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,340
He's actually really good at this.

421
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Okay, piano.

422
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Uh, piano.

423
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Mozart.

424
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:45,460
Okay, that wasn't funny, but that makes sense.

425
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,980
Uh, dog kennel.

426
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,460
Patrick.

427
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,060
No.

428
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,460
That makes no sense.

429
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,460
It completely makes no sense.

430
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
I think he's actually really good at this.

431
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
Computer Duster.

432
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Mmm... Patrick Duster.

433
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
No! No!

434
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
You can't just keep saying my name!

435
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Patrick Duster is actually funny as fuck.

436
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Chair!

437
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Chair.

438
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,460
Umm...

439
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
You stumped him.

440
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Yeah.

441
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,460
They don't have chairs in Mexico.

442
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,460
No, we don't.

443
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:35,300
Patricio. No! No! La Biblioteca. Oh I know this one. El Biblioteca. I don't know that

444
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,700
one. What's that? That means... Donde esta la biblioteca? That's a word they made up

445
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,740
for community. Yeah, they made that up. They made that crap up. Yeah, that's like, that

446
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,860
That was a language they made up like J.R.R. Tolkien did.

447
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
Mm-hmm.

448
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,500
Dan Harmon, yeah, I'm gonna be Harmon him when I see him.

449
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,220
What the hell?

450
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,220
What the hell?

451
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,220
When will you do that?

452
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Yep.

453
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,220
He made me cry watching Rick and Morty.

454
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,500
He made me cry because I actually thought about existential-ass stuff.

455
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,700
Yeah, some of that shit's a little too poignant for me, I have to say.

456
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,140
It's like, can you at least have Morty be an adult character so I don't think about

457
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,340
my childhood when I'm watching the show?

458
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,880
ass at least have Rick and Morty be the same age the one and it's cool that they

459
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,940
have all those scenes were what you say I want to make Rick and Morty forever he

460
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,580
was like talking about it is like yeah we got the next season coming up next

461
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,620
year and I think we can just have it going off forever well it kind of it

462
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,860
kind of has to like they're kind of screwed into like only doing Rick and

463
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:44,580
Morty forever because like it's so fucking popular now like can you imagine

464
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,500
imagine if they were like if Rick and Morty got like cancelled right now.

465
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,180
Yeah I think it's also the thing of every every uh any other show they try to make is if people

466
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,500
it's just like oh this is a this is the Rick and Morty.

467
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:05,460
Right everything now is like a ripoff of Rick and Morty and like it's crazy how successfully

468
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,220
they did enter like the zeitgeist.

469
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,180
Yeah like it was like it it it felt like it was an instant.

470
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,260
I know and it's really impressive because I feel like usually shows based around science

471
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,940
just people aren't there for.

472
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,460
No nobody likes a nerd.

473
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Exactly people.

474
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,620
But this show actually made it so nerds are cool as fuck.

475
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,900
And it drops fucking knowledge about interdimensional portals in a way that a lot of shows could

476
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,020
even not even dream of doing.

477
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,580
Like and and depression too.

478
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,820
That's why it's so impressive like a show like Doctor Who I mean that one teaches you

479
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,100
a lot of stuff if you really tune in keep that one taught us even Vincent van Gogh was

480
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
depressed.

481
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,860
but but you know even even that one. He even suffered from mental health.

482
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,380
Even that one it wasn't as it's it wasn't as scientific.

483
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,820
I mean you can tell because it's all live action and. No and it's all magical science too.

484
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,580
Exactly. It's none of this real science. A sonic screwdriver. You can tell also like there's

485
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,580
clearly some tensions behind the scene because they have to keep firing the main actor and

486
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,100
trying to change him out and be like no it's the same person the same guy. Yeah they go

487
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,780
clearly doctor who's a bird fed up with science that's what they're all saying

488
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,460
I don't want to do any more science fucking bird everyone talked to who

489
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,740
she's a fucking bird what is the doctor who change there like every year they

490
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,700
change it every year because the original show the actor who played dr.

491
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,540
who was a pedophile or knots that's how they say it over there across the pond

492
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:37,260
they say not okay and they changed him and then it kept happening where every

493
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,560
single because it's a show from it's a British show yeah every year they're

494
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,200
like oh this guy's a pedophile yeah the show is actually rid of him now the show

495
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,260
is officially we have a big episode sending him off to because you get

496
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:58,320
rewarded for being a pedophile yeah you realize the show is actually the actual

497
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,840
name of the show is just the doctor but people just call it doctor who because

498
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,560
it's so confusing because they change the actors so much.

499
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Who's the doctor?

500
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
That's what I'm saying.

501
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Was it a big deal when fucking Peter Capaldi was the, because he was the first Scottish

502
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,880
Doctor Who, right?

503
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,200
Yeah, I think so.

504
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
I have no idea actually.

505
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,280
I just said yeah.

506
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
I don't know why I said yeah.

507
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
It's okay.

508
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Yeah, what are they going to have for that?

509
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
That guy Matt Smith.

510
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,880
I just want to, oh yeah, Matt Smith.

511
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,120
Dude, I remember Matt Smith.

512
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,620
i did what some doctor who in high school 'cause a lot of my friends uh... or into

513
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,320
it

514
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,840
uh... your friends were who locked out yeah they were who are

515
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,120
that's a so that's that never got i hated that show i i like i will i'm not

516
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,440
gonna pretend i didn't like doctor who

517
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,440
in high school but i will say i did always think that sure lock was gay and

518
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,360
i'm i'm

519
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,460
happy to be able to say that

520
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,360
i never show even though maybe sure lock is that that doctor is probably worse

521
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,520
than sure like i don't know i know i didn't watch that much of either i did

522
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,880
watch either of them. The only type of British show I watched was like comedy stuff because

523
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,120
I was like I don't fucking care about what these British people think about drama. I

524
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,440
want to know what is actually funny in a posh way.

525
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah exactly. What's like dry leash.

526
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,880
I think it's funny to make a guy who objectively looks like an alien be like a sex symbol for

527
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
girls.

528
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
For nerdy women.

529
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:31,720
women yeah oh my god look at this man I said it I said it before but he looks

530
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,440
like if white people made the statues on Easter Island he looks like he's

531
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,720
actually made of plasticine like he looks like a yeah it looks like one of

532
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,720
those Halloween masks you buy online that's like $80 because it has so much

533
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:51,720
you know when they they had like like like the early 3d like video games like

534
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,120
from like 2001 and like the cover art or no no no it's like a 2d side-scroller

535
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,400
but they had like 3d art as the box art and it's like oh this is what the main

536
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,680
character looks like he looks like he should be playing an astro he looks like

537
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:11,760
he should be on the cover of like a Sega Saturn astronaut game like jet and like

538
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,800
jet ketchup or something yeah he looks like you know and like you know and and

539
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,840
in Harry Potter when the guy gets the face on the back of his head.

540
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Oh yeah.

541
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,040
He looks like the face grew.

542
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,160
He looks like the face on the back of a naked mole rat's head.

543
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,840
Like if a scientist in a lab grew a human face on like a...

544
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,480
What is he, he's on that new Game of Thrones show now?

545
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Yeah.

546
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Oh yeah.

547
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
I don't give a fuck.

548
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Me neither.

549
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
I don't give a fucking shit about TV.

550
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
I don't give a fuck about Game of Thrones.

551
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Uh huh.

552
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
This is a movie's in TV chat and we don't even give a fuck.

553
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Speaking of, I just re-watched the last couple of episodes of Breaking Bad because my girlfriend

554
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
was watching them.

555
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
It's the best show.

556
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
It's incredible.

557
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,840
It's so good, dude.

558
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,000
It's nuts how good it is.

559
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,660
We actually care about shows that they're actually kind of fucking fire.

560
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,760
That's another fucking show that teaches people knowledge about science and drops knowledge

561
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
of...

562
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,360
Listen, even if you're a fucking dropout loser who wears bullshit-ass hoodies and has no style

563
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,200
at all you can still become a science genius.

564
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah.

565
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
If you befriend the right older man.

566
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,080
Jesse Pinkman wore super sky tops.

567
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
If you...

568
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,680
That's a crazy, crazy detail.

569
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,800
If you spend enough time with the right older man, you can become a genius.

570
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Yeah.

571
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,480
What you need to do, you need to flunk out of school, right?

572
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,320
You need to not pay attention to a single lecture, single class in high school.

573
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,320
you befriend at the age of like 18 an old man you walk up and down the street.

574
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:56,060
I forgot about that too. He's supposed to be like either 18 or like very early 20s.

575
00:30:56,060 --> 00:31:01,400
Yeah dude that's the funniest fucking detail like Aaron Paul did not

576
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,600
like I mean he's great but he just does not. No he's a great actor yeah he just

577
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,400
just forget that he's supposed to be that age basically yeah you're just like oh

578
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:16,440
yeah he's just a guy but yeah my head he's like at least 10 years older than

579
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,960
Walter jr. if you win yeah if you if you are if you befriend the right older guy

580
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,680
at 18 you you grind you go out on secret missions with him I mean you guys do

581
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,120
stuff together that no one can believe you guys you're gonna become a genius

582
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,320
That is like Rick and Morty. You are also, you will become a slave.

583
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,200
Mm-hmm. You will become to a bunch of, you'll become a slave to the Aryan Brotherhood, and you will cook them meth.

584
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,340
Yes, but then, but then your old man will come save you.

585
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,480
Your old man will come save you and it'll be fire. Yeah. Do you think Rick and Morty's gonna do a Breaking Bad episode?

586
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,140
I hope they do a crossover. Oh my god. Jesse. I'd never even thought of that. And Mr. White. Now I'm freaking the fuck out.

587
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,660
That would actually be fire. I think all the best Rick and Morty episodes is where they just do a movie

588
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,400
And then I watch it, and I'm like the movie that they're doing right now. I like that movie I

589
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:19,600
Watch it, and I'm just happy because I'm thinking about Jurassic Park or whatever yeah, yeah, I like that that episode of Rick and Morty

590
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,360
where

591
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,680
Kevin brings in all the chili oh my open I

592
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,380
Can't stand that episode because I'm like that is a waste of chili when it spills

593
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,080
Yeah, yeah, I'm like you could have literally fed the crew with that you're pouring it on the ground. Okay, that's true

594
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,700
Okay

595
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:42,440
He should have fed you should have fed the cast and crew with you know a lot of a lot of movie cast and crews are

596
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Completely homeless and starved to death

597
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,040
They when they're done with a best boy

598
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,520
They leave the best boy out in the cold and they don't even give him a jacket

599
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, there's and they tell him the whole time that the the what is it like three to six months?

600
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,520
they're shooting that movie they're like you're the best boy you're the best boy

601
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,400
and we love you and he's like okay love you so much can i have some clothes from this from the

602
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,000
prop department because i'm i'm completely naked when i go home i i rent clothes to wear during

603
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,760
the work day but i can't afford to rent clothes when i get home and they're like no sorry you can't

604
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,400
you can't wear any of these clothes we have to burn them because we we 3d printed them they're

605
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,760
their proprietary designs their live

606
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,160

607
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,060
yugioh reboot and we can't have them

608
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,900
leaked so no you're going to have to

609
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,400
freeze to death at home and he goes

610
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,300
home to his igloo in in glendale

611
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,440
california

612
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,300
and the best looking true is to death

613
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,700
and this is okay.

614
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,800
Disgusting it's okay in hollywood,

615
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
but it's not okay.

616
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,500
It's not okay over in new york

617
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
and no you'll do it on new york.

618
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,760
The best boy see the best boy on like

619
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,200
- That's not how we do it in New York.

620
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,760
- Sorry, my New York accent popped out.

621
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
- That's not how we do it in New York.

622
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,840
- Yeah, that's not how we do it in New York.

623
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,360
- Okay, all right, well here we go.

624
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,480
The funniest thing about New York is,

625
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
go, the Ark.

626
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
The Ark? - No.

627
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,240
- That's pretty good. - It's not funny.

628
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,360
- No, it's-- - The Ark is not funny.

629
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,900
- There's something there.

630
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,320
- No, Ark isn't funny.

631
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,760
- Maybe when I walk into the bodega

632
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,360
and ask the Ark to make me,

633
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,020
(snaps fingers)

634
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,860
- A pizza.

635
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,700
(snaps fingers)

636
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,520
(laughs)

637
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
- What?

638
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,200
(laughs)

639
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,020
What?

640
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,860
(laughs)

641
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,600
It's a deli, they don't have a pizza oven.

642
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,060
- That's why it's funny, Pat, you don't understand.

643
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,260
You're being too harsh on him.

644
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,740
It's funny 'cause it's just to present it's real.

645
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,240
- It's not funny to make fun of the vibrant culture.

646
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,080
- Okay.

647
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,900
(laughs)

648
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,000
- It's not funny.

649
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,740
- Okay, what's his culture?

650
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,060
- Nuevo York.

651
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,420
- No, where's he talk from?

652
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:57,740
Well, he's from some Persian country. I don't know.

653
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,500
Okay. That's funny.

654
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,740
Something about me that changed ever since I moved to New York is I can't get enough

655
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
of musica.

656
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:12,420
I can't get enough of musica. Oye como va?

657
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,780
Oh my God.

658
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,980
I mean, dude, ever since I moved to New York, my meals have totally changed.

659
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,180
I mean, I'll get up from the computer to have lunch and I'll make myself a peanut butter

660
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:33,300
and jelly torta.

661
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,100
And it's, yeah, I mean, I didn't used to ever do this.

662
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,380
I used to be a clown eating sandwiches.

663
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,220
Now, I learned about...

664
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,540
You know what's a really big New Yorker movie?

665
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
This recently that they come out?

666
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,540
What?

667
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
Bullet Train.

668
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Bullet Train?

669
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,820
I thought that was a Japanese movie.

670
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,700
No, it's about New York because it's on the metro, it's on the subway.

671
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,260
Oh, okay.

672
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,260
And Bad Bunny is in it.

673
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Bad Bunny is in it?

674
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Is he really?

675
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Who is?

676
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,220
Wait, Bad Bunny just kissed a background dancer?

677
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,060
I saw that, he kissed a male.

678
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:17,140
I don't know about all that. I heard he kissed a male. Yeah. I heard that man that he kissed

679
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:25,860
was Good Bunny. I heard that was Good Bunny. Who is Bad Bunny? Is he a musician? He's a

680
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:31,780
music artist. Cameron doesn't get it like me and Jubio do. No, I'm still learning. I'm

681
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,740
still learning. I'm still growing. There's a lot of things. Sing one of his songs. Go

682
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,580
- Go ahead.

683
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,300
- Upside.

684
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,020
(laughing)

685
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,860
- What's that?

686
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,680
(laughing)

687
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,100
- Living la vida loca.

688
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,580
- Oh, that's him.

689
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,860
Okay, yeah, I know that one.

690
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,700
- Yeah, yeah.

691
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,020
He got in a big controversy recently.

692
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,860
He kissed a guy.

693
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,900
- Yeah.

694
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,860
- I heard he kissed a male.

695
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,620
- I've definitely heard a Bad Bunny song before,

696
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,680
but I don't think I could ever tell you the title of 'em.

697
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,660
I know that one song,

698
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,840
'cause there was a guy playing it so loud

699
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,400
outside of my apartment that I just shazammed it.

700
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,440
And I started listening to it on my phone.

701
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,680
(laughing)

702
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,040
I gotta look up what the song is called.

703
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
But it's the one that goes like,

704
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,000
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

705
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,840
- What?

706
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,760
- You know that one?

707
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,760
- I heard that Bad Bunny's real birth name is Melvin Nymire.

708
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,680
- Really, where'd you hear that?

709
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:40,320
I heard that he chose Bad Bunny because he thought it sounded cooler.

710
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,520
But I think Melvin's a cooler name.

711
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
Wow, that's interesting.

712
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah, just a fact I learned about him at the bodega.

713
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,880
You know what they used to call him when he was a kid?

714
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
What?

715
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,260
Melvin the Martian.

716
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Is that true?

717
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Really?

718
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
Yep.

719
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
Oh my god.

720
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,620
Do you guys have some big news I left off on sharing?

721
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
This is the song.

722
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Okay, let's hear the song first I guess.

723
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:08,620
I have no idea what that is.

724
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Is that, is this what you were describing as being pop, pop, pop?

725
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Yeah, it gets there.

726
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
It gets there?

727
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
What's the song?

728
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:28,620
It's called "De Manhattan Pa El Bronx" by El Cherry Scombe and Dwoba Montana.

729
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,620
so that's not bad bunny. Yeah that's not bad bunny at all. I really just showed my ass

730
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:42,620
there. I've been shazamming so much stuff. You're a fake bad bunny fan. No I know I am.

731
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:49,180
You probably didn't even know that he kissed a male. Yeah that's true. Only real fans know

732
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,780
that. I love shazam so much. I love shazam, I love touch tunes, I love music. I like la

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,620
Bad Bunny's name, it doesn't say that his name is Melvin...

737
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,260
Where did you get that name?

738
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm looking at Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio.

739
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
Ocasio?

740
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
Woah!

741
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
He's AOC's cousin.

742
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
He's AOC's cousin, I think.

743
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
That's why he's so popular.

744
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
You believed me when I said that Bad Bunny's name was Melvin Nymire?

745
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Yeah.

746
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500

747
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500

J Balvin's real name is Melvin Highmire.

766

That's where Balvin comes from is Melvin.

767
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Oh, oh.

768
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,660

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
That makes sense.

770
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
Makes complete sense.

771
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:37,780

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,160
of brocco bomb of the director of the people of the report

849
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,460
i would why would you say the term

850
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,440
we want to know what we need to look at it easily gets a bit of the usage is

851
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,600
critical bomber

852
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,280
is generally used in the hebrew bible to refer to a dark-skinned person of

853
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,920
effort

854
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,200
that's not a nice thing to say

855
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,480
what do you think

856
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,600
he's a hebrew racial slur for black people

857
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:26,080
well yeah i'm reading what mordecai ben david said and that's not a good thing

858
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,240
why would you say that

859
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,960
i'm not gonna say it again

860
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,960
Oh my god.

861
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,520
Because I didn't know what it meant.

862
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,960
It was so obvious what it meant.

863
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I guess it's Hebrew for the N word.

864
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,960
It's clearly the Hebrew N word.

865
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,460
It's obviously what it is.

866
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,460
What else would it be?

867
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,960
Well, that's my bad.

868
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,960
What other racial thing would he call Obama?

869
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
I don't know.

870
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I thought it was like an antiquated one.

871
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Like the stuff my grandpa used to say.

872
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
Like what?

873
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
I'm not going to get into that.

874
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,320
Alright guys, let's do a list of our favorite racial words.

875
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,320
I'm not gonna get into that.

876
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Well actually, if you knew anything about this fucking podcast, you know it's a premium episode, we don't do lists.

877
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,320
Alright.

878
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,820
Yeah, I didn't know that that... I didn't... Look, I don't speak a lick of Hebrew.

879
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,820
I don't either. I could easily tell what was happening in that sentence.

880
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,820
I was just the king of Jewish music for a little bit.

881
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,820
Yeah.

882
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,820
Okay, let's change the subject. Let's get back to movies.

883
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,820
You guys catch, uh, A Turtle's Tale 2, Sammy's Escape from Paradise?

884
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:34,500
A Turtles Tale 2. Sammy's Escape from Paradise. You guys catch it?

885
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,540
I didn't catch it no. It just came out?

886
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,260
It just came out in 2012. Yeah, what is it about?

887
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:48,260
It's about Sammy and Ray. They're essentially, they have grandchildren and two of their grandchildren

888
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:57,260
are captured. That's all I remember from it. But apparently it stars Caitlin Marr.

889
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,260
Oh, okay.

890
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,260
Got a Gnar.

891
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,260
And Carter Hastings.

892
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,260
Yeah. Yeah, that movie was fire.

893
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
You guys didn't see it? No.

894
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,260
That's your loss, I guess.

895
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,260
What was the last movie you saw, Pat?

896
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,260
Sorry, I'm reading more about this

897
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,260
Mordecai Ben David guy.

898
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,260
Okay, let's talk more about what he said.

899
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
He, uh,

900
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,260
I'm not reading that, I'm just, uh,

901
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,260
I'm just looking at, at, uh,

902
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,740
many albums he's made.

903
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,740
Oh yeah?

904
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,740
Pretty prolific.

905
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,740
I don't know who gave me that title.

906
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,460
I don't know who was calling me the king of Jewish music.

907
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
When this guy was around?

908
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,180
Is that what you're saying?

909
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,780
When this guy was around, yeah.

910
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:44,060
Solo albums, collaborations, this guy truly is the king of Jewish music.

911
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:49,540
But I guess not a very nice guy.

912
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,540
Based on what I read.

913
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,540
Why not?

914
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,540
Oh, did you guys...

915
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,540

So he's got, I'll read in, this guy's name is Mark Az Dipay.

922
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,340
And here's his, I'll read from, from, that's how you're supposed to say his name, Mark Az

923
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,340
Dipay.

924
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,500
I'm going to read his movies from earliest release date to most recent, okay?

925
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,020
So first off, Spawn, that's first.

Michael Jackson's Halloween.

The one hour animated special packed with the vocal talents of some of your favorite CBS

So is Alan Cummings.

Jim Parsons.

950
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,540
Hey, it's Jim Parsons plays Hey Man.

951
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,180
Diedrich Bader's in it.

952
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,180
As Franklin Stein.

953
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,180
Oh, that's our good friend.

954
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,180
Sorry, that's our friend.

955
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,980
Oh, and Christine Baranski.

956
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:51,300
remembers our AMA with Diedrich Bader. Remember Christine Baranski from

957
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,220
The Grinch? I can't believe that Jim Parsons was able to land the role of

958
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:07,780
Hey Man. That's huge. Everyone knows Hey Man right? Michael Jackson's Halloween in 2017.

959
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:29,800
that

960
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
I just found a video that I think we should watch.

961
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,800
And he gets addicted to making videos.

962
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Through the

963
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,800
one, not on the selfie camera, but just

964
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,800
on the back camera on his phone.

965
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
And he gets very popular.

966
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
And that's it.

967
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,800
That's the whole movie. He doesn't even take a single selfie

968
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,800
in the movie. But it's called Selfie Dad.

969
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
That's cool.

970
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,800
That's incredible. Yeah, it just came out.

971
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,800
It just came out? Yep.

972
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
I'm gonna have to watch it. We should watch it right now.

973
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,800
We should watch it. We're gonna watch it right now.

974
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,840
you want to hear about your check check this video out for we got a video to

975
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,600

976
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,600
yeah now that i mean we can all watch this together

977
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,040
okay what's this video here

978
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,660
uh... hold on it

979
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,120
started playing in a different window is about

980
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,900
but this is uh... i can't

981
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,960
this is jim parsons talking about

982
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,480
my name and music

983
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,160
also in the guise of a halloween story i play hey man he is somebody who has been

984
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,240
put under the spell by this evil queen.

985
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,520
Today, Hey Man's a pumpkin head,

986
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,880
but when no one's watching,

987
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,280
he turns into a wonderful dancer.

988
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,800
Which is something out of the blue that he asked me to do,

989
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,920
and there was no way I was gonna say no,

990
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,080
because anything that's celebrating Michael Jackson music

991
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,440
is just really enjoyable to be a part of.

992
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,360
My favorite Michael Jackson song,

993
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,680
it's "Human Nature," I would say.

994
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,120
There's so many good ones.

995
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,040
It's turned into my favorite type of sound

996
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,960
he produced. It's wistful in its own way, there's a melancholy to it.

997
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,760
He's not talking about Heyman enough.

998
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,880
No, go back to Heyman.

999
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,200
Yeah, come on Jim, talk about Heyman.

1000
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,440
...was as a musician as much as anything, but I find it very moving.

1001
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,760
My favorite memory of Michael Jackson...

1002
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,920
Come on, talk about Heyman!

1003
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,200
...most distinctive, I remember being at a birthday party at a Chuck E. Cheese in Houston.

1004
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
And Michael Jackson walked in.

1005
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,040
...puppet things that sing.

1006
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,640
And played in the ball pit with us.

1007
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,060
monitors or whatever and I tie very much watching the um...

1008
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,480
He what? He tied?

1009
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,320
in that Chuck E. Cheese on some monitor and as silly as it sounds to me

1010
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,560
You got tied up at Chuck E. Cheese?

1011
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,520
birthday party it's...

1012
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,560
Talk about hey man!

1013
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,360
That's exactly the essence you know

1014
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,280
you think of music in a car or music on your headphones or whatever but it's like

1015
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,880
you almost don't realize you keep dancing and moving and living to

1016
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,380
until years later like oh that was that's the soundtrack of my life

1017
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,120
I think in the same way when

1018
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,120
Come on.

1019
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
Alright, say some more shit about Hey Man.

1020
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,120
It's over, it's done.

1021
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,560
He's never going to talk about Hey Man again.

1022
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,120
Yeah, he's not talking.

1023
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
He's done with Hey Man.

1024
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,840
He's talking too much about Michael Jackson.

1025
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,960
What's this Selfie Dad thing?

1026
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,160
I do have a list of Michael Jackson's Halloween characters.

1027
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,960
This is Selfie Dad.

1028
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,520
Why are you putting it at two times speed?

1029
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,120
Because it's legitimately the whole movie.

1030
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
That's the whole movie?

1031
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Wait.

1032
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
It's the whole movie.

1033
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
It's the whole movie.

1034
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Full family comedy movie.

1035
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Yeah, it's a family comedy movie.

1036
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,120
It's my favorite movie of all time.

1037
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,120
I don't think we should watch the whole movie.

1038
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Well you said we should watch the whole movie.

1039
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,120
That's what you said.

1040
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,120
It's good on you for following orders.

1041
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,120
But this is kind of like a bit of malicious compliance.

1042
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Where I think you know...

1043
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,120
That we shouldn't watch.

1044
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,120
We shouldn't be watching this whole movie right now.

1045
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,120
Yeah, we shouldn't have that much fun.

1046
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,120
We should go back to work.

1047
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,120
I gotta figure out if there's a way to...

1048
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,120
Download that Hey Man video.

1049
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,520
I want to see all the Hey Man scenes.

1050
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,920
Here's the one piece of trivia about SelfieDad on IMDB.

1051
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:01,360
The thank you credits list in the credits begins by mentioning Chic Filet San Clarita,

1052
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,120
spelled without the K in Chick.

1053
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,720
This should give steam to all of the Mandela Effect subscribers who say that this was the

1054
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
original spelling of the restaurant chain's name.

1055
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,480
What?

1056
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
Isn't it?

1057
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
That was Chick.

1058
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,840
Isn't it Chick Filet like uh...

1059
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,680
- CHIK.

1060
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,520
- CHIK.

1061
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,340
- CHIK.

1062
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,180
- Chick-fil-A.

1063
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,880
- No, isn't it CHIK, F-I-L-A?

1064
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,180
- No.

1065
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,600
That's not even what people were,

1066
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,040
that's not even the Mandela effect thing.

1067
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,880
That's just a completely different--

1068
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,480
- I thought it was spiky chicken.

1069
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,320
- Chicken.

1070
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,440
- Oh, you know what it is?

1071
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,240
It's 'cause I think that it's Chick-fil-A with a K

1072
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,560
because all the ads were the cows.

1073
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,400
- Oh, they spell it wrong.

1074
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,480
- That said eat more chicken, yeah.

1075
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,320
So that's, so we just debunked a Mandela effect right there.

1076
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,100
there. That was actually very, very smart of you. I wouldn't have thought of that.

1077
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:56,000
Did you know that that didrich bader voices franklin stein a mad scientist

1078
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,940
cat who works for conformity and built a machine that destroys music really

1079
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,920
know that now however after he's captured by vincent and victoria he

1080
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,840
reveals that he really wanted to make music before meeting conformity and

1081
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,640
joins forces with the pair who use his machine to summon michael jackson.

1082
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,520
it's funny that you have a lot of money they use a machine that's destroys music

1083
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,200
to someone michael jackson you think they'd use a machine

1084
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,480
that destroys children's lives

1085
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,140
is that so funny that uh... i mean fuckin what's his name

1086
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,680

1087
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,000
angry video game nerd says in his video about michael jackson moonwalker but it

1088
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,800

the uh... the the goal of the game moonwalker is to save a bunch of

1090
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,680
children

1091
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,180
in a lot of time

1092
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,480
uh...

1093
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,560
speaking of angry video game nerd i was hanging out with uh... you were hanging out with an angry video game nerd?

the big star big star celebrity sean p mccarthy

1111
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,440
And this guy comes up to us and starts like,

1112
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,080
I don't remember what he was asking us,

1113
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:51,560
but then the conversation turned to him asking us,

1114
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,080
oh, he asked me what I do, and he was like,

1115
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,320
oh, so what do you write?

1116
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,760
And I was like, I don't, what are you talking about?

1117
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,200
And he's like, you write?

1118
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,800
You do graph?

1119
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,200

1120
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,480
I don't, I'm not a writer, sorry.

1121
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,080
And then he's like, well, what do you do?

1122
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,280
And then Sean said that we're both comedians,

1123
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,400
And then he talked Sean's ear off for 20 minutes,

1124
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,840
talking about how AVGN is his perfect ideal of a comedian.

1125
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,080
(laughing)

1126
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,600
Like, we couldn't leave because like,

1127
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,840
Sean was smoking his weed.

1128
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,840
So, the guy had him locked in conversation about AVGN.

1129
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:35,300
- I had a very similar experience,

1130
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,180
where at my old job at the liquor store,

1131
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:43,500
my one of my managers is pro it was like a

1132
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,160
like late thirties guy

00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,500
uh... one of the work that you get it so whenever somebody asked what does that

1137
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,780

1141
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,800
those assume yeah i think

1142
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,720

1148
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,780

00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,720
uh... the irate gamer

1150
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,380
'Cause I don't think he'd ever watched either of them.

1151
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,460
And, uh, 'cause we were talking about Michael Jackson, Moonwalker,

1152
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,360
and I was showing him that, and then we got into this, like, fuckin' rabbit hole

1153
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,660
of just watching irate gamer videos for, like, an hour.

1154
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,860
And we watched the irate gamer reviewing, uh,

1155
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:57,720
every one of the, like, like, Yummy Mummy and, uh, uh, Count Chocula.

1156
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,600
And it's like a video that the irate gamer made detailing the history of like forgotten

1157
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:11,480
uh like the Count Chocula cereals which is like Yummy Mummy and like um what's the other one it's

1159
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,080
Frankenberry Booberry and Count Chocula are still around but then there's Yummy Mummy

1160
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,320
And then there was like a werewolf one. Ghost...uh...berry.

1161
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:32,360
Yeah, werewolf berry. I don't want...I...I...it's not called like creature pieces.

1162
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:38,680
I really hope it's not called creature pieces. Oh, it's called chocolate screams.

Fruit brute. Monster...it was called fruit brute. Monster milk. Monster milk. I think it was monster

Creature Crispy.

1171
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,800
Crispy Crunch was good though.

1172
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Crispy Crunch and uh...

1173
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,640
It got rid of all that terrifying creature theming.

1174
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,640
And it was just plain Crispy Crunch.

1175
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:40,840
I'm looking at a box of Creature Crunch here and I guess this is a video game that came

1176
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,520
out for Creature Crunch.

1177
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:51,520
It's an animated nightmare of a game starring Martin Short and Eugene Levy.

1178
00:59:51,520 --> 01:00:01,520
It was like Creature Crunch cereal I guess came with a game starring them.
