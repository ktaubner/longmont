[MUSIC]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Last time on Gun City, the Temple of Tepanguin of Doom.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Our heroes attempted to avoid the gamers who slept in their weird apartment complex inside of the land caves by traveling along the internal river on their Mass Effect raft.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,600
But they were far too noisy, and the nasty gamers began to do a sinister crane game,

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,520
picking up our heroes, even though Ray William Johnson did an excellent performance of being dead.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,040
After their best attempt, they got scooped up, tossed into a terrifying dark maze of

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,760
Pac-Man variety, and became the prey of gaming. After collecting the four elements or element-like

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,280
sort of things they needed to to get out of the cave, or get out of the maze, they took a magical

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,280
Willy Wonka elevator up past where all the land parties were happening to the main control

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,360
area for the gamers who have since colonized this cave. The giant Xbox. And now they are

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:17,380
face to face with the great gamer, the winged gamer, who stands before them. And if you

12
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,900
remember the gamer said um uh would you like to play a game and uh i thought it was saw

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,940
i thought it was the saw gamer no he's just he just said that as a little not um not to

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,740
saw it's saw he's trying to fix my mic playing with your microphone did i show you guys i

15
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:43,860
got this what is that is that jimmy carter oh it's donald trump and my pants trumpets

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:58,860
is

17
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,860
this

18
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Caleb, you get one thing to add.

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,860
These two?

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Nope, one thing per game.

21
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
One thing per round.

22
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
I don't have...

23
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
This is a good mechanic.

24
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
I don't have anything in my room.

25
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
You don't have anything in your room?

26
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Nope.

27
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
You can add this to your inventory.

28
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,860
I add that empty jewel pod to my inventory.

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,860
So you add Patrick's empty jewel pod to your inventory.

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Thanks for the spot, Pat.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,860
You're welcome.

32
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,860
know

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,860
Then Sullivan will take the empty jewel pod.

34
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,860
So yeah, the winged gamer beseeches you, you know, says "Would you like to play a game?"

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,860
And he sort of, you see the little gamer who is, you know, sort of going

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,860
[gibberish]

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Sort of like looking towards the four of you, gesturing towards him.

38
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,860
And Patrick Yoda, you'd be able to understand what the little gamer is essentially saying

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,860
is "Play the game and you'll get the prize."

40
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,860
Um, yeah.

41
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,860
What the fuck is he fucking saying?

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,860
I believe he's trying to say, "Play the game and you'll get the prize."

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Oh, so you can understand him. Okay.

44
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,860
Yes, I can understand all my games.

45
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,860
So now, now I don't have to be the one that he talks to.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,860
Yeah, you can just like come around with us after whatever happens between us here in a minute.

47
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,860
You can just like come with us so we can understand this game.

48
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Yeah, but you can understand.

49
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
We'll pay you.

50
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,860
Well, the little gamer here, like, would you say pay me?

51
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,860
Yep, that's what I said.

52
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Do you have any interest in an iPod Touch?

53
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,860
Do you accept negative money?

54
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,860
I don't accept negative money, but an iPod...

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,860
It's a huge hit up on the surface.

56
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,860
An iPod Touch is a pretty rare relic.

57
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,860
Okay, wait, hold on.

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,860
We don't have one.

59
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,860
Okay.

60
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I do have a...

61
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
I have $100.

62
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:12,860
I mean, look, I'll take your money to help you if you need, but the little gamer here, he's not going to be traveling with you any longer.

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:30,860
And he sort of, he sort of like goes like in like the little gamer sort of scurries up to him and the wing gamer gives him like sort of like there's like a little like up, up like with a dog with food, but it's like with a Game Boy advanced and eventually he drops it and the little gamer grabs it and scurries away.

64
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:41,980
away. I say before the little gamer leaves I say, "I hate you too." Which means, you

65
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,740
know man, I mean I've only known you a couple minutes in this game but you feel

66
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:53,780
like it feels like you're a real best friend to me and I was sad to see you go

67
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,900
but you know I know that we'll always be friends and I always understood

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:07,180
everything you were talking about. He looks at you and he goes "WAAA" which means F-Zero

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:22,300
for the GBA and he just looks back down. And he just goes back to playing. Alright so Wing

70
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,600
Gamer it seems like maybe we figured this whole thing out, like maybe you can let us

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:34,360
into the next room or if only well first of all this is the last room okay the next level

72
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,280
like okay a little bit maybe if this is the last level we could go to the next world maybe

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,200
like world two level one yeah like the desert one because this is like

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:55,720
what map oh yeah map yeah we could get another map yeah maybe he's a multiplayer gamer fellas

75
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
You don't need to do anything of the sort.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Please, approach my machine."

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,720
And he gestures back to his, like, giant, like, game console PC thing.

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
He says, "This is called the Void.

79
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,720
We were going to enter it, after which we will play a game.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,720
And if you defeat me, you will receive a gift from the temple.

81
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Something left by the Tamagotchi people.

82
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,720
It was once told that true gamers would come

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,320
And seek out a relic and help the world.

84
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Perhaps something related to, I don't know, the gamer word itself.

85
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:39,520
So, I have to obey this prophecy as you four have defeated Gaben.

86
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Please, come forth, enter the void.

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I'd dive in.

88
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,020
Okay.

89
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,520
Can I take a bite of that cosmic brownie first?

90
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,520
All the cosmic brownies here are yours to have.

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Alright, then I'll just wait until I come back.

92
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Yeah, I stuffed my pot.

93
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,520
We'll share, you know, don't...

94
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
You don't get any.

95
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Don't what? No way.

96
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
Yeah, we're gamers.

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
We're gonna play this damn game.

98
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,520
How about you just give us the...

99
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,520
How about you just give us the relic and then we can sit here and eat cosmic brownies until the timer runs out.

100
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,520
I am unable to get the relic. The relic is inside the void.

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
So go in the void and get it for us.

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,640
You need to defeat me.

103
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
I'm waiting.

104
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
It's a ritual.

105
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
What if we- I've got an idea.

106
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Repeat that?

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I've got an idea.

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
You need to-

109
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,640
A ritual?

110
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
You need to defeat me.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
It's a ritual.

112
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Oh, I knew it.

113
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
I fucking knew it.

114
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
This guy.

115
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
What?

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
He's trying to get us to fight him all along.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
No, no, no.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
It's not a fight.

119
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
It's just a game.

120
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
You wanna fight?

121
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Come here, you piece of shit.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
No, I don't wanna-

123
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Fuck.

124
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I spit in his face.

125
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Oh my god.

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
I'm not putting them up.

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Please.

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Let me at him.

129
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
I've got an idea.

130
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,940
- Why are you doing that? - We're crazy.

131
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,640
- Why don't we put him in there with a mirror? - I'm straining like a dog on a leash,

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,440
but there's no leash. I'm just pretending to hold myself back.

133
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,140
You don't want to bump my homie over here. He's loco.

134
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,540
Okay, I think evil is good.

135
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,740
If you... How about this?

136
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,240
Oh, what's that? Is that the... Oh, a sub voice.

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
If you beat me in this, you'll also get to level up.

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
- Ah, what does that mean? - Get into the void.

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,360
Okay, yeah.

140
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,400
I grab Pat and throw him into the void with me.

141
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,240
So what happens is actually,

142
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
because there's no, it's like there's this giant machine here

143
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,480
and as you approach it,

144
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,200
your vision begins to get like kind of fuzzy

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,880
and the edges of reality fray

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,640
and like vibrate a little gently.

147
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,340
It's sort of like you're on a you're like tripping and you

148
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,240
also get to melt into something else like some other world and

149
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,740
it's must be where the winged gamer lives all the time and he

150
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,440
says he says to you and his voice is now sort of like echoing

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,340
and has like a another tone below it.

152
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,240
That's so deep it like sort of like rings in your head and

153
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,140
he's like the void is able to project the sine wave that

154
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,540
corresponds to the gamers.

155
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,340
I if you stand too near for too long you become like us.

156
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
But this should not be a worry for you all.

157
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,140
You must step in and you guys kind of step a little bit closer

158
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,240
and the sensation you felt before happens again, but now like

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,540
sort of louder and stronger solvent as well.

160
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,340
The you look up at the top of the Xbox sort of thing you're

161
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,240
in and it now begins to open up into like a black sky punctuated

162
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,340
by these like little stars that seem to streak along it echoing,

163
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,040
you know, their echoes like lingering along a horizon where

164
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,320
You see like crystal mountains cutting through an endless

165
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,620
expanse radiating colors refracting from nowhere.

166
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,520
And then suddenly the wing gamers before you again, like

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,620
you're sort of like shook by this vision and then you see

168
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,220
his face is like perfect face and it devours your field of

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,320
view and you hear his voice again and he doesn't even seem

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,440
to be moving his mouth and he says tick-tack-toe.

171

176
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:33,360
The gamer says first, "Best two of three," and puts an X here.

177
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360

void with him and somehow you're able to stand near the machine now the void is

246
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:23,300
locked and he says I've lost I became red nude and mad I rage you have made me

250
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:49,320
wooden Eldridge Bop it. And it's sort of like floats towards

252
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Okay, I drop it.

259
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
As you catch it,

260
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
as you drop it,

261
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
it lands on the bop it button

262
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
and

263
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
when it lands on that

264
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
it goes like a

265
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
"Oooh, lock-o!"

266
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,600
and then it starts like all the like different parts of the bop at the

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,680
twisted to flick it they're all they all look like this dark obsidian wood and

268
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,320
they all start like they all start like glowing intermittently like the bop at

269
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,040
the game and you hear it go doh-la-co and like the twisted thing lights up and

270
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:49,840
then if you don't do anything it just goes and it's like gotta I think we got

271
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,240

You first.

273
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I don't want to touch it.

274
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
I already touched it.

275
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,920

291
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240

It goes "Oolaco" and then it goes "Oolaco".

294
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440

interesting doesn't seem like it took very long but i am

364
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,500
okay i just

365
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,060
i knew how long it was going to take the department shut up

366
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,420
try again

367
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,960
okay i bought a lot go

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,780
okay yet starts up

369
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,980
adore local i twisted

370
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,660
flake it

371
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,940
I go to lick it but then I flick it.

372
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,860
Then it says

373
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,140
"Pass it!"

374
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,780
Okay, I throw it up like I'm passing it

375
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,940
but then I just catch it.

376
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,420
I bop it.

377
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,740
Which one's Sulaco? Spin it.

378
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,180
This goes on for another 45 minutes and eventually you guys figure it out.

379
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,340
Pretty you guys got it. I'm not worried about you getting it. And as you do,

380
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:07,300
it says it starts it once you like complete the Bop It sequence, it then you hear and

381
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,020
And like a little disk drive pops out.

382
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,420
And you see the amulet that Marie and Rex gave you.

383
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:24,520
That was from Leo. Start to glow a little bit and like sort of move a little bit in the direction of the Bop-It.

384
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,020
So you can keep it away from that thing.

385
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,720
I put the amulet in.

386
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,420
Okay. Yeah, you put the amulet in, you close it.

387
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,820
Like it's hard to close because there's like string around it,

388
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,820
but eventually you get it to close and as you do

389
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,820
the Bop it the Bop.

390
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,220
It says like please move away.

391
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,520
Please move away.

392
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,220
Please move away and I hand the Bop it to the winged gamer.

393
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,620
Yeah, and he's like fuck just like tosses on the ground and

394
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,720
it starts to the Bop it starts to like like sort of like like

395
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,400
It looks like it's both like growing like the gnarled obsidian like wood of it is like sort of

396
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,040
Growing and twisting around until it makes like a weird like

397
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,320
Egg shape and then you hear

398
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,360
And it like just just sort of standing or sitting in place

399
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,840
It's like egg and then you start to hear like a little sound like a tinny sound that sounds like a blizzard

400
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,520
uh, like whooshing by and the sound gets louder and louder miser and

401
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Then the egg bop it in all its like

402
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:42,300
Weirdness it pops open like it cracks open and it reveals like a solid gold penguin

403
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,960
with a really realistic vagina I

404
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Thought it was gonna be snow miser

405
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,160
and

406
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
What is this fucking bullshit?

407
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:01,480
Fuck this thing. I thought this was gonna be fucking snow miser. No. No, I think I think that's a clue

408
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,240
I think that's supposed to be a clue. I don't care

409
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,780
Sullivan are you think it's do you think that thing is sexy?

410
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,760
No

411
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,400
Everyone knows I'm

412
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,760
Talk to her

413
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,360
Sullivan say this word for word. Hey bitch. Are you from Tennessee? Cuz you're the only 10 I see it'll work

414
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,200
Go try it

415
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,960
You're only interested in that thing cuz it looks like a frog

416
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,640
What I push Sullivan up to it

417
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,400
Tennessee

418
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:46,840
You're fucking it up Sullivan. Oh don't sing Tennessee arrested development. Don't sing that I

419
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,680
Don't I'm not I'm not cool enough to know anything like that Patrick Yoda

420
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,240
and you hear from

421
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,160
beyond the a

422
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,320
A little bit beyond the Xbox area that you're in, a familiar voice say, "Well, that's all

423
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,040
I needed to see."

424
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,680
And it is none other than Pennsylvania Jim.

425
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,500
And he says, "You would have thought that you three Dwights would be able to figure out

426
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
what that means by now."

427
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Don't call me that!

428
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,840
I thank you for that.

429
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Hey Jim, is this thing your girlfriend?

430
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh!

431
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Yeah, watch this.

432
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,920
You know what he's about to do to it.

433
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Yeah, watch this.

434
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,640
eating the statue's pussy right in front of him.

435
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,640
"Yeah, you like this? This is your girlfriend. Oh yeah."

436
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,880
Yeah, well you sure own me, Dwight.

437
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,560
"Tastes like a water fountain."

438
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,360
I'll tell you who's gonna own you now, and he...

439
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,160
[laughter]

440
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,040
Fuck.

441
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:54,880
He snaps his fingers, and then nothing happens,

442
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:20,880
is

443
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
out with so many children.

444
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,320
It's because I have a loving wife and we have three kids together.

445
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,440
Are these your three kids?

446
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,280
You're putting your kids up to battle us?

447
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,920
No, these are not my kids.

448
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
I'm going to go.

449
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I got what I needed.

450
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
You're going to go fall in love with a kid.

451
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Nope, not going to do that.

452
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
You're a pedophile, Jim.

453
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
That's what the P in your name stands for.

454
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Nope, it's pretty clearly Pennsylvania.

455
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Nope, Peru.

456
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Pedophile Jim.

457
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Yes, that's what the P in your name stands for.

458
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Nope, it's pretty clearly Pennsylvania, actually.

459
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Nope, parole Jim, for pedophile stuff.

460
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
I'm on parole for being a pedophile?

461
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Yep.

462
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
[laughter]

463
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
I stopped him from leaving.

464
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
Yeah.

465
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Alright, you wanna try to stop him?

466
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
Yeah, I grab onto his leg.

467
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,920
We get into a circle and we just kinda like, we put our arms together.

468
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Can we get him on the map, though, for real?

469
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
Oh, shit.

470
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,680
uh...

471
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,360
your ability to do it about a good down

472
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,780
so that you better stay away from this guy 'cause you're short he might mistake

it's

493
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,320
Everyone roll initiative, and I think because Jim's not expecting it, you guys can get a

494
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,120
round where you try to stop him.

495
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,800
Oh dude.

496
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800

00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
20 from Pat, let's go dude.

501
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
Nice dude.

502
00:28:51,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Okay, yeah, okay, I also, I forgot, I wanted you guys to level up after you solved the

503
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,120
Bop It.

504
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,160
So, um, uh, see ya.

505
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,200
See ya. Yeah, just give us like yeah, five minutes

506
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,640
Just don't do any pedophiles it over there. It's one thing. I respect. It's RPGs. Please level up boys and

507
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,560
So yeah, I'll show you guys your you remember your things

508
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,060
Your weird trees I made for you

509
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,980
I did some tweaking on some of them because I took away some abilities and gave you some others

510
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,200
And retooled them a little bit

511
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
But things are largely the same

512
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,280
For the most part

513
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:47,600
So what you can do if you look at the your your thing you get two points per level up

514
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,680
So you can obviously save two points also

515
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,340
Or just use one point now to unlock a subclass and get the bonus

516
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,140
But right now so Ray William Johnson has you have an unlock in bazinga

517
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:09,000
You have an unlock blow toss in shadow who and Patrick Yoda you have an unlock in

518
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,680
counselor

519
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,720
Yeah

520
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,200
Do I wait I still have the smoothie ability

521
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,240
Got about that you can now you can now unlock the yeah ignore that the tree

522
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,080
I didn't edit the tree the abilities the tree is mostly correct

523
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,780
But the abilities that I described are did I even have the smoothie and

524
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,680
Uncle's Falcon you had the smoothie.

525
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,080
You didn't really use it.

526
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,180
You had piece for you to piece for all which I fixed.

527
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,180
I'm not completely broken this time.

528
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,980
Because last time it was like basically like a realm of peace for

529
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,580
10 minutes, which is crazy.

530
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,980
I don't know what I was thinking.

531
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:58,380
Why why change that it was perfect.

532
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,380
Metric also never used it.

533
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,380
It's true.

534
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
Yeah.

535
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
Yeah.

536
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,180
So wait, it costs how many?

537
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,780
We get two points, it costs how many to-

538
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
Yeah, you get two points.

539
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,040
It costs one to unlock one of the subclasses.

540
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,580
So if you have a subclass unlocked, like you already have Shadow Who unlocked, you could

541
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,940
just spend your two to finish getting the abilities from that class.

542
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,940
Alright.

543
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,940
Versus, if you, once you unlock a subclass for that level up period, it then costs one

544
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,740
additional one like it costs two then to unlock another subclass so if you saved

545
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,560
up to this time you could spend three to unlock two subclasses how do we know

546
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,940
what we have well I probably I have three because I just unlocked a bazinga

547
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,920
the first time and that was my first subclass right yeah you actually have

548
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,280
yeah yours are actually stacked yeah you have three cool actually do I have you

549
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
You have two.

550
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,120
Where do I see that?

551
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
You don't see it anywhere.

552
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
You don't see it anywhere.

553
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,400
You unlocked Counselor last time.

554
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,800
And I retold your abilities so you're, even though you didn't quite keep some of the same

555
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,880
abilities from the last level up, I made you, I kind of like made you a bit stronger to

556
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,400
like make up for that.

557
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,840
Okay, well I'm gonna, either way I'm unlocking Dark Yoda.

558
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Okay, and Dark Yoda is under Sentinel.

559
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Okay, so you unlock Sentinel, which means...

560
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,840
So when you guys level up also, your Technoslime increases by 25%.

561
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,840
But for you, Patrick Yoda, now it's going to increase by 50%

562
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,840
because you unlock Sentinel, which is the Force user subclass.

563
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,840
And Dark Yoda is... Dark Yoda is very cool.

564
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
It basically gives you additional abilities when you use Use the Force.

565
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Okay, the whole Sentinel subclass as I made it is supposed to be like you have that used to force ability and that's that's gonna be so it just stacks on top of that.

566
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:05,840
So when you have dark Yoda patch Yoda embraces the dark side giving him these additional abilities when he uses the force Yoda's mind now can cause psychic damage upon entry into the mind.

567
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,840
So if you try to read somebody's mind, you can also do a shit ton of damage to them now.

568
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,840
Yoda's choke. Yoda can choke enemies grappling from afar with a wisdom check

569
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,840
against a disadvantaged strength check and will be undetected unless the target succeeds on a perception check against Yoda's sleight of hand.

570
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,840
So basically, you can choke somebody and they cannot know where that's coming from.

571
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
And then you have Yoda ultra lightning. Your lightning is now superior and can attack more than one person at a time.

572
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,840
a strike of lightning or a stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in the direction you choose.

573
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Each creature in the line must make a dexterity saving throw, they'll take 86 on a failed save or half as much,

574
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,840
and also the lightning ignites anything flammable that's nearby.

575
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Um, so, and then also you get, um, also, oh no, yeah, Foreskin Ultra's actually a separate ability.

576
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,840
So you just get those, those, those three up top there.

577
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Um, yeah.

578
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Oh, so this, if this, you didn't update the tree.

579
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Yeah, I didn't update it.

580
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,840
This were on the tree, so it would be like Dark Yoda would be like one thing and then it would have like a bunch of other branches?

581
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,760
It would be no it would be like a sentinel like it is in dark Yoda

582
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,120
But then dark Yoda the abilities would make would you would see the abilities there rather though. You did update it. Okay. Yeah

583
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah, but if I had a better tree would be a better tree. Okay. Yeah Plotas. What do you want to do?

584
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,320
What are you thinking? Um, so yeah, I unlocked the shadow who class and last time I got master disguise

585
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,800
So I'm just gonna get the two other abilities from it. Nice. Yeah, which is who's there - there

586
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,000
where after I take damage I can turn invisible and then sneak attack people.

587
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,200
Gift of the Lorax, which it says I can pick one of these spells.

588
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,700
Can you explain what these spells are?

589
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,200
These spells are like 5e psychic damage based spells.

590
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Mental Prison, which means you can basically trap somebody inside of a mental prison.

591
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,800
I'll send you the like actual like spells. It's basically like you

592
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,480
Give they are inside of a prison that only they can see

593
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,740
So they just like think they're inside of a prison

594
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,480
and then they take a

595
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,520
That they take like a shit ton of damage

596
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,080
In there like to take 5d 10 psychic damage while they're in there and they can continually take damage it's pretty crazy

597
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,520
So you have that ability

598
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
And then you have

599
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,440
Phantasmal killer is the other one you could choose

600
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,520
We get that one up to

601
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,720
Fan there. I'll send you these actually

602
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,960
So phantasmal killer you tap in the nightmares of creatures

603
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,680
You can see within range create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears visible only to that creature

604
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,180
The target must make a wisdom saving throw on a failed save the target becomes frightened for the duration at the end of each

605
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,000
Of the targets turns before the spell ends target must succeed a wisdom saving throw or take 4d 10 psychic damage

606
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm going to choose Mental Prison though.

607
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Unless Crown of Madness is really really cool.

608
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Crown of Madness just puts a crown on their head and it makes them crazy.

609
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I choose Mental Prison.

610
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Gift of the Lorax also lets me teleport.

611
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I choose Mental Prison.

612
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And also Gift of the Lorax lets me teleport.

613
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yes. Yeah.

614
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So you're basically like, you fully embrace sort of the aspects of Whovian culture that deal with dark magics.

615
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Yeah, and you're fully maxed out there.

616
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And it gives me intelligence too.

617
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yes. Yes, you get +1 intelligence because your spells are intelligence based.

618
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Now, RayWilliamJohnson.

619
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What are you leaning towards?

620
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,840
I think I'm gonna tailor my level up for our specific enemy and I'm gonna go with

621
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,760
I'm gonna get to are we computer subclass and I'm gonna unlock child porn upload -

622
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,400
Okay

623
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,160
Yeah

624
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,600
Which I don't even want to know what that is, but I am unlocking it. Basically. It just means you can use

625
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh shit, I think I I changed that slightly

626
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,080
Yeah, I'll put it back in. Yeah, basically what it does is it allows you to

627
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:42,220
Attempt to upload child porn on onto five people max

628
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:50,640
Could I hypothetically upload five times the child porn to onto one person? Yeah. Yeah, you could try

629
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,520
It

630
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,400
It makes the porn the children are five times the age

631
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:03,880
It does cost so that's actually that's that doesn't work out doesn't help at all. Yeah

632
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,740
If you if you upload the thing it costs

633
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:15,900
10 techno slime points to use. Okay, so if it doesn't work, I mean you're out but you have I think you have refills

634
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
So yeah, I have to risk addiction

635
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,540
But yeah, go for it

636
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,340
Child porn upload to so plus one intelligence and then

637
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:32,580
And everything after a level of everything's like refilled, right? Yeah, you guys are refilled anyway as it is

638
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,140
so yeah

639
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,460
But let me find the

640
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:44,100
I'm gonna make sure I have child porn upload - you're making sure you have child porn uploaded. Nope

641
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:50,740
That's you and that I have to stop making that you have to stop making sure that you guys stop you guys stop

642
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:57,740
Not putting words in my mouth, but like, you know, just sort of mixing around the words that are there.

643
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,740
I'm not denying that they're there to make it seem like I'm a bad guy.

644
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,740
You want to put one word in your mouth, child.

645
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
Okay.

646
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:12,740
But yeah, you guys are all leveled up. You also all, again, you gain 25% of your Technoslime points.

647
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
Okay, do we get to round up?

648
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:20,980
And Patrick Yoda you get 50% because you chose Sentinel.

649
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,620
So that means your Technoslime points are now...

650
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,980
100.

651
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,980
Yeah, 102.

652
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,260
Oh, okay.

653
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,260
How much health do we gain?

654
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Oh yes, we have to do that as well.

655
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,220
So you guys are now technically level 6.

656
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,220
So, that's cool.

657
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,900
but roll you can you just have to hit the uh... okay

658
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,420

664
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,740

665
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,380

I wanna grind for my shit.

669
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,860
For you guys in your character sheets, hit your hit dice.

670
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
The hit dice button.

671
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,860
And whatever that is, just add that to your total HP.

672
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Cool.

673
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Where's it?

674
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
It's under hit points.

675
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,860
Four, bitch!

676
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,860

677
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,860
Nope, I saw that.

678
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
Come on, man. I'm right here.

679
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:45,860

680
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:57,580
I have three hit points total. Oh my god, he fell for it, guys. Yeah, whatever you need

681
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,980
to say, I guess, to me to keep yourselves entertained. And so, yeah, I mean...

682
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,980
It's your turn.

683
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
So what do you want to do?

684
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,980
It is?

685
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,980
Mm-hmm.

686
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,980
Mm-mm.

687
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
My apologies, sorry.

688
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Patrick Yoda, it's your turn.

689
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
How do you want to try to stop Jim?

690
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
That's what I asked this turn for.

691
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,980
So are we still-- what are we doing?

692
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
Are we still doing the-- what we were doing before?

693
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
Yeah, let's just kill Jim right now and just get--

694
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
What the fuck is going on?

695
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,980
I don't think we should kill him.

696
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,980
What did you do, Caleb?

697
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
It's none of your business, actually.

698
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,980
What were you doing?

699
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,980
Nothing.

700
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,980
I think he fell down.

701
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,980
I think he fell down.

702
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,980
I think he fell down.

703
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
I think he fell down.

704
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,980
I think he fell down.

705
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,980
I think he fell down.

706
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:33,180
kill him. What did you do Caleb? It's none of your business actually. What were you doing?

707
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,220
I think he fell down. I did not fall down. Caleb fell down. Okay I'm gonna be honest with

708
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,580
you guys, the door to my bedroom is broken. I asked Janna to turn off the TV and said

709
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,100
she closed the door and now I'm locked in here so I had her roll a beer under the door

710
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:54,740
and it was very loud. It was very loud on my floor. So are you guys happy now? Wait how

711
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,660
How did you get a beer under the door?

712
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,940
My door is hung poorly and there's a giant gap in the bottom.

713
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,940
You have to know just everything.

714
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,940
I didn't, I've seen it before.

715
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,940
What about when you have to go to the bathroom?

716
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,940
Great, and now the fans know. I guess I'm just gonna fucking not pee, cause I'm stuck.

717
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,940
Okay.

718
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,940
You should kill Jim.

719
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,940
Yeah, so I think what I'm gonna do to Jim...

720
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Oh, read his mind.

721
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,940
Uh-huh. I'm gonna read his mind.

722
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,540
Wait, wait, wait. You should read his mind after I upload porn to it.

723
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,540
I'm gonna read it before. No, because I'm gonna read it before.

724
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,540
He might save me some trouble. There might already be child porn in his brain.

725
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Right. So I'm gonna read his mind.

726
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,540
Alright, so you wanna do Yoda's mind.

727
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,540
Vanilla Yoda's mind on our boy Jim. Dark Yoda's mind.

728
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,540
You wanna do dark Yoda's mind? Yes.

729
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,540
So for that, first you have to use the force. And I have an advantage.

730
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Because we snuck up on him, you said?

731
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:03,540
No, no, no. The advantage is that you're all going to get to go right now out of turn order before anything.

732
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,540
I thought we had an advantage.

733
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
I'll get an advantage for going.

734
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Just do your turn.

735
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:18,540
So yeah, you spend 8 Techno Slime points now, and you start charging up, and you have this Force abilities and your Dark Force abilities.

736
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:27,540
It's all happening around you. Now, for Yoda's mind, it costs 5 Technoslime points to do.

737
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,540
So, wait, so I took away 8, you said?

738
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Yeah, to get the dark Yoda's mind.

739
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Okay.

740
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:46,540
But now you have, now you're used to force. So you have the lightning shit you had before, you have the advantages on abilities that you had before.

741
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Okay.

742
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
it gives you that super power up.

743
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,540
Oh, so I have five techno slime points now.

744
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Yeah, but you have the ability to recharge it and you have used a force for,

745
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,540
let's see, how many turns?

746
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
So about five turns.

747
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
So you still have it for five turns.

748
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Yeah, that's going to do it. We're going to be fine.

749
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,540
Yeah, so your AC goes up by two, your movement speed is doubled,

750
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,540
you have all this, you can move shit with your mind now,

751
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
and you have lightning abilities.

752
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Okay.

753
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,540
So, but you're gonna use Yoda's Mind. Okay.

754
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,540
So, with Yoda's Mind, he has to resist this now.

755
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,540
And he can't.

756
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,540
No, he can resist.

757
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,540
Against your Wisdom save, let's see how he does.

758
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,540
And I roll a Wisdom?

759
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,540
No, it's just against your Wisdom save.

760
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,540
So, your Spell save, rather, which is 16.

761
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:51,540
he did beat you. No! But you still roll 3d8 and he takes half of that damage still.

762
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh. Because you still like tried to penetrate his mind. Penetrate? Come on.

763
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:05,540
You're rolling all these d8s individually? Alright, cool. Nice, yeah. So you did 7 damage to him.

764
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:19,420
the

765
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:32,380
your

766
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:39,460
I'm gonna do chill. Yeah, so first thing what you should do is roll a sleight of hand check to see if you can sneak the wire

767
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,340
Up to his brain

768
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,860
Okay, I rolled a 12

769
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:50,840
Okay, and that is going to be against his we don't have like a wireless fucking

770
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,460
There's no not a little tooth not for child porn. Oh, I

771
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,200
Guess that makes sense

772
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:06,260
Yeah, so that is against his his passive wisdom. Yeah his passive wisdom. Yeah, so he sees the wire coming

773
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:12,680
She's he's able to like stomp on it and sort of like send it back towards you. No my child born. I mean

774
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,820
that was

775
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,940
There's my wire dude

776
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:22,660
But yeah that that that costs you like 10 check no techno slime points

777
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,860
But I mean, it's also like a one-shot kill. So oh it was a good kill

778
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,900
Well when you upload child porn to somebody the gun city government immediately

779
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,160
Tracks down and swarms the person that would funny just kill

780
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,100
They would have been bad

781
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,260
Good maybe for me

782
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,300
Blotus you're up. It does mental prison. Does that involve an attack role?

783
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,580
No

784
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:58,300
Mental prison is it? No, it's a save. It's a save. Okay, so they have to make an intelligence saving throw

785
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:08,300
So your spell DC is 14, so he has to beat that to not get that.

786
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:14,300
Yeah, I'm going to continue the streak of just using new abilities and I'm just going to use Mental Prison on him.

787
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:19,300
Yeah, so that's 5 Technoslime points to do that. I should make that cost more.

788
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,300
Now that I've heard that, I'm going to be using it every single fight.

789
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,340
uh...

790
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,140
okay yeah he does

791
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,620
managed to uh...

792
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,300
uh... okay he does manage to beat it

793
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:38,780
but he still takes 5d10 psychic damage

794
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,540
alright

795
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,160
so he momentarily thinks he's like in a prison

796
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,620
yeah can i describe do i get to choose the prison? yeah describe it describe it

797
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,660
so he looks around and he's in

798
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,660
the familiar office

799
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,600
uh... because uh... he goes up to the front desk

800
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,740
he sees he sees a beautiful head of hair from the back

801
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,660
and he goes of him i love you any walks up

802
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:05,200
she turns around you know whose face it is

803
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,020
well no

804
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,660
it's the white house also she and then he screams and he takes thirty one day

805
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,460
pitch

806
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,740

Yet cuz I was like all just like first round like you guys saw Jim and just like tried to fuck him up and you

852
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,240
did

853
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,760
But now we're back to the top of the order. So Patrick Yoda, you're up. All right

854
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,000
So now we have to fight these three ninjas. Yeah

855
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,560
What colors are they? Yeah, they're yellow green and pink from what you can see

856
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:41,440
The pink one has like a bo staff of some kind and she has like sort of like a cartoonish

857
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,560
cartoonish looking like a

858
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:49,000
rocket like a little like bomb like it looks like a like a if you've played a

859
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,360
Enter the gungeon books like the little bomber gun in that

860
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,240
and then the green one is there and

861
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:10,760
And he doesn't have any weapons, but he's just like dripping green all the time and he just looks kind of nasty, even though you can looks like a ninja and he's just green, but you could be something's emanating out of him.

862
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:25,760
And then the yellow one has like her just also has nothing equipped to her that you can immediately tell but there's like kind of electricity crackling around her and she sort of like stands at the ready.

863
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
But yeah, that's a three that are there.

864
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,560
So yeah, what do you want to do, Patrick Yoda?

865
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,260
Patrick Yoda, you also used a force, which you have four more turns of now.

866
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:34,960
Oh, okay.

867
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,660
So you're super powerful right now.

868
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,060
There's a lot you can do.

869
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,060
All right, then I'm gonna...

870
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,960
So I roll with advantage?

871
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,060
Not for everything.

872
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,560
Okay.

873
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,860
Some of the things you can do, though, with...

874
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,760
Use the force is...

875
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,260
Hold on.

876
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,960
So yeah, with... Use the force...

877
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,960
Yeah, you can move objects though.

878
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,660
Like if that's kind of what you're asking and you have,

879
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,160
you can automatically move objects that are tiny or small.

880
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,440
If they're medium size, which is what these people are,

881
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,460
right, it's DC 10 generally,

882
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,340
but then like they're gonna resist to some extent.

883
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,160
But then also you have the ability to shoot lightning

884
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,360
out of your hands now and you can shoot lightning

885
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,280
with a phone set.

886
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,520
That's the first thing I'm fucking doing.

887
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,720
Okay, so you can also try to set it up

888
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,720
so that you line them all up for a dark lightning attack.

889
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,560
- Okay.

890
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,720
- Or you can do just a regular lightning attack.

891
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,920
- Okay, all right, so I'm trying to set them all up.

892
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,320
I say, "Hey, conga line!"

893
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,120
(laughing)

894
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,400
- Yeah, I'll let you try it.

895
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,320
I'll literally let you try a persuasion check.

896
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,720
- Okay. - To see.

897
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,720
- 14.

898
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,720
- No, yeah.

899
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,960
If you got a crit, I would have absolutely let that happen.

900
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,400
That would have been very funny.

901
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,240
Okay.

902
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,280
So yeah, you can still,

903
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,520
So you have like 60 feet of movement though, so you can pretty easily at least get a couple of them in a line

904
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,380
Obviously, well, okay 60 feet. What if I just went right here?

905
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,200
Because are these two in a line?

906
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,080
Yeah, they're about yeah, cuz if you turn over that's five feet. That's what

907
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,840
You can get the pink and the yell in the back. They are just moving everything around on this map

908
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,680
Okay, okay. I move right here

909
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,960
Okay, and then I shoot lightning

910
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:36,960
in

911
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Describe your dark lightning as I roll.

912
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Um, I have...

913
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,960
So, I run over to that spot.

914
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,960
And then I go...

915
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Wait, how do I... How should I find out that I have it?

916
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,960
You're not even just running, you're doing the force run in Battlefront 2.

917
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,960
Like, kinda shit.

918
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,960
Yeah, so I'm just like...

919
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,960
Yeah, you're like bounding over there.

920
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
and uh...

921
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,380
i trip over

922
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,520
these cheese poofs here

923
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,960
there's some scattered snacks on the ground and you definitely dodge out of the

924
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,720
way of milk duds but the cheese poofs get you for sure. I get the cheese poofs

925
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,760
and then i roll on the ground and i get up because i stub my toe on them

926
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,440
i get up so angry

927
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,600
that i shoot brown lightning out of my fingers

928
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,280
uh... when they see that it's brown their first reaction instead of dodging it is to go

929
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,280
Oh

930
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:40,940
But yeah now they're going to roll some do some DX. All right, they're pretty they're pretty dexterous, but let's see

931
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,960
You're not

932
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,960
Okay. Yeah, okay, and then I mean they still take half damage. So even if they yeah

933
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,720
They both like are able to like get out of the way of like the largest part of the blast, but they still take

934
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:03,060
You know half damage so roll 8d6. Okay, so just forward slash our 8d6 and then half of that

935
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,880
Well, I can't can I do it my way you could do it your way if you want to roll each one at once cuz it's a

936
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,300
Little fun for you. I mean you guys are now where'd you guys go on the map?

937
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,620
I don't know where you are on the map anymore. Oh

938
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,640
They ran away blowtoss. I didn't really Johnson. Where are you guys on the map?

939
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,440
Someone disappeared I promise I did not move us

940
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,440
What did you do Pat?

941
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,880
I disappeared you.

942
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:34,880
Where did you put me?

943
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,940
Are we under Patrick?

944
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,640
I don't know where you guys are.

945
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,040
I'll get your tokens back I guess.

946
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,680
What happened?

947
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,040
Nope, he's back.

948
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,600
You're a bitch.

949
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,840
What is going on?

950
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
How do you like it?

951
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,100
(laughing)

952
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,680
God damn it.

953
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,320
All right, let me get you guys back there.

954
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,020
You guys didn't delete Sullivan, did you?

955
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,320
- No, he's still there.

956
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,320
- Okay, good, he's just freaking out.

957
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,200
(laughing)

958
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
- Oh, where'd they go?

959
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,040
Oh my God!

960
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,920
I can't do shit!

961
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,320
- All right, you're back.

962
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Okay, cool.

963
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,160
So yeah, they still take 16 damage.

964
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:28,160
I got a 31. Yeah, they take half damage. Oh, right, right.

965
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,160
So they take 16 and you still have your bonus action that you can do.

966
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,160
Should I just shoot more lightning? If you want to.

967
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,160
Alright, I'm going to do that again. Yeah, go for it.

968
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,160
28. No, no, it would be...

969
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,160
Oh yeah, shit, I guess we gave you two attacks. That's crazy, why'd I do that?

970
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,960
Um, yeah, so, uh, yeah, they take 14, uh, from that as well.

971
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,660
Um, so yeah, they're just like getting like, they're like, you're like,

972
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,660
*mimics lightning*

973
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,660
And you're just like completely fucking them up.

974
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,160
Um, and now you also still have a bonus action for more lightning damage.

975
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,660
Uh...

976
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,660
I have more, I have another attack?

977
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,660
Yes.

978
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,160
Oh my god, dude.

979
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,660
You guys are crazy strong now.

980
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,660
31.

981
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,660
Well, not that one, not, not that, that much attack.

982
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,660
You have like a bonus action you can do.

983
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,160
Oh.

984
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,160
which is so basically it's like you did your two attack actions

985
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,160
and so you have a little extra action you can do that you can see here in the sheet

986
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:27,160
it's a 2d6 as a bonus action. That doesn't change even with dark lightning

987
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Ok, I think I'm going to roll, so I can roll 2d6 for lightning

988
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,160
Yeah, just roll 2d6, yeah. 4. 4. Ok, yeah, so they're only going to take

989
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,160
two of that. So you did, I mean you just did 32 damage

990
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,160
so, or, it's not bad, 32, 33 damage. 32,

991
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:57,120
the

992
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:04,120
back to

993
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,320
next

994
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,320
in our turn order though

995
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,700
is uh... the yellow one

996
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,380
so after getting like fucking fucked up by that shit

997
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,080
uh... she sort of like uh... real brief

998
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,580

00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,680
recruits

1000
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,120
and uh...

1001
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,880
jumps just like i runs over here

1002
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,000

1003
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,040
and she opened you see you see like

00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,960
uh... uh... out of the top of her ninja

1005
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,880
visor

1006
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,360
you hear like a

1007
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,040
like a loud high-pitched scream and like these like sonic waves coming out of it

1008
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,100
uh...

1009
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,560

00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,760
uh...

1022
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,480
so she does

1023
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,680
uh... okay

1024
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,440
array

1025
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,480
doing the damage from that

1026
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,480
uh... hope shit when i saw

1027
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,180
that wasn't even before you know how much it was damaged it does

1028
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,600
yeah that's basically how much it is information

1029
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,680
okay cool

1030
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:38,960
uh... yes holden takes six points of damage so he's on the four h_p_

1031
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,280
uh...

1032
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,080
and now

1033
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,460
she's going to uh...

1034
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,360
uh... after she does that

1035
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,840
Sullivan also has like a yellow mark that appears on him,

1036
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,480
like some sort of like yellow smudge.

1037
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,480
He's like, "Ah, ha! You can't get it off!"

1038
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,360
And then she's going to...

1039
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,600
suddenly like she's gonna like kind of vanish for a second,

1040
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,080
and then appear like on the other side of you guys,

1041
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,960
and you're all spinning in place like cartoons.

1042
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:15,600
And like she moves so fast through you guys that you're all spinning in place.

1043
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:23,100
And you're all basically dizzy and she now has advantage.

1044
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,600
Anybody has advantage on attacks against you guys for one round.

1045
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:32,600
And now she's going to do her sonic thing again with advantage.

1046
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,600
And probably, possibly kill Sullivan.

1047
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,600
What? No.

1048
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Yeah, she hits all of you guys.

1049
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,800
uh, and nice. Okay.

1050
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,800
And she has another six damage.

1051
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,000
Uh, uh, just six damage to you.

1052
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,900
Three, um, Sullivan blow toss and re William Johnson.

1053
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,000
So the sonic thing comes out and like pierces your ears and like

1054
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,100
shakes your head.

1055
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,600
Just feels crazy.

1056
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,100
I'm solving just head and Sullivan just like passes out.

1057
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,800
He's just like on the ground passed out.

1058
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,200
He's gonna have to start rolling for him.

1059
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,500
Can we throw?

1060
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:16,500
So can we throw Sullivan under a table or something?

1061
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Yeah absolutely.

1062
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,500
I'll let you guys deal with that so it doesn't become an escort mission.

1063
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:30,500
But yeah now it is Ray William Johnson's turn.

1064
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,500
Okay.

1065
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:40,500
I'm going to attack the yellow ninja.

1066
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Mm-hmm.

1067
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,500
Mm-hmm.

1068
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,500
Actually, you know what?

1069
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
Maybe I'll throw--

1070
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,500
I might throw my sexual grenade in between the green and purple ninjas.

1071
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,500
Nice.

1072
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

1073
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
All right, do it.

1074
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,500
Right here.

1075
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,500
Well, I can't.

1076
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
You can just hold it down like that.

1077
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Yeah, there you go.

1078
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Perfect.

1079
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
All right.

1080
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,500
Yeah, that works.

1081
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
I rolled a hit of 16.

1082
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,500
That hits both of them.

1083
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:13,860
both

1084
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,860
nasty ooze and lights em a fire. That also costs you, how many Technoslime points is

1085
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:24,460
that for you, is that two I think? Because it's like sort of like one of your base attacks.

1086
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:31,460
I think I gave it two. Let me see. It's either two or three. Three. Three? Okay. Yeah, but

1087
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:38,380
yeah the pink one's not looking too good after that. Yes! So, yeah, you still have another

1088
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:45,380
attack to and your movement. I'm gonna just do it again. Yeah. Yep. 14 that time. It doesn't

1089
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:51,220
hit this time. Fuck you! Yep, alright. So this time they just manage to get out of the

1090
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,740
way. They kind of know what to expect. Alright, then I'm gonna move over here and hide behind

1091
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:01,300
the mountain dew. Wait, bring Sullivan with you. I bring Sullivan with me. Yeah, yeah,

1092
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,460
you run. I'll let you pick up Sullivan. He's pretty light. And just run over with him. Just

1093
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,100
pick 'em up by his leg.

1094
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,100
Yeah, just drag him.

1095
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,820
He's banging his head against, like, controllers

1096
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,420
that are scattered on the ground.

1097
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,500
Palming his head like a basketball.

1098
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
Yeah.

1099
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,580
I'm pulling him, like, by his, like, upper lip,

1100
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,340
like, all the way.

1101
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,980
He's having a sense, memory, in his, like,

1102
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,820
passed-out state of a terrible bullying experience

1103
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,300
that, like, he went through.

1104
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,620
Which was also me.

1105
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,660
Yeah, it was, like, also you.

1106
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:35,060
Yeah, we'll do Gun City Babies.

1107
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,740
you all went to preschool together

1108
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,740
uh... yet so now it is

1109
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:43,740
the uh...

1110
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,260
the uh...

1111
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:46,720
pink ones turn

1112
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,900
and uh...

1113
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,900
they're going to

1114
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:52,700
turn into some sort of weird gaseous mist

1115
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,900
we're gonna go home

1116
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,500
and uh...

1117
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,540
i've learned to say they're going to go home

1118
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,100
that's not what i said

1119
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,340
said they're going to do it and it is going to turn into a gash

1120
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:07,020
and uh...

1121
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,400
float like over here

1122
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,500
and then reform

1123
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:15,220
and then shoot at you blowtoss with their like weird little bomber gun and like

1124
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,260
he's like damn it

1125
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,220
pink sparkles come out

1126
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,700
of it when when

1127
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,100
she shoots it

1128
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,620
and yeah it doesn't hit you

1129
01:04:22,620 --> 01:04:24,180
uh... I knew it

1130
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,980
and she's gonna try to shoot you one more time again with that

1131
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,020
oh no actually

1132
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:29,620
you know it would be more fun

1133
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,220
Is if she does something cooler like

1134
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:39,140
Yeah, she does she starts to like convulse sort of what you saw when you saw the blue ninja do this back in the day

1135
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,100
and these like

1136
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:48,260
Like crazy like lines come out of her back almost like tentacles run up to wrap you blow toss

1137
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,700
enroll a

1138
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
DC roll a deck safe

1139
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,260
Okay

1140
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:57,480
16.

1141
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,900
Nice, yeah.

1142
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,300
Okay, these things try to wrap around you, but you remember seeing Patrick go to deal with that last time,

1143
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,900
so you're able to like get out of the way of it.

1144
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,220
Um, and now it's your turn, Blowtoss.

1145
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:10,500
All right, so the only ninja that hasn't gone yet is the green one, right?

1146
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,180
That's the Mountain Dew ninja.

1147
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,220
It's a Baha Blast ninja.

1148
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,460
I'm gonna run up right next to him, and since I get advantage and extra damage against people

1149
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:26,500
who haven't gone yet, so I'm gonna use my dual pipes.

1150
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:41,500
is

1151
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,220
That's not true. The green one got hit by a sexual grenade by Rueben Johnson.

1152
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:44,720
Oh, okay.

1153
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,820
You did pink and yellow.

1154
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:51,900
But I- but because I hit- any hit I- I score against a surprise creature, it counts as a critical.

1155
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,600
Mm-hmm.

1156
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Yeah, so do I roll damage twice? Is that it?

1157
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,920
Um...

1158
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,020
Yeah, just count it twice, whatever you roll. We can just do that.

1159
01:05:59,020 --> 01:05:59,800
20.

1160
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,200
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

1161
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,300
That's the highest possible damage, I think.

1162
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:08,500
Oh shit, we're gonna count that twice. You just hit 40 damage.

1163
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,000
Yeah.

1164
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,500
Yeah.

1165
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,000
Maybe.

1166
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:17,060
So this guy just like hasn't moved and like just got burned a bit by ray william johnson, which you did 13 damage to them. Jesus

1167
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,940
Yeah, and you just like start

1168
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,980
Like beating them senseless

1169
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:28,260
Um, and they do not look good. I got another like shit. Yeah, go for it. I'm gonna do it again

1170
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,880
26 that hits

1171
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:36,820
14 times 228 damage. Yeah, you just keep uh, oh no, it's not crit this time. I think right because

1172
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,460
Oh, no any oh, right. You're right. Yeah

1173
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,980
Fuck yeah, you just like brutalized this guy.

1174
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,980
He's more or less out of commission.

1175
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,060
Like like it's going to be his turn, but I don't know what

1176
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,180
he's going to be able to do.

1177
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,480
So yeah, it is.

1178
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,680
Freaking cry on me.

1179
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,180
Yeah, and he is just like a mess.

1180
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:02,560
He looks like he's been beaten into a pulp and you watch him

1181
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,580
slowly melt into himself

1182
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:11,360
and turn into like some sort of like slime puddle

1183
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,600
uh...

1184
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,960
and uh...

1185
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,800
uh... he's able and uh...

1186
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,500
you start to sink into the ground

1187
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,320
uh...

1188
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,600
blow toss

1189
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,520
uh... and he moves away as a puddle

1190
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,880
like past you

1191
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,720
uh... and turns back

1192
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,040
and uh... uh...

1193
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,200
uh... you blow toss you're going to be able to move next turn you're like stuck in this like puddle

1194
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,920
uh... but otherwise he's gonna try to you

1195
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,040
uh... with advantage

1196
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,720
and we did you is you can go

1197
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,720
he's really just concerned to you with

1198
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,100
out of his visor similar to the pink one

1199
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,840
is gonna shoot something out of your

1200
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,760
so the l one except it's gonna be like

1201
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,480
with it

1202
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,260
i think this green slime vomiting out of his ninja hood

1203
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,720
uh... c_e_o_ he does

1204
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,000
he is crying on the end of it

1205
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,920
you're not crying

1206
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,960
he's crying what's going on here i a he's crying

1207
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,840
you're right he was crying

1208
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,080
and he just said that

1209
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,760
what a fucking baby

1210
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,120
you can't even cry out loud

1211
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,480
and uh... yeah that's all he's able to do he's pretty fucked up

1212
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,280
so we're back to the top of the order

1213
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:22,040
aka Sullivan's turd he has to roll a death saving throw

1214
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,500
oh he's dead?

1215
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:28,320
he's getting there it's one failure. Is this like the third time he's been dead this campaign?

1216
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,280
yeah

1217
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:34,440
yeah pretty much. God he's unlucky bro. He just has to sit in a backpack

1218
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,800
yeah yeah you there's a you can find out what it's all

1219
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,680
you can find a way to solve for this i would love to know what what you do to

1220
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:45,200
protect yeah we gotta keep in like a safe or something yeah

1221
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,640
so solvent is like inching towards uh... uh...

1222
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,560
doom

1223
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:54,240
to be fair this this solvent almost death is the first one that like isn't

1224
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,780
our faults that we did not on purpose i don't remember what the other answer

1225
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:02,880
yeah uh... and it is your turn patrick you know

1226
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:05,280
uh... this little boy

1227
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,000
yeah i'm gonna go on the hill sullivan

1228
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,380
you so far away though

1229
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:13,400
yet but i have jet i'd speedy a sixty movement so you're here

1230
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:17,900
pretty good yet because i have exactly fifty feet some ago there and then i'm

1231
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,440
just gonna

1232
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,140
my fort my four skin

1233
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,240
is uh... better now right

1234
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,840
now i know you didn't get the force can upgrade it's still good though

1235
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,960
uh... but

1236
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,160
but you do risk obviously

1237
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,760
your force can upgrade allows you to trap enemies

1238
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,400
and deal damage to them under the force can and not trap you

1239
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,440
well you'll you

1240
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,280
but this one just traps you heels you right now

1241
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,360
okay

1242
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,880
uh... and i can use it on sullivan

1243
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,480
you can use on solving you can make it so that it doesn't get really johnson

1244
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,460
and it's like just the very tip of it

1245
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,900
on sullivan and like everything else is just like a little bit of sullivan a

1246
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:56,400
bite of my hoagie

1247
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,800
Well, that counts as food, so that would heal him, right?

1248
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,200
I would let you do that, but then your hoagie would lose a little power, probably.

1249
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:09,800
What if I give Sullivan the Mike Pence coin?

1250
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,400
It's psychic damage, instantly.

1251
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,400
Ah, fuck.

1252
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:21,000
Alright, then I'll do... then I'm focusing on healing Sullivan.

1253
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:28,600
Okay, yeah. Um, so that costs techno slime points wise to three,

1254
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,600
right? Three, I believe for foreskin. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and so

1255
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,360
yeah, you create this like giant, like thing of this giant,

1256
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,500
you know, your giant foreskin sort of thing you generate. And

1257
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:45,680
you basically did it. So it's just like around here, more or

1258
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:52,440
less. So for so solvent's fine. Now he's healing. You can roll

1259
01:10:52,440 --> 01:11:07,440
the

1260
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:13,800
at seven. Yeah he's fine he's like... and Ray William Johnson you're just still holding

1261
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:23,800
onto his lip. He's just like "you let go of my lip! Let go of my lip!" Yeah and it is now

1262
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:32,880
whose turn is it? It is the Yellow Ninja's turn. The Yellow Ninja is gonna go after

1263
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:55,400
you

1264
01:11:55,400 --> 01:12:10,320
the

1265
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,420
I thought it was you for a second. I thought he said Ray.

1266
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,420
No. Yeah.

1267
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:18,420
Damn you look cool as hell now.

1268
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,420
Very similar words.

1269
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,120
She attacks you again and she does hit again.

1270
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,120
Ugh.

1271
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
And uh.

1272
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,120
Stop.

1273
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,120
That does 10 damage to you.

1274
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,120
And now you have like more yellow marks.

1275
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,120
Hard to know what's happening there.

1276
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,120
What do they look like?

1277
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,120
Damn I look even cooler now.

1278
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,320
(laughing)

1279
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,680
They look like when a kid smudges crayon on something.

1280
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,480
- Okay, I wipe them off then.

1281
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,320
- You try, you can't wipe them off.

1282
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:55,840
And now it is Ray William Johnson's turn.

1283
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,200
- Okay.

1284
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,720
- Oh, it's my turn?

1285
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,560
- Yeah.

1286
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,400
(laughing)

1287
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,480
- No, don't do this to me.

1288
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:03,240
- I'm gonna throw my nade again, dude.

1289
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,640
I think I have enough, Techno.

1290
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,480
- Yeah.

1291
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,080
- I'm gonna throw my grenade between,

1292
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,080
This time between the yellow and the pink.

1293
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,080
Yeah, go for it.

1294
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Alright, I'm rolling...11. God damn it!

1295
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,080
Okay, yeah, it's a dud.

1296
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,080
It just like...

1297
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,080
It just like plops there.

1298
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,080
And just like leaks.

1299
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,080
It just stays there for the rest of the fight.

1300
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,080
Just a nut sack on the ground.

1301
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,080
Yeah. Okay.

1302
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
You can do it again.

1303
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,080
Yeah, I do it again.

1304
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
27. Yeah, that hits.

1305
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,080

Um, and, uh, the green guy is just out of commission.

1311
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,280
He just falls to the ground.

1312
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
He's done.

1313
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,840
We took down the green goblin.

01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,080

01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,180
with my friends

1366
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:34,100
Yeah at that, uh point, um with two of them knocked out

1367
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:36,820
Um, the yellow one kind of scurries over to them

1368
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:41,780
and sort of gets them to like move barely and they start to stack on top of each

1369
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,660
other like you saw the red one and blue one do before

1370
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,980
and they start to do Naruto ninja signs and shit

1371
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:57,940
and they vanish and they're gone and uh in their place

1372
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:05,060
is a plate with a big pile of jello on it and what looks like a note

1373
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:12,580
inside of it. Yum! I threw the jello away. No!

1374
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:22,660
There's no trash cans here. What the hell man. You look at the note in the jello and it says

1375
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:27,660
from Jim to Dwight, a parting gift.

1376
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:36,500
And then suddenly the ground around you begins to shake

1377
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:39,340
and you look up at the siding of the massive Xbox you're in

1378
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,260
and it begins to, 'cause you start to see it

1379
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,020
like sort of shivering and shaking

1380
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,980
and you hear like the plastic,

1381
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:47,620
the very hard plastic shaking.

1382
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,260
You start to see like the shelves that are up

1383
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,860
that have like snacks on them

1384
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,140
and the mom bot is like freaking out.

1385
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,340
Oreos and Snickers and Mars bars and Nerds

1386
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,040
are falling from the sky in this gamer's paradise.

1387
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,620
The fridge, the giant fridge in the back is wobbling around.

1388
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,420
And then you start to see from behind the Xbox,

1389
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:07,780
pieces of stone and rock that were made of this land cave

1390
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,400
back where the Tamagotchis found it, falling to the ground.

1391
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,500
You're all struggling to keep your balance.

1392
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,600
The wing gamer's like, he blew up the cave.

1393
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,540
It's gonna collapse.

1394
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,660
You must run.

1395
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,300
i'll protect my people

1396
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,060
and he just puts on a v_r_ headset and then a rock crushes him

1397
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:26,660
not

1398
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,780
uh...

1399
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:33,260
but yeah so the can we have seen do we have the golden penguin

1400
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,740
uh... yeah you can snatch it okay yet will that's the first thing we do is we

1401
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,160
take the golden penguin

1402
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,740
the second thing i do is i teleport out of the case

1403
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,980
me too i tell him that i grabbed his leg

1404
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,780
and me and so i grabbed cameron's layers float us is lakes

1405
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:49,860
okay yeah so uh...

1406
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:53,940
uh... you only move thirty feet at a time you teleport so the way this works

1407
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:59,280
is i teleport thirty feet forward like a hundred times

1408
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,180
i just run up to where they just teleported to

1409
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,340
i kinda had a grasp of it

1410
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:05,540
yeah cause you have the same move speed too

1411
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,260
so it takes the same amount of time

1412
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:11,420
you guys start by running out of the cave though oh no it's a whole

1413
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,000
sequence to get out of this cave

1414
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,100
uh oh

1415
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,220
it's not going to be easy

1416
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,460
is it is collapsing around you this is not easy

1417
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,540
yet

1418
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,780
uh...

1419
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,780
so you guys uh...

1420
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:28,620
teleport out of their uh... uh...

1421
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:30,600
uh... pretty easily

1422
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,520
uh... and you end up in the uh...

1423
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,740
the land cave room over here

1424
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:36,580
uh...

1425
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,460
where it's like this massive beautiful waterfall

1426
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:44,300
uh... you start to see like these like wires and monitors flying around all

1427
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:48,620
these gamers. Some of them are still trying to game even while the whole place is collapsing

1428
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:57,660
around them. While that's happening, I just take an Xbox from one of the gamers. Yeah,

1429
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:07,020
he doesn't even notice that he took the Xbox and his game stopped working. He's still clicking.

1430
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:14,660
You see an Xbox 360 whiz by, you hear a headshot echo as it connects with the skull of another

1431
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,980
gamer, like it's going crazy.

1432
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:20,700
And then you guys see a bunch of monitors falling.

1433
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:25,620
All of you roll dexterity check to see how you do on dodging this shit.

1434
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:26,620
Holy shit.

1435
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:27,620
Oh no, eight.

1436
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:28,620
Okay.

1437
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,620
Okay.

1438
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:30,620
17, yeah!

1439
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,620
Guys, we beat it!

1440
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,620
Yeah!

1441
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,620
Guys, we beat it!

1442
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,620
Patrick Yoda, an Xbox falls on you,

1443
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:42,620
and you're going to be moving slower as you try to run away from this cave,

1444
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,620
and also you have to get this Xbox off of you.

1445
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:50,620
It's just like a very big Xbox that is too big for Patrick Yoda.

1446
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:56,620
A blowtoss, you just get knocked in the head by a Wavebird controller.

1447
01:20:56,620 --> 01:21:00,620
Ray William Johnson, you find a way to just deftly move ahead,

1448
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:03,020
head and now you're kind of further ahead in the cave

1449
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:07,020
carrying Sullivan and the penguin Patrick Yoda. How are

1450
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,220
you going to get this Xbox off to you the force? Yeah, you

1451
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,520
can sort of blast it off of you using the force. Yeah. That's

1452
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,720
very easy because it's a tiny thing. so you're able to do

1453
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,720
that and move ahead your head's kind of ringing a bit as this

1454
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,620
happens though. Okay. Yeah blow toss. You're able to catch up

1455
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:25,520
though fairly easily and as you move out of this waterfall

1456
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,620
part of the cave the floor beneath you collapses all of

1457
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:49,620
roll

1458
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,500
surprised you as you fell to the ground back into the labyrinth where Gaben was.

1459
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,300
Gaben is now just spinning in place and just going

1460
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,380
"Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah" like freaking out.

1461
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:04,900
You see the lava and the slime from before and like the acid, the sand

1462
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,860
are just like sort of like shifting around. This is almost like a tilt-a-world

1463
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:12,100
effect. So yeah, lava is like coming at you guys.

1464
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:17,540
You're able to get around most of it. At this point, your combined damage

1465
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:34,540
and

1466
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:38,100
like a giant dome up there, the elevator is fucking not working.

1467
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,020
How are you gonna scale the walls, how are you gonna get out of here?

1468
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:42,020
What's your plan?

1469
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,780
How tall is the wall?

1470
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,500
I pressed the long button on my keyboard.

1471
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
Tall is like 50 feet.

1472
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,580
I jump on Sullivan's back because he's a frog.

1473
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,580
And I say...

1474
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:53,580
Jump, froggy, jump!

1475
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:57,580
I can't, I'm not good at jumping, I was never good at jumping!

1476
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:01,540
You're a fucking frog for Christ's sake, jump me out of here!

1477
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,160
i must say excuse for a frog i know

1478
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,340
i've been told this before right well i throw sullivan up the wall

1479
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,780
i said

1480
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,140
okay it that you're you're gonna try to a longboard thing we get ready with the

1481
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:19,020
night i a hit the white button on my hoverboard so everyone can get on it

1482
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:21,900
okay yeah i like that it just gets really wide

1483
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:22,740
uh...

1484
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:25,960
you have to i think it's a role in a place like to try to catch all of them

1485
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:32,960
of

1486
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,160
- Yeah, go for it. I'll let you try. - 40 feet is pretty much quite a bit, right?

1487
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,160
- It's pretty hard. Let's see what you do.

1488
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,460
- Nope. - Five.

1489
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,460
- Yeah. - All right.

1490
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,660
- Just like it's tossed like 15 feet.

1491
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,660
He takes... - No, no, we catch him. We catch him!

1492
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:51,460
- I'll let Blowtoss roll an Athletics check to see if he can catch Sullivan.

1493
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,460
- He kills Sullivan again. - 11.

1494
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,160
- Just not enough, man. He just tossed him.

1495
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,160
Like...

1496
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,860
- Okay, he only takes two damage this time. He's okay.

1497
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:05,860
But yeah, you just tried, you just both missed catching him completely.

1498
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:10,860
In my brain, I'm coming up, my character's coming up with like a new sport when I get through all of this.

1499
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,860
Where someone is like a ball involved.

1500
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:14,860
Yeah.

1501
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:22,860
But yeah, so I'll let you try to fly up with the hoverboard, Patrick Yoda.

1502
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:27,860
As you do though, it's sort of like a bullet hell as rocks are falling down.

1503
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:42,380
all

1504
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,380
animal handling and I got an A.

1505
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:48,080
Okay, yeah, you are getting like knocked back a little bit.

1506
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,380
You guys take like five more damage from that.

1507
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:54,880
You can try again though to get up there.

1508
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:55,720
I'll let you try that again,

1509
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,680
or you guys can come up with something else.

1510
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,160
- How high up are we on the longboard right now?

1511
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,600
- Yeah, you guys are about 20 feet.

1512
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,440
You have got to teleport the rest of the 30 feet.

1513
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,260
- Okay, I teleport the rest of the 30 feet.

1514
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,680
- Hey, it's not a long, it's a wide hoverboard.

1515
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,520
It's not a longboard.

1516
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,280
- I teleport the remaining 30 feet.

1517
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,360
- You teleport, you all manage to grab the ledge

1518
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:13,020
right when you appear and climb up.

1519
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,020
That was a good move. That was a good move, Blotas.

1520
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,020
Blotas is able to teleport you all up.

1521
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:22,020
And you're back over in the second room now.

1522
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:26,020
You're back on top of the building.

1523
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:30,020
I love that we get to see all the old stuff we drew on the map too.

1524
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:34,020
We wrote coins with a heart on this one.

1525
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,020
Yeah, you're able to...

1526
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:38,020
Oh wait, no, that said cousins.

1527
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,020
Oh.

1528
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:55,100
Yeah, you're able to like run and like to like look like aim for the bushes kind of thing

1529
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:59,500
jump off these these like weird buildings what you see are now all the apartments inside

1530
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,900
are destroyed you see some of the gamers have like their heads caved in from the things

1531
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:08,620
collapsing around them you look beyond you pass the river and you just see that like it

1532
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:22,420
is

1533
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:26,980
the front entrance of the cave thoroughly beaten up and you appear at the entrance

1534
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:32,940
and the screen is getting fucking crazy

1535
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:42,620
you just have to take screenshots so that we can give these to people so they

1536
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:48,080
They could know why I stop in the middle of what I'm saying to say stop doing that

1537
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:58,600
So you guys now like sort of tumble outside the cave

1538
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:05,580
You're you're all very bruised battered you made it through though you didn't fail too many times

1539
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:11,020
But you lift your head up to notice that

1540
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:18,020
that

1541
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,020
Oh yeah, look at the map.

1542
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,020
Oh, we were in there for too long, weren't we?

1543
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:22,020
Our pass expired.

1544
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:23,020
Fuck!

1545
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,020
Oh no.

1546
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,020
Mm-hmm.

1547
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:29,620
And, uh, you see, uh, uh, uh, the King Gad.

1548
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:39,220
And he says, "You abused my trust, and now this cave is destroyed and your pass expired?"

1549
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,220
Um...

1550
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,020
"It was Pennsylvania Gym."

1551
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,020
Yeah.

1552
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,980
"Pennsylvania Gym did all of this, I swear!"

1553
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:48,820
you're under arrest.

1554
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,300
- Okay, we did a couple of the--

1555
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,900
- Literally, literally hook up the lie detector to us.

1556
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,580
It was Pennsylvania Jim who made us take too long

1557
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:57,620
and destroyed the cave.

1558
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,860
- Here, you have to take the lie detector test first.

1559
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,140
Put this wire in the back of your head.

1560
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,400
(laughing)

1561
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,340
- You see-- - We gotta test it.

1562
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:10,780
- The wires, hissing wire things

1563
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,780
are now like kind of crushed by the rock.

1564
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:17,120
You hear them like hiss and you turn your head over

1565
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,220
and you see three mopeds unattended.

1566
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,280
Pssst.

1567
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,820
- I think we should use the mopeds.

1568
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:34,640
- I say as loud as I can, what mopeds?

1569
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,800
- They turn their heads over and see the unattended mopeds

1570
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,920
and they start to make a move.

1571
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,360
- I just book it towards them.

1572
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,400
- Yeah, me too.

1573
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,200
- Okay, you guys get on the mopeds.

1574
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,520
These are all the mopeds, the Walmart kind of,

1575
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:50,840
they're a Walmart vehicles, they're mopeds.

1576
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,280
There's only, they only go max 30 miles an hour

1577
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,960
because they don't want anyone's stomach to get hurt.

1578
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,240
But you guys are able to start going

1579
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:02,160
and you hear the like Ken Bone cops are coming up behind you

1580
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,520
and you're riding down this crazy mountain,

1581
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,080
which leads us into our chase sequence.

1582
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,200
- Wait, whose moped is Sullivan on?

1583
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,400
- I was gonna let you guys decide.

1584
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,880
I was gonna let you guys decide.

1585
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:23,880
Okay, I tie him to the back of my moped like when married people tie cans to the back of their car.

1586
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,880
This is gonna die. He's gonna die.

1587
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,880
I do that first and then I put him on my moped.

1588
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,880
Alright, we're done with it? You wanna say a cool line at the end or no?

1589
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,880
Let the chase begin.

1590
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,880
Why don't you say it instead?

1591
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:44,880
Uh...

1592
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,080
Clean take.

1593
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,080
Let the chase...

1594
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,080
What?

1595
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,080
Hold on.

1596
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,080
I kind of messed it up anyway.

1597
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,080
I had like a weird crack in my voice.

1598
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,080
Are you ready?

1599
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,080
Let the chase...

1600
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,080
Chase...

1601
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,080
Begin!

1602
01:29:57,080 --> 01:29:58,080
There it is.

1603
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,080
Cool.

1604
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:00,080

1605
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,080
