1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
Wally Wankoff, the name on everyone's mind.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,560
There isn't a soul in the world who doesn't know him.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,400
He's the world's most feared and respected businessman, as well as its most successful.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,560
While Wankoff Enterprises has dipped into every vertical under the sun, and completely

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,840
crushed it too, there are three things Mr. Wankoff does better than just about anyone.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,240
Bombs, candy, and toilets.

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
When a brain-dead 19-year-old too stupid to torture cats as a kid unwraps a candy bar,

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,240
he's eating a wank off.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,280
When his grubby, candy-covered hands grips the console where he's remotely piloting

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,640
an MQ-9 Reaper over rural Pakistan, the bomb he's gonna drop is a wank off bomb.

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,760
Then when he remembers he has to shit because he has the "no-no" feeling going on, the

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,240
smartest man in the armed forces will sprint to the bathroom and just miss, planting a stinky

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:04,100
in a Wankoff toilet. Wankoff once said, "People will shit, eat candy, shit, and blow up the

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,760
only movie theater in the Basdarwada Valley for as long as they live." And so far, he's

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,480
been the most right man in the entire world, and justly rewarded for it.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,200
But it must be lonely at the top, or at least, Chucky Fuckit likes to imagine it is. Because

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,400
Because he's at the very bottom, a kind child with a good heart and without a penny to his

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,680
name, humble Chucky Fuckett just wants one thing in life.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,960
To meet his hero Wally Wankoff.

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,560
Surely an impossibility, right?

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
Well not quite.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,400
Because Wally Wankoff announced today that for the next week, in five of his Wankoff

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,000
Yummy Yums, his famous candy treat, there is a brown sticker with a QR code on it.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,960
The QR code, when scanned, takes you to a schizophrenic substack domain.

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
But with one of these stickers, a lucky child or adult can enter into Wally Wankoff's

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
factory, too, better known as the Crazy Playhouse of Indentured Servitude, where Wankoff says

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,880
he will, from among the winners, choose an heir to his fortune and company.

28
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,360
Wankoff is a notorious recluse, and the day he lets the winners into his factory would

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,440
be his first public appearance in over 20 years.

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,120
When he was last seen at a Panera, with a hood pulled over his head, a mask, and a cloaking

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,320
device, so no one could see him.

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,400
Wank-off mania is sweeping the planet.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,120
All over people were wanking it.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,740
Wanking it is the colloquial term for buying a wank-off chocolate bar.

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,200
From all walks of life, children, adults, the rich and the poor, the black and the white,

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,160
not Koreans though for some reason, but everybody else was wanking it.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,200
Day and night people were flooding candy stores and wanking it for all to see.

38
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Some would shop online and wank it there, others went mad, stealing wank off Yummy Yums, this

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,800
is known as jerking it, and not even bothering to wank.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,200
Businesses shut down for a week, schools were closing, prisoners even took the week off from

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,680
being locked up.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Everyone and I mean everyone wants those brown stickers.

43
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,320
So what chance does poor Chuckie Fuckit have?

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,040
Well, just as much as your eye if we were all so broke.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,500
But fate may have something else in store for little Fucken.

46
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,180
And while this is a story about Chucky Fucken, the poor sweet boy who works year-round as

47
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,920
a dog walker for the oldest, richest, weirdest guys in New York City, there are other characters

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,880
in our story who deserve the limelight all the same, for they too were lucky enough to

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,600
get a Wank Off Browns sticker.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:42,240
And so we zoom in to Shantyville, Illinois, where there's a little boy who might even

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,400
be more unfortunate than Mr. Chucky Fuckit.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Who is this little boy?

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Hello!

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,200
My name's Bibby!

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,880
And I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm not walking because both my legs are broken

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,720
permanently in casts.

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,520
I'm crushing up and down the sidewalk in this this small town and I'm yelling.

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Extra, extra, read all about it.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm an orphan.

60
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
I'm an orphan.

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
Extra, extra.

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
I got no family.

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,800
Ah, piss off you.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,720
And some random passerby just tries to trip you on your crutches.

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,360
Roll an acrobatics check.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Okay.

67
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
That's a 19.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Hell yeah.

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
Yeah, he tries to trip you.

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,320
What do you do?

71
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
How do you do this?

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:37,600
I deftly pivot on one of my crutches and I spin into the street to avoid the tripping.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Okay.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Whoa.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
So the only issue- Pretty cool, right?

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Yeah.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Pretty cool, yeah.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,960
Man's maneuver.

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,700
So while it is pretty cool, lo and behold, here comes a truck.

80
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
No avoiding this.

81
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,840
Let's see how much damage you take.

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,400
That is eight damage you take from this truck that is coming by.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:05,080
Okay, I take eight damage. I fly. I fly down the street. I get hit by the truck. I go flying and I smash into the wall.

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:13,080
A brick wall. And I go, I slide down. Like it goes like, as I slide down to the ground.

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,240
Yeah, you see a proprietor of the store you just slammed into go outside and go,

86
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,840
"Hey, are you doing okay, kid?" And starts picking you up and starting to brush you off.

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm so sorry I damaged your store, sir. I could work it off if you need to.

88
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,760
Oh, well, it's quite all right. We have a lot of children in debt who already work here.

89
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,560
Is there something I can get you, young man? Perhaps a hospital?

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,240
I've been to every hospital. They say they don't know what's wrong with me.

91
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,080
They don't know how to fix it. I've had broken legs and arms for six years. I'm 12 years old.

92
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,400
Oh, you look really young for your age.

93
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,440
That's good when you're older.

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
That's going to be good when you're older.

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,440
I'm shorter because I lost six vertebrae when I was seven years old.

96
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,520
Well, how'd that happen when you were seven?

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
A frisbee, sir.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,960
Knocked it right out of my spine.

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,240
Okay.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Well, look, I don't know if I can help you.

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
Um, you seem to be unfortunate.

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,240
There is one thing I I desire more than anything and he turns around he goes what?

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,200
What is it? Well besides finding out who my family is

105
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,900
Since I'm an orphan, right? I would really like to eat a delicious chocolate bar

106
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,020
Really had one in my life. Oh

107
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,920
well

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,960
This week Wankoff is giving away brown stickers

109
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,920
So you might get lucky in more than one way if you eat that white car. That sounds delightful

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:56,160
Yes, it is. Well, the only candy store in 5000 miles is right across the street. So you just got to walk across the road

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,440
Can you do it?

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:09,240
I I would like to I would like to take another I would like to try to find an alternate route

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,020
So I'm going back. I'm okay if I can get out of the street

114
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
it. I'm going through a back alley and I'm going to try and come around the back and

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,080
cross the train tracks that run through the town. Yeah, there's a back alley. As you walk

116
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,820
through the back alley, you see the guy who pushed you and you also see he has another

117
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,200
friend with him and a couple other friends. And the guy who pushed you goes, "That's him!

118
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,560
That's the one who didn't fall down when I tried to hurt him!" And the other guys sort

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,040
square up against you. Um, and so they start swinging at you. Um, one of them is going

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,520
to try to attack you. We're not even going to roll initiative here. Uh, let's see how

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,400
they do. Uh, that hits you. Okay. How much damage do I take? Let's find out. I'm a fiend

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,560
for damage. You take nine damage. He cool. He guts you with a knife. Uh, uh, and, uh,

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,200
truck. Yeah. Yeah. It's for trying to avoid me. Yeah. A moth flies out of the cut in my

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
my stomach.

125
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Yeah, and he's and they look at you and another one tries to

126
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,100
kick you now in the in the shins, which are already I think

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
in the dire Straits if I'm correct.

128
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,100
Yes, that hits you too.

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,700
All right.

130
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,800
How much are we talking here?

131
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
Let's find out guys.

132
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,700
Cam has a lot of HP and no AC.

133
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,400
Okay, that's 10 damage for you.

134
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,100
He just kicks you right in the shin your shin bends inwards

135
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,020
and you're sort of walking like a chicken now.

136
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,220
You don't look too hot.

137
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,260
- I'm running away like a chicken.

138
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm running- - Like a chicken too?

139
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,340
- Yeah, well, if I'm walking like a chicken,

140
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,900
I'm probably running like one too, right?

141
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,420
- Yeah, they're like, "Get back here!"

142
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,460
And they're trying to chase you,

143
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,600
but they're, for some incomprehensible reason,

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,340
a lot slower all of a sudden,

145
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,480
as they're running towards you

146
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,340
and you run out of the alley and you're safe and sound,

147
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,780
you're huffing and puffing.

148
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,540
You see across from the train tracks is the candy store.

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,940
Turns out you don't have to go across the road.

150
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,460
There's one across the train tracks too.

151
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,860
And that guy who said there's only one in 5,000 miles

152
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,180
is fucking crazy.

153
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,220
- Oh yeah.

154
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,380
- But you can go, the only way across

155
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,660
is across the train tracks.

156
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,340
- Okay, I take a step towards the train tracks.

157
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,860
- Okay, as you do, you hear,

158
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,940
(imitates train bell)

159
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,780
- A candy bell, oh boy!

160
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,360
(all laughing)

161
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
I better get over there fast!

162
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,260
And I'm going as fast as I can, which is not very fast.

163
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,380
Okay, yeah, the train speeds up as you go on top of the track.

164
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,220
Yeah.

165
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
And you see the guy who, uh...

166
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,460
I notice a shiny, beautiful penny on the train tracks.

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,780
Okay, yeah.

168
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,260
Let's have you roll... Let's just have you do a...

169
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Are you gonna try to avoid the train, or is she...

170
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,580
I don't see the train.

171
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,380
You don't see the train, that's true.

172
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,180
Okay, you're gonna add one gold.

173
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:13,020
Okay. And you're going to take... I'm gonna die. Yeah, what are you at HP wise? I'm at 13.

174
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,420
You're gonna take 18 damage. 18? Yeah.

175
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:28,100
Okay, I'm at negative... Okay, I'm unconscious. Okay, so you are unconscious.

176
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,220
Um, you see, all you see is blackness. You think this is it. This is how this is the end for Bibby, Bibby the orphan.

177
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:46,980
Uh, uh, and since this is a very playful intro we're doing, uh, you, uh, hear kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, and you're getting slapped in the face.

178
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:56,300
Uh, you're also, I want to say when I'm where I'm waking up, I, I, I woke up in a completely different town because I got stuck to the front of the train and I went all the way.

179
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,100
You are we woke up actually in Duluth Brooklyn.

180
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Oh, the Luth Brooklyn which is famous for their there's it's a town that only has one residence which is the giant iron dome in which wonka lives Wankoff lives.

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Yeah, who's that?

182
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Who's Wonka?

183
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,220
He's... I don't know who the fuck that is.

184
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,000
You're gonna cut that out.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,700
You take four damage from the slap, and you go unconscious again.

186
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,860
And then the guy shakes you again, and he gives you water.

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,220
He's like, "I don't know why I slapped you.

188
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,460
I saw it in movies."

189
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,860
And he's like, "Kid, kid, are you okay?"

190
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,860
And he starts...

191
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,780
He's holding a chocolate bar underneath your nose as he's doing it.

192
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,780
"Kid, kid, kid."

193
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
"Candy?

194
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,620
Is that candy for me?"

195
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,460
Uh, yeah, I guess it can be.

196
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
I smashed the candy.

197
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
I was just trying to wake you up.

198
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Okay.

199
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,740
Did you take a big bite out of it?

200
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,540
I take, I don't even unwrap the wrapper.

201
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,060
I take a huge bite and there's a, and then there's a loud sound like glass breaking and

202
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,500
then like a Looney Tune, one by one, all my teeth fall out because I bit onto a hard brown

203
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,660
sticker inside the wrapper.

204
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,660
That's right.

205
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,420
You got one of the brown stickers, baby.

206
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,420
You're the luckiest boy in the world

207
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,920
A brown sticker!

208
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,420
Oh this is great!

209
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I'm so happy I get to visit the factory!

210
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
I'll probably wake up...

211
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
...at the candy factory!

212
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,420
What?

213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
And we cut away...

214
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,420
...to a courthouse

215
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,420
where the world's foremost child lawyer is

216
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,420
He is a dapper little man

217
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,580
and there's nobody quite like him. Who is this little dapper boy? Yeah we're

218
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,340
looking at a kid he's about seven years old he's dressed in all white he looks

219
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,780
like he's wearing like a like a Colonel Sanders like costume mm-hmm like the

220
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,020
white hair and a white goatee but that's growing naturally on him. Yes. He saw

221
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,220
something really scary in it.

222
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,060
yeah so he's dressed it all white and he's in the courtroom he has a cigar and

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:16,340
there you know there's like ceiling fans like lazily spinning above course yeah I

224
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:23,300
guess he's in the middle of mm-hmm yeah there's okay yeah your honor Oh what you

225
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,740
gotta what you gotta understand in this case is the defendant he gestures to the

226
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
defendant.

227
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,180
So, yeah, go,

228
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,220
no, go.

229
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,220
This young man here,

230
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,140
he's as guilty as the day is

231
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,740
long.

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,020
And some of that is

233
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,860
I'm innocent. I'm innocent.

234
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,160
I swear I didn't know that there

235
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,340
was cookies in the cookie jar.

236
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,220
Even I just I I just

237
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,860
and then the judge goes now.

238
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,380
Now, settle down.

239
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,440
Let's let the handsome child

240
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
speak

241
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,940
and he looks good.

242
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,700
Of course, the call

243
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
to my time

244
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,140
Now, obviously, in cases such as this,

245
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,140
it's usually we're looking at a $5 fine, a slap on the wrist,

246
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,780
a promise to never do it again.

247
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,220
But in this case, I am, of course,

248
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,540
pushing for the death penalty.

249
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,220
You do firing squad, lethal injection, electric chair.

250
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,420
Take your pick.

251
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,020
Oh, well, I don't know.

252
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,820
This does seem like a not minor offense.

253
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,140
After all, it was just a cookie from a cookie jar.

254
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,820
and it was, after all, oatmeal raisin.

255
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,580
Not even a very good cookie.

256
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,720
- When asked initially, the defendant,

257
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
we asked the defendant who stole the cookies

258
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,280
from the cookie jar, was it you?

259
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,020
He said, "Couldn't be," which we learned was a lie.

260
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,660
- Well, I couldn't be me.

261
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,300
I was not in, I wasn't in the vicinity of the cookie jar.

262
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
- Irrelevant, you don't need to be near the cookies

263
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
to steal the cookies.

264
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
(yells)

265
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,780
Why don't we open up evidence?

266
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,340
Let's see these little cookies, see if the bite mark matches up with this kid.

267
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,140
Now that's a really good idea.

268
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,020
You're a really smart lawyer.

269
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,500
Thank you very much.

270
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,540
In addition to that, I'm seven years old.

271
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,380
I remember being a baby.

272
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,380
Yeah.

273
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,940
You see all the jury nodding like, "That's true.

274
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
That's true.

275
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
He does."

276
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,060
And so what we're going to do is, first, I want you to roll a persuasion on the jury

277
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,180
for your death penalty thing.

278
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,620
we'll resolve that after you open the evidence too.

279
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,620
Oh fuck.

280
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,620
Oh my god.

281
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
I don't know if this is going to work.

282
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
I got a 27.

283
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,860
Yeah, you got a 27.

284
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,580
So the jury is now at this point making daggers at this little boy.

285
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,460
But you're opening the evidence case too.

286
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,580
So what's in here?

287
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,220
You're comparing the bite marks from that oatmeal raisin cookie.

288
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,260
Yeah, so there's going to be, we've got like a VHS with grainy surveillance footage of

289
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,260
this kid.

290
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Yeah, right.

291
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,260
a cookie, there's cookies with bite marks, they're all like in ziplock bags.

292
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,460
And then there's evidence of this kid's bites into other things.

293
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,180
So there's like other stuff that this kid is eating, like a broccoli and like a single

294
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,140
lemon that he took a bite out of.

295
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,420
And there's also a chocolate bar in there.

296
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,300
Yeah, there's all this stuff in there.

297
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,980
And the grainy footage, you see the boy, it looks like the boy.

298
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,340
It's pretty clearly though, like you wearing a wig as the boy taking the cookie from the

299
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
cookie jar.

300
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,420
Yeah, I've got a shirt on that says defendant.

301
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,420
Yeah.

302
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,560
You wink at the camera, the judge goes, so charming.

303
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
You're charming.

304
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,300
Or is the, he's getting a little confused.

305
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Who can say?

306
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,140
We all know in a court of law, details are nothing.

307
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,380
It's the tone of the court.

308
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,740
E pluribus unum, I think.

309
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Yes.

310
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
Of course.

311
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,940
- Nothing. - And yeah, you have also this chocolate bar

312
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,380
in here. And you're gonna test it out on the boy. So you can see the defendant is on the

313
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,180
stand. He's shivering. You see his mother's crying. She's like, "I left out the worst

314
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,220
kinds of cookies and he still did it!" Like, she's in tears. Yeah, you're gonna bring

315
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,540
him the chocolate bar or what's the meaning here?

316
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,580
Yeah. So I'm gonna bring him the chocolate bar and say, "You, defendant, didn't catch

317
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,220
- I asked you to write your name, didn't ask.

318
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,420
(laughing)

319
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,980
I'm gonna unwrap this chocolate bar

320
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,920
and ask you to take a single bite of the chocolate bar.

321
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,900
- Okay, it's Silly Michael, but okay.

322
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,240
- Silly Michael?

323
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,380
- Silly Michael, that's me.

324
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,000
- I'm gonna look at his mom and give a big thumbs down.

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,700
(laughing)

326
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,960
- She just goes like, "Ugh."

327
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,820
- Sure, sure.

328
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,780
- And yeah, so he takes, he says,

329
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,300
"This is gonna absolve me, I'm sure of it."

330
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,500
And he goes to take a bite of the chocolate bar and he goes,

331
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,500
"Oh, there's something else in there."

332
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,540
And I would say you can notice pretty quickly

333
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,200
that it is the brown sticker,

334
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,980
but I am gonna have you roll a sleight of hand

335
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,300
to see if you could keep it.

336
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,140
- Yeah, hell yeah.

337
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm gonna sleight of hand.

338
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
I'm gonna try to steal it from him.

339
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,060
- Yeah, 13.

340
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay, so with the 13,

341
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,700
you're able to sort of like pocket it away

342
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,940
and the kid's like, "What was that?"

343
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,780
- Shut up.

344
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,640
works.

345
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,480
Guilty mouth. Well, I think we could all agree that it's we'll

346
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,400
never know exactly what happened in this case by by guns. I am

347
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
still of course pushing for the death penalty. And I got 27. So

348
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,160
you know, we're gonna torture this kid to death.

349
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,140
Yeah, you could do almost anything that is, you know,

350
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,560
allowed to be recorded.

351
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,960
And I'm gonna grab the judges gavel and Michelle court is

352
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,360
I couldn't I wouldn't say it any other way.

353
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Okay.

354
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
All right, everybody get the hell out of here.

355
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
No kid.

356
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
What are you doing later?

357
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,880
I got some we're trying to start a poker game up and you just sort of fades out from that

358
00:18:51,880 --> 00:19:07,640
and we move to a Thanksgiving dinner where the I guess the candy family is sitting sitting

359
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,400
happily at their yummy, delicious Thanksgiving table

360
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,400
in some nondescript, lovely John Hughes suburb.

361
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,960
And there's somebody there though,

362
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,040
who's always trying to cause a little bit of trouble.

363
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,140
He's a that uncle maybe at Thanksgiving.

364
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,140
Who is this guy?

365
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,480
- I'm John Candy.

366
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,040
(laughing)

367
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,200
I think this meal sucks, I won't eat candy.

368
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
You got it pretty good.

369
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
It's not bad.

370
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, you see your brother, your brother.

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
This turkey's dry.

372
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,160
Look, John.

373
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,040
Oh, very funny, John.

374
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,640
But look, we can't have candy for Thanksgiving.

375
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,000
We can have candy for Thanksgiving dessert.

376
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,080
Well, we're going to have a pumpkin pie.

377
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Fuck that.

378
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,400
I want to wank off.

379
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
No, you know you want to wank off.

380
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Oh, you want to wank.

381
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,560
Yeah, no candy not what are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about

382
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,500
You're the one who comes here and brings your attitude. You see his wife goes up behind him is like honey, honey. He's like

383
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,520
Do you have my candy in your purse I

384
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,540
God, I just want candy so bad. I hate this crap and you see

385
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:31,800
The kids at the table and they're just like why don't I go back? It's it the kids table. We don't want him sitting here

386
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,520
He ate all our food last year.

387
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,720
Yeah, John, we let you sit at the kids table and you ate all their food.

388
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,020
When we tried to take it away from you, you said finders keepers,

389
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,520
which didn't really add up.

390
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,820
That's a law.

391
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,020
It's not a law.

392
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,820
Yeah, it is.

393
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,320
You sound like that lawyer I just heard about.

394
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,420
Look, let's just sit down.

395
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,620
Let's just say grace.

396
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
Okay, grace.

397
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,220
Nice, normal, funny.

398
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,020
Let's have a nice, normal Thanksgiving dinner.

399
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,820
Okay, and everyone closes their eyes.

400
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,180
and the candy bars are around and you see

401
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,420
uh uh uh you see them all placed in front of the children's table so everyone's

402
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,220

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,940
They are worried.

416
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,340
How big is the kids table?

417
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:33,940
It's like like three by three kind of like, you know, square

418
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,840
kind of thing.

419
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,340
Like those little like plastic little table tables.

420
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,140
Yeah, you know, it's what you can do, you know for the kids.

421
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,740
I just pick it up and try to take it in the bathroom with

422
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:42,840
me.

423
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,040
No, no, John Candy, Uncle John Candy.

424
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
No, you see the kids are following you.

425
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,080
Your brother is like, God damn it, John.

426
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,480
And he starts chasing after you.

427
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,320
Let's do should we?

428
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,960
Well, the candy, the candy bars are on the table, right?

429
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Roll initiative. Make a fight. Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,720
Let's roll initiative.

431
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,440
And armor on anyway. Yeah.

432
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,280
He's doing well.

433
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,240
So I'll roll for the kids and I'll roll for the dad.

434
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh, oh, they're not dressed in armor, though.

435
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,120
OK, so what's your deck?

436
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Because the kids decks are probably higher than yours.

437
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
If I had to guess.

438
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,520
My decks, uh, it's 11.

439
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
It's 11, right?

440
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Yeah.

441
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Okay.

442
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Yeah.

443
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
So the kids are going to go first.

444
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,960
So, uh, your little nephew, um, your little nephew, Billy Bob is going to try to grab

445
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
the candy off.

446
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
That's my real nephew's name.

447
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Please don't use that name.

448
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
Really?

449
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Okay.

450
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
In case I murder him.

451
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Okay.

452
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Yeah.

453
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
So your little nephew, Gumby.

454
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm kidding.

455
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I don't care.

456
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Oh, wait, hold on.

457
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Now actually keep it.

458
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Yeah.

459
00:23:47,200 --> 00:24:00,080
the

460
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:18,080
but

461
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,320
the candy bar away from him. You're just moving the table inside like it's up a bit higher.

462
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,600
And now you're going to go so you can just use your full movement to get to the bathroom.

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,160
Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, like you have like 30 feet of movement,

464
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,600
so you can just okay, the house isn't that big. You just get in the bathroom,

465
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
you get free action to lock the door. You're in there with the table.

466
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,160
All the candy bars. Like one of the table legs is sticking out of the toilet.

467
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,760
Like you couldn't quite fit it in there.

468
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
You hear your brother slamming on the door.

469
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,760
God damn it!

470
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,760
John, I'm never gonna let you in my fucking house again!

471
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
Good, I don't wanna come back here, dude.

472
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
This place sucks.

473
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,560
You don't even have like a Nintendo Switch or anything.

474
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,760
I don't even get to play games when I'm here.

475
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,260
We do have a Nintendo Switch!

476
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,760
It's for the kids, John!

477
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Well, I can't play it!

478
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
You always want me to stay upstairs!

479
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
If you could play it, if...

480
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Last time, you said, "It's my turn, it's my turn, it's my turn," and my kid cried for you.

481
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
It was my turn!

482
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:41,360
and

483
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,560
You see the lock wiggles a little bit, and you see little Gumby looks up at you, and

484
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,280
he sees the sticker, and his eyes go wide.

485
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,720
And you enter into a rage, because you're a barbarian.

486
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,760
Which way does the door open?

487
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,340
It opens out.

488
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,680
Like out from you.

489
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,440
So what did you say about Gumby?

490
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
I think you're going to enter into a...

491
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,040
Were you going to enter into a rage as a barbarian, or were you going to just...

492
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,640
I was I want to like exit the bathroom in an excited rage.

493
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
Do it.

494
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
Okay.

495
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,480
So just because I found the sticker and just because I'm, you know, yeah, just a big man

496
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
child.

497
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,440
I just like, I just kick the door open with Gumby in front of it.

498
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,040
And we're cutting over to another character.

499
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,480
We'll find out what happened there.

500
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Maybe.

501
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:42,480
It is a little wooden boy who is in somewhere in Italy.

502
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
No, not Italy.

503
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Where are you at, Pam?

504
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
Florida.

505
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Florida?

506
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Yeah.

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,360
*laughter*

539
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,060
Oh fuck, this hurts! This hurts so bad! What is this?

540
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Oh, okay, okay, so Geppetto is able to like, shave down your nose a bit.

541
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
It hurts worse!

542
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
I can't have you walking around like this!

543
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
Stop, why? I don't care!

544
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
I'm doing an anti-semitic thing again, which I'm not.

545
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
What is this? Hold on!

546
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Why is my nose so huge?

547
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
And, um, he, he, he goes,

548
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
"Okay, look, look, just,

549
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,580
I- I- I- I- I didn't know this was gonna happen. I knew that I made a deal with a guy

550
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,760
I thought it was gonna be something magical, but I didn't know you would come to life

551
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
I was hoping you would just light up or something

552
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,960
Okay

553
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,660
Okay, let me hold on one second and he goes out and he takes out like a

554
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:33,820
Manual that says making a magical boy and he opens it up and he's looking inside of it. He's like, hey

555
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,060
Okay

556
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,060
Do you want to be a real boy?

557
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,820
um

558
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,060
Yeah, yeah, well, I know stop growing. All right. Hold on. It's just to go to page 57. So hold on

559
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
He starts peeling through the basic

560
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,420
Yeah, you know, it'll stop growing

561
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,980
You have to do good deeds

562
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:58,700
Yes, then your nose roll d20

563
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
You're not gonna do good deeds

564
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:19,300
Okay, all right, okay

565
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,940
Do what to do? Okay. Hold on one second and he goes and he leaves his

566
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,180
he leaves a

567
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,220
the his little hovel he lives in and

568
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,460
You could see on the right

569
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,560
On your right. He also left a chocolate bar a

570
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,860
a wank off yummy yum unopened.

571
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:48,020
Um, I was born 90 seconds ago and even I know that's a wank off yummy yum.

572
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,140
I'd like to go try to grab it and eat it.

573
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Okay.

574
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,100
As you try to go, go grab it and eat it.

575
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:01,300
Uh, um, a, you see a little, uh, uh, cricket, uh, pop up on top of the, the chocolate bar.

576
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,580
Uh, he goes, Oh, well there.

577
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Well there.

578
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
Hold on.

579
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:12,580
you trying to slap him as hard as I can into a wall and he just splats.

580
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Yep, he just splats.

581
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,580
And I rip open the chocolate bar.

582
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,580
Yep, and you find a brown sticker in there.

583
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,580
But Jimmy Petto is coming back in there.

584
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,580
So, I mean, he's going to see it unless you want to hide it.

585
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,820
it. I'm gonna you know what I'm gonna do. He have a I'm gonna

586
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:43,540

587
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,820

589
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:56,820
nose. So it's hard to hide is what you're well. What I'm

590
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,860
saying is you can also do an acrobatics check and get the key

591
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,140
ring around your nose.

592
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,620
Oh, well, you're smarter than me.

593
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
I will do that.

594
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,100
I was thinking I was probably a problem solve for Pinocchio.

595
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,420
If hell yeah, you just like do a swan leap in the air and just the ring of the keys just

596
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,180
slips on your nose and ends up like like whap whapping you in the face.

597
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,420
He Geppetto opens doors like the fuck you doing my keys.

598
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,340
I put the hanging keys in my mouth so that there's and I bite really hard so there's

599
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
really no way for me to get him off.

600
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Give me those keys he tries to go and grab you

601
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,340
What are you guys doing? Can I do?

602
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,580
Do whatever you want. Can I do a here? I

603
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,020
Didn't just kill a cricket. Oh

604
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,780
Cool. Yeah

605
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Roll d20 10

606
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:52,740
Near three foot nose. Yeah, he tries to go grab you and you get him right in there

607
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:05,780
camera and he's like oh no you got him right in the nards uh i'll say you have a chance how's

608
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,380

609
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:26,100
yeah uh yeah i would say at this point you he's he's uh doing the italian spider-man face um

610
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:37,700
and you're able to escape. And so I get in his Acura and I'm driving completely sideways

611
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,260
because my nose has to go out of the passenger door-winding window.

612
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:50,660
Just taking out mailboxes and side-view mirrors. Yeah, and yeah.

613
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,180
newspaper spinning into view. Yeah, and I have a bunch of cans behind the car and a

614
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,340
bumper sticker that says, "I just killed a cricket."

615
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:06,740
Perfect. That's all I wanted from you guys. So now we cut to a week later,

616
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:18,580
okay, where we are outside of the Wankoff factory. Thousands and thousands of people are lined up

617
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,980
outside in the Wankoff factory in Duluth, Brooklyn.

618
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,180
They're all vying for a chance to see Wally Wankoff.

619
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:30,880
To even, you know, for however brief, breathe the same air as him.

620
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,380
There's a massive iron dome that sits just outside of that sits

621
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,380
like within Duluth.

622
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,280
It's about three miles high and ten miles around and inside of

623
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,780
there.

624
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,080
It's impossibly large.

625
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,180
Sits the factory.

626
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,140
The entirety of the dome can contract.

627
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,860
Here are my glasses and seal from any point at any moment.

628
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,540
So being a defense contractor and shipping toilets and candy everywhere,

629
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:11,860
the dome is constantly just like like all these like little like pockets of the of the iron dome are just retracting and detracting and planes are flying out of there and delivery trucks are flying out.

630
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,960
It's this giant network where nobody's allowed inside the dome, but it's somehow like magically just like

631
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,140
Letting things out all day

632
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:26,440
So it but in there and so the factory's never really seen and right outside the factory are just ton of burnt corpses

633
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
They're strewn about from those who tried to enter

634
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,700
Famously if anyone steps within five point one five feet of the dome they are immediately vaporized

635
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,200
Even just today. We've seen like casualties and permanent scarring

636
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:51,460
I still the event is of the brown sticker recipients is basically it's like a tailgating party. There's jumbotrons everywhere to capture the event. There's music playing. People are playing flip cup with hot cocoa and burning themselves.

637
00:35:51,460 --> 00:36:06,460
There's a dunk tank that where you sit on a toilet, and you throw a like bomb at the thing and then you dump and you fall into chocolate, like all the businesses are all represented and all these different little games, and you guys are the you know the guests of honor at this

638
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,820
tailgating Bonnaroo party that is before Wyckoff officially comes out.

639
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,660
What are you guys doing at this big bonanza at this event?

640
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,820
Are you guys interacting with each other? Are you guys on your own?

641

653
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,900

662
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,660
I'm just flying all over the place.

663
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,360
I keep getting close to like I'm like reaching out for candy

664
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
and I keep getting close to touching it and I just get like

665
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,660
punted somewhere else.

666
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,260
Yeah, and very nearby.

667
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:06,520
There's like a there's like a one second shot of me breakdancing by spinning on my nose with a large crowd going yo

668
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,440
But it cuts away very fast, yeah

669
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,340
Yeah at the tank. Yes. I've tried to throw and my throws not strong. So I'm trying to convince the guy

670
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,860
to dunk himself just

671
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,860
Roll persuasion check. Sure. We said what did you live for? What could you have to live for?

672
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,800
Yeah, you got nothing to live for and I've persuaded you

673
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,060
21

674
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Your life's a joke your wife's

675
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,820
It's don't respect you

676
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:54,260
This guy's like I mean, I think at least a little one, you know, you know he

677
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:01,760
he just swallows off into the bag and you see the guy there is

678
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,060
like, here's your price and it gives you a wank off yummy.

679
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:10,960
Yum, which when you eat these you do get a plus 5 temporary HP.

680
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,060
So they are I'm just going to like load up on those.

681
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,060
Yeah, yeah, there's tons of games.

682
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,860
You can play here.

683
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,460
There's like a ski ball game.

684
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,860
You can you can basically try to load up on the different kinds

685
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,660
of candy that will give you temporary buffs if you guys want to do that.

686
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:34,500
I'm playing skeeball and every single ball is bouncing back and hitting me in the face.

687
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,840
You don't want to try to win?

688
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,700
I'm trying really hard.

689
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,540
Go go go go go John.

690
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,460
No you go ahead.

691
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:52,100
So I just realized I said okay and I was just like meant that for you but I got confused.

692
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:59,180
Although a um, let's roll a attack roll, but we'll add your dex and your proficiency as

693
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,740
you're doing skeeball.

694
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,820
Okay, unarmed strike, 14.

695
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Okay cool.

696
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,420
So with a, yeah, with a 14, you're getting pretty close, you're getting in there, but

697
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,900
it's not quite enough points.

698
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,100
You could try again, but it is going to cost you your shiny penny that you got on the train

699
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,860
tracks.

700
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
I will definitely spend the penny.

701
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:27,460
cool. Do it. Try again. I don't understand the value of money at all. Let me roll again.

702
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:31,700
Oh, you got a crit. Okay, cool. So-

703
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,300
Also, yeah, can I say what the- Yes, of course you can.

704
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,980
Yeah. I've been missing every single one. They're all bouncing back and hitting me in the face.

705
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,220
And then the last one bounces back, hits me in the face, bounces off my face,

706
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,900
and goes into the 10,000 point tiny circle at the top.

707
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:58,100
and you see, like, the woman who works there is like, "Can he get any luckier, this kid?"

708
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,820
And everyone's, like, clapping, like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

709
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:08,420
And I go to walk to get my prize and my foot is stuck underneath the machine.

710
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:16,740
They're like, "Can we-- do you wanna-- let's just try to, like--"

711
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,900
I'm already trying to chew it off.

712
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,100
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, you don't have to do that.

713
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,300
They try to like move the machine.

714
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm going to have these like normal people do like a strength check.

715
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
Let's see what they can do.

716
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,700
Yeah, no, they're just not able to move the machine.

717
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,400
They're like having a lot of trouble.

718
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,300
So they go to get the prizes and give it to you.

719
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:42,600
You're going to get three Wankoff Twizzlies,

720
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,800
which give you a temporary AC buff of plus one for for ten minutes.

721
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
Delicious Twizzly, I wish I could eat this!

722
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Well you can, you can just- oh, no teeth.

723
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Well, uh, let's try to...

724
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,800
You know what, you're the winner. Do you have a blender?

725
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,800
A blender? A what? A blender?

726
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,800
A bender? No I'm not going to get a bender. I'm having a good time. What?

727
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,800
A bender? A bendo? A blender?

728
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:28,800
home

729
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,920
right here. Who's on first?

730
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,920
I want to blend this! I want to blend this!

731
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
You want to blend me?

732
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
I want to blend it!

733
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,920
You want to blend me?

734
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,920
I mean this could go on forever. I'll have a great time.

735
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Cut, cut real quick for one more second.

736
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Let's please do it.

737
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,920
And now, now I'm sitting on the ground and women are dancing on the pole that is my nose.

738
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,920
Same exact sound. People are like, "Wah wah wah wah!"

739
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,420
And I'm the life of the party.

740
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,420
Yes, you are. Yeah, you're the best ever.

741
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,620
Um...

742
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,340
Yeah, and as you guys keep doing this, suddenly...

743
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,420
Uh, you guys have been having fun, you've been--

744
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Or being mad at people, or...

745
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,420
- Uh, I'm-- - Making people want to die.

746
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,580
I've-- The whole time that everything's been going on,

747
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,060
I'm just beating the shit out of the gate.

748
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,500
- Yeah. - [laughter]

749
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,540
Like, punching-- Punching the gate so hard.

750
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,900
- It's like-- - The gate is--

751
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,900
[screaming]

752
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,900
It's like, screaming.

753
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,020
You have--

754
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:39,480
I gave you a big half convinced that it worked because you suddenly hear the thunderous roar of screeching metal piercing the air all the music in the sound stops this mass field as the iron dome creates another opening.

755
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:53,040
Is screeching screeching screeching and as the metal like you know the side of metal riches upwards into wherever it's going all you see is a sea of blackness inside.

756
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,220
And everyone like these thousands of people are like, "Huh? Like what?"

757
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,380
I turn to all of them and I'm like, "LUIGI IS DEAD!"

758
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:05,460
And then you hear someone say, "It's Wankoff! It's Wankoff!"

759
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,380
And sure enough, from the darkness, you see a face emerge.

760
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,540
A big, goofy, expressionless Marty Feldman face.

761
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,100
He's got glassy, googly eyes and a shaggy 70s bob.

762
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,420
And he has a goatee.

763
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:26,380
And a drone camera swoops in to take a look at his visage.

764
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,900
His eyes flip towards the camera

765
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,540
and as it hovers in front of him, he gives a big toothy grin

766
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,420
and on all these jumbotrons, everyone's going fucking nuts.

767
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,140
This is happening.

768
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,620
And the crowd is like going crazy.

769
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,900
It's Wankoff, it's Wankoff.

770
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,620
And then you see his eyes start to go back and forth.

771
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:51,460
Like some kind of pendulum and the crowds going crazy, then they are.

772
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:58,860
getting sleepy and then they all fall asleep except for five of you.

773
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:05,820
The four of you and little Chucky Fuckett, this little sweet blonde boy.

774
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:11,980
And eventually the drone finally, as the operator slowly passes out, the drone stays hovering

775
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:17,700
somehow and Wankoff's face begins to retreat into the darkness.

776
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,740
and he says to you all, come in.

777
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,420
OK, yeah, so you guys can all come in the five of you.

778
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:32,860
And as you walk into the dome, you move into just pure darkness

779
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:38,660
and then you hear two claps and lights come on, or rather the

780
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,940
sun comes on because the Iron Dome, which outside is like this,

781
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,140
you know, metal that you can't get see anything through inside.

782
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,420
It's a one-way mirror in a way where you could see the sun,

783
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,740
you could see the sky.

784
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,300
It is this like translucent thing.

785
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,440
You see in front of you now,

786
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,040
'cause it's this 10 mile circumference,

787
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,940
you see this massive field of bombers, tanks,

788
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,300
all these military grade vehicles.

789
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,740
You see thousands of robots and little frog men

790
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,980
tweaking and tinkering each of these machines,

791
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,780
making them, fixing up one thing,

792
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,620
making them work on another thing,

793
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,220
giving them the Wank Off stamp,

794
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,100
which I can draw for you later,

795
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,340
and then sending them off into the sky,

796
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,820
wherever they go or the trucks are being sent out.

797
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,140
It's this like massive field of all this stuff happening.

798
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,700
You also see far into the distance,

799
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,860
like a few miles ahead of you,

800
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,420
'cause it's flat and you could see

801
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,300
this like dense pink sparkly fog.

802
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,340
And then these like spires

803
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,700
of like some sort of strange factory.

804
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,660
You can only see the silhouette of it.

805
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,300
Then barreling down like five miles ahead of you,

806
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,500
like where this thing is, you hear the like,

807
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,980
and it's this uncoiling steel walkway

808
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,860
that's like a carpet of some kind and then it like goes and like

809
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:57,300
flaps right in front of you onto my onto your foot and you go.

810
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,500
and you're gonna take. You got all your HP back from before

811
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,380
right? Yeah, we're good also at at at the it's so startling to

812
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,260
me when he yells the ouch that I turn to the side and just hit

813
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,020
him right in the in the my nose. Yeah. So in that case,

814
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:22,040
he'll take instead. I'm gonna stab him. He's getting stabbed but like in the same place

815
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,200
that he got stabbed earlier. I just reopening the wound over and over again. So he takes

816
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:40,540
16 damage from all of that. And out flops Wankoff who is about 5 foot 1 and is a pudgy

817
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:45,940
Neo from the Matrix, the same face you saw earlier,

818
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:49,540
and he dusts himself off, and he stands up,

819
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,180
and he goes, "Hey."

820
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,740
- Hey.

821
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,240
- You guys the winners?

822
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,020
- Yes.

823
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,860
- Yeah.

824
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,680
- Awesome.

825
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,280
- My name's Wally Wankoff.

826
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,260
It's super nice to meet you guys.

827
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,900
Sorry, I thought I had something prepared for this.

828
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,740
Hold on.

829
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,980
And he goes into his pocket and he's pulling out like lint

830
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,380
and like a bunch of other crap.

831
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,260
And then he takes out like a crumpled up post-it.

832
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,340
He says, just says, hello.

833
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,700
I guess I didn't finish writing.

834
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,380
So yeah, welcome to my factory.

835
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,220
Pretty cool.

836
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,460
All these bombers all around

837
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,740
'cause I'm a defense contractor too.

838
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,640
It's a pretty neat place, I think.

839
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,700
Yeah, so I'm looking for an heir.

840
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,600
Hoping it could be one of you guys, right?

841
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,300
That's pretty cool.

842
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,800
There's air all around us.

843
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,700
Oh, yeah, to be your son.

844
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,000
Wow.

845
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,700
Yeah, I never my mom always said that if I just, you know,

846
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,000
drank a bit more milk, maybe I would, you know, sprout up.

847
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,800
But uh, okay.

848
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,100
Yeah.

849
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,700
So we're just gonna what we're going to do is we're going to

850
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,600
hop on this walkway here.

851
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
This metal walkway.

852
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,120
It's gonna whip us back to the factory and I'll explain what we're gonna do today. It's gonna be a lot of fun

853
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,880
You guys are gonna see a lot of cool stuff

854
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:22,240
Okay, all right, come on come on now look I just stop you right there I love oh what's up my own father

855
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,560
Does he need to become deceased if I am to become your heir? Oh, uh,

856
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,280
That's a really good question. I

857
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,640
Don't think so cuz like just say the word. Oh, oh

858
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:43,540
Okay. Yeah. No, I'll try to make that if that needs to happen like we can figure something out. I think I smelled my father's penis

859
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,840
So any earlier yeah, how old are you I

860
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:56,260
Don't I maybe I don't know the other this guy. Well, I'll awake. Oh, hey, I'm like 37

861
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,720
Oh, I'm 10 years older than you. Haha

862
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,720
*laughter*

863
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,720
I don't know how he owned you there!

864
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,720
He kinda got me pretty bad.

865
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
I'll be your big brother!

866
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
Yeah, no, whatever works man.

867
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
Look, uh, okay.

868
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
So, I'm gonna, alright, I guess, alright.

869
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
I should probably level with you guys.

870
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Um...

871
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,720
I...

872
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,720
I don't really know how any of this shit in here works.

873
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
Um...

874
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
So...

875
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
20 years ago or so,

876
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:33,840
So my uncle, it was Wally Wankoff, he was very eccentric and fun and all these things.

877
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,280
He died and he gave me the factory and he said all I needed to do was just change my

878
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,080
name and then I'd have it.

879
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:47,000
So at the time, I was working at Best Buy and I was like, "Skill, whatever, who cares?"

880
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,880
And I was like, "I'll save enough money, maybe go to college full-time, like a two-year school

881
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
and then go to a four-year."

882
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,680
I didn't really have a plan, but it wasn't a big deal.

883
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,440
So I was like, oh my god, like so much money from my uncle like yeah, um, anyway, the factory doesn't let me leave

884
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,800
uh

885
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Can we go to best buy after this?

886
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah, if you want to go like do you still have an employee discount? Yeah, I don't have no I

887
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,920
I haven't worked there in like 23. I haven't seen this anything. I haven't seen people in 23 years

888
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,880
Um, i'm a people my uncle

889
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,680
Us. Yeah

890
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,960
Okay. Well, this is exciting for me. I get four inches. Yeah

891
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,320
- Yeah. (laughing)

892
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,920
- Is that gonna keep happening?

893
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,760
- No!

894
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,920
- I get four more inches.

895
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,600
- Okay, all right, it's confusing.

896
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,440
- I'm gonna need to keep it running totally here.

897
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,960
(laughing)

898
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,960
- Is the other kid with us too?

899
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,360
- Yeah, Chucky's there too.

900
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,700
- What's his deal?

901
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,960
- He's just smiling pleasantly

902
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,280
and listening very intently.

903
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,400
He's very excited. - I'm gonna turn to him

904
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,000
and get right in his face and go, "Explain yourself!"

905
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,200
(laughing)

906
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,400
Oh, uh, hi, my name's, uh, Chucky Fuckit.

907
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm, uh...

908
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,500
Bonjour.

909
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,500
No!

910
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
No!

911
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,500
[laughter]

912
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
No!

913
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
[laughter]

914
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,500
I don't- I don't understand what he's laughing at, but I think- I wanna, like, be in on it, so I'm starting to go like...

915
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,000
[laughter]

916
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,500
SHUT UP, YOU DON'T GET IT!

917
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
[laughter]

918
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,500
Yeah, I fall over.

919
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
[laughter]

920
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
I've tumbled backwards.

921
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,060
Yeah, I'm just a chucky fuck it.

922
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:32,500
[Laughter]

923
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,500
Yeah, I just got very lucky one day and I got one of the brown stickers.

924
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,500
I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Wankoff.

925
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,500
I'm sorry that you don't know how the factory works.

926
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,500
That sounds really tough.

927
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
It's fine.

928
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
The factory kind of runs itself.

929
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,540
They're doing their thing. They're those frogs. They're doing their thing. Uh, it's pretty chill. Um

930
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,260
But I got it. So my uncle did say I can have an air

931
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,940
So it looks like I was able to you know, get you guys inside

932
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,440
Which is really exciting for me. Hey, I got some air

933
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,980
Okay, so yeah, that's gonna be your thing the whole

934
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,000
trip

935
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So what I need you guys to do

936
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,180
I'm gonna show you around the factory. We're gonna you know, you'll have a nice time. I'll get you guys some free chocolate

937
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,660
But uh, I need you guys to help me just

938
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,540
Clear out some shit. I

939
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:31,880
Haven't really been running. So okay. I was doing I was like kind of

940
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,620
almost a professional at

941
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,600
Halo 2 for a few years. It was pretty close, but I was mostly doing that

942
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,660
so I haven't really seen the factory in some time and I

943
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,580
Just need to make sure that whoever I pass it to is gonna know how to handle it. So

944
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,460
We'll just go to a couple of the rooms there.

945
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:57,520
You can see it, get excited by it, you know, maybe help me understand it a little bit better.

946
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,660
And then you know, whoever is the best at that, I guess, you know, I'll make you the air.

947
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,660
Does that sound good?

948
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:06,860
Hey, I got some more air.

949
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,660
It's really gonna be the whole time.

950
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,860
It was silent.

951
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,580
Does that sound good?

952
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,580
Or I could I look I I

953
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,580
I silently just turned green.

954
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,580
I'm right above them.

955
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,580
[laughter]

956
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,180
[clears throat]

957
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,480
Okay, alright everyone, let's just get on my, uh, let's get on the walkway.

958
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,880
It'll just whip us back. I don't control that, but that's what it does.

959
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,380
Whip us!

960
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,080
No, well, not like, no, I don't like that.

961
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Uh, so yeah, you guys can get on the, uh, the metal, um, walkway.

962
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,080
Uh, it's zooming you back.

963
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Uh, Chucky fuckit falls off and, uh, breaks his head open and, uh, he's dead.

964
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,680
And I get to the factory.

965
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,680
Chuckie fuck is dead.

966
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,440
He goes, Oh, I guess that's one down.

967
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,440
And you guys are at the factory.

968
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Yeah.

969
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,980
Yeah, you're at the factory door.

970
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,160
You see it's just like big.

971
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:14,240
You get through this like dense pink fog and you see the factory and it it's it's it's like

972
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,560
It has this big, massive, golden door and embalmed on it is that Wankoff's face.

973
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:31,040
He's got the same sort of Marty Feldman-style, Igor-looking guy.

974
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,760
It looks a little bit more like an older person than him.

975
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,240
Looks like an older version of him.

976
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,120
He goes up and he starts waddling up to the door and he's like, "You guys like this outfit?"

977
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,680
last movie I saw was the Matrix so that was pretty sweet I thought you guys

978
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:54,400
would like it you guys like it positively luxurious okay well you're

979
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:09,360
not wearing a dress I'm not wearing a dress no okay so I'm gonna have to

980
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,240
figure out what that is logistically in this game.

981
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,240
This is huge.

982
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,240
Getting out of hand.

983
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,360
Yeah, you guys are at the door for the factory.

984
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:27,360
Again, big golden has an embalmed figure of a wank off on it or a wank off looking type

985
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,000
of guy.

986
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,240
And he says, OK, so to get in here, it's got a one second and he goes to the door and he

987
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,600
it's a little keyboard pops out and he starts playing it and it's sort of a syncopated bleeding

988
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,280
of trumpets and he turns you guys like that's a ska, ska pretty cool right and he keeps

989
00:56:49,280 --> 00:57:01,160
playing it and eventually the door clicks and you hear you see the face of the Wankoff

990
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Sort of whip out and give him a big wet kiss on the cheek and go.

991
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,160
Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo.

992
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,060
And the door starts to creak open.

993
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:25,060
And but then the face sort of looks to the four of you right Chuckie's dead and the door slams shut and then Wankoff goes.

994
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,960
Okay, and he opens the piano again.

995
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
he plays the same ska tune.

996
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,260
So I had a ska phase.

997
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,360
It's awesome.

998
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,760
It's pretty cool.

999
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,060
I think and I know about ska.

1000
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,560
Yeah,

1001
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,160
hell is that?

1002
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:39,760
All right.

1003
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,260
Your nose is now 60 70 inches about 8 inches.

1004
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:43,860
Okay.

1005
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:50,460
So what we're going to do is I'm going to be honest here.

1006
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:55,960
We've been playing it pretty fast and loose, but I think there

1007
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:02,960
There is something to be said about what are we going to do about your 70 inch nose.

1008
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,640
I'm not the dungeon master.

1009
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,640
That's your job.

1010
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm supposed to have fun and get the biggest nose award at the end of this like it's Mario

1011
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Party.

1012
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,720
What we're going to do is that is going to have its own attack at this point.

1013
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,600
I think it does 1d12.

1014
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,520
I think it's a strength attack, strength based attack when it's this length.

1015
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,120
I think also everyone is going to have advantage on grappling you

1016
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,820
because you have a big nose there.

1017
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,360
Trying to discourage me from doing this.

1018
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,320
No, no, no, not at all.

1019
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,220
It's not going to work, but I would know I would never discourage you ever, ever, ever.

1020
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,120
At some point, too, is it's going to be top heavy.

1021
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,820
He's going to use his head is going to be against the ground.

1022
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,020
If you can.

1023
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,080
For I just think by now.

1024
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,720
What? Oh, yeah, it's definitely.

1025
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,660
It's been I'm two feet tall.

1026
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,960
Yeah, yeah.

1027
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,600
A fucking five and a half foot nose, dude.

1028
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,680
Yeah, which is a normal height for a nose.

1029
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,600
Yeah, I agree.

1030
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,960
Guy. And so you're.

1031
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,240
Yeah. So he plays the tune again.

1032
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,280
The same thing happens.

1033
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,160
The door goes, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1034
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,000
Gives him a kiss, starts to open and looks at the four of you

1035
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,640
and the door closes.

1036
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,080
He's like, OK,

1037
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:20,160
hmm, one more time.

1038
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,920
And he plays the same thing.

1039
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,440
and the thing does not go, does not give him a big wet kiss and go wahoo wahoo wahoo.

1040
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:35,680
Instead the embalmed figure starts to pop itself out of the door and looks to all of you

1041
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:42,080
and attacks. We're gonna roll for initiative. What the fuck? Oh my god, I hate this game.

1042
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:48,560
What? I forgot you had to fight. It's always so uncomfortable because it's like they really

1043
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,120
hate playing D&D. That's all I do with them. Oh my god I hate it. I brought

1044
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:02,540
somebody here who does D&D. I'm no fan. He doesn't like either. Nobody likes D&D. I also do the dishes man.

1045
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:11,080
I don't. Fun though. I have nightmares. I also suck the sludge out of a gutter.

1046
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,080
I don't know what to tell you, man.

1047
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,080
Yeah, because I have to.

1048
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,080
I paid for the honor. I don't like it.

1049
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,080
[Laughter]

1050
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Okay, cool.

1051
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,080
Cam, you are going to go first.

1052
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
You lucky duck.

1053
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,080
So yeah, there's this big guy in front of you.

1054
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,080
It's like a weird

1055
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
embalmed figure that popped out.

1056
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
So he's sort of two-dimensional and made of some kind

1057
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,080
of gold or copper.

1058
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,080
Some sort of metal.

1059
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,080
And it is right now approaching you guys

1060
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:57,080
is

1061
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:03,880
crutch right up to it. I'll swing myself over there and I will I'll swing myself around

1062
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:10,120
and and and and or no, you know, I'll hit him with my crutch. Okay, cool. Yeah. Do your

1063
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:15,320
crutch attack? Alright. Oh, it's a crit. Holy **** Okay. You gotta crit right away. Okay,

1064
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:22,400
roll for damage. Alright. Oh my god. Okay. Damn. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So,

1065
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,200
what do you how do you attack him? How do you do a critical attack with your crutches?

1066
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,880
I like pirouette on one crutch and I'm holding out the other one.

1067
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,760
I smack it.

1068
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,040
I assume it's pretty tall probably so I smack it in the shin.

1069
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,040
Yeah yeah and it goes like

1070
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:46,240
Yeah yeah and you can yeah you can it my arm bends the wrong way too when I do it and I

1071
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,240
go

1072
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,240
Yeah you go there

1073
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,800
And you see Wally, by the way, who is just like cowering away.

1074
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,440
He's like, I swear it's never done this to me whenever I come in here.

1075
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,640
I promise this was not.

1076
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,080
Oh God, like he's just like totally afraid of this.

1077
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,620
He seems completely confused by what's going on.

1078
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:09,020
It is now the door things turn.

1079
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,620
So after doing that to you, it's going to try to kick you with its like leg.

1080
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:15,520
It's like weird, like, like copper leg.

1081
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,840
So let's see how it does it that.

1082
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,120
It does not do well.

1083
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:27,920
swings and misses. I go flying anyway. Yeah, of course you do. And then it's going to like

1084
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:37,040
sort of like a a a a womp in Mario. Try to like go flat and and you're all gonna roll

1085
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:45,200
Constitution saving throws. Oh no. As it goes to flop on the ground. Eleven. Okay. Alright.

1086
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:52,200
and

1087
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,280
this check. As this thing whomps on the ground, you're all gonna take from the shockwave,

1088
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:05,880
you're gonna take like not too much damage, probably. You're gonna take 5 damage, so it's

1089
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:15,080
not too much. But you're all also stunned for the round. So the stunned condition means,

1090
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:19,800
well, unfortunately for you guys, means you can't really do much. You're not really able

1091
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:33,640
to

1092
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,560
falteringly I'm pissed off that I'm stunned oh we can talk falteringly yeah

1093
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:43,040
that's that's the technical rules yeah hmm I'm pissed off that I'm stunned I'm

1094
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:50,320
just staying there I'm just like it's just fucking shit this I I want to move

1095
01:03:50,320 --> 01:04:02,360
my arms so bad and hit this guy then do it or are you faltering I'm faltering

1096
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:10,460
right now. I can tell. So you guys can't take actions or reactions. So I mean, you're you

1097
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:17,600
could just we could just like loop right around. Go back to the top of the round. Unless there's

1098
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:23,480
things you want to do on your turn that are like free actions or something like that.

1099
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:30,680
Can I can I position myself in a way that if he tries to to swamp on me again, he'll

1100
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:35,240
just immediately run into my nose. You can't move. You can't move. Okay. Well, can I think

1101
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,440
that I might do that next time? Yeah, you can think about it. Okay, I sit there and

1102
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,480
think about it. You're thinking about it. So we go back to the top of the round and

1103
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,560
the flop is just going to go again and this time he's going to try to kick you cam and

1104
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:52,280
now he's going to have advantage against that on. Oh, so let's see how he does there. Okay.

1105
01:04:52,280 --> 01:05:00,560
Yeah, he hits you. Oh, which makes sense and he does. He only does six damage to you as

1106
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,760
He kicks you in the gut.

1107
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,260
And then he's going to try to kick.

1108
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:11,040
He's going to try to kick all of our again or this time which

1109
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,340
he's going to have advantage on that against you which by the

1110
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:13,860
way, that's me.

1111
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,060
I don't think I said my name.

1112
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,060
Oh, yeah, just realize that yeah, I'm Waylon all of our

1113
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,560
all right.

1114
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,060
We'll have to add that in the beginning.

1115
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:24,260
Okay, cool.

1116
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,760
All right, you definitely get hit and you're going to take.

1117
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:34,640
Seven damage from that. So you're you're you're doing okay though.

1118
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:42,240
and now we're back to who is next. We got over here who got the

1119
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,440
the eight was you Pinocchio. So you're up. Okay. I'm going to

1120
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,800
try to use because I am I am a warlock. That's true. So

1121
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Your patron is Japano.

1122
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Pinocchio, the famous character, is going to use his witch bolt.

1123
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,800
[laughter]

1124
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,800
So...

1125
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Yeah, do it.

1126
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,800
I'm gonna cast my witch bolt.

1127
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,800
[laughter]

1128
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,800
[deep breath]

1129
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,800
20.

1130
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,800
Oh shit, yeah, that hits.

1131
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
Nice.

1132
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Roll for damage. Good god!

1133
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,800
Cast that at a second level, okay.

1134
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,100
So you just did 19 damage to this kid.

1135
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,000
Good God, you guys are really fucking chunking away at him.

1136
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,400
It's a Pinocchio.

1137
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,300
All he's done is is be used for his nose to this point.

1138
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:37,400
You take kind of Palpatine esque force lightning out of his hands

1139
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,800
and nose and into a door.

1140
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,300
I got the bombs and bombs figure that popped out of a door magic.

1141
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,700
I'm like, yeah, I'm so I'm so happy because I finally I'm like,

1142
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,580
Oh my God, I knew magic was real all along.

1143
01:06:53,580 --> 01:07:08,260
Yeah, I mean so with which bolt that just remain that can just remain and you can just like continually do damage every turn without having to roll another attack roll cool.

1144
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,900
Waylon.

1145
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:18,820
Au revoir, you're up so he just he's got hit me. I'm pissed. I'm going to throw a dagger at him.

1146
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,860
Fuck yeah.

1147
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
Go for it.

1148
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,860
And uh...

1149
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:22,860
Fuck yeah, that's a 20, that hits.

1150
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,860
Oh, nice.

1151
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,860
Okay, for uh...

1152
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:30,220
Oh, all your rolls except for that one constitution one.

1153
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,220
Everyone's doing good.

1154
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,220
Two.

1155
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,220
Nice.

1156
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,700
Yeah, you just like get a dagger like, you know, just like stuck in its forehead.

1157
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,700
Oh, yeah.

1158
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,700
He's like, "Aaah!

1159
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,700
Uuugh!"

1160
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:43,020
Then I want to use a bonus action.

1161
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,020
Hell yeah.

1162
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:47,740
To uh, I want to cast something called Unsettling Words.

1163
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:54,180
So I'm gonna like look him dead in the eyes and I'm just gonna say like your mother has a crush on you.

1164
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:57,920
*laughter*

1165
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,120
What do you think?

1166
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,080
I don't actually, I don't know what it does.

1167
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:10,100
So, unsettling words means I think on the next, and I'll double check this, because on the next

1168
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:15,580
uh, a check he does, ability check he does, he takes like a B, where you would do like

1169
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:20,780
bardic inspiration, it's like bardic desperation, so he would just roll like a D6 and subtract

1170
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,780
it.

1171
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,780
Oh, okay.

1172
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,780
But I'm gonna-

1173
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,780
So he'll be thinking about what I said?

1174
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,780
Oh, uh, first he's-

1175
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,540
He's gonna be stuck in his craw for quite a while, I think.

1176
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:31,860
Let me make, let me double, triple check that, but I'm almost positive that's what that is.

1177
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,940
Uh, where are you beautiful?

1178
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:35,940
Unsettling words.

1179
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:36,940
Yes, yeah.

1180
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,940
Yes, yeah.

1181
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:40,940
Oh, you can see roll the bargain.

1182
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:43,740
Spirits 91 D6 and creature must subtract the number rolled from

1183
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:44,640
the next saving throw.

1184
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,140
It makes before the start of your next turn.

1185
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,440
Okay, so he'll take the four.

1186
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,140
Yeah, so he'll take the four and he'll have to subtract that

1187
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:51,540
from any saving throw.

1188
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:53,240
It has to make before the start of your next turn.

1189
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:58,640
So yeah, and he's a when you say that he's like, oh, like

1190
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,740
he's just like very upset and is upset by the idea that he

1191
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,140
has a mom because he's a some kind of like door figure.

1192
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:13,400
and then also upset that this new blessing would also want to fuck him.

1193
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,760
And now you're up John Candy.

1194
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:21,240
I'm sitting here still pissed off that he stunned me.

1195
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:27,280
Just like, "Ugh, this is bullshit!"

1196
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:28,280
That's all I do.

1197
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Oh no, you're not stunned anymore.

1198
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,280
No, I know.

1199
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,880
I'm just so pissed off.

1200
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,000
I don't even know, I'm not stunned anymore.

1201
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,320
I'm like moving around.

1202
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:48,960
I'm not acknowledging that I have to be involved in the fight at all.

1203
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,960
Amazing.

1204
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,360
Okay, we're back to top of the order and you're up, Bibby.

1205
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,560
Alright, I'm going after the door with my crutches again.

1206
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,400
I also realized I forgot last turn, I can make an unarmed attack as a bonus action when

1207
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:26,800
I

1208
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,960
dent into this thing. Uh, uh, dent into my leg as well. Yeah, of course. Everything that you do

1209
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:40,160
also hurts you. Um, and he's not looking that good. I am going to spend a, a, a key point

1210
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:48,320
because I have key. Bibby has a reservoir of key. He does use flurry of blows to make two

1211
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:54,160
or wait, that is, that's another bonus action. Is that, am I able to do that? So you can't

1212
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,960
really do it again because it's accused your bonus action. Okay, then I don't do that. Okay,

1213
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:05,280
it makes sense. Um, uh, when you use your tag, actually, yeah, it's a bonus action so you can't

1214
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:12,560
really do two. All right. Yeah, no, I won't do it then. Okay, cool. So now we're next, we're back

1215
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,880
to the door. So the door is getting pretty pissed at this point. Um, and it's going to open its

1216
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,960
mouth. Um, and you're going to hear dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, and

1217
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,760
And everyone roll wisdom saving throw.

1218
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,560
I got a 313.

1219
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,560
I'm not good.

1220
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,760
I got a three.

1221
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,260
Yeah, it's not good.

1222
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,760
I'm so unwise.

1223
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,060
Now you guys are not mad and wise.

1224
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:34,560
What's going on?

1225
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,360
Cam? Oh, there's yours.

1226
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:36,060
Sorry, I didn't see it.

1227
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:36,960
Okay.

1228
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,860
All right, uh, baby.

1229
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,460
Okay, didn't do too bad.

1230
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:51,460
Vivi and John Candy, you guys are going to take three damage Pinocchio and are of why you taking six?

1231
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:55,060
He's taking the full damage from this attack.

1232
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:59,060
And then he's going to also try to try to

1233
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:04,600
headbutt you, John Candy, as you're like wandering around.

1234
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,740
He like thinks of you as like someone obnoxious gnat.

1235
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,280
And what's your AC, John?

1236
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,580
That is 14.

1237
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,120
All right, it's going to hit you, buddy.

1238
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,240
I hate to say it. Yeah.

1239
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,820
It does nine damage to you as he headbutts into your your luxurious tummy.

1240
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:38,800
the

1241
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,000
So I don't have to recast my laser bolt.

1242
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,600
Yeah, your laser bolt.

1243
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,600
My witch bolt.

1244
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,600
Which is what you call it.

1245
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
So I'm gonna hit again.

1246
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,600
You can just roll for damage again.

1247
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,600
Yeah.

1248
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Okay.

1249
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,600
Wait, no, that's unarmed strike.

1250
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,200
Hee hee.

1251
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
Hee hee.

1252
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,200
13.

1253
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Good god.

1254
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Okay, yeah, you just like shock it again.

1255
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Oh, that's not damage.

1256
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Oh, you know what, I should have probably had you.

1257
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
That was an attack roll.

1258
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,200
Okay, there it is.

1259
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,200
16 then.

1260
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,200
You're welcome.

1261
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,200
You happy now?

1262
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,280
Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna let it slide.

1263
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,480
I should have had you roll to see if you can still concentrate on the spell, but I didn't

1264
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,480
catch it.

1265
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,480
So I'm gonna let it slide.

1266
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,480
He takes another 16 damage.

1267
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,320
He is basically looking like he's not around anymore.

1268
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,320
You're up wayland.

1269
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,320
Au revoir.

1270
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,320
Au revoir.

1271
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,240
I'm also using my nose like iron sights.

1272
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,240
Yeah, okay.

1273
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,240
Right.

1274
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1275
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,800
It's like, yeah, making sure you can aim appropriately.

1276
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,800
Yeah, the bolt that's coming out of your nose is just like a little like trickling little

1277
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,800
spark.

1278
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,080
Very, very tiny, but he's keeping it like located on it.

1279
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,080
Yeah.

1280
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
Uh, Waylon.

1281
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,080
Yeah.

1282
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:45,760
I got um, what do I got?

1283
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,400
I have a rapier that I keep on me for like always like in the courtroom in case of course

1284
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,400
like a duel.

1285
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,400
Yes.

1286
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:59,080
Uh, so I'm going to pull that out and I'm going to say, think about the mom thing again.

1287
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:02,080
And I'm going to say, 11.

1288
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,640
11 is not going to cut it.

1289
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,120
So he's a, he's a shaking his head.

1290
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:19,760
is

1291
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:24,760
I point to the next person in the initiative and say "He's all yours!"

1292
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,760
And it is all John Candies.

1293
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,760
John.

1294
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Um, um, now that I got hit, I'm like "What the- Oh my god, what the fuck, dude!"

1295
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:43,760
And I just whip- I pull my belt off of my- my pants like I'm Hootie Tang.

1296
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,760
That's where I start- I start swinging it around.

1297
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:59,640
and

1298
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
this door.

1299
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,640
I'm just hitting it.

1300
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,640
I don't know.

Very big, very big Chicago Bears logo.

1306
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,360
I fucking swing it at the door, hit it on the handle.

1307
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:33,260
handle just fucking I guess it's like it's like a I don't know like a door

1308
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:39,240
handle and I just break the door handle up yeah it's like really curious about

01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,400
- Dude, say here's Johnny, say it.

1313
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,240

(laughing)

1316
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,160
- Who are you talking about?

1317
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,160
- You see Wally Wankoff who was cowering

1318
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,120
and he's like, "Okay, all right."

1319
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,000
See, this is exactly why I wanted strong children.

1320
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,320
And you--

1321
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,320
- I'm older than you, dude.

1322
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,240
- Yeah, what?

1323
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,200
So that was really, it was meant for kids

1324
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,440
just because I get an air.

1325
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,040
That's fine.

1326
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,400
You know, it's OK.

1327
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,000
It's better to have an adult in here to help out.

1328
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,400
What?

1329
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,480
I was just confused because like usually weird.

1330
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,280
No, I'm not.

1331
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:36,160
You're the I know you just beat a door with a belt.

1332
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,520
I guess that's my factory, I guess.

1333
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,880
So, you know, you're being weird.

1334
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,000
Let's just be chill.

1335
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,520
Come on. Let's let's come in.

1336
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:43,920
Come in.

1337
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,160
This place is already incredible.

1338
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,600
I can't wait to see what other excitements are in store for us today.

1339
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:54,600
This is the best day of my life!

1340
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,600
Okay, yeah, uh...

1341
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Hey, Toothless.

1342
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,600
Oh, wait, hold on. Wait till I say it.

1343
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:10,600
Loser says what?

1344
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,600
Is he trying to say "blender"?

1345
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,600
And you step through

1346
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,600
their defeated door into Wally Wankoff's incredible vacuum.

1347
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,100
'Cause I've got a golden ticket

1348
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,600
It's ours, Charles!

1349
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,600
I've got a golden sun up in the sky

1350
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,600
Slippers, Charles!

1351
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,600
I never thought I'd see the day

1352
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,600
When I would face the world and say

1353
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,600
Good morning!

1354
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,600
Look at the sun!

1355
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,600
I never thought that I would be

1356
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Slapping the lap of luxury
