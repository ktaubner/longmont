1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[laughter]

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[music]

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're a crap monster.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
[explosion]

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You should get a...

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What?

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A...

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A...

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A...

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A...

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A...

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A...

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A...

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A...

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A...

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A...

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A...

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A...

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A...

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A...

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A...

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A...

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
A...

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A...

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A...

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A...

29
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A...

30
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
needles on it dip it in the paint yeah and then they just stab you a million

31
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:41,680
times I searched about shibori I think it's t-b-o-w no no it might be

32
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,200
both I be there it is te there we go I don't know what is it what is it so they

33
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,760
tattoo you like a thing or is it there's no machine crazy just stabbing him a

34
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,640
million time. If you're a tattoo artist and you listen to the show, send in some tattoo

35
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,280
ideas for the three of us to get as a team. Tell Patrick they're going to give him a discount

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,360
on a tattoo and then tattoo a swastika on his back where he can't see it, please. And

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,040
put it in that one spot where nobody can reach it. So that he can't even try to like ruin

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,760
it and like scratch it. Yeah, exactly. There's no choice but to keep it perfectly clean. Speaking

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:31,060
of Nazi tattoos on the plane home yesterday, guy next to us, full Iron Eagle on his arm

40
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,400
and it said like, I was like trying to read the German.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
For what?

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Iron Eagle.

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Like a Nazi Eagle crest type thing.

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Well I don't know.

45
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
I think that.

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,840
It was a family, so here's the thing right?

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,960
It wasn't a Nazi Eagle, it was like a coat of arms, but it looked enough like a Nazi Eagle

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,520
that it's like, that's a little weird.

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,480
looks like yeah and then but and i was like okay it's probably just a coat of

50
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,920
arms it's all the rightness something i was trying to read the german on it it

51
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,920
did have german on it too and then other arm iron cross to iron cross and then

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,400
everyone's such a i think an iron cross doesn't mean anything but i think those

53
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,120
two things together that is it is it well and then the four are also just the

54
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,840
way he looked yeah the way he looked on a way to look he was coming from myrtle

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,400
beach forty dollar flight from myrtle yes on his forearm huge we the people

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,440
the uh... so so i'll be soon

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,660
yeah although all here's my impression you guys guys i saw a patriot yesterday

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,400
always a lot of looking

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,780
as a fucking perfect patriot i violated his privacy that's why i didn't do

60
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,560
anything i want i wanted to read the german because i was like a little

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,800
session on patrick and you can say let me brush up a little you wanted to see

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,380
if it's a patrick and orin had to have you walking over to him at baggage claim

63
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,080
and going like this

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,200
you were you were arguing five times in a row. Also, the reason I don't know this was me a

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,960
baggage claim. He doesn't know how to act in public. Yeah. You and me have one you me and

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,200
Cam have one standard of public behavior and Patrick has a completely different one. Yeah.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
You and Pierce have a similar kind of idea of public behavior and what's okay and me

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,520
and Cameron think that you should be polite and courteous specifically to women. Yeah.

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,800
And you guys have, like I said, kind of an opposite kind of idea.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,200
A different school of thought.

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I did see...

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,520
More like an Arkham Institute.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,520
So there was a family sitting next to us, two of the most annoying kids in the world.

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:36,460
And that guy and his wife, they were trying to get everybody in the row or something.

75
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,660
And the lady just looked at the...

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Everybody in a row?

77
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,280
They're trying to get everybody on the plane into one row.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
No, they were trying to get the family into the row.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,040
What the hell is that? It was a Karen.

80
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,040
The lady looked at the lady with two kids in her arms and she was like,

81
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,280
"That's my seat. Is there any way I can get in?"

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,160
The lady went, "Sorry, we like the window seat."

83
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
Whoa!

84
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,520
Yeah, and she also asked Patrick.

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,920
We were sitting in our seats and she came up to ask Patrick.

86
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,840
Then she's like, "Are you in 20D or whatever seat we're in?"

87
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,320
And the seat that Patrick is in, it is on his ticket.

88
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,680
and Pat was like, "Yeah." And she's like, "Are you sure?" And he showed and he had to pull up

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,760
his boarding pass and show her when she clearly was not in that seat because it was Patrick's seat.

90
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Yeah.

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,800
She made Patrick show his boarding pass.

92
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,720
And this lady was a Karen?

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,360
She was a complete, she was one of the biggest Karens on a plane I've experienced in recent memory.

94
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,480
Did she anywhere near kind of milfy?

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
No, she wasn't even milfy.

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,400
Not even a bit. So you didn't let it slide?

97
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,800
No.

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,040
No.

99
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,040
know

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
What if Cameron really gave her some serious side eye?

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
What if she was...

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,080
I would say it was a side stink.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I hate to say it, yeah.

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
I gave a dirty, stinky look to her.

105
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
What did?

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Once or twice or ten times.

107
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Now, new scenario.

108
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
And that kid looked weird.

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
New scenario.

110
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,720
What if she comes up, she says, "Can I do that?"

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,920
And you say, "Oh, I don't know."

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,400
But then she turns, she's like, "One second."

113
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Turns around to put her carry-on in the overhead.

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
She puts her kid in there.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
And then you see her bottom.

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,200
She has two little divots for her nuts like a Lego butt.

117
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Right.

118
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
So she sits on you.

119
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,080
Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. So she sits on...

120
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
And she's milfy. And she has a Lego butt.

121
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Yeah, but then if I have to get up to go to the bathroom, she's gonna like...

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
It's like a whole thing.

123
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,080
She's gonna bend over into the seat in front of me and then I'm gonna like...

124
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
No, you take her...

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Excuse me, sorry.

126
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,080
No, you take her body, you take the top part of her body and you just take her legs with you.

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Listen, I'd love to...

128
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Okay, so I pee through the...

129
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
You pee through one of the Lego butt holes.

130
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,080
I'd love to help with the accommodations of a MILF in the airport before and after the flight,

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,920
But on a plane, that's the sacred time of relaxation and sitting in my own seat.

132
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,040
Nothing is more relaxing than just flying on a plane.

133
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm saying I need to be relaxed.

134
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,960
Shooting 60 million miles an hour.

135
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,760
I truly needed to get this lady away from him.

136
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,800
I've done enough flying that I've gotten to the point where I just pretend that I'm not flying.

137
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,920
When I get on a plane now, in my head, I'm like, "I am on the bus."

138
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
Yeah.

139
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,440
I can't do that.

140
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,280
I'm on the bus or the train.

141
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I really can't.

142
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
I try.

143
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
It doesn't work.

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
Well, because it's really hard because then you look outside and the world is this big.

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
You know what it is?

146
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,860
You've got to start sitting in the aisle seat.

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
It doesn't make any difference.

148
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,800
Can you imagine that first flight, man?

149
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
The Wright Brothers?

150
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh my God.

151
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Kitty Hawk.

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
We were just there.

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,200
We were close to Kitty Hawk.

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Now it is.

155
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
They flew on a Kitty Hawk.

156
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
They'd probably be the Wright sisters.

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Probably be the wrong sisters.

158
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Yeah.

159
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
No, they didn't fly.

160
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
It was called Kitty Hawk.

161
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Animal?

162
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
place where they were and the Wright brothers, one of them

163
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,700
pushed the plane and then the other flew the plane.

164
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
So where did they fly to?

165
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
Just in a, like an up and down.

166
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
So they didn't even go anywhere.

167
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
They flew from Kitty Hawk to Kitty Hawk. That doesn't even count.

168
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,700
The first time there was a place to place

169
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,700
plane flight was Amelia Earhart and we all know how that turned out.

170
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Well that was a place to no place flight.

171
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Well she was saying I'm gonna go.

172
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,700
That was the first flight where there was no destination at all.

173
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,340
saying I'm gonna go transatlantic on them. What if Amelia Earhart just

174
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,340
like got trapped in like a an Amazonian village and decided hey I'm gonna stay

175
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,300
here with these hot ladies. That's probably what she did I mean that's what

176
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,940
I would do yeah yeah that's the thing there's so many undiscovered tribes in

177
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:36,180
the world and on the entire planet. Of women who have been bred into having humongous breasts.

178
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,180
I would love to bring my kind of... And the guys are this big so you show up and

179
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,580
you're like over four feet tall.

180
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,020
- Yeah, it's a death by snoo snoo situation.

181
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,500
- Oh my god, yeah, we're gonna go Futurama on this guy.

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,580
- I think I would really like to kind of meet up

183
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,060
with some of these undiscovered tribes

184
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,580
who have made no contact with humanity

185
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,180
and bring them some of my ideas, literature, and food.

186
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,020
- I think I wanna--

187
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,460
- I want them to show them Green Day.

188
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,380
- I wanna show them kind of how I see the world

189
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,200
and maybe see--

190
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,820
- Bro, if you showed one of these,

191
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,540
if you showed an undiscovered Amazonian tribe Green Day,

192
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,700
it would kill them.

193
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,020
- What's that one place where you're not allowed to go?

194
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,500
- That island where they throw spears at the cameras?

195
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,340
- Yeah, one place where Cameron's the only guy who's--

196
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,740
I think it's technically a violation of some international law to do it.

197
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Couldn't you do a little bit of...

198
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,740
Patrick got really in one of the baby's faces during the flight, by the way.

199
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
I didn't want to bring it up until he said that, but...

200
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
What do you mean you got really into a baby's face?

201
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
When we were getting up to leave the plane, he was like this.

202
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
And he didn't even smile.

203
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Why'd you do that?

204
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
You know when you smile at a baby and wave?

205
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
He didn't smile, he just waved.

206
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,740
And then he did this.

207
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
[imitates baby's face]

208
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
You slid your finger across his throat?

209
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
You slid your finger across your throat as if you were slitting it?

210
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
I threatened the kid because he wouldn't shut up.

211
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
Why?

212
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Why are you... that's rude.

213
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,740
that's just put headphones in man I had headphones in then you're just then

214
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,460
you're the baby you're and I had headphones and all I could hear was well

215
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,300
I was playing all you could hear okay maybe I did have a weird playlist on go

216
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,260
ahead and tell me what it is baby screams 10 hours then why that's what it

217
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,300
just blended right in baby was smiling good idea I think the baby was smiling

218
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,020
you get you immediately get desensitized babies the babies weren't really when

219
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,660
babies were not annoying on the flight at all I have to say well I really have

220
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,660
- I brought up the babies because Patrick said that I wasn't allowed to.

221
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,660
- No, but earlier you said, and we were on the plane.

222
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,660
- Oh, he didn't even hear that.

223
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,660
- Before you got here.

224
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
- I forgot you're the one with the headphones.

225
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,660
- Before he got here, you were like, yeah, we were on the flight and there was three babies on the plane.

226
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
- They were loud, but they were not annoying.

227
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
They were not crying.

228
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
They were just screaming.

229
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,660
- What?

230
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,660
- They were screaming, laughing.

231
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,660
- Oh, well, that's adorable.

232
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,660
- Exactly.

233
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,660
It wasn't that bad.

234
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,660
- Oh, all right.

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,660
- Yeah, but it is just crazy to get sat next to three babies.

236
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
- That is like worst luck.

237
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,660
They started screaming and crying right when we landed.

238
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
How about Octomom?

239
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
On a plane?

240
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
While all her babies are there?

241
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Octomom on a plane? That's the movie.

242
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
And you got Samuel.

243
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
She's on the soul plane.

244
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I'm gonna fucking kill, or get these fucking babies out of this.

245
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
I'm tired of these motherfucking octomoms.

246
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
When we were landing...

247
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
There's an octomom?

248
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
Oh my god.

249
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Bad octomom.

250
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
Here's a question.

251
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,460
It's like a mom's, it's like a, it's like a dirty mom's movie.

252
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Listen.

253
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Right?

254
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,020
So she's, it's all of these other octomoms.

255
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Okay.

256
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:15,340
And they're all, they're all going to Miami to get more pregnant.

257
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
So here's the question.

258
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,340
That's scary.

259
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,520
That's what makes it scary.

260
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,980
It's all these octomoms in heat.

261
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
If there's a whole plane.

262
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,420
And there's one guy on the plane.

263
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,900
There's an entire plane full of octomoms, right?

264
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,220
Literally at all 150 seats, all octomoms.

265
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,540
and then they all are right about to burst.

266
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,060
They all start giving birth at the same time.

267
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,140
So now there's fucking eight more for every person.

268
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,980
- Yeah, it'll make the plane heavier.

269
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,260
- Yeah, the plane crashes, right?

270
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,100
- Yeah. - Probably.

271
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,060
- It has to, 'cause a plane can fit 150 people.

272
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,180
- I mean, even besides the weight thing.

273
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,700
- 950 people?

274
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,740
- I think even besides the, well,

275
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,580
I don't think it's a weight thing

276
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,080
because the babies are already in the mom's bellies

277
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,940
if they're that close to being born.

278
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,660
I don't think the weight on the plane changes at all.

279
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,260
- No, the weight's different 'cause it's more people.

280
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,540
- Okay, but I do think the plane would still crash

281
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,180
because you're imagine you're the pilot and the stewardess knocks on the door and

282
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,540
says eight hundred babies were just born. I think you...

283
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,620
Eight hundred babies were just born and there's a hundred and fifty more on the

284
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,340
way. I think that I may might just crash the plane out of instinct because

285
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,980
this cannot be a thing that happens on earth. I think that twelve hundred babies

286
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,140
being born at one time... That might be the most beautiful sound in the world. Might honestly be...

287
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,620
The babies would probably all harmonize. Yeah. Some of them will. Yeah. We're not going to say all

288
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:40,080
all

289
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,080
counting your fingers right now. Oh you're talking about going up and down?

290
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,360
That's yeah yeah that's 16. So you cover every... Okay I guess that is 8.

291
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm thinking of the babies covering every octave is what I mean. So you're

292
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,840
saying this might be something that might be sampled in hip-hop for decades

293
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,120
to come. So you know you know how that you know that song I'm not in love by 10cc?

294
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,520
I think the babies should all sing happy birthday because it's their birthday.

295
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,720
Whose job is it to sing happy birthday to all these damn babies?

296
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'll do it.

297
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm a good singer.

298
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
It would fucking ruin everything.

299
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm rushing the cockpit and I'm pressing the intercom button and I'm singing happy birthday

300
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
to these fucking babies.

301
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Doing Skyler White.

302
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Marilyn Monroe kind of thing.

303
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Yeah, exactly.

304
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
It's a Marilyn Monroe kind of thing.

305
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Yeah.

306
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:40,400
But then it ruins the, basically air travel is fucking ruined forever because now that's

307
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,560
going to be the number one most amazing thing that ever happened.

308
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
150 octomoms, what are the odds they give birth at the same time on the same plane at

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
the same time the plane crashes.

310
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,600
Now, and everyone survives, or at least some of them survive.

311
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,120
1,350 people and then the crew and stuff.

312
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
Well at that point the mommy's bellies are just rafts.

313
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,840
But well that's true.

314
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
That's true.

315
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,840
So all the water goes in their hee-haw.

316
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,840
But then now every year all these people have to have a reunion and do a reunion flight.

317
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,840
In a couple of years, these kids are full grown.

318
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,840
By age two or three, they're all five or six feet tall.

319
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,840
They all have hit growth spurts, and they're all loud, their voices are getting deeper.

320
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,840
"Hey, Mama, can we go do the anniversary plane trip with my 1,200 cousins?"

321
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
We'll just call them cousins.

322
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
They're basically cousins at that point.

323
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,740
they all the same father. I would say that's it that would be like a week

324
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,040
after this news story happens that might be National Enquirer front page news.

325
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,540
Yeah, and they all had the same dad. Yeah, and then that guy's getting

326
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,140
quarantined because something's up. Something's going on. Stop sperm.

327
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,040
They would probably that guy would disappear forever. You got to get it.

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,940
They would they would that would be like, you know, in like a in a in a

329
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,140
movie when they discover an alien and the alien just disappears because the

330
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,240
government just takes it permanently or someone superpowers. That's that's

331
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I think I will just be in a lab for the rest of this.

332
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
Yeah, he's going to be under Arizona.

333
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,640
So I brought up the 10cc song, because back in the 70s, the way they recorded that was

334
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,080
they had the mixer board and they had four people singing a note, and then they would

335
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,420
like slide up, like the breathy synths in that song are all just the mixer.

336
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,520
So you do that with all the babies on the plane, you go there with a field recorder,

337
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,840
go in there you record every single one of those babies harmonizing uh-huh then

338
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,540
you have the craziest synth sound in the world. You're right. I don't think you need

339
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,720
to be on a plane to do that though. Yeah but if they're all octomom babies and

340
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,040
then if there's one music producer who's also on the plane who has a field

341
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,600
recorder. They're also, you gotta think about it, they're half-brothers too. Yeah. So they're

342
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,520
ancestors, they're half-sisters. There's no girls. That's the other thing man. It's all boys.

343
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,640
called the Octomom Plain Baby Orchestra.

344
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,120
If it's all boys this might be the most

345
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,680
interesting news story to ever happen. This is like amazing that we're even thinking of it.

346
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
Even the thought of this should be a news story. I feel like it would be like

347
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
Dune. I think that these would be like like a new race of like like babies that

348
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,360
know everything about the world and just kind of take over. That has got to be one

349
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,700
of the most amazing things to ever happen. It would either be that or it would be like a

350
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,720
duplicity situation where one of the babies is very smart and then they have

351
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,600
no cities there's no sister yeah yeah one of the babies is very smart it's like

352
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,640
village of the dam smart on a plane type and then you keep going down the line

353
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,200
and they just keep getting every single sibling right they're not clones or

354
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,880
anything or it could be a despicable me situation they're all there made their

355
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,280
minions of the pilot or wow you just found it yeah the truth that's the

356
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,040
statement they have to grow up to become minions yeah they have to be there

357
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,360
forever indebted if the pilot lands the plane successfully they have to be

358
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,080
slated yeah they literally have to I just don't know what to tell I think the

359
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,320
minions are slaves I think they're a hundred percent slayer right aren't

360
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,800
slaves they do that are they getting paid buddy keep telling yourself that

361
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,040
those are fucking slaves they're literally a race of slaves that were

362
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,160
there a race of slaves we have stockhold slave home syndrome and love being

363
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,680
slaves yeah I guess it's true huh yeah it's fucking yeah they all have their

364
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,200
own weight they'll they get literally dances but they all get but they get

365
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,900
ordered by grew to do stuff and sometimes they're like I don't want to do

366
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,480
it and grew makes them do it and they don't get paid well they don't really

367
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,400
say I don't want to do what Gru wants. Sometimes Gru is like go do this and Minions are like

368
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,880
"Nah, do your number, bro!" Think about how evil, like if he was actually evil he'd be like

369
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,880
go finger that old woman and they're not gonna, the Minions are too nice for that,

370
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,480
but they're probably doing it anyway. They would do it if Gru asked for it because they're loyal

371
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,000
to Gru. Yeah, they're loyal, they're more loyal to Gru than they are to their own kind of Minion

372
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,960
morality. Does Gru punish the Minions? Yes. I think Gru punishes the Minions. He puts their

373
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,240
faces in their own shit. Is there a scene in the movie where he punishes the Minions? Yeah,

374
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,280
One of them takes a sh- a stinking brown shit.

375
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,440
Yeah, the minion forgets to use- how to use the bathroom.

376
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
And he puts his nose in-

377
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,800
"You're going to get your poop in the face!"

378
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,440
Mm-hmm.

379
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
And he rubs it in.

380
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,160
"You're going to get poop in your own face!"

381
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
I never understood that.

382
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,840
Why am- why is it that every time Phil takes a poop in here, I'm ru-

383
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,840
Why am I rubbing his face in his poop?

384
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,320
That doesn't make any sense.

385
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
That's the thing.

386
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,240
Dogs love to eat shit.

387
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,240
I know, he just eats his own shit, dude.

388
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,080
One time, I swear to God, he put a little bit of the end of one of his shits in his mouth

389
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,240
and then slurped the log up like spaghetti.

390
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,880
Jesus Chri-

391
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
Why would you tell me that?

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,480
That is so gross.

393
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,360
The image of a dog slurping up poop like spaghetti.

394
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,720
I mean it was more like he like lapped it up, but it went-

395
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,920
as like one log went into his mouth and he probably swallowed it whole.

396
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,840
That's pretty nasty.

397
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,960
That is disgusting.

398
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,080
Do you think people want to have that mental image?

399
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,880
Do you like me?

400
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,080
These people who are listening to this right now are on their-

401
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,440
Do you fucking like me? Do you just hate me?

402
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,240
-on their way to work or something.

403
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,520
Do you just hate me for no reason?

404
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,480
They're gonna be working at like, I don't know, Sabaro or some shit.

405
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,280
Whoever listens to this probably works at Subway,

406
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,520
and they're probably going to be making a sandwich today,

407
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,040
and then they're going to be putting butter or something down

408
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,240
onto a piece of bread, and think about the dog poop getting slurped up,

409
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,280
and they're going to imagine the stick of butter as the poop,

410
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,960
and they're going to think the whole time, "Yeah, Caleb put that in my head

411
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,160
on my commute here, on my job where I'm making $12 an hour."

412
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,800
Look at how much you're making him cry.

413
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,920
Tears are literally rolling down his face.

414
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Take a picture of him.

415
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,260
And know that you did this.

416
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,840
Good.

417
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,260
I literally saw a full tear go down his face.

418
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,380
Oh wait, check this out.

419
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,480
Dr. Santa.

420
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,120
Doctor, that's a good license plate.

421
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,960
Dr. Santa.

422
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,780
This will cheer you up, Caleb.

423
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,360
Take a look.

424
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,520
That's next to your house.

425
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,080
You can go see that right now.

426
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,520
If anyone is listening and

427
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,440
works at a pizza place and is putting butter on bread,

428
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
And he's upset about my dogs

429
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,520
My dog slurping up a piece of poop like spaghetti. I'm sorry. I just like to say that

430
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,040
Why do you apologize?

431
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,660
We move I think we moved past this right? Yeah, I think we can I think we can move forward

432
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,940
I'm okay. Okay when we were on the flight not to go back to the flight, but to go back to the flight

433
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,440
We were on the flight when we were landing. There was some crazy turbulence and the flight attendant came on the intercom

434
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,840
Well, they came on the intercom one time and they were like,

435
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
"There's going to be some turbulence where we're landing,

436
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
so everyone like sit down and strap in."

437
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,640
And then like there was some crazy turbulence.

438
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
And a minute later, they were like,

439
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,000
"There's going to be some even crazier turbulence,

440
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
so stay sat down and stay strapped in.

441
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,560
And also if you have a baby, like hold them really tight."

442
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,120
(laughs)

443
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,360
Yeah.

444
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
(laughs)

445
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
And if you don't have a baby, grab a Bible.

446
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,040
Just an instant like prophetic flash of a banned scene from Final Destination.

447
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,880
Why are you proud of that? Why are you...

448
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,040
That's okay. No, I didn't want to finish talking.

449
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,720
Yeah, tell your story, Cameron. I'm sorry.

450
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
I basically, I said basically what I thought was funny and it was completely

451
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,080
paved over by Patrick showing a picture that no one else can see.

452
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,120
Oh it's the picture of Caleb crying and it says "I'm proud of this."

453
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Now Cameron's crying. Wait.

454
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Come on Pat. Look, I mean, you just ruined his story.

455
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
I'm in my evil era now.

456
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,800
You fucking, look at him.

457
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Yep.

458
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
You ruined his, you're a fucking menace dude.

459
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry my story wasn't funny.

460
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,300
It's okay Cam, it really, it was funny but he got interrupted by this guy putting his

461
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,260
phone in your face.

462
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,400
And I think that's fucking dispa- and I was giving you the- don't look to your right.

463
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Don't look to your right right now.

464
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm s- don't.

465
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
There we go.

466
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Don't look over there, don't be tempted.

467
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Okay, now you can look.

468
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
No, no he-

469
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
*screaming*

470
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,120
He pulled- he held up the middle finger and then he switched to the pinky.

471
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,400
You can't cry because Phil is gonna-

472
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Oh yeah, Phil's looking at you like you're a bird.

473
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,040
- Phil needs you to-- - Oh, he's trying to come to you.

474
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,960
- Phil's trying to-- - Oh, he's stretching.

475
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,040
He's warming up, dude.

476
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,920
Dude, the cone is killing me, bro.

477
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,520
- He's coming over, he's trying to give you

478
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,560
emotional support. - He's so shitty

479
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
with the cone. - I made you so cry.

480
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
- It's cone. - I made you so sad.

481
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,360
- That's right, buddy.

482
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,240
Say it again, Kim, yeah. - Yay, yay!

483
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,480
- It's cone. - It's cone, yes.

484
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,720
- So we had to, we were in North Carolina

485
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,240
and then Caleb had to go home a day early

486
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,720
'cause Phil got neutered.

487
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
He has no nuts.

488
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
He has zero penis.

489
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
They didn't let you keep it, right?

490
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
No penis?

491
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Yeah, he keeps his penis.

492
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
No, the nuts.

493
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
The nuts.

494
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
I didn't ask for the nuts.

495
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
You didn't ask for them?

496
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Wouldn't you?

497
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
You said you were going to.

498
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
I forgot.

499
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
You said you were going to keep them in a jar.

500
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I didn't even go.

501
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
I didn't even drop them off.

502
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,440
You know how with every, like, imagine, okay, look right there.

503
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,400
You see the corn broom and shit and the rug and everything?

504
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
Don't say I have a corn broom.

505
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
You have a corn broom.

506
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,720
People don't need to know this shit about me, dude.

507
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,440
you just say yeah right next to the 60, 66 inch flat screen and a red TV for Samsung?

508
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,600
Right next to this original Rothko painting, right?

509
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,520
Oh no, that's, that betrays me. No, right next to the Dolby 5.1 digital, right next to the

510
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
fuckin' giant-

511
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,160
Right next to this neon Saint Polly girl-

512
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
That's right.

513
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Sign.

514
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,480
Right next to the foam spray cave that, uh, uh, what kind of texture that I put on the

515
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
wall.

516
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Yeah, so right underneath that-

517
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,680
I should get a man cave in here. I think we have one section, one corner of it.

518
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,760
this like all these candlesticks and shit imagine right there a jar of your dog's

519
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:07,960
pickled nuts are they red what if what about red like imagine it right there it

520
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,480
would go amazing with this with your homes aesthetic it would be kind of cool

521
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,080
yeah I didn't even think about it honestly I was so I was so thinking

522
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,640
about other things that I didn't even think to say, "Can you put these in formaldehyde

523
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,400
and let me look at them at night?"

524
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,120
And I probably would have put googly eyes on him.

525
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
Yeah.

526
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,760
That would have been such a good thing to have.

527
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I also feel like he's definitely been lacking vital energy, vital male energy since he's

528
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
been neutered.

529
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,640
Well, you can just put testosterone in his food.

530
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,600
Well, but I was thinking, can you?

531
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,320
You can just put male enhancement stuff in his food.

532
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,760
Just like extends and shit?

533
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,520
extends like my brother my younger brother used to have these pills they

534
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,200
were red pills that were just like testosterone it was called male

535
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,700
testosterone plus for a dog no for a guy oh but you could just break up those

536
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,220
pills and hide it in his food I don't think I'm gonna do that I was saying is

537
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,840
maybe he would if he had eaten his own ball his balls he would have at least

538
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,920
gotten some of that back oh like yeah placenta yeah like just like hormonal

539
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,680
thing. I really just think like imagine just having like one day your friend was

540
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,080
like do you want to go over here and you said yeah and then you woke up the next

541
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,340
day your balls are just gone like you're gonna be feeling pretty bad but then if

542
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,200
he was like... I guess the analogy is more like your parents your parents

543
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,280
your parents take you to the fair yeah and then you go to the hall of mirrors.

544
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
I guess it's less your parents, it's more your owners. Yeah yeah your master. It's

545
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,040
probably your owners or your master and it's probably that they take you to the

546
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,360
vet. Okay. And then the vet takes out your balls. I don't like to say master with my dog.

547
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,880
But I also don't like to be like, "Oh, I'm his rescuer." Let's just say owners. Yeah.

548
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,120
He's an item. I think that people who, I think you don't, you

549
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,400
should never call yourself your dog's parent. I think it's really weird. Yeah.

550
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,280
Yeah. No, there's a lot of weirdos who call themselves, who talk about, like at

551
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,880
the dog park, they'll be like, "Oh, this other, this dog, his parents are over

552
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,480
there I'm like yeah parents really there's - oh really there's two dogs

553
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,240
over there oh really oh he lives with two dogs you fucking idiot

554
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,880
since you mean it's master yeah don't you mean it's master and mistress yeah

555
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,920
yeah word yeah I guess it is mistress huh what's up the male don't even say

556
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,640
this fucking boners yeah well that's the thing it's like fucking tons of fucking

557
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,280
boners. Well think about like the... I'm thinking about them. Okay so like master

558
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,360
has an evil connotation to it but mistress has a sexy connotation. Master

559
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,100
doesn't have an evil connotation. Yeah it does. Oh I've mastered the

560
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,480
katana. I'm a chess master. I'm a grand wizard. Yeah but those both have...

561
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,500
Mastered is in past tense and then chess master has like a qualifier. Okay okay.

562
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm a master at chess.

563
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
That's still a qualifier.

564
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
That's still...

565
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
What are you talking...

566
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Okay, I'm a master of slaves.

567
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
That's a qualifier.

568
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
That's evil.

569
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
That's a qualifier.

570
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
But it is a qualifier, so I guess that I am wrong.

571
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
I am a master...

572
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,100
What if I'm playing chess and I say I am a master?

573
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Master chef.

574
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,220
And then my slave brings me a martini.

575
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,100
Your little house of cards has come tumbling down.

576
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,700
Oh, oh.

577
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
He didn't even know what a master chef was.

578
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,700
No, no, I thought...

579
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
This guy's a fucking alien.

580
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I should.

581
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,740
I wait man I think I did immediately master trying to say Master Chief Master

582
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,220
Chef Master Chief - yeah that's a title Master Chief and he's also he's also not

583
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,700

that

593
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,140
bad boys. Oh, I thought you meant like Rumbles like a 1950s fight.

594
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,340
No, that's not bad boys like Martin Lawrence, bad boys like Sean Penn.

595
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,860
West Side Story. Million Dollar Baby. That's Rumblecore. Million Dollar Baby, Stumblecore.

596
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,980
Stumblecore. Yeah. Grumblecore, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

597
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:10,980
The Waterboy, GumboCore. Saw, Chumblecore. I would say that Pacific Rim is GundamCore.

598
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,660
Yeah. What else? What else do we got in here?

599
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,980
Condomcore is on all that stuff on porn.

600
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Zack and Miri make a porno.

601
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
That could be it too.

602
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
Cummingherdcore.

That Lieutenant Porter Carlowizzi.

605
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,980
I would say any movie that you watch at a

606
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Regal or AMC theater is comfortcore.

607
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Because of those big nice seats.

608
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Also comfortcore,

609
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,980
what's that

610
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
fucking...

611
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,980
Uniclo.

612
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
Yeah.

613
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,980
That's comfort core.

614
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Uh-huh.

615
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Holy crap, those fucking fit me well.

616
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Those Uniclo socks are great.

617
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
Yep.

618
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,940
I straight up, I never wore anything from Uniclo before.

619
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:59,500
We can't do any, as a fucking, we can't wear those clothes if you're not like 100 pounds.

620
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Yeah.

621
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
The Uniclo clothes.

622
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,540
Oh, no, they hug me in all the wrong ways.

623
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
They're not for...

624
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,860
I bought a suit there for a wedding and it looked good on me.

625
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
Really?

626
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
Yeah.

627
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
They do make clothes for fat guys now.

628
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Wow, really?

629
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
That's big for a Uniqlo.

630
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,700
I used to walk into Uniqlo when I was a little tad bit heavier.

631
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,200
I'd walk into Uniqlo and I'd be...

632
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,860
Well, they're making oversized stuff.

633
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,180
I'd be sitting there and I'd say, "Hey, where's the men's section?"

634
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,860
He's like, "The whole thing's men's, buddy.

635
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
The whole floor is men's."

636
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,860
I'd say, "Really?

637
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,860
You want me to wear blue?"

638
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
They got that giant Uniqlo in Boston.

639
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
I wouldn't say it's giant.

640
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Pretty big.

641
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,180
Two floors, it's pretty big.

642
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,500
two floors vertically. Yeah, I guess you're right. Two floors vertically is not that big.

643
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:50,940
Yeah, but horizontally it'd be huge. Horizontally two floors? Yeah, that'd be really huge. That's

644
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:59,260
really impressive stuff. What's that other, Muji? Muji I like a lot. Muji is the best.

645
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,220
I used to go into Muji and take a nap on the beanbag chair. Which Muji did you take a nap

646
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,220
during

647
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,940
it wait do you know how to call a Mooji think about his wordplay first so I

648
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:21,180
think what's called a Mooji a movie emoji movie is probably yeah go ahead try that

649
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,980

You can click like a cheetah.

653
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
We should get on.

654
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Are you seriously talking, did you fell asleep during the emoji though?

655
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,460
Yeah, well I actually never even saw the emoji.

656
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,020
I saw Wreck-it Ralph.

657
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
That's kind of a sin.

658
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,460
TJ Miller is in the emoji movie.

659
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,460
That's right.

660
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
Oh, Ralph the Wreck?

661
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,940
Yeah, what emoji does he play?

662
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,700
Fucking sexual misconduct emoji?

663
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I don't even remember.

664
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
TJ Miller, that's the movie.

665
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
Is he the main character?

666
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
He's the main character.

667
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
He plays Meh.

668
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,420
Wait, Meh is the main character in the emoji?

669
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,420
It's not Smile?

670
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,420
No, it's Meh.

671
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
Well, his name is Gene.

672
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,100

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,040
- Let me get some water while you find this.

682
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,180
- Could you get me some water, too?

683
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,880
- Okay, so my, the main character would be star eyes emoji.

684
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
- Really? - Yeah.

685
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,100
- Star eyes? - Uh-huh.

686
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,180
- You use that often?

687
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,420
- I use that a lot.

688
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,220
- Mine is just grinning.

689
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,680
Mine is normal grinning. - And then a neutral-faced emoji

690
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,600
would be the second character, and then the heart hands one

691
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,440
would be third place.

692
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,480
- Is it go down or across?

693
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,320
- Down.

694
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,140
- Down?

695
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,980
Okay, so mine is--

696
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,000
- And then laughing.

697
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,800
- Mine is grinning, swearing, and grinning.

698
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,040
- Basketball clown.

699
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,600
- Okay, so basketball clown.

700
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,440
There's a basketball clown emoji?

701
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,600
- I'm writing a movie right now based on those characters.

702
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
- Starry eyes emoji.

703
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,480
- Main character, starry eyes.

704
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,520
- He has, he's blind.

705
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,860
- What? No he's not, he's blind.

706
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,960
- Because his eyes are made out of stars.

707
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,960
But he can only see the world through music

708
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,880
because his name is music, right?

709
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,840
- His name is music?

710
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,440
- Uh-huh, and his mom--

711
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,820
- Wait, what?

712
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,520
- Wait, this is the plot of music.

713
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,360
- Okay.

714
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
- Hold on, I just watched that.

715
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,960
- Starry Eyes?

716
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,920
- I just watched the movie Music by Sia.

717
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,200
So let me just, okay, let me start over.

718
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Okay, so the starry eyes,

719
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:42,160
guy, his, okay, so he's blind but he's also deaf and mute.

720
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:52,100
And then his teacher teaches him how to say water.

721
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,640
That's the Helen Keller biopic.

722
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Hold on.

723
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Okay.

724
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,400
My most recently used are skull.

725
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,760
skull you just to get an idea of what kind of what kind of text I send a skull

726
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,720
emoji fire emoji 100 emoji and goat emoji a lot of commenting on basketball

727
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:24,280
Instagram okay TV starry eyes is blind because it was no maybe I should go okay

728
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:32,780
Okay, so StarryEyes is a little boy in London and he meets his friend Bernie Taup.

729
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,080
Nope, that's Rocketman.

730
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,480
Alright, your movie, your Muji is cancelled.

731
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I can't do it.

732
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
You rate my movie.

733
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
What would your movie Muji be about?

734
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,400
Okay, let me pull up my list here real quick.

735
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Alright so basically my first one is a smiler.

736
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,880
The complete grinner.

737
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,680
So maybe the first what's up just something that it's really good.

738
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Yeah, okay.

739
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,880
It'd be it's a be a smiler.

740
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,480
Okay, so this I guess is good.

741
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Here's my okay my here.

742
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,880
I'll just run through the plot of my movie really get really quick.

743
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,080
Yeah, you just said movie, but yeah, well you guys taught me what it was.

744
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Okay.

745
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm basically your teacher slash master slash owner.

746
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Sure.

747
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,760
Okay.

748
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,840
So basically there's a guy and he's smiling grinning with his eyes open and his mouth

749
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,540
open grinning yeah, then he

750
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
swears. Okay, something

751
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,440
happens that make him he

752
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,040
makes him say and dollar

753
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,740
number percent.

754
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,140
See stubs his toe.

755
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,040
Yeah, he stubs his toe

756
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,940
then he but then he

757
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
grins again this time with

758
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,940
his eyes and mouth both

759
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,140
closed. Wow, and then he

760
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,440
has and then his heart.

761
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,140
So I'm seeing there's a

762
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,340
heart emoji. So maybe his

763
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,040
something happens to his

764
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,140
heart and then the next

765
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
one's neutral. So maybe

766
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,840
his heart it flatlines

767
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
like the flat line of the

768
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,640
mouth and then his eyes

769
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,940
go wide and he blushes

770
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,140
the blood God is is

771
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,660
rushing to his head. God damn it. And then he's gritting his teeth here as he's having

772
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,100
a heart attack. And then he's very sad. Or it could be, this could also just be he's in

773
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,340
a coma or dead. Christ. And then he's smirking and smiling. Oh, that's good. Yeah, maybe

774
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,580
he's having a dream in the coma. Oh, okay. And then he's frowning again, so maybe he's...

775
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,180
So he woke, maybe he had a bad dream. Yeah, and then, oh, well then we got an eyes open

776
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:17,140
emoji, so that's him waking up from the coma. And then he's sweating, because he probably,

777
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,460
you probably sweat when you wake up from a coma. You wake up in a sweat. You wake up in

778
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:37,860
a

779
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,180
have us guess the movie based only on the emojis.

780
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:49,860
Okay, Halloween emoji. Halloween. Trick or treat. Yes, Caleb was right.

781
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,300
That was close. Okay, all right, this is for an upcoming movie that's not out yet.

782
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,940
Smile emoji. Smile. Okay, that's right. There's a movie called Smile.

783
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,460
So Caleb went home a day early. We didn't know what to do when we were in

784
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,580
North Carolina for a day because they basically we didn't have us to exist

785
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,380
when I'm not around we didn't know what to do because we didn't have a car yeah

786
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,300

793
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,860

794
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:55,100
Oh can he do it? I did it all myself. I bought clippers and I did it myself. I do remember

795
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,460
when you walked into me and Cam's bedroom and you had the clippers and we

796
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,780

No, then you'd be a tape man.

840
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,460
You wouldn't be a who.

841
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,900
That's true.

842
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,400

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,820

- And they just make her eat just giant sandwiches?

890
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,720

892
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,640

893
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,080
If you got a mouth that big, people are going to make you eat some crazy stuff.

894
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,700
Eat this can of spray paint.

895
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
She does.

896
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
That would fit.

897
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,700
Yeah.

898
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Husband, like, suck your breasts?

899
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,560
It's eight amazing benefits for wife.

900
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
Eight benefits provided by wife when you suck breasts.

901
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
One.

902
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
We got this photo here.

903
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Yeah.

904
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
So it's a photo of a man and a woman in bed.

905
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,840
It's not a photo of sucking breasts, but it looks like it's about to happen.

906
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
It could be about to happen.

907
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Show it.

908
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Show my thing.

909
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Let's just see it.

910
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Show me how old breasts suck, man.

911
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,760
Number one, improve your sex drive, wife.

912
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,060
Without this technique during sex may reduce sex drive his wife.

913
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Not only that the process of making love would be very boring and wife

914
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,460
becomes become less enjoy because the breast has many points of

915
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,160
sensitivity.

916
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,760
In fact in some situations lubricants.

917
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,560
She does not go out because of does not lubricants.

918
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,260
She does not go out because of lack of stimulation causing his wife

919
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,860
pain when performed penetration pain when performed penetration.

920
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,680
So they're saying that your wife will have a bigger hole if you shove her breast in your

921
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
mouth.

922
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Yeah.

923
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,400
I want to know how you found this website.

924
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,760
I found this website by the ghost content on here and then while I was looking for more

925
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,840
ghost stuff I came across a bunch of stuff on this website that was not ghost related

926
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
at all.

927
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
I don't like suck your breast.

928
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,920
Yeah, that makes sense.

929
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,080
Well unless this article was written by a ghost.

930
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:04,440
woman's um you know what yeah if you put her boo bees you know's into your mouth

931
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:19,160
then maybe her you know what goes that's how that's a sound yeah put a ringtone

932
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,160
in your wife yeah like touch - or tooth tunes yeah and when you're fucking you

933
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,500
hear like but that's the thing you have to have it at the right angle I'm a star

934
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,100
boy there's a problem with tooth tunes you had to really press them if you

935
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:40,000
didn't press the right angle and in here be awesome yeah I would have sex way

936
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,200
more often yeah that's the other problem it starts over they should do something

937
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,300
like that in women so that you know if you're doing good or not yeah yeah you're

938
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,740
I'm just like yeah, I'm probably probably just not doing all that good. I'm going

939
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,300
down there. I'm I'm trying to write water down there like I'm Helen Keller. Yeah,

940
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,020
and if you're

941
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:06,560
and if you're but if you're here and like you know, if you're down there and

942
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,920
you're here in New York, I love you, but you're bringing me down that might like

943
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,160
if you hear that when you're doing good. Yeah, right and you hear like maybe a

944
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,540
car or when you're bad or here's an alternate idea. That's kind of the

945
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,920
opposite you know the game operation yeah maybe you're doing something wrong and

946
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,680
your entire body goes no no no maybe big red yeah but it goes but you would feel

947
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,440
it up your body as well any pain so this idea is bad it wouldn't be pain it would

948
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,640
just be allowed it's not even painful for her maybe it is it's an idea that's

949
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,920
being worked for that's being workshopped by three geniuses three guys

950
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,120
in the sex industry huh I would say we're roughly in the set where sex industry

951
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,900
Adjacent we could go to the avian expo get a booth definitely. I act like a fucking slut. I dread

952
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,460
I'm so slutty. I showed the top of my head. Yeah

953
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,480
You you are so slutty you wanted to look more like a penis and I did a pretty damn good job

954
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,320
I think I even have like a nice like giant head that looks like a penis head

955
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,620
You should get you should get a line on top of your head. We mean I should get a line

956
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,400
Who do I go to me? Oh put a line in my head

957
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,320
You could go to a guy with a permanent marker or you could go to a tattoo artist

958
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,960
I think that's a pretty not we don't want to tattoo. You said a line. That's true. You couldn't get a tattoo of a line

959
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,440
That's my bad

960
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Of a line, but I couldn't get a line

961
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,640
Well, if you would say for example when you're getting a tattoo, you might say I'm getting a skull on my arm

962
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,320
Yeah, you can get a line on your head to of a skull

963
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,760
But you said put a line on my head some kind of put a line also just put a line on your head some abstract

964
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,040
2014 the hipster ass tattoo on your head. I should get a mustache on the top of my head at a bad angle. Yeah

965
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:51,280
Check this out

966
00:44:51,280 --> 00:45:02,480
Look what I hold it up. It looks like I have a mustache on my head wait wait put your face

967
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,880
face, but your face behind my head.

968
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,680
That's genius dude. Number two can detect any abnormalities in the breast wife.

969
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,780
Yeah, by manipulation of the breast area, then unwittingly husband had helped his

970
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,580
wife to conduct early detection of breast cancer. If abnormalities, then you

971
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,780
and your partner will immediately take action. This has early detection of

972
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,880
breast cancer. The ob gyn does when he goes, I put he puts this mouth. No, I'm

973
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,680
old school.

974
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:43,880
put your tits in his mouth? Yeah I do. This is an old pioneer technique that I still use.

975
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,300
That tastes like cancer. I'm a holistic OBGYN. That tastes exactly like a tumor. I kind of

976
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,300
feel like acupuncture is kind of close to that. These acupuncturists have got to be

977
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,620
doing something with women's rear ends. Yeah. Like putting a needle in their butt? Yeah.

978
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,020
yes yeah i think so

979
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,960
and this is the

980
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,280
this is the area in your body were for put a needle and it will actually help

981
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,620
uh... make a red dot on your skin

982
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:12,500
that's what that's kind of an idea and this is the effect is you have a red

983
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,740
this area yeah how did they not believe when you put you had a key puncture dot

984
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,960
i'm not a it's a tattoo it's not going all the way in

985
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,580
i'd be bleed i believe when i get to know you would you can believe when you

986
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,500
get to i've never bled people to tell people one tattoo some people to do this

987
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,820
So yeah, both of those don't count.

988
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:33,580
Some people bleed when they get vaccines and stuff too.

989
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
I do.

990
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
Really?

991
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,580
Do you actually?

992
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,780
My body is already trying to get that shit out of there.

993
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,780
That toxic shit.

994
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:43,180
I wish I could- I train my body to as soon as they put it in,

995
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,820
it's already, I squeeze it back out just so they have it on file, but I know that my body's

996
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,820
pure.

997
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,820
That's right.

998
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
It's like taking your meds, right?

999
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,820
You put them- I haven't taken them in five years.

1000
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,820
You hide it under your tongue.

1001
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,820
I hide the microchip under one muscle and then I pop it out straight away.

1002
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:58,980
I hide the microchip under one muscle and then I pop it out, straight pop, I pop my bicep

1003
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,980
out.

1004
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,980
It's like the shark tooth in the Woman King.

1005
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:01,980
And I'm getting a good pump too.

1006
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,460
It's exactly like the shark tooth in the Woman King.

1007
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,900
The movie Cameron and I saw.

1008
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,900
Shark tooth in the Woman King.

1009
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,900
You didn't see.

1010
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,900
Don't worry about it.

1011
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,900
Yeah, you wouldn't get it unless you saw the Woman King.

1012
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,900
Did you see this yesterday?

1013
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,900
No, don't worry about it.

1014
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,060
We're just going to move on to the next thing on the list because he's kind of harshing

1015
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,700
the vibe of us talking about our movie that we like.

1016
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,860
I've been the vibe man.

1017
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,180
No, we were just trying to talk about a movie that we liked and you were like, what's that?

1018
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,720
so I just want to know we just like we like talking to people who know the

1019
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,180
movie yeah and we shared popcorn in the week to you only like talking to

1020
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:35,200
people who know the movie yeah, okay, but I don't know who shared popcorn to

1021
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,780
and you know I what's it calling you

1022
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:43,020
shark tooth and the woman King or woman King, it's called right, who is no you

1023
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,700
saw it wait. Oh, I think I'm trying to I think I've actually seen that movie.

1024
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,140
When did you see it pretty recently actually really one yeah, like two

1025
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,740
three days ago. Maybe really I saw it. Yeah, I think so. Is your favorite

1026
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,780
character? I thought all the what was your favorite kingdom? I thought all the

1027
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,220
characters did a great job and there is no kingdom in it. So it's a proves that

1028
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,820
I'm completely did not completely did not see it or there is a kingdom. Sorry.

1029
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,140
I watch it in a different language. It wasn't called a kingdom. It was called. I

1030
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,020
don't remember it was in a language that I've never even heard of

1031
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,860
much to dub,

1032
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,500
but I actually really thought the movie was really good. So it's fine for us to

1033
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,520
keep hanging out and talking okay. Okay. Did you share popcorn with us when you

1034
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:33,960
saw it? I think I did share yeah. I think I did. Oh, mm-hmm. All right. I guess I

1035
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,640
can trust him. Yeah, I wouldn't expect him to lie to me. I guess yes, we wouldn't

1036
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,560
be a guy. You saw the movie wouldn't lie or like yeah. I mean well now that like

1037
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,440
the oil kingdom exactly now that we all here have seen it. I mean we can discuss

1038
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,280
like I thought that the the the oil kingdom when they rode horses. I was like

1039
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,260
get those horses out of the horses when the horses originally rode into the

1040
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,040
kingdom. I was like bad news. Yeah, bad news is coming and that's and that's and

1041
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,800
I was right and what did you say? What did you think of the the rapist

1042
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,160
character? I think either way, you know, it could be could be portrayed either

1043
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:08,560
way.

1044
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:16,800
Yeah, what really with most stuff in the movie, either which would just a lot of

1045
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Either way.

1046
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,880
What did you think about them stopping, the idea that they wouldn't sell people anymore

1047
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,880
and they would actually start selling palm oil?

1048
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,640
Well here's what I got.

1049
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,840
Opinions are like assholes.

1050
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
Everyone's got them, right?

1051
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,880
Or everyone's got one.

1052
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,080
So that's my thoughts on the movie, or not so far because I already finished it.

1053
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,040
But that's pretty much my thought on that film.

1054
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,880
And the director, a lot of people have a lot to say about them and I don't really.

1055
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,800
I just don't have that much to say.

1056
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,280
And the movie itself, the script I thought was really...

1057
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,680
And the location.

1058
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,680
The locations were...

1059
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Of DaHomie.

1060
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
Of what?

1061
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
DaHomie.

1062
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,680
Yeah, that was good too.

1063
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Yeah.

1064
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,680
I thought there was a lot of just, you know, I had a lot of takeaways and maybe I haven't

1065
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,440
fully processed the whole thing.

1066
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,440
Sure, yeah.

1067
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,720
There's a lot to talk about with that movie I guess.

1068
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,200
So we could do it on the next episode.

1069
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
We could do a full...

1070
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,200
Yeah, yeah, we'll do a full...

1071
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200
A full deep dive.

1072
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
I think if we turn into a...

1073
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,880
We think we should turn into a movies review.

1074
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,200
movies only? Yeah I think maybe movies only. And that's what it would be called. Holy movies

1075
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,560
only. Holy movies only. FMO. It's gonna be good. Number three. Can smooth the flow of

1076
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,280
blood. By sucking the breast and perform massage of the breast will make the blood flow to

1077
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,080
the breast wise to be smooth so could your partner's breast still tight and will not

1078
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,560
loose again. Suck the breast can also relieve stress in women. Yeah I love getting a breast

1079
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,680
massage. Is there fucking blood in boobies? Yeah I guess so. It's fucking disgusting.

1080
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,840
There's also white milk.

1081
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
Oh that's amazeballs.

1082
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,840
No, the balls have white jizz.

1083
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
Oh.

1084
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,840
Wait, what?

1085
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
You're thinking of amazeboobs.

1086
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
That's amazeboobs.

1087
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,280
That's amazeboobs.

1088
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,000
Number four is can tighten facial skin.

1089
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I know mine.

1090
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,720
I'll tell you this much, my loose wife needs this badly.

1091
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,600
Because of the time of sucking the breasts during sex will make the movements of the

1092
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,000
muscles in the wife's face.

1093
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,600
It is good for the sport faces.

1094
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,960
That aims to tighten the skin in muscles wife's facial area.

1095
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Sport faces?

1096
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,280
Yeah, so if you have a sporty wife.

1097
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,280
Okay.

1098
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,160
I guess my wife is decently tennis-like.

1099
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,160
Yeah.

1100
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Yeah?

1101
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Yeah.

1102
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,520
And she could play a sport.

1103
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,120
Okay, so this might be useful to you.

1104
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,520
Maybe I'll tighten her face.

1105
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,760
My wife constantly has yellow beads of sweat because of how much Gatorade she drinks.

1106
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Really?

1107
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,600
Yeah, and she's constantly in black and white, and the beads of sweat are in color.

1108
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
Wow, that's interesting.

1109
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,480
Is the bottle in color?

1110
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Yes.

1111
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,480
Oh.

1112
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
My wife...

1113
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,560
She's in black and white.

1114
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,880
- My wife's skin is so loose

1115
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,580
that she looks like a degloved apple.

1116
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,440
So I think I might use this technique to try and--

1117
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,280
- That's right.

1118
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,120
- Yeah.

1119
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,040
- You know what's so, when you come home

1120
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,840
and you see your wife and she looks like

1121
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,000
the skin that fell off of the rotisserie chicken.

1122
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,920
- Yeah, she looks, I get home and I'm like--

1123
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,080
- Baby, are you wearing your mom's skin today?

1124
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,440
- And I'm like, I forgot that I bought

1125
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,680
a Salvador Dali painting.

1126
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,360
- Yeah, I hate it when my wife sheds her skin

1127
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,960
and leaves it around the apartment.

1128
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,400
- Baby, are you malting?

1129
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Oh my god, she's molting again.

1130
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
You know, it's my wife's time of the month, she's molting.

1131
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
[Laughter]

1132
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Yeah, you know, I love her to death.

1133
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
I love her to death, but I could do...

1134
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
A full respect the pouch, just like deflated, fucking...

1135
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,400
I love my wife, but I could do without the skin on the floor.

1136
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, listen, we all love the wife.

1137
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,400
Look, she leaves her skin on the floor, I come out of the shower, the skin gets wet, I slip, I almost hit my head on the side of the tub.

1138
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
Mm-hmm.

1139
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,360
Number five, train the balance of the heart.

1140
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,080
With Breast Sucking Wife,

1141
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,980
we'll make the heartbeat faster than normal.

1142
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,700
It is good to practice healthy heart rhythm.

1143
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,360
- So you're making, I mean is it--

1144
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,480
- You speed up her heart by--

1145
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,320
- With like the suction?

1146
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,080
- I think it's you suck in and out to kind of--

1147
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,720
- And then contract, yeah. - Oh wow.

1148
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,080
- You're trying to suck her heart out of her boob

1149
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,680
like it's the Temple of Doom.

1150
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,480
- I want to suck your boob.

1151
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,200
- You're sucking the boob and you're going,

1152
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,120
"Kalima, Kalima!"

1153
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:10,360
And this makes her heart go into your mouth like through a portal.

1154
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,640
You suck it out like when it pops out of a cartoon.

1155
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,520
It's like a heart shaped tube that goes all the way back of skin or of fur.

1156
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
You can hear the SpongeBob guitar going.

1157
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,520
I love the SpongeBob guitar.

1158
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,640
I've been meaning to learn to play it.

1159
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,640
Number six.

1160
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,160
Little one with the four strings.

1161
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,920
Increase contractions after childbirth.

1162
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,520
contractions after childbirth and smooth the blood when menstrual pain arrived.

1163
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,880
Well this is very interesting. Turned out to suck the breast can prevent the

1164
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,160
occurrence of active bleeding after childbirth. Suction is performed will be

1165
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,200
made so that the maximum contraction of blood vessels in the uterus that had

1166
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,040
been wedged open back and make the blood stops. Menstrual pain has got to be hard

1167
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,080
AF. Honestly women are fucking metal. Yeah. Nature is kind of metal too. Yeah.

1168
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,560
Nature is metal for women's bodies. Metal as fuck. Yeah. Women are metal. Women's bodies are made out of

1169
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,400
metal hey at least the ones I talked to

1170
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,600
sex robot

1171
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:10,480

1172
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,480
Davis let me tell you do a sex robot that can torque

00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,840
holy shit well right now they can do is gyrate

1174
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:21,560
if they can do it working Boston dynamics robot with a brown metal ass

1175
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,680
be fucking like my shirt okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go through these last two

1176
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,600
really fast we can get to the other the other companion list here

1177
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,880
So this is seven, reducing pain during menstruation.

1178
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,860
At the time of menstrual pain, sucking at the breast,

1179
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,640
we're able to distract the woman from the pain that is felt

1180
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,640
on the other breast suction

1181
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,920
when the contractions become painful.

1182
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,080
Menstruation will make the maximum forcing

1183
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,560
in pure blood to be released.

1184
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,440
And number eight, losing weight with suction the baby

1185
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,480
through breastfeeding.

1186
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,420
With breastfeeding, it will accelerate your return

1187
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,240
to your ideal body shape originally

1188
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,840
because there'll be a fat burning calories

1189
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,920
while breastfeeding the baby.

1190
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,440
So it's great for your healthy diet.

1191
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,220
- So that's an easy way to cut if you're like an IFBB pro

1192
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,200
trying to make a bodybuilding competition

1193
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,920
is to have a baby suck your breast.

1194
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,720
- Yeah, so that's really good to know.

1195
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,560
- I didn't even know that.

1196
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,920
- There are a few comments here

1197
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,880
that are mostly links in other languages.

1198
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,800
- Well, I like this one, though.

1199
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,640
Go up a little bit.

1200
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,460
- Yeah.

1201
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,400
- Smaller breasts provide females a beautiful look.

1202
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,260
Make your breasts smaller and firmer.

1203
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,240
With the use of natural supplement, it is effective.

1204
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,500
- Interesting.

1205
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,800
Okay, I'm gonna move to the second list here that we have.

1206
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,020
It's called Five Technique How to Breast Sucking

1207
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:20,860
to Not Injury.

1208
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,080
- Wow.

1209
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,480
So is this, are you trying to get,

1210
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,960
Who's getting the breast, or the injury, is it the sucky or the sucker?

1211
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,000
I think it's unclear as of right now.

1212
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,880
And I think that, so first we learned the benefits of husband suck wife breast, and now maybe

1213
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,960
if you would like to implement some of these benefits in your life, we can learn how to

1214
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:49,040
do that safely without causing injury to either the husband mouth or wife breast.

1215
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,960
So this is women's breast sucking techniques to not injury.

1216
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,460
Yeah, it is way too big.

1217
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,460
That looks crazy.

1218
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,460
looks insane. Oh my God.

1219
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,220
Put some Chad Muska flair on it.

1220
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,220
You look crazy.

1221
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,220
You're jealous of my new hat.

1222
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,220
It's a cool hat.

1223
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,220
It is a cool hat.

1224
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,220
I got a cool new hat too.

1225
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,220
Do I look like Chad Muska?

1226
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,220
No.

1227
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,220
What was your new hat?

1228
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
I can't say what it was, but we bought it in North Carolina.

1229
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,220
Well, we'll just start.

1230
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:18,940
Number one, suction nipple or areola down to the black part around the nipple.

1231
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,980
This is done so that you not only do the manipulation of the nipple so that you make the nipples

1232
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:29,820
become sore, but it by sucking up areola area, then your partner will be able to enjoy and

1233
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,300
not feel sick at all.

1234
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,300
Areola area?

1235
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,300
Areola area?

1236
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,780
Areola area?

1237
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,780
So that's useful to know.

1238
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,260
In a corn maze gonna scare ya.

1239
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,260
Holy shit.

1240
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,700
Dressed up like a scarecrow.

1241
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,700
In a scarier area.

1242
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,260
Dirty jobs like a micro.

1243
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,780
Holy fuck dude.

1244
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,780
Areola area?

1245
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,780
Damn, he unlocked an M&M ability.

1246
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,260
That's a pit bull style terrier.

1247
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,260
Oh my god.

1248
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,420
Keep going, keep going.

1249
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,660
I got some poop coming from my derriere.

1250
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,660
Okay, keep going.

1251
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,380
You have two more bars you gotta do to finish the...

1252
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,100
And I'm in the closet.

1253
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,260
I ain't coming out.

1254
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,640
You're supposed to keep rhyming.

1255
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
You just started saying...

1256
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,640
'Cause my foot got the gout.

1257
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,640
Are you like...

1258
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
Bad case of gout.

1259
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,980
It really sounded for a second like he was just like trying to sneak in coming out to

1260
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,620
us.

1261
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:20,980
I got something to tell you later.

1262
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,480
in the middle of the impression.

1263
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,220
(laughing)

1264
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,240
- So you can actually save a woman,

1265
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,960
you can suck up all the areola.

1266
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,460
- Yeah, the black area.

1267
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,300
- And get it all--

1268
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,140
- What is the black area?

1269
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,980
(laughing)

1270
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,640
I sounded like Don Knotts for a second.

1271
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,900
What is the black area?

1272
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,560
- What is the black area of the areola?

1273
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,200
(laughing)

1274
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,340
- Why, what is the black area?

1275
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,680
- Number two, do palpability in the other breast

1276
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,160
that is not you smoke.

1277
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,560
- Do palpitinia.

1278
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,880
- If you know for sure about the shape

1279
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,160
of your partner's breasts,

1280
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,320
then if there are abnormalities such as tumors

1281
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,660
arising in the breast area,

1282
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,020
you are the first to know,

1283
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,080
so that remedial action can be done immediately.

1284
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,680
- Okay, so it's like remedial.

1285
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,520
- We already heard that.

1286
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,200
It's like a prevention technique is sucking your woman's

1287
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,040
breast. - But this is saying,

1288
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,860
this is saying-- - Remedial is a word

1289
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:12,440
I'm familiar with. - The other one you know

1290
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,480
is, this one says immediately.

1291
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,680
So I think you might be the person taking out the tumor.

1292
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,440
- Well here's what I, remedial is a word

1293
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,680
I'm very familiar with a lot of my classes were remedial.

1294
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,020
- Okay, that's perfect.

1295
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,480
- I think what they're saying here is it's so easy

1296
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,260
a caveman could do it.

1297
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,200
- Right. - Oh, really?

1298
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,680
- Yeah. - Listen, caveman,

1299
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,160
if you're listening, stay away from my fucking wife's breasts.

1300
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,000
That's not your job, that's mine.

1301
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,040
- Caveman, stay away from my cave.

1302
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,040
- Cavewomen. - Stay away from my fire.

1303
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,160
- What's up? - Yeah, what's going on?

1304
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,080
- What's up? - I bet that thing

1305
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,480
smells like PlayStation Air.

1306
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,720
- Do you think, (laughs)

1307
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,680
Do you think, shouldn't, just for fairness,

1308
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,200
you know, shouldn't a woman also have to suck your balls

1309
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,880
to see if you have testicular cancer?

1310
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,400
- Yeah.

1311
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,600
- And your asshole to see if you have polyps?

1312
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,360
- Getting your balls sucked hurts.

1313
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:03,200
- Who's sucking your damn balls so hard?

1314
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,840
- The friggin' Nunu from the Teletubbies?

1315
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,680
- Yo, what's up?

1316
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,500
- Yo, what's up?

1317
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,340
- What the fuck is up, boy?

1318
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,480
- I was gonna say Henry the vacuum.

1319
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,360
- Damn, damn, we just got your ass.

1320
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,200
- Henry the little red vacuum.

1321
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,040
- He getting sucked by Nunu.

1322
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,320
- Oh, shoot.

1323
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,440
Oh my God.

1324
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,700
Nah, not him getting snoo-snoo from Nunu.

1325
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,400
Holy, not Birdo sucking, yo, dick.

1326
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,760
Double TV reference.

1327
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,600
Yep.

1328
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,760
That's the noise it would make when Birdo sucked.

1329
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,040
Yeah.

1330
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,440
Yeah, and also the noise you made before.

1331
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,400
(whistles)

1332
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,240
Yeah.

1333
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,580
It doesn't hurt to get your balls sucked.

1334
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,680
(laughs)

1335
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,400
It's gotta feel good, man.

1336
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,640
I'm not even gonna finish this.

1337
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,840
It's like, damn, my balls are getting,

1338
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,480
I mean, it doesn't feel good on your balls,

1339
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
but in your head you're like, word.

1340
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,000
(laughs)

1341
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:44,840
My balls, man.

1342
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,720
There's this old interview show for skaters.

1343
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,760
It was called Weekend Buzz.

1344
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,560
And there's this guy--

1345
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,420
I bet that's awesome.

1346
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,920
Austin Gillette talked about getting a ball koozie.

1347
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,760
Yeah.

1348
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,560
Which is when you put your balls in hot water

1349
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,720
and the woman just blows into it with a straw.

1350
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,280
Nice.

1351
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,080
That guy should work for Urban Dictionary.

1352
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,580
Yeah.

1353
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah.

1354
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,520
That does actually work.

1355
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,840
He worked for Globe Footwear.

1356
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,880
And he made a skatable Chelsea boot.

1357
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,880
He's a globalist?

1358
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,380
Yep.

1359
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,360
Yeah, big surprise there.

1360
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:12,760
Yeah.

1361
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,960
Globalist skateboarder.

1362
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,960
Number three.

1363
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,720
Global skateboarders are ruining the country by making skatable Chelsea boots.

1364
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,080
Yeah, and inventing new fucking out-of-marriage ball techniques.

1365
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,080
Yep.

1366
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,080
Fuck that.

1367
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,080
Number three.

1368
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,480
Performed breast squeeze technique is also important when you suck the breast of your

1369
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,480
partner.

1370
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,560
By squeezing, then you can know your partner feel pain or not.

1371
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,640
If pain is felt towards the breast area menstruasi, then it was reasonable.

1372
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,640
Menstruasi.

1373
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,080
However, if the pain is felt at any time and not be bearable, then you should immediately

1374
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,500
consult a doctor.

1375
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
So if you squeeze...

1376
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,900
That is crazy.

1377
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,440
One way to avoid injury when you're sucking your wife's breast is if you squeeze it so

1378
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,780
hard that it hurts that will injure her.

1379
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,420
Did they, were they trying to spell menstruation and then...

1380
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,420
No, menstruasi.

1381
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,260
It's a type of, it's like an ancient science.

1382
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,940
No, it's a martial art.

1383
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,980
Oh, that's, yeah, that's what I meant.

1384
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,780
Yeah, it's a martial art.

1385
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,500
Ancient science.

1386
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,860
Is this like alchemy?

1387
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,860
Yeah.

1388
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:11,860
Or perform techniques to manipulate the nipple pair.

1389
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,860
(laughing)

1390
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,860
- Manipulate the nipple pair?

1391
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,180
- Occasionally do pencubitin.

1392
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,700
The goal is that you find out whether the size of nipple one

1393
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,240
and the nipple two equal or symmetrical or not.

1394
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:25,540
Besides, extortion is also done if the nipple

1395
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,640
ooze pus or blood when pinched.

1396
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,740
In cases of breast cancer, will bleed nipple and pus.

1397
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,940
So you should immediately conduct an intensive examination.

1398
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,700
- Have you ever seen those pictures of women--

1399
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,920
- Pupes is just a kind of hair.

1400
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,580
- A woman who survived heart, pubes is just a kind of hair,

1401
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:41,420
that's a good line.

1402
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,300
Have you ever seen those women who get their breasts removed

1403
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,980
but then also get their nipples removed?

1404
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,820
- Yeah.

1405
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,380
- That's gotta just hurt and be kind of odd.

1406
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,780
- I've seen people who just get the nipples removed.

1407
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,960
- Nipples are pretty much useless,

1408
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,580
but that's gotta feel, I mean I want them still.

1409
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,680
If I had the option to be born with or without,

1410
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,820
I'd choose with.

1411
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,900
- What is this?

1412
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,860
- I'm trying to figure out what pencubitin means.

1413
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,980
- What did it just say?

1414
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:06,820
(laughing)

1415
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,660
- What?

1416
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,540
it's it when you were typing that it said he will pay

1417
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,340
well

1418
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,820
it is a latin

1419
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:18,460
and in english it as you type it will pay so i have to take the language on

1420
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,980
attempting and can cuba ten

1421
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:23,100
i've got pen it's a pen okay

1422
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,460
and then pet p_n_c_ pink that means five

1423
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,540
and then it moves to uh... pinku which is pen range of the knees

1424
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,260
that we have

1425
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,140
pent-up which is a pent-up

1426
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,980
and then we have

1427
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:41,020
the house, and then i add an eye or a pencubi and it means squirt vulgar in

1428
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,780
chinese simplified, and then i add a t pencubit and in latin it is he will pay

1429
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,940
vulgar. He will pay and then i press a and we have pencubi, it means pencubite

1430
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,980
and then i add an n and now it means airbrush pen alter in chinese. Holy

1431
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,540
fuck,

1432
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:03,220
squirt vulgar vulgar that that must be performed techniques to manipulate the

1433
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:08,460
pair occasionally do squirt vulgar. That has to be the only one that makes sense, right?

1434
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:13,500
Occasionally he will pay. Yeah, I guess you're right. Occasionally he will pay.

1435
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,980
But this isn't a Chinese website, right? I don't know. I don't think so.

1436
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,180
Maybe it's translated from Chinese. Who knows?

1437
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:24,060
Number five, the last one is, massage the breast while sucking wife's breast are also very important,

1438
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:28,620
thus making the blood flow in the breast area to be smooth. If done in nursing mothers will

1439
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,700
will make milk more smoothly and avoid engorgement.

1440
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,340
Moreover, it's possible the massage

1441
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,140
will make the breast becomes tighter.

1442
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,180
- To avoid-- - Oh, I love a tight breast.

1443
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,140
- Yeah, just like you can fuckin' pop a quarter off of it.

1444
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,300
Oh my fuckin' God. - Yeah.

1445
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,060
- Yeah, that's what they do in the female army

1446
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,740
every morning, they check-- - The female army?

1447
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,300
- Yeah, they check if you can bounce a quarter

1448
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,380
off your breast. - I was,

1449
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,380
we should make a movie about like a guy--

1450
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,740
- Called the female army. - A guy who like,

1451
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:57,140
sneaks into the female army-- - The woman king too.

1452
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,740
so that you can genius.

1453
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:02,840
Oh, we could go undercover and not undercover janitors or we could hide in

1454
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,240
the laundry and stuff and see what kind of female army stuff they do.

1455
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,440
Yeah, pretty smart.

1456
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,640
So it's like Porky's but in the female army.

1457
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,140
Yeah.

1458
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,740
Yeah, it's like the opposite of Mulan.

1459
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,140
Well, what would that be called the female army?

1460
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,240
The female army about if Porky's is about the camp and doing panty rides.

1461
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,740
Well, it'd be like army fun.

1462
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,440
Panty rides.

1472
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:59,820
talk.com/shows. We did more than draw pins, we said what it was many times. We filmed a

1473
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:05,340
paranormal investigation with Caleb's uncle. We were making allusions to something we said

1474
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,260
before. We saw a lot of allusions that were casted on us. We did see some, I'm going to

01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,540
be real, you've got to come through because there's some stuff that we saw on tape. There
