You say, "Hey, spell IHOP." People would be like, "Oh, okay, he's making a joke about."

you were not the great you are not a great and you are many people but you

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,280
were not the correct

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,800
yeah well that was the fucking we went to a bar that had really dim lights and

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,600
because I was in the green face paint just looked like I was in black face

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:46,320
yeah it was bad yeah I took a picture - yeah of you dressed as black Santa yeah

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,400
dude it just looked like I was black Santa it was so bad is really bad yeah

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,160
and I was the only one there dressed up - which but also Grinch is a good caught

43
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,480
like Trudeau should have tried to pass it off as Grinch. Yeah, when he's in that big

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,480
turban. Yeah, they're like, "Sir, the Grinch is green." He's like, "Well, I read the book.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,200
I didn't see the movie. I don't know what I..." I'm not supposed to know that. "In my head, he was

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,040
black." He was pitch black. "In my head, he was a black man with a turban who stole things."

47
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,640
I just dressed up as somebody who I thought hates Christmas. Yeah, yeah, you did.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,240
it's um speaking of holidays it's did to do all it is to do all which I think is

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,280
it is a Hindu holiday that means that you can you don't have to move your car

50
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,880
you can just park for free in New York that's the holiday today yeah I think

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,200
it's maybe my favorite holiday in the world because of that yeah it's been

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,960
actually not have to pay for parking I didn't have to I didn't have to pay Wow

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:49,200
thank you do all the graduations thank you do all the festival of sunrise I

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
I don't know what it's called. Why'd you guys both phone me?

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,680
We both got a text from Jubio at the same time. I guess you didn't.

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,080
I did but I have some fucking, I have some manners.

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,320
I wanted to see if it was something important. It was important for the business.

58
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,680
It was not important. You got a text from some Mexican guy you know.

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,360
I didn't know. It could have been my mom saying that she's dead.

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,520
She wouldn't send you that text message. It could be a dead woman's switch.

61
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
day could be that too

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,980
i need to see who's texting me i'm not gonna open it but i need to see what it

63
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,560
is so you guys have a dead man's switch

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,940
was that maybe

65
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,000
when you die something funny what's a good what's a good dead man's switch

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,960
what would be a good one uh... like uh... i need an idea for one for no

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,860
right now on the issue in in p and all and throw up

68
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,060
what like you all of your fluids at leave your body does not get a good man

69
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,760
says that it had been switches that's a good what happens when you die and it's

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
That's a dead man switch.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
That's a dead man switch.

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
You have to set it up though.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Yeah.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,880
A good one of that is if it like mailed a box of all your pee and poop and vomit to someone

75
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
when you die.

76
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
That's funny.

77
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
That's what a dead man switch is.

78
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,480
What about like the end of Breaking Bad just like wherever your car is parked a machine

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,520
gun just pops out of it and starts shooting.

80
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,720
That was so stupid.

81
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
It's cool dude.

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,080
That was like on the tier of the science rock exploding.

84
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,240
I was I was I was cool but I was like I was like come the fuck on like seriously

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,720
what and the guy was standing right in front of it when it opens - that's his

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,920
fault that's too much it was sick dude it would have been ass oh wait is that

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,400
Walter White does I forget how that ends yeah you explain it Walter I'm not

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,400
without giving spoilers Walter White a machine gun comes out of the trunk of

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
his car yeah and then without getting exposed he died it's inspector gadget

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,040
it yeah it's literally they stole it from inspector gadget super cool wait but

91
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,280
does it does he die before that or he does I think it does 50 or 60 times I

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,400
think it does 50 or 60 years before that yeah yeah he died so the beginning of

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,760
the show starts with him dying yeah it starts well it starts with a sperm and

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,520
an egg that combine and then die yeah and then the rest is kind of like a

95
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,440
fever dream exploration of what could have happened yeah the rest is basically

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,600
like the live-action Mario Brothers movie mm-hmm yeah where they're just

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Right.

98
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,600
They go into the sewers, they see the Goombas that look like lizards.

99
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,100
Yeah.

100
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,600
Yeah.

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,100
What was that shit about?

102
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,600
What the hell was that?

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Why weren't the Goombas-

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
You remember the little Bob-

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Little Bob-omb that he has?

106
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Yeah.

107
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
That thing was cute.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,100
Pretty cool.

109
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,100
Yeah.

111
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,600
It was like a little-

112
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
That's what Walter White should have thrown on the ground,

113
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
instead of that fucking stupid rock.

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Yeah, that little Bob-omb.

115
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
A little bomb, dude.

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Little black bomb.

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Yeah.

119
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,600
And the guy's like, "Hey, what's that? A random black ball?"

120
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
With a string coming out of it?

121
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
out of it? It's not a normal black ball. It's a science bomb. It's actually a bomb.

122
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Yeah. And if you jump on it once, it flashes red. What does he say when he throws it?

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,100
What's that, a tiny bowling ball? He says, "Hasta la vista." Is that actually what he

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,700
says? No, I think he says... He says, "Praise science." Oh, fuck. No, he doesn't. I don't

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,000
remember, but I don't know if he says anything. Does he say something? I think he's not about

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,440
what's he says he says eat rock bitch that'd be sick eat my dust to go eat my

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:12,560
chemicals to go he says he says to go he's a speed racer yeah to go eat this

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,960
yeah he says yeah he says well my nemesis and he throws it down how did you know I

129
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,360
hate explosions doesn't he walk out of it Scott free - yeah Scott free I mean

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,560

131
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,960

132
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,640

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,320

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,960
I got to spell it backwards?

135
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
- Yeah, spell it Scott, free backwards.

136
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,240
- E-E-R-F--

137
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
- Oh my God, he said it.

138
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,400
- T-O-C-S.

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
- You know what you just said?

140
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
- What?

141
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,860
- You said free of--

142
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,280
- I said, I said--

143
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,840
- You said Earftox.

144
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,680
- Earftox?

145
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,500
- Yeah.

146
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,340
- I said Earftox? Damn.

147
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,200
- Earftox money don't.

148
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,260
- True.

149
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,320
- Yes sir.

150
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,240
- Yeah.

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
- You guys have any big Duali plans?

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,120
- I think I'm gonna kill myself.

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah, I think I might kill myself too.

154
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
I think I was thinking...

155
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,320
You see, I said you guys should park a car somewhere.

156
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,120
Yeah, if I had a car I would definitely do that.

157
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
It's thrilling.

158
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,320
This is one of the best car holidays.

159
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Does it work if I maybe just put a bag down somewhere and that could be like a car?

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Probably, yeah.

161
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
We could make a car on the airport.

162
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I guess normally I wouldn't have to pay a parking meter to put a bag down.

163
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,320
I do think like if you put a rock, like a big rock in a parking space, are they going

164
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
to try to tick it?

165
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,120
As long as, if you'd pay the meter it's fine.

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
It's quite fun, right?

167
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Yeah.

168
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Yeah.

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,000
like that rock. Oh yeah, well yeah, what are you going to do? Yeah, it's not it's

00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,640
rock house right behind you yeah

176
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,360
completely made out of rock. There's a there's like a huge like like like

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,040
like fucking like rut in the ground where you dress the rock from your

178
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:27,500
garage like all the way down this clear path. Yeah, I love to yeah. I'd love to

179
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,660
see you find out where I live. I would hate to be a slug. Yeah, you couldn't

180
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,360
get away with anything to know and you don't imagine cheating on your wife as a

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,560
one need a french fry exactly, but but you also you can't like like you can't

182
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,820
lie to anybody about where you've been, you know?

183
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820
You don't even get a cool shell.

184
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,940
Yeah, exactly. You don't have a protective bulletproof shell.

185
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,780
Dude, I wish I had a shell. I wish I had a pouch. I was thinking about that the other day.

186
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,980
You have a pocket.

187
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,620
Yeah, but like...

188
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,820
You have a lot of pockets.

189
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,820
I do. I'm wearing cargo pants right now.

190
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,180
But, like, a pouch in my stomach.

191
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,980
Yeah, but why? You'd have to reach inside your clothes to take anything out of it in public.

192
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,780
Yeah, I feel like that...

193
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,940
It would look like you're jacking off.

194
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,380
No, it would be in my stomach.

195
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,220
Well, you'd put your hand in like this, and then you'd be going like this.

196
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
I wouldn't be going like that.

197
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,220
You would.

198
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,220
You'd be rooting around inside it.

199
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,360
I could put a baby bird in there.

200
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,820
You want to put a baby inside you?

201
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,780
I want to put a baby bird in my pouch.

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Why?

203
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
It would suffocate.

204
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,380
And then I'd pull my shirt up and let the bird fly out in McDonald's.

205
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,380
I think the Diwali spirit has gotten into you.

206
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,380
Yeah.

207
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Yeah.

208
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,980
Well, I don't know what Diwali is about.

209
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
I don't either.

210
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,340
I think it's basically Christmas, based on the time of year that it is right now.

211
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,380
I think it's I think there's a tree there's presently in there could be a

212
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,180
menorah I don't know

213
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,460
energy but what is with your neighborhood in expired energy drinks

214
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,740
to all Polish people bro oh yeah yeah

215
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,180
well this right random numbers for the experience yeah I don't know what is it

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,540

220
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
- Yeah, unlike--

221
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,380
- Oh, this isn't expired.

222
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,200
- Yeah, I don't know why I assumed it was.

223
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,340
- I thought it was 'cause your Red Bull cans

224
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,180
usually have the bowl in the tab.

225
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,460
- Why are you so afraid of expired?

226
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,140
- 'Cause I drank an expired can at your house once.

227
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,900
- It's not gonna do anything different,

228
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,260
like worse to you than a normal energy drink would do.

229
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,540
- You're already getting fucking hammered.

230
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,940
- You're already drinking like evil chemicals.

231
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,420
- Your central nervous system is so fucked up

232
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,260
for everything you drink.

233
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,300
- Yeah, but that's why I don't get sick.

234
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,620
I have so many preservatives.

235
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,460

251
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
I didn't take my ginseng today.

253
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
That's what he did.

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
I didn't take my ginseng today for the first time in a while.

255
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
And he is cranky because of it.

256
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,940
And my balls, I went to go pee, my balls are hidden in my body.

Not in my sack.

259
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,860

No, my...

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
- My, no, that's a-- - Your balls have never retreated.

265
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
- That's a sub power.

266
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,820
- My nuts hang lower than my penis.

267
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,620
- When it's cold, my nuts will like to,

268
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,500
they like to touch my, they like to hide in my butt cheeks.

269
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
- When it's cold, that's a different story.

270
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,740
- You never have had your nuts go up into your stomach.

271
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,940
- No, they don't go up into my body.

272
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,020
- My nuts hang-- - Something's wrong

273

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,900
- My nuts hang a foot below my penis.

275
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,820
- A foot?

276
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
- Yes. - Yeah.

277
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,700

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,380
It's like a little, you can hook your finger into it and swing him around.

339
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,980

340
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,600
on his body around his wiener and butt region that was confusing me yeah and

341
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,240
it's like a band a waistband type like yeah protrusion out of his body.

342

Who is weird and then he and then he went into you went into the bathroom and

344
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:54,260
this like cloth hanging off of it is like it like he grew some kind of like cocoon

345
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,760

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,740
(imitating gun noises)

351
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,740
- What the fuck is you talking about?

352
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,820
Tell me you're from Canarsie

353
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,020

354
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,860
- My wife.

355
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,100
(laughing)

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,220
- That's what's up.

357
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,700
- Oh man, we should make that video.

358
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,540
- Yeah?

359
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,360
- Yeah.

360
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,200
- Okay.

361
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,020
- All right.

362
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,860
- Let's start filming, bitch.

363
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,540
- Okay, I'm gonna record you and then you go.

364
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,580
- Oh, I'm nervous.

365
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,740
- Oh, okay, then if you're nervous, we don't have to do it.

366
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,580
- Thanks.

367
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,400
- Okay.

368
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,240
- I love being nervous.

369
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:51,160
Yesterday I watched Transformers The Last Knight, the fifth Transformers movie, the last

370
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,040
Michael Bay Transformers movie.

371
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,840
And you know how in every Transformers movie they kind of like retcon some of human history

372
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,760
to be like about Transformers.

373
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,960
Like in Revenge of the Fallen they have like, oh one of the pharaohs was a Transformer.

374
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,320
And like the third one, they're like, oh the reason we went to the moon was to like find

375
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,960
a Transformers ship.

376
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,520
the fourth one they're like dinosaurs were transformers. Actually the fifth

377
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,500
one, the premise of it originally is that like oh like King Arthur and

378
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,540
Merlin were real and they had a dragon that was a transformer, which that's

379
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,060
already pretty cool, but then they have this whole sequence where they're in

380
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,600
like this guy like this guy's mansion, who's like part of like the Knights

381
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,520
Templar, but like for transformers like a secret society about transformers,

382
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,860
okay, it's gone on for ages and they're

383
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:42,280
they're listing like people who are like parts of the Knights of the what is the

384
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,380
the Knights of the Wit Wiccan and like like Sam, with Wiki Shia LaBoeuf and

385
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,840
listing them and they're like they're like like JFK, Harriet Tubman,

386
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,180
Benjamin Franklin, but Harry is so they like show a picture of like

387
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,340
Transformers and like the Civil War and then they go they're like looking at

388
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,420
this like this like like case where they have like an evil like watch

389
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,740
transformer trapped in it and it's Sir Anthony Hopkins is like the is the

390
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,300
the transformer guy and he like he's showing them he's like and they're like

391
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,060
trying to touch he's like don't touch that that's very dangerous that's the

392
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:30,900
watch that killed Hitler. It cuts to Bumblebee like killing a bunch of Nazis.

393
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,600
It's so crazy dude. It's so sick. But yeah, so a transformer killed Hitler.

394
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,740
Okay, so a transformer killed Hitler.

395
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,860
But it was a bad guy transformer that killed Hitler. It was an evil watch.

396
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
It was a Decepticon?

397
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,140
It was a Decepticon killed Hitler.

398
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,020
So they're setting it up, it's Minion style. Even the Decepticons didn't like

399
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,020
Hitler.

400
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Yeah.

401
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
Wow.

402
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
That's so funny.

403
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
That's crazy cool.

404
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,500
The Decepticons and the Autobots had to get together to kill Hitler.

405
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Yeah.

406
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,140
But yeah, such a good reveal.

407
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,260
That's a crazy...

408
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,100
I would rather watch that movie.

409
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Yeah, that's...

410
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,380
Dude, oh my god, Valkyrie but with the Transformers?

411
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,340
Because there could just be a Transformer named Valkyrie and he's a desk.

412
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Yeah.

413
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Dude, they have a...

414
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
That's what that movie's about, right?

415
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
The desk bomb?

416
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,780
Frederick Douglass was also part of the Order of the Witwickens.

417
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,780
Also they would have to bumblebee since he doesn't have a voice. He would have to

418
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,980
talk with like nineteen fucking forties. Yeah, like that is so funny that they

419
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,280
reckon it to be like like in the original one. There's like oh they

420
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,780
landed here in like two thousand and eight, but then every time they're

421
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,880
recon it to be like earlier and it's like oh they actually were here

422
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
millions of years ago, but they still like look like like samurai and there's

423
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,480
one who looks like a like a just a British general and stuff and it's like

424
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,880
a mad. Yeah, yeah, very funny. They should make a transformer that turns

425
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,040
into a phone. They did in the first one. And I should get to use the phone. No, for

426
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,560
free. And I get to play a game on the phone. What game would you play? Angry

427
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,240
Birds. I don't think the Transformers would take too kindly to that. I would

428
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,800
play Bit Life with them. They would not like Bit Life. They would love Bit Life.

429
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,960
Are you kidding me? No, they would love Bit Life. Their entire life is a Bit Life. They don't care for

430
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,560
puny, the lives of puny humans. That's right. Oh, also, sorry to just talk about

431
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,520
Transformers. I would love to. Barricade, the Decepticon who turns into a

432
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,680
a police car yeah, so i'm sure you've seen when he is for the police car that he

433
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,040
transforms into you know on the side of police car just says to protect and

434
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,120
serve his on his car. It says to punish an enslave that is and then when he

435
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,200
turns into a robot, he has brass knuckles to say punish and enslave.

436
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,560
Well, so sick do so cool that's who I want to be when I grow up.

437
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:45,840
I mean those movies are objectively so they're awesome. Yeah, they're like so

438
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,000
last one like that one's the best like that should be a Walberg one yeah I

439
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,720
have it on I have a blue ray we should watch is that it's a second Walberg one

440
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,080
or the yeah the second Walberg one is TJ in it no post TJ I've talked about it

441
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,760
numerous times but that scene where he finds the transformer he's like I think

442
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,480
we just found a transformer transformers and we found a transformer I think we

443
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
just found a transformer we just found a transformer yeah and this one it's like

444
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,160
like it's like they're like like they're like it's like an like a an

445
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,480
anti like like ice and like DHS theme to it because it's like the

446
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,320
transformers are like illegal aliens. So like but then like like

447
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,560
mark wallberg yeah well yeah exact mark wallberg is like it's like

448
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
years after the like the first wallberg one or whatever. So he

449
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,440
like rides around and like a leather jacket and is like the guy

450
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,960
who's like protecting like the the illegal alien transformers like

451
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,100
smuggling them around it's so sick pretty hard pretty easy to smuggle a

452
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,580
transformer I would say yeah yeah turn into a book some of them can't transfer

453
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,780
the dinosaur ones are just dinosaurs they brought back the dinosaur one

454
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,860
yeah the dino bots are in the fourth one and then they're also in the fifth one

455
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,420
so according to the transformers lore is every dinosaur fucking just I don't know

456
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,940
bots I don't know okay unless all of them I don't think so okay I just yeah

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,580
- That was fucked up learning that those motherfuckers

458
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
had feathers.

459
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,980
- But then they went back on it.

460
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,820
- They went back on it?

461
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,660
- Yeah.

462
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,340
- Not all of them, some of them have feathers.

463
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,380
- They said that there was not,

464
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,060
it's not nearly as many feathers as they originally thought.

465
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,900
- Yeah, but--

466
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,180
- A couple feathers every once in a while.

467
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,020
- What, which animal--

468
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,220
- They might have like a plume.

469
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,060
- Is it velociraptors?

470
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,260
No, it's not velociraptors.

471
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,460
- Yeah, velociraptors were probably feathered.

472
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,060
- Well, no, no, I know, but which one did the ostrich

473
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,120
like originate as?

474
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
I think someone was telling me this the other day,

475
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,960
that like an ostrich used to,

476
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,960
like it's like, I don't know what the fucking word is,

477
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
but I think it's velociraptors.

478
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
- Speaking of dinosaurs, I've had a new gator obsession.

479
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,560
- Yeah. - Yeah.

480
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,760
- There's a, I have to show you this guy.

481
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,080
His name is Wally.

482
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,480
He's a registered emotional support animal

483
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
in Pennsylvania, I think.

484
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,600
- I thought you were gonna say Pensacola.

485
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,960
- No, in Pennsylvania.

486
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,520
Oh, is this who you're talking about?

487
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,320
No.

488
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,820
No.

489
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,320
Wally Gator.

490
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,480
Not Wally Gator from Hanna-Barbera.

491
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,760
Caleb watched a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.

492
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,560
This is the coolest alligator I've ever seen.

493
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,040
He's way kinder than most gators.

494
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,880
He wears a collar.

495
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,680
He has a hat.

496
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,440
He's very funny.

497
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,840
I see him here.

498
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,840
No, he has this old guy who basically said,

499
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,640
I was going to kill myself until--

500
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,280
Yeah.

501
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,520
He's like, I was going to kill myself until I picked up Wally.

502
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,920
And apparently he just like walks around and puts this fucking alligator on like women in the grocery store.

503
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
It says he loves attention.

504
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah and he uh...

505
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Oh look at him.

506
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Dude it's the best. I want an alligator so badly dude.

507
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,920
21 year old pet alligator named Wally dies after getting hit by a car near Lansing.

508
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
What? That can't be true.

509
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,420
Are you fucking kidding me?

510
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,920
Dude he's dead.

511
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,420
Are you fucking kidding me? I watched a video about him that came out like a year ago.

512
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,820
I think this might be just a different animal.

513
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,980
Where did it come out?

514
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
This is in 2019.

515
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
All right, we're good.

516
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Okay.

517
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,980
I think.

518
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
Yeah.

519
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
Where was?

520
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
In Lansing.

521
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Oh.

522
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
It's in Pennsylvania.

523
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
No, it's in Michigan.

524
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Oh, damn.

525
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
It's in Pennsylvania.

526
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
There is a Lansing, Pennsylvania, I'm guessing.

527
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Oh, it is a family.

528
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Okay, see this guy's just a single dude.

529
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
Yeah, okay, Wally's fine.

530
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Wally's fine.

531
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
But yeah, I feel like a pet alligator might be a good late life move.

532
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Yeah, I think so.

533
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
I think so.

534
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
I think so.

535
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
I think so.

536
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
I think so.

537
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
I think so.

538
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,980
I think so.

539
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
I think so.

540
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,700
life move for me. Yeah. Janet dies, you know, just pick up a gator. Yeah, it

541
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,060
could be nice. There's no there's no Lansing, Pennsylvania. I was thinking of

542
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,780
Lancaster.

543
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:52,620
You're so dumb. I'm also I just don't want to die. I just did opening that

544
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,460
like news article reminded me that when I was I said this is another

545
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,660
Transformers thing. I found I found a news article when I was looking at

546
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,280
barricade the one who the to punish an enslave yeah some guy in

547
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,280
Massachusetts like bought a car and like made it look exactly like the

548
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Decepticon cop car and a bunch of police tried to arrest him for it and

549
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,080
then he like they took him to court and they they ruled he was like

550
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,320
innocent. They're like it's fine. Of course, it's so sick to do

551
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,880
this fucking so in slave on his car mission in slave. Yeah, so awesome

552
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,960
that's anyway. We could keep talking about wall. I just remembered that

553
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,040
- No, I just don't, I'd like to get some more info

554
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,320
if anyone has it on what the cost is,

555
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,400
how free, probably, how much. - I don't know if you could

556
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,760
have an alligator in New York.

557
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,360
- I'll fucking, dude, I'm looking every day

558
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
for a reason to move.

559
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,740
- Yeah. - That might be the reason.

560
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,580
- Yeah. - That finally

561
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,400
pulls me. - You don't wanna stay here

562
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
and hang out with me?

563
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,760
- I think I'll probably live here for a couple more years.

564
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
- Yeah? - Yeah.

565
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,040
- But I just-- - You don't wanna hang out

566
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
with me? - I like being here.

567
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,720
- Yeah, what about me? - I like being out.

568
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,400
- You don't wanna hang out with me or Cameron?

569
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,320
- Yeah, I'll stay here then.

570
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,160
- Okay, cool. - Yeah.

571
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,000
- Yeah.

572
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,040
- This sucks.

573
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,420
- I think I might move, actually.

574
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,660
- So I've been thinking of moving, actually.

575
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,700
- Yeah.

576
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,540
- No, I just--

577
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,880
- Have you actually moved to New Hampshire?

578
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,200
- I would love to move to New, yeah, sure, let's do it.

579
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,040
- Yeah, let's move to New Hampshire.

580
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
- Get an alligator?

581
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,700
- Yeah.

582
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,000
- You could totally get an alligator in New Hampshire.

583
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
- Yeah, absolutely.

584
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,680
- Yeah, definitely.

585
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,260
- Yeah, it might get too cold for them, though, actually.

586
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,100
- Yeah.

587
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,420
I'd just keep it in my--

588
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,680
- Well, you don't think of Pennsylvania.

589
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
- It's not gonna leave its slave quarters.

590
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,600
- What?

591
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,040
- It gets cold as shit in Pennsylvania, too.

592
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,880
- I guess.

593
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,800
bath that he keeps it in. Okay that makes sense. Wally. He has multiple gators but

594
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,960
Wally's the sweetest and kindest of the three. Oh okay what are the other one's

595
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
names? One is named Carl. Okay. And I don't remember the other's name because I

596
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,500
didn't focus on him because it seems like he's a bit of a problem gator. He

597
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,120
might be a little snappy. Uh-oh. Yeah but Carl and Wally would be a good name for him.

598
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,660
Snappy yeah you might you might be right. Slappy? No. That's a clown's name. That could be good to have three alligators

599
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,320
seem like snappy slappy and crappy or like.

600
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,120
- Crappy's got the bad into that stick.

601
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,960
- Yeah.

602
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,780
- He pulled the short straw.

603
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
- Okay, flappy.

604
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,620
- There you go, that's fine.

605
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,440
- Flappy bird.

606
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,620
- Dude, when we went to the, what was it,

607
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,580
Alligator Adventure?

608
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,660
- Alligator Adventure, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

609
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,660
- When we went there, like finding out that like alligators.

610
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,700
- That's never heard a siren before.

611
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,940
- That's barricaded.

612
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,100
When we found out that,

613
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,780
they don't want me to say this.

614
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,300
they don't want to talk about the salamanders not uh...

615
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,420
uh...

616
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,900
trying at the lake alligators mouths aren't like

617
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,420
like my mouth

618
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,740
you know it's like

619
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,660
like it out there now doesn't have a hole in it is just like a really i don't

620
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,740
see them just sit there with their like

621
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,180
mouths open but i think there's nothing that looks so freaky dudes hot out the

622
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,180
cool off by because the other close their throat

623
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,500
yet to do that

624
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,260
i wish i could close my throat

625
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,820
like that and what

626
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,900
yeah

627
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,060
you literally can't look

628
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,700
not that it looks different

629
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,900
that was my tongues and i can't

630
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,860
making it

631
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,980
it might be a great while

632
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,300
are all if a gator could talk that's probably how he fought a nice i don't

633
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,420
get

634
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,620
yes he ever has a gator and i actually a little bit of a gator was talking

635
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,500
price on this

636
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:21,620
Apparently they do, they purr and growl. They hiss. They also purr and growl. They like

637
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,340
to hiss. They were hissing a bunch when we were there. Yeah. Dude that one bucked at

638
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,880
me remember? The crocodile though. It's a crocodile that bucked at me. Crocs are pretty

639
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,780
fucked up except American crocodile is closer to the alligator as far as like how tame it

640
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:42,580
is. Like it's much more chill. Like you can have a pet American croc. They get too big.

641
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Crocs?

642
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Yeah, American croc.

643
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,100
I thought crocs are way less chill than alligators.

644
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:52,940
Yeah, they are, but the American croc is more chill than like a Nile crocodile or like a

645
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
wild crocodile.

646
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,060
A wily croc, or there's one called the evil crocodile that is actually surprisingly mean.

647
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Really unchill.

648
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Yeah.

649
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:06,540
Where do you guys land on, what pets, what animals are okay and not okay to have as pets?

650
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Everything.

651
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,540
Ball python.

652
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,260
I think, I'm closer to everything is okay.

653
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,340
I think that you could have, like I could...

654
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,860
I mean we kind of, we kind of just already like...

655
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
We're getting there.

656
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,640
We kind of, we kind of just like, humans as a race kind of already just like jumped the

657
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,660
shark on like enslaving nature enough that I don't think there's any animal you could

658
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,340
make a pet that wouldn't be like, like wouldn't, there's probably someone has done worse already

659
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,500
like you know what I mean?

660
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Yeah.

661
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,780
Like I think we've, I think we've subjugated the earth enough.

662
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Giraffe.

663
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,540
But they make all these fucking documentaries and shit about oh we put orcas in, in the

664
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,340
most beautiful place of all time fucking SeaWorld who doesn't want to spend time

665
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,540
in SeaWorld first of all right what are these orcas hate fun yeah unlimited food

666
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,780
they get to swim around they get to fucking kill one person every five years

667
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,980
that's like an ideal like what it doesn't need to be out in the wild dude

668
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,980
I think you just pool I think you literally just can't be the first person

669
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,340
to ever have an animal as a pet right because that's yours might be you got to

670
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,620
have like some there's has to be precedent yeah can't be Mike Tyson Mike

671
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,240
Tyson you got a point at somebody and be like damn well that guy has one I can

679
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,280

he's probably probably like he probably was pretty crazy I'd like to think he

684
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,280
as a prospector.

685
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,120
- He might have been digging under the ground.

686
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,800
- He was a pioneer for sure.

687
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,280
- 'Cause you know that for a while,

688
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,820
they didn't know that gold was in the arid desert.

689
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,200
So they were just checking everywhere for gold.

690
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
They were digging through snow.

691
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,600
They would suck all the water out of a pond

692
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,880
with big straws to try to find

693
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,280
if there was gold underneath there.

694
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,320
- Yeah. - Yeah.

695
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,940
- We should start prospecting.

696
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,780
- I would love to.

697
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,200
- Would that be, we should go panning for gold dude.

698
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,640
I've been panning for gold before.

699
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Really?

700
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Yeah.

701
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
Did you find any?

702
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
I don't think so.

703
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
You panned for dirt, my friend.

704
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Pretty much.

705
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
Yeah, you can go to like...

706
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Yeah, there's some in the mountains of North Carolina.

707
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,920
There's also like in Montana, you can go to like, quote unquote, like ghost towns that

708
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,920
have been like touristified.

709
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,400
And you can like go there, they'll have like a candy shop in like an old saloon.

710
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Yeah.

711
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,720
And then you can like go and like pan for gold there, but it's like not like real panning

712
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
for gold.

713
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,760
- They might like, they'll like, yeah, they'll like,

714
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,960
you can, yeah, exactly.

715
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,820
And they'll like put stuff into it sometimes, yeah.

716
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,600
That's like, I don't know, that's fun.

717
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,920
- I'd rather just get the candy.

718
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,760
- I love any--

719
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,840

720
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,440
- Any like lollipops. - Old West.

721
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
- Oh!

722
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,760
- Oh, did you ever get that?

723
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,600
- Montana lollipops, dude.

724
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,640
- They make 'em different there.

725
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,560
- They're famous for a reason.

726
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,400
- Rock candy.

727
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
- Do you ever get those, that bubble gum

728
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,840
that looks like gold nuggets?

729
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,040
You ever get that?

730
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,880
That's a damn good bubble gum.

731
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,080
- I had the bubble gum that looks like

732
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,080
a chunk of coal. Did you ever get that bubble gum that looks like a roll of tape? You ever

733
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,800
play the game you can only play when you're high? I have. Yeah, we watched that again.

734
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,840
You watched it again? Yeah, on Halloween. Whoa, I didn't know that. It's way better

735
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,240
than I remembered. I remembered it being like, oh, it was boring to watch and that one line

736
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,240
was the only funny part. It's so funny, the whole thing. It's really funny. Yeah, the

737
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,760
Chucky. Everybody go watch Chucky Friends 'Til the End on YouTube. It's a real Chucky

738
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,520
movie that was made for a little but we need to make a fan movie. I know we need

739
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,920
that's what I'm saying that that I mean we need we need to make our I think that

740
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,880
Jason vs. Pennywise I think that's our $20,000 goal. That's what I was gonna say.

741
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,360
I think that could be our $20,000 goal is we make a feature-length fan vs. movie.

742
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,520
That would be so sick dude. What would we purchase? Just get like 20 costumes of different

743
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,440
characters. Yeah we spend it like Party City costumes. Yeah that's actually

744
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,440
really such a good idea. Can we do that?

745
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Yeah, we'll set that up.

746
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Like a tiger electronics camera.

747
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
The ultimate showdown.

748
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Oh my god. The movie.

749
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
We get Neil involved.

750
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
Dude, we get Neil Cicerega.

751
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Holy crap.

752
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
I was supposed to say holy cow,

753
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
then I said holy crap, and then it turned into holy craup.

754
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Why'd you try to say holy cow?

755
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm off my game today. I'm sorry about my performance this episode.

756
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,440
I know my pay will be docked for this.

757
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
We always, any um

758
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,240
that you throw in, I dock you $10.

759
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,080
- I know.

760
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,120
- Anytime you give up in the middle of the story,

761
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,760
because you can't remember the end, I dock you $100.

762
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,920
- No, I know, that's why I've been hurting

763
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,800
this past couple months.

764
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,920
- As your mental deficiencies kind of start to show through

765
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,440
more and more, you've been losing a lot of money.

766
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,260
- Yeah.

767
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,800
- Yeah, and me and Cam have been doing really well

768
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,640
for ourselves.

769
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,460
- Interesting.

770
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,300
- Very interesting how that works.

771
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,280
- Strange.

772
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,120
- Yeah.

773
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,080
- Rather strange.

774
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,900
- It's crazy.

775
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,600
- A rather strange phenomenon observed on the podcast

776
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,720
about list podcasts that would be like if a nature documentary was about what

777
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,720
was going on.

778
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,520
Oh yeah, and here we have Patrick completely still.

779
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,960
A rather compellingly strange organism, they might say.

780
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Patrick in his natural habitat, the couch, leaned back, not a care in the

781
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
world.

782
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
You're sitting in a really funny way.

783
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Look at his legs.

784
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,760
You look, honestly, because of the clothes you're wearing, you look like

785
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,760
you're 400 pounds right now, dude.

786
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,880
I gotta stop wearing this sweater.

787
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
You look so huge.

788
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,160
This sweater makes me look like way fatter.

789
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,880
You look like Baron Harkonnen dude.

790
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
You're like floating on that chair.

791
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,720
You look like a Russian stacking doll.

792
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,320
Like the sleeves are so small but then like the rest of the sweatshirt itself.

793
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,880
That's crazy.

794
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,880
Yeah.

795
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Dude it's so fucked up.

796
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,200
I think they like, I think it was made to look like this dude.

797
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,520
It was made to make you look huge and fat?

798
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520

hand,

856
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,340
because also we're

00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,740
What a straight guys like I don't know you should never flush

859
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,780

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,880
His claws are cool to straight guys.

864
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,680
Yeah,

865
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,180
like me just having just like just raw meat sitting in his pantry for days and

866
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,780
days.

867
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,080
We're like he has to eat the maggots.

868
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,380
He just needs more flies.

869
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,380
We're just describing the apartments we hung out in in college.

870
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,480
Yeah, that is kind of what my apartment was.

871
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,580
Yeah, I used to have a mountain of recycling.

872
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,380
Oh, dude.

873
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,780
I'm about to close right now.

874
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,980
Our recycling in my old apartment, it used to, it was in the pantry.

875
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,220
Oh fuck, I remember that dude.

876
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,180
And it would get so high that it would cover up the food in the pantry.

877
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,220
And you'd have to take the recycling out to even get to the fucking food on the bottom

878
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
two shelves.

879
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,220
Dude, I remember.

880
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,980
And then we would take it, we wouldn't even put it outside, we were too lazy.

881
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,980
We had a room that was like a little, it was like a closet that was blocked by our couch.

882
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,820
So we would move the couch, open that door, and just put all our recycling in this room.

883
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,760
I think when we left there was probably, it was like honestly filled like, like probably

884
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,580
like mid torso level of just can.

885
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,780
There was a window next to the trash though.

886
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,780
What?

887
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,440
Yeah, in your old apartment, wasn't that, didn't that kitchen window open up to where

888
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,660
you threw the trash out?

889
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,540
I wasn't gonna, I'm not an animal, I'm not gonna throw trash out of my window.

890
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,700
Dude, no, you're allowed to, if you live close enough to the trash, you can throw your trash

891
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
bag out the window.

892
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,380
I would have had to bullseye fucking 100 360 no scope it to make it into the trash can.

893
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,220
You have your other roommate go down there.

894
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,380
That was the problem, was the going down part.

895
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,380
I lived on the third floor.

896
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,740
I'm not going to walk all the way up and down the stairs.

897
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:02,060
Also they put a fucking code on the lock to the trash cans.

898
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Really?

899
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,420
Yeah, because people were fucking throwing their own trash in there that didn't belong

900
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
to them.

901
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
Oh, okay.

902
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Scumbags.

903
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
Right.

904
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,420
Ruining shit for everybody.

905
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
at my apartment.

906
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,660
Just give it to a homeless person instead.

907
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,660
They like it.

908
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,020
They build clothes and house out of it.

909
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,900
I will say the people, the homeless people in this neighborhood seem to have a serious

910
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,140
fucking trash addiction.

911
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
Yeah.

912
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,140
They're like fucking.

913
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
They're digging through it.

914
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,140
They're eating it.

915
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
They're snarfing it down.

916
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,020
It's like not even out of my hands before there's a guy with a black and mild in his

917
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,380
mouth like picking out all the cans.

918
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,860
The way that people around here wear like.

919
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,100

944
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,800
exactly with cardboard and trash materials they could be shooting you into

945
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,960
space and learning like how what happens when the human body freezes in a vacuum

946
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,680

00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,080
- They have open tryouts, but also like,

958
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,000
how hard is it to, like, if you're fucking,

959
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,400
like I heard one story that was like,

960
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,520
a guy was homeless, I can't remember the guy's name,

961
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,360
and he tried out for the--

962
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,180
- Homeless Jim.

963
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,100
- I think it was Homeless Jim.

964
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,480
He was homeless, and a guy came up to him

965
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,840
and he was like, "Hey, like the Pistons are playing,

966
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,940
"or the Piston G League thing is tomorrow,

967
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,820
are like you should go like try out for that and ended up getting it and i was

968
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:05,880
like how stupid you have to be to be literally seven feet tall and on the

969
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,900
street and never think once like maybe i should play basketball.

970
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:15,140
Like maybe i'd be good at basketball yeah like that guy that guy deserves to

971
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,140
be homeless. If i ever if i'm ever like about to have like a if i'm ever going

972
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,900
to have like a big break i'll probably be homeless for like a day beforehand. So

973
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,740
i can say like i made it from like being homeless, you know, like the king of the

974
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,760
world, because that's coming for me. Yeah, yeah, I would look. I remember there's

981
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,920
a life changing experience. I didn't realize that people were addicted to

1047
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:38,120
Toilets are wider to account for fat asses. What? Because only women can be fat. No, well women have big fat asses and big juicy tits

So yeah, would you rather press like the button that like makes a bright red

1101
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,800
light or like a button that makes a bright green light?

1102
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,400
If you could drink a drink that made you drunk, would you do it?

1103
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,980
Yeah, like what food would you eat?

1104
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:36,980

1105
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,500
would you? I would. Yeah, would you rather have like fingers on your hands

1106
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,540
or toes on your feet?

1107
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,800
(laughter)

1108
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,040
- Alright, you get two ears and you get to hear out of them.

1109
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,880
- Yeah.

1110
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,880
- But, when you put your fingers in them,

1111
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,720
you can't hear anything.

1112
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,560
- Okay, yeah.

1113
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,980
You have $10 to build your perfect woman.

1114
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,400
If $5 is beautiful, $5 is perfect.

1115
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,640
(laughter)

1116
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,840
- You have $10 to get a chicken salad sandwich at Subway.

1117
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,920
(laughter)

1118
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,760
What do you get?

1119
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,080

1120
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,920
- Yeah.

1121
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,740
- Yeah.

1122
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,500
What are your free topics? Hypothetically, this is all hypothetical, right? Yeah. This

1123
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:24,640
is the hypotheticals. Are you taking a million dollars? If you had a job that paid you a

1124
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,580
million dollars a year and you got a million dollars, would you take the job? If you won

1125
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,140
the lottery, would you rather win one million dollars all at once or whenever? Just randomly.

1126
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,380
would or wall at the same time. Do you guys trust yourselves enough to do the lump sum

1127
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:48,620
with the lottery? No. I would have to. No you, okay. Here's what, no lump sum, lump sum, lump

1128
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:53,900
sum. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'd have to do the math on it. I feel like, I feel like

1129
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,100
like literally what I would do is I would sit down and be like, I have to do the math on

1130
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:03,180
it. No, I would sit down and be like how long do I think I'm going to live? Oh, true. Like.

1131
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,180
Well, but it's not like they...

1132
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,480
Yeah, well true, because I don't know what happens to the rest of the money if you die.

1133
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,580
I would like, if I won that much money, I literally, I would sit down and be like,

1134
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:15,180
"Do I think I'm living to like 40, 60, 70?"

1135
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,580
Like, how much money should I like be aiming to spend?

1136
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,080
Because that's a lot, like if you win like that much money,

1137
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,580
I guess you probably want to leave some of it to your kids, but still.

1138
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,280
I honestly think in my life, I will win the lottery.

1139
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,680
Yeah, it could happen.

1140
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,780
I have a true belief that I will win the lottery.

1141
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:33,540
I feel like it's coming dude.

1142
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,540
Yeah?

1143
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,180
How often do you play?

1144
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,180
Never.

1145
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,180
I've played one time and it was wins.

1146
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,180
That's it.

1147
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,180
That's it.

1148
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,180
That's it.

1149
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,180
It's only wins.

1150
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,660
The lottery can smell when you're a stinky old lady who buys a hundred scratch tickets

1151
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,660
a day.

1152
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,660
It won't let you win.

1153
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,660
Have you ever won a scratcher?

1154
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,660
Yeah, I won a bunch of scratchers.

1155
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,660
Oh really?

1156
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:52,660
Yeah.

1157
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,660
My dad gets...

1158
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,660
I got a hundred bucks on a scratcher and it's nice.

1159
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,660
Since I was like six or seven.

1160
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,660
I know.

1161
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,860
My parents let me scratch it and then I got to buy whatever I wanted.

1162
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,940
that dude I bought an external hard drive for the computer and I put all my games

1163
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,420
on it. Nice. Doing a scratcher when you're underage is so sick.

1164
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,140
Yeah. You have to give it to your... Especially if you win too much dude it sucks though

1165
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:15,580
because then it's like your parents are in charge of it. Yeah. But I was since ever since I was like

1166
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,700
six or seven my dad's gift to me at Christmas every year has been five

1167
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:25,980
scratchers. Yeah. So sick. Yeah. And I won one year but then we have a my dad

1168
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,060
makes this fucking lame-ass rule where it's like if you win over $500 everyone

1169
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:36,140
splits it it's like oh dude fuck you yeah yeah I'm 13 you have a job you fucking

1170
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:40,220
lazy piece of shit you're fucking waiting on me to use all my luck so that

1171
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,740
you can have 200 bucks dude fuck yeah yeah but I didn't ever tell him that I'm

1172
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,340
really scared of him actually there were guys that would play games of skate for

1173
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:54,140
scratchers yeah and scratchers is like they bought like $20 worth of scratchers

1174
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,140
Absolutely.

1175
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,900
Yeah, it's so sick though.

1176
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,720
I think one dude won like, they bought like 20 bucks worth of scratchers after he won a

1177
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,580
game of skate and then he won like 120.

1178
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,940
Which is like man, fuck.

1179
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,260
You won twice that day.

1180
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,260
That's crazy.

1181
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:14,780
It's basically getting one spin of a slot printed out and that's what you have.

1182
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:21,540
When we moved into our apartment in Boston, our realtor just gave us a free scratcher.

1183
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,620
wrote like I like thank you for like choosing like me or whatever and then

1184
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:30,260
like put a scratcher and we won like like 25 bucks on I bought one every once in

1185
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,220
a while like fuck you and then she and then I never emailed her again or print I

1186
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,940
pretended she didn't exist yeah nice yeah bitch if I have if I have five bucks

1187
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,180
and I'm like getting a soda down at the corner store I'll pick up a scratcher I

1188
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:47,020
for some reason thought I think it's Powerball isn't it like you have to be a

1189
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:53,820
resident of the place that you bought the ticket. You are a resident. Yeah, but like

1190
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:59,460
legally. You are legally, you reside in New York City. Yeah, but my ID. That

1191
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:04,100
doesn't mean anything. Yeah. Okay, so I could be buying scratchers? Yeah, yeah you

1192
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,940
could be buying, well scratchers, you can buy scratchers, I mean it's literally you

1193
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,300
hand a guy five dollars, he doesn't even ID you. You know what we should do? You buy them out of

1194
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,380
vending machines. We should go and just buy like a whole roll. The entire roll?

1195
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,380
We buy a whole roll of scratchers.

1196
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,380
That would be sick though.

1197
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,380
One dollar scratchers.

1198
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,380
Yeah.

1199
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,380
Spend the entire Patreon one month.

1200
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
Yeah.

1201
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,380
Just see what we make, dude.

1202
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,380
We could swing a thousand dollars to buy a whole roll of scratchers.

1203
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,380
Yeah.

1204
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,380
Oh, fuck.

1205
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,380
That's doable.

1206
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:31,380
I mean, I have a thought like that every month, though.

1207
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,380
Yeah.

1208
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,380
Yeah.

1209
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,380
Every month I have some thought where I'm like, "What if we just put it all on one horse

1210
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,380
that we bet on or something?"

1211
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,380
Yeah.

1212
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,380
And then maybe we get really rich.

1213
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,380
Who fucking knows?

1214
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:46,540
on or something. Yeah. And then maybe we get really rich, who fucking knows. Yeah. That'd

1215
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,900
be cool, right? It would be cool. Just 100 times whatever we make. Horse racing would

1216
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,660
be cool. I would love to go to a horse race. We should do the Kentucky Derby. I'm down.

1217
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:01,060
I'm small enough to be a jockey. Costumes. Costumes. Yep. Kentucky Derby costumes. And

1218
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,420
you know I'm gonna have a biscuit. And you know. You know my hat's gonna be big. I'm

1219
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:11,740
thinking guy dressed all in purple with a big clock. Yeah. For the Kentucky Derby. That

1220
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,100
could be good yeah. I think that'd be a good one yeah. What where is like yeah

1221
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,140
where is the Kentucky Derby? I know I'm thinking of it now I'm thinking of our

1222
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,860
Brian character but he goes like another level into it like he like he like gets

1223
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,900
food at a restaurant he's like he's like and you know I'm gonna be stealing that

1224
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:38,140
and you know that means I'm not gonna pay anybody for it. He explains it further yeah. In a higher voice yeah and he keeps going just yeah and you know I'm

1225
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,340
I'm stealing that and you know I'm just kidding that's after he finds himself

1226
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,120
and he becomes a better person. He introduces another layer yeah, yeah,

1227
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:51,120
we're kind of just making a guy with like a little like disorder yeah. More

1228
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,880
we get into this. I think this is I think most guys are that guys with mental

1229
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,300
disorder. Most guys have mental disorder. It's okay. My mental is completely

1230
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,400
clean you they've done tests. I'm disorderly. They've scanned my brain and

1231
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,660
they found I don't know really they found nothing there. They said, sir, you

1232
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,080
of chaos in there. No, no, they said that to me. Oh, really? Yeah, they're too

1233
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:15,480
scared. And I said, I said this, yes, no, you blew their minds. So you have a

1234
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,780
bunch of you have a ball of black and red crap in the middle of your head.

1235
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,680
Yeah, you have there's a bunch of tangled string in there. It'd be cool to

1236
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,780
get an x-ray from a doctor and they're just like all right cool. Would you

1237
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,880
rather get an x-ray from a doctor or a nurse? Definitely a nurse dude.

1238
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:39,440
male nurse. Because if they fuck it up, male nurse. Because they're gonna fuck it up probably.

1239
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,760
And then I get, I sue them. Yeah. You know? And you know I just irradiated my patient.

1240
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,880
Malpractice is one of the scariest things to me. Medical malpractice. Why? They're not

1241
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,920
doing anything to you. You don't go to the doctor. I know. Because of this I'm afraid

1242
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,680
of it. You're afraid they're gonna like, they're gonna prescribe you the wrong knee brace? No,

1243
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,440
have you ever seen that Malcolm in the Middle episode where he's like, oh I'm fine now but

1244
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,540
but then the doctors are like,

1245
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,600
oh, I'm gonna go through with the surgery anyway.

1246
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,160
- No. - No?

1247
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,120
- You think you're gonna go to the doctor

1248
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,240
and they're just gonna operate on you,

1249
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,320
you're gonna have no say in it?

1250
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,640
- Yeah.

1251
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,880
- What world do you live in? - You don't think

1252
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,160
a doctor would do that?

1253
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,440
- A doctor cannot, - What?

1254
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,280
- Can't just operate on you - You don't think a surgeon

1255
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,320
would just do that? - Without your consent?

1256
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,760
- True, I guess it's not a problem for me.

1257
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,880
- Unless it's a life-saving operation,

1258
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,320
and you have to, and if you're unconscious,

1259
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,360
and you still have to have somebody

1260
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,400
who can talk for you. - I guess this is a problem

1261
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,360
that you would only have as a child.

1262
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,200
- Yeah.

1263
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,440
- 'Cause your parents have to be the ones

1264
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,320
to give the consent, right?

1265
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,880
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

1266
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,560
So your problem is that you thought that doctors--

1267
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,040
- You thought your parents were gonna let the doctors

1268
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,320
like tear you apart for no reason.

1269
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,880
- But you still think now that doctors,

1270
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,320
just you don't have any rights.

1271
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,640
- You think that a doctor's gonna see you

1272
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,540
and be like, "We need to cut you open right now."

1273
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:53,380
- Yeah.

1274
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,120
- We have to take his bones.

1275
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,960
- Yeah.

1276
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,960
- He's got bad bones.

1277
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,760
- Yeah, sir, there's something inside you.

1278
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:03,100
I think a doctor, what if I wake up on the operating table

1279
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,360
and my whole arm bone is gone and it's wiggling around

1280
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,000
like that scene in Harry Potter?

1281
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,840
- Oh yeah.

1282
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,660
- Oh, that would be scary.

1283
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,660
That scene's scary.

1284
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:14,660
I think that scene did scare me

1285
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,260
when I watched that as a kid.

1286
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,100
The wiggling bone.

1287
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,700
- The fact that it hurt when it re-grew scared me.

1288
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,740
I was like, ugh.

1289
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,340
- Broken bones in general scared me a lot, I think.

1290
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,340
- Funny medical thing.

1291
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,540
I was, funny little medical story I have.

1292
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,380
- What a tidbit.

1293
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,820
- So my left eye has just been like

1294
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,580
watering constantly recently.

1295
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,820
And I think it's like just an allergy or something.

1296
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,880
But when I was having lunch with my buddy the other day,

1297
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,180
and I was just telling him about it,

1298
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,280
I hadn't seen him in a while.

1299
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,860
I was like, oh yeah, it's so weird.

1300
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,820
I have this like fucking watery eye thing.

1301
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:47,380
Like, it's so annoying.

1302
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,420
And I was like, who knows, maybe it's brain cancer.

1303
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:51,240
And he was like, oh yeah, that's funny.

1304
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,540
You know what's also funny?

1305
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,900
I had this friend that I used to work with

1306
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,820
who his left eye would twitch constantly and then we make all these jokes like

1307
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:03,300
maybe it's brain cancer or something and then it was actually brain cancer and he

1308
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:08,820
died. Wow. And I was like that is a funny little tidbit. Don't tell me that

1309
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,020
when I said that I have like the exact same thing going on my eyes. It's

1310
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,020
different. Yeah. There's something weird with my eye. Water is different than a twitch. But it

1311
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:24,060
also twitches. Have you ever considered you might just be sad? No.

1312
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:26,060
Okay. Open up your heart.

1313
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
Anything to plug?

1314
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,060
Ummm...FUCK YOU!

1315
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,060
Poop store.
