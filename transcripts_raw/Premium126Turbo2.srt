42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,080
What he does is unconscionable. That's right. What's up? Yep, about those truckers.

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,880
He won't let them... What is it? Is that still happening? Yeah, it's still happening.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Really? He won't let them do loop-de-loops. Yeah, they want to do loop-de-loops like a

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,880
Hot Wheels track. Dude, they want to make burritos in the parking lot. They want to do burnouts.

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,120
They won't let them do it. He won't let them get microwaves in their car.

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Burnritos. He said you can't have PlayStation in the cab of your truck.

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna do this again. I'm just kidding. That's not true. But you did

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,920
say you're not allowed to use CDs. Yeah. Yeah. You have to use that the tape adapter thing.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,120
He said he thinks it's distracting to put a CD in the car while you drive. Yeah. He

51
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,800
says he says, Well, how about you be a car driver instead of a truck driver? Yeah. He

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,520
also said, I want to see D so bad. How about you car drive? I bet you see these nuts? What?

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,280
He also said that truckers aren't allowed to put anything in their trucks. The trucks have

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
have to be empty. Is the trucker thing still happening?

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
We just said.

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
They just actually, there was a big movement in it where now they're allowed to put one thing in the back of the truck.

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
They move the trucks. Yeah, they're allowed to move the truck with one thing.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
They move the trucks one inch.

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
But they still have to hold their breath the whole time they're driving.

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Yeah, because it's like driving a truck is like swimming, so you should be holding your breath.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
That's one of those things. That's the thing, this guy's an idiot.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
He doesn't even understand anything.

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
He said you should be able to drown while driving a truck.

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, well he said the truck has to be full of water.

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,600
That's just not okay.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,320
Yeah, he said anything that you,

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,000
he said you can only bring fish.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Yeah, he also said, he said trucks can go forward,

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,240
back and turn left or right, but they can't go up or down.

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Nope.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
No, that just can't be true.

72
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
So if there's a single--

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,580
That's not right.

74
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,420
That just can't be true though.

75
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,760
If there's a single inch of elevation on the route,

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,600
they can't do it.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,700
This just in, that can't be true though.

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
That's right.

79
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,360
Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,040
Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
If I was a newsman, I'd be making all sorts of puns.

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,820
And apparently he called the truckers the motherfuckers.

84
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,820
Oh my God.

85
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
That doesn't even rhyme.

86
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
That's just insulting.

87
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Oh yeah, wait, it does rhyme.

88
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,940
Oh wow, that's actually kind of cool.

89
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
I'm not opposed to that.

90
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,940
Okay, now that I found out that it rhymed.

91
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,180
Now that I found out that he's cool.

92
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,820
Hold on, let me look at my rhyming dictionary to double check if that rhymes.

93
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,260
And apparently I also heard that he called bikers "motherfucker likers."

94
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,980
Hmm, well that, does that rhyme?

95
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,580
Bikers for truckers is a big group now.

96
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,740
I'm going to be a biker.

97
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,300
I'm a motherfucker liker.

98
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Yeah, it does.

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah, it does rhyme.

100
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,820
And he also said that mailmen are--

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,260
- Snailmen, 'cause his mail goes so slow.

102
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
- Yeah, he did say that.

103
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,920
- He said, no, he said--

104
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,340
- He was the guy who came up with snail mail.

105
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,180
- How come mail isn't faster now?

106
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,860
- He said that they're crailmen.

107
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,700
Crail is an insult he came up with, though.

108
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,860
- Yeah? - Yeah.

109
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,700
- Like a crail tap?

110
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,540
- Nope, he just said one day, he was like, "You crail."

111
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,620
And everyone was like, "Oh."

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,940
- That's an 80-word. - Yeah, something.

113
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,620
- How come the mail isn't faster now?

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,100
You'd think the mail would be faster now.

115
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,460
- Well, that's why you use email, extremely fast mail.

116
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,220
- If you're still using normal mail,

117
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,100
you kind of deserve it, I think,

118
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,300
'cause everyone else has moved on to email, texting,

119
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
airdrop, SMS.

120
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,540
- They don't call it snail mail for nothing, brother.

121
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,380
They don't call it snail mail for nothing.

122
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,100
- Packages go pretty fast, too.

123
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,940
- And here's the thing, though,

124
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,060
if a snail was as fast as mail is,

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,940
that would be, you got a serious movie called Turbo on you.

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,700
(laughing)

127
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,180
You have an actual Turbo-style movie.

128
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,020
- I guess mail is, it's as fast as a car.

129
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,460
- Dude, they made a TV show.

130
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,260
They made a series out of Turbo.

131
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,900
- Dude, there was an iPhone game for that.

132
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,740
- Really?

133
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,580
- Or maybe it was at that point,

134
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,940
it was probably an iPod Touch game.

135
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,220
- We gotta get Turbo merch.

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,380
I think that's our next move.

137
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,100
- Turbo is swag.

138
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,940
- I bet there's the coolest Turbo shirt in the world.

139
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Would that be sick if they tried to,

140
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,020
they probably made it look like old,

141
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,180
oh, that would be tight.

142
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,380
It made to look like old NASCAR stuff from the '90s,

143
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,700
but it's the Turbo snail.

144
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
- Oh, that would be cool as fuck.

145
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,180
- That would be so dope.

146
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,860
- Yeah, it looks like a Dale Earnhardt judgy.

147
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,020
- You ever hear what happened to Snail Earnhardt?

148
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,860
- Double sides.

149
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,540
- Snail Earnhardt.

150
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,980
- Yeah, he turned left too slow.

151
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,300
- Turbo two, the fall of Snail Earnhardt.

152
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,260
- He just, his shell just explodes.

153
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,300
He's stuck inside the shell.

154
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,140
- Oh my God.

155
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,960
- Dale Earnhardt.

156
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
- Yeah, you know what happened?

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,140
He became a slug.

158
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,300
- My mom was at the NASCAR cafe

159
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,060
in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina when he died.

160
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,900
Pretty cool.

161
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,100
I bet they put the checkered flag at half mast.

162
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
They did.

163
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Yeah.

164
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
And people got confused.

165
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,340
They didn't know if that meant go or...

166
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,860
That's why everyone in the restaurant ran out.

167
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Everyone was running in a circle.

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,860
Yeah.

169
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,900
They all ran out of the restaurant because they thought that meant 9/11 too.

170
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,140
NASCAR is cool as fuck.

171
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Yeah.

172
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
NASCAR is awesome, dude.

173
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
NASCAR is sick.

174
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
I want to get some NASCAR information in my brain.

175
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,820
My favorite NASCAR driver would be Bobby.

176
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,660
Yeah, for me it would have to be the gay guy from that movie instead.

177
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Yeah.

178
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Oh, yeah.

179
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
John C. Reilly?

180
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,660
No.

181
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,660
he's in it and he's like yeah, I like people be a

182
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,760
pelia. I'm going to suck dc my boyfriend and everyone in two

183
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,060
thousand six is like what the fuck's going on. His boyfriend

184
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,960
is Andy Richter, most believable part of the whole movie. Yep,

185
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
yep,

186
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,460
that's true. It's very it's believable for Andy Richter to

187
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,660
be someone's boyfriend, but he can't be the guy who has a

188
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,460
but yeah, he doesn't have a specifically. He doesn't have

189
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,860
enough initiative or like yeah, he's the sidekick boyfriend

190
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,260
Exactly even in even in his relationships. He can't be like, oh, this is my boyfriend. He has to say I'm this guy's boy. Yeah

191
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,140
They're my boyfriend. Yeah, this guy I'm his boyfriend

192
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,980
Mom dad, I'd like to meet you. I like

193
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:46,580
Yep, yeah

194
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,200
Yeah, that's a woman just saw Borat for the first time yeah

195
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,800
Great, it's a great thing to show somebody Borat for the first time. I'd rather see a snoring rat. Yeah, no

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,380
I love Borat do you this is lying to you? We're at it's so good. It's the best. It's the best movie of all time

197
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,580
It's so crazy. I feel like it comes back to us every I mean like no every like six months

198
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,700
I watch it we watch it again, and we just talk about it for like a week when he's saying

199
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, that's the funniest that's so many good moments

200
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:24,540
Oh my god, every every part every inch every nook and cranny of that movie. Oh my god, so good. Yeah

201
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:31,180
Said that uh, we will the national anthem. Yeah, so when he says we will drink the blood of every man woman and child

202
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,180
Yeah

203
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,180
even a lizard. Yeah, remember, we're just literally just repeating jokes from 4Head now. They're

204
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:51,580
good jokes. Oh dude. The part where he's interviewing the old guy and the old guy's just like, "Yeah,

205
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,580
we need to hang all the gay people." Oh yeah. It's so crazy dude. That guy, I hope he's doing

206
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,380
well. When he starts unpacking his suitcase in the elevator. Yep, that shit's funny. That

207
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,900
you should start to bore at three mm-hmm come on hit us up hit us up to do what

213
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:51,020
what did the five fingers say to the face slap bitch that's right yeah we'll be

214
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,140
Like the Three Stooges were gonna be like, "Get in there, dog! Get in there, dog! I'm up in there, dog!"

215
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,740
We're gonna end like the Three Stooges.

216
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
"I'm Rich Biatch!"

217
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,100
"Nah, see? I'm Rich Biatch!"

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,540
That's what the Three Stooges did.

219
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,900
That's what, when they got the, when the Three Stooges found the Jawbreakers,

220
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,980
they said, "I'm Rich Biatch."

221
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,820
Did you see the new Three Stooges movie with Will Sasso?

222
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,740
Yes, I half of it and I shut it off.

223
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,260
I refuse to watch it.

224
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm a big Will Sasso fan. Oh dude, Will Sasso's the best. I bet it's a good movie. Oh no,

225
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,300
the Three Stooges are the best. Will Sasso's so, dude, remember he did-

226
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,380
What are your comedy influences? Probably the Three Stooges. I watched so much Three

227
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,700
Stooges growing up. I think I've- I don't think I've seen- I was kind of a weird kid.

228
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,740
My favorite was Shemp. You ever watch the New Year's Eve Three Stooges marathon on TV? Yeah.

229
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,540
Yeah, I watched that every year. I was big into Three Stooges and Little Rascals as a kid.

230
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,060
Yeah. And my mom started, because my mom would show us those, and then my mom started showing my nephews

231
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,540
those little rascals. And there's just an episode where they get like a genie's bottle

232
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:09,100
and like Stimey immediately wishes for a watermelon. It's so crazy. It's so crazy that like

233
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,820
that yeah it's like it's racist as hell. I never knew how racist. Who's Stimey? Stimey's a little black boy.

234
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,820
this three rascals those three little rascals I've seen maybe one episode of

235
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,900
three stooges and I've seen the newer little rascals movie yeah with Trump's

236
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,940
and Trump is Waldo's dad dude I don't I didn't even watch it I've watched it

237
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,340
like five years ago what and I like just looked at my phone the whole time cuz

238
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,740
it's a it's got the whole movies his kids talking no Brooks is in that he

239
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
Mel Brooks is in it?

240
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,540
Mel Brooks is in it, he plays a banker.

241
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
That doesn't make any sense.

242
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,540
You don't understand that?

243
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,140
I don't think that's true.

244
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
I think you thought it was Mel Brooks.

245
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
I think it was a different actor, yeah.

246
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,340
You just saw a banker?

247
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
Just immediately?

248
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,420
You guys should see Mel Brooks in the Harry Potter movies.

249
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,820
They cloned him over and over again like Willy Wonka.

250
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:09,380
They do, I forgot about this, in the 94 Little Rascals, they go on each other's shoulders,

251
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,260
they go into the bank dressed up like ha seats.

252
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
- Really?

253
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,920
- Yeah.

254
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
(laughing)

255
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,600
- I think I remember that.

256
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,580
- I was like, oh, I think they fixed all the racism

257
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,740
in the new Little Rascals.

258
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,380
It's like, no, we gotta stay true to four.

259
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,460
We gotta do like the most racist thing we can do.

260
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,020
- I know, oh, thank God they didn't make them

261
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,260
the PC Rascals.

262
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,100
- Yeah.

263
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,920
- Oh my God.

264
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,740
- They're probably gonna make a reboot called the PC Peewees.

265
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,580
- Probably.

266
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,220
(laughing)

267
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
- Gonna ruin everything.

268
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,620
- Probably these days they might actually do something

269
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,140
to the freaking woke tykes.

270
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,260
- The woke tots.

271
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,460
yeah and there the songs like

272
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:46,260
trigger warning. Oh my God trigger. They would have that in the side. They

273
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,960
would have that content warning mischief. Yeah, content warning three little

274
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,160
kids bastards and they're bastards because they don't have a dad and that's

275
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,660
okay. Nowadays, it's okay to be a actually normal to not have a dad these

276
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,860
days. It's actually completely some because they have five moms. Yeah, five

277
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,760
moms all named Terry. Uh-huh. Yeah, and they have parents there. They may be

278
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
me name Terry, but they're Karens at the CVS.

279
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,760
They're Karens in spirit, and they wear those cotton shorts that got their fupa in them.

280
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,480
Oh yeah. Oh my God, that thing is so sick.

281
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,440
You know those shorts?

282
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
I want to bury my fucking head in that.

283
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,640
Yep. You know those shorts that your gym teacher wears?

284
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:20,960
Trampoline fupas.

285
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,800
You know that if you smelled that fupa, it'd be exactly like a library.

286
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
It would smell like a library.

287
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
It would smell like old ass books.

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Or like sourdough starter.

289
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,120
I was about to say like bread dough.

290
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,680
You know when you have it in a Ziploc bag and you're...

291
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Oh my god.

292
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
You have rising yeast.

293
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,960
So you can make a pizza later.

294
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Oh my god.

295
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Yeah.

296
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah.

297
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,560
Man, I'd be speed bagging that fupa and dislocate my elbows.

298
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Oh my god.

299
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Your arms would be bouncing back too violently.

300
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah, dude.

301
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,600
I would have her like spread her legs and then I'd get in the creases between the thighs

302
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
and the fupa.

303
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
You're getting too far about this.

304
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
And then I'd have her...

305
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,200
As soon as you started this with spread her legs.

306
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,120
I'd have her squeeze her legs back together to push the fine meat up to the fupa and just

307
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,760
crush all my fingers.

308
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
And then I'd take them out and I'd smell every last finger I had.

309
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,960
I'd be bouncing back and forth between all the five fupas like the balls in Hungry Hungry

310
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Hippos.

311
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,080
I'd be addressing the five fupas like they're the Cosa Nostra Five Families.

312
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,560
I'd be coming to them with an offering.

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,100
The Bronx, yeah. Oh my god the five fupa's on me like that scene in the Incredibles

314
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,680
when those black balls stick to him. Yeah, just being completely suffocated dude. Oh my god.

315
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,560
Crushed like a trash compactor, a gas compactor. I'm walking around looking like the...

316
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I know those cotton shorts don't got a string. Damn, she got a gas compactor.

317
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm walking around looking like the slitulent man.

318
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Yep, yep, yep.

319
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Katamari, I'm like Katamari Dame Nancy.

320
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Yep.

321
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Because they're all named Nancy now.

322
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
No, they're named Terry and they're Karen's.

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Katamari Terry.

324
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Karen.

325
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Katamari Terry.

326
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Yep.

327
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,820
(laughing)

328
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,660
- Yep.

329
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,960
- Katamari Terry.

330
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,420
- Wouldn't it be, how crazy would it be

331
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,900
if the next Mario game came out or something,

332
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,060
you see the trailer and you're just

333
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,140
one of the guys in the movie?

334
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,980
- Me?

335
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,800
- Yeah.

336
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
- Specifically me?

337
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,480
- No, just anybody.

338
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,180
That'd be a cool kinda feeling, right?

339
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,420
- Yeah, if someone said I looked like a Mario brother,

340
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,700
yeah, that'd be cool.

341
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,020
- You don't look like one of the brothers,

342
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,140
you look like Wario.

343
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,980
- I don't look like Wario.

344
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,100
- You're like a Mario cousin, I would say.

345
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,140
I feel like I'm the I feel like I'm the anti-warrio.

346
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,060
Like how Mario is like anti or Wario is anti-Mario.

347
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,060
You look like you look like Mariopolis.

348
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
The Greek Mario.

349
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Maurice.

350
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Maurice Mariopolis.

351
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:14,300
Maurice is a Greek Mario and he just owns a diner.

352
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,300
What?

353
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
He just owns a he doesn't have a plumbing.

354
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Why did you say that?

355
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,940
of a plumbing business. He just owns a diner in his and what are you going to

356
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,880
say that he smells that he has covered in Greece, too much body hair. That's

357
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,580
where he's from

358
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:32,780
you did you are your racism is showing today. The only really I knew two Greek

359
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,320
people growing up. One of you so you think he eats napkins. One of them was

360
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,980
my best friend and the other one was the guy who owned the diner. My mom or dad,

361
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,460
you know, it's awesome about Greek diners. They always have a little like

362
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,360
of the kids is just like oh you just works there. I think I talked about this

363
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,920
for a day I was that kid and I was like busing tables I was like 11 and I

364
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,280
burned my hand on the toaster and then they asked for me to never work there

365
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,840
again. I wanted to be that kid so badly I watched my big fat Greek wedding and I

366
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,920
was like mom dad we have to get a diner. I need to become a little Greek boy.

367
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
become a little Greek boy.

368
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,920
That definitely, as a kid, it seemed very cool to live above a store or something.

369
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah.

370
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,320
And then you grew up, you're like, "Why would I want to do that?

371
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Why would that be cool?"

372
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
Yeah.

373
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,680
Why would it be cool to live, like I would just say, "If I lived above a store, then

374
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,560
I could just get free stuff from the store."

375
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
It's not true.

376
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
No, you just have a store.

377
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,120
You're just paying rent to a guy who has a store.

378
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Every kid that lived in the suburbs just wanted to live in, "Hey, Arnold."

379
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,480
That's what I wanted.

380
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,160
I just wanted to like I there's not at any city in North Carolina

381
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,960
I either wanted to live in hey Arnold or Dracula's castle

382
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,100
Actually, I wanted to live in them dragon tails. Oh my god dragon tails

383
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,600
I want to live in Mario that pink dragon was fine

384
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,940
Which one Cassie plus the ones with the two heads exact and wheezy second wheezy. I don't remember any dragon

385
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,280
You don't remember Zack and wheezy no I most of the shows

386
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,540
I watched as a kid had because you know - you know two heads are better than one you know where they added

387
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,500
I do remember that added a third kid to dragon it was what was the guy who's like

388
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,520
their cousin right beat oh it was like it was someone in Emmy and then they

389
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,900
added Enrique yeah it's like their cousin right I don't know I never I

390
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,160
wasn't watching it just put well I think it's like it's like a cousin and he's

391
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,840
like visiting from New Mexico or something I think they just ruined the

392
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,240
sanctity of the show because it's about like - it's like a brother and a sister

393
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,700
yeah we go to Dragon World dragon land you bring cousins into the mix I know

394
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,860
I know that's everything that's what I'm saying you shouldn't have done that.

395
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,580
That one C.S. Lewis, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, get that motherfucking kid out of there.

396
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
Oh my god yeah.

397
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Get that goofy ass.

398
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,580
Edmunds?

399
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,580
No Edmunds is the brother.

400
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,860
What's his name?

401
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
The fucking cousin.

402
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,940
It has a different mass Ed in his name though doesn't it?

403
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,940
I think it's Enrique.

404
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Tedmund.

405
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I think it's Enrique.

406
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
Enrique Pevensey.

407
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Enrique Pevensey.

408
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,980

He goes into the same wardrobe and they're like where did he go? Enrique,

431
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,860
needle in his eye I see that that was sick did you see me actually get some

432
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,380
pepper in my eye the other day that was horrible yeah that was horrifying

433
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,500
disturbing that was a disturbing moment in my life yeah I'm 10 disturbing I

434
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
remember a kid when I was in middle school a kid threw like a handful of

435
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,940
crushed red pepper flake in my eye yeah I flew out and it whizzed around the

436
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,860
room sanded a kid's eye and I remember I was at a pizza place and he was like he

437
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,020
was like sorry and his mom made him apologize to me but I was like I should

438
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,140
like I gotta kill this kid now. Yeah you're allowed to fight a kid.

439
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,700
Mm-hmm. And then if you're like 16 and a four-year-old does anything to you,

440
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,220
you stomp them out. Yeah until you're 18 years old you're legally a child.

441
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,900
You can just beat the shit out of any kid if they give a fuck with you.

442
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,060
And I did. I was 17. I killed a child. I do remember one time...

443
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,220
I think it's a sponge from my record. I remember one time when I was like 15 maybe going to like

444
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,420
like this, like arcade place, because they had like every two weeks it was out of

445
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,700
town. It was like twenty dollars. You play all the games you wanted to all day

446
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,040
long, and I went and like a little kid started messing with me. I was like

447
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,660
fifteen years old, and I really was like I'm gonna like I'm gonna fight a child

448
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,420
like a little ass kid. He was like nine years old, and he was like doing that

449
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,500
thing where I would be like what are you doing? He'd be like what are you doing?

450
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,940
And I was like bro, I have to kill this kid. Yeah, like I now I still wish I did

451
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,280
What did you do? I think I tripped him one time. Nice. Yeah and that was it.

452
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,260
Because I was like, I'm gonna go. That's literally like that's all you have to do. It's like the

453
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,100
least harmful thing. Just trip him. And then you're like, oh whoops, I got big feet.

454
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,540
Yeah. You know. I'm a big guy. Yeah, I'm huge. I did the, I was the opposite. I was a really, you

455
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,780
know, I mean it's pretty obvious. I was a really annoying kid. There's this, this

456
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,740
kid came over his name I forget but he was in my sister's grade he forgets

457
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:58,060
think his name was Marcus no no and I do even win Kevin win yeah that's why I

458
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,460
doesn't want to say it was Kevin McAllister it's Kevin McAllister this

459
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,820
kid I I was just being a little shit I annoyed him and they said do it one more

460
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,300
time I'll beat the shit out of you and my sister's like I don't know like four

461
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,060
four years older than me. So I was like nine. He was like thirteen. He just

462
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,300
fucking wailed on me. Oh, yeah, it's not. I sound like he warned you, though.

463
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,860
Yeah, yeah, but but what I'm glad to see that you didn't learn any lesson. I

464
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,340
did not didn't learn a single lesson. My friend had a had a little brother who

465
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,020
like I think is maybe in a in like a like a old school mental hospital, like

466
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,580
one flew over this cuckoo's nest style now. Yeah, but he used to chase me

467
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,600
ground. He was like way younger than us, but he used to fight. He used to get

468
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,620
like kitchen knives and like shit and just chase us.

469
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,640
Like he was gonna kill us. Yeah. Wow. And then we'd have to just wear

470
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,660
him out by running around the neighborhood as he chased us with knives until he like, he would just

471
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,680
fall asleep in the middle of the road. He'd have to like call his mom

472
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,700
and be like, "Hey, Chris is asleep in the middle of the road." Damn.

473
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,720
It was cool, dude. Yeah. I think I threw a grape

474
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,540
at my sister's middle school boyfriend and he beat the fuck out of me too.

475
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,260
Dude you just, this is telling me everything I need to know. Yeah? Yeah.

476
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,580
Which is that next time that you annoy me I just need to fight you. You've done it

477
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,020
before. Uh-uh. You've slapped me and shit. I'll slap you. Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:32,780
It's just so funny to annoy people. I don't find it that funny. It's so funny.

479
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,860
to to you it's so funny to me and that's all that matters all right this you you

480
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,340
just made it way worse now I'm definitely gonna kill you yeah something

481
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:51,260
about that that was that was really done yeah yeah oh it's just oh it's me shut up

482
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,660
okay shut the fuck up see that's annoying you stick your tongue out of me

483
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,900
again the tongues gonna be in that toilet I'm gonna rip that tongue out of

484
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:09,500
your mouth now cuz then you get like a carbon fiber prosthetic tongue so fast he

485
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,260
could probably become a rapper so much more annoying if he had like like a deus

486
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,500
ex like if you if you were like you had a mod on you'd be so funny if I got like

487
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,700
like cancer or some shit in my arm I had to replace it and then I got like a

488
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,300
robot arm that made me really good at fastballs I want to be I want to be

489
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,340
augmented or uploaded so badly. I have none of the like science fiction thing of

490
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,000
like oh but where like is it still you? Yeah. Like I don't think about that at

491
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,780
all it's like put me in a put me into an Xbox or give me two red arms. I would like to be

492
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,140
mutated I'm not I don't want a robot parts because then that runs out of

493
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,620
batteries that gets rusty I would like to be part animal. Robot legs. I would like

494
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,420
to I would like to look like the mutants from beneath the planet of the apes with

495
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,380
the big bro yeah yeah or maybe like a resident evil monster you want to be an

496
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,780
evil monster yeah I want to be a robot no because you know you know we need to do

497
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,220
is team up and we can really only oh technology you know but here's the

498
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,740
scenario right you two are you two are robots we're going out to fight crime

499
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,660
obviously and and we run into magnet man I'm the only one I have to save your

500
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,700
asses because you guys are both instantly non-magnetic metal in my

501
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,860
my entire body. The best part about turning purple is that no one would

502
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,100
no one would care. No one would care if you were black or white or yellow or

503
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,560
purple. I think if you turned purple, you would be in a zoo right now. If I

504
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,380
turned purple,

505
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,740
that'd be funny if it's like the thing where like you know like how like it's

506
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,940
always like in like movies and stuff. If someone if someone gets powers, the

507
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,060
government wants to like like cut them open and stuff. Yeah. It's that but just

508
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,700
because someone turns like green like nothing happens. It's like we need to

509
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,680
study the green senator that drink the colloidal silver. We need to figure out

510
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:02,980
we need to make our soldiers green. We need a green super soldier army.

511
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,100
Yeah, I mean that would be terrifying. My friend Patrick at school, he turned

512
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,780
purple and then he just vanished. I don't know what happened. Nobody heard

513
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,220
from him. The cover just disappears. You see like purple. President Obama has

514
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,440
eaten purple soup today.

515
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,400
That's in area 51.

516
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,520
they're reporting the color of soup.

517
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,920
Every day, every day. It's like today is different. President

518
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,520
Obama drank ate a purple soup the first time ever. Yeah,

519
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,720
they was that Obama truly became president when he ate a purple

520
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,420
soup. He had a purple soup, but no one knows that it was made

521
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,520
from. Yeah, no one knows the scary ingredients behind the

522
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,220
purple. So I could see you being

523
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:47,020
I can see you being a purple guy.

524
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:54,260
purple people. I could see you getting. Oh dude if I turn purple I gotta watch out for

525
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,700
that people eater. No he's not a purple people eater. No he's a purple people. Guys you guys

526
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,020
are seriously misremembering the song. No it's purple people eater. He's a one eyed, one

527
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:10,100
horned, flying, purple people eater. People eater. They say purple people eater. Flying

528
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,640
and purple people eater. Flying so I get to fly too? Okay riddle me this you fucking geniuses.

529
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,060
if he's a purple people eater, wouldn't he fucking starve to death on account of

530
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,480
there's no fucking purple people? That's why I don't see him yeah, because he's

531
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,880
eating them. He ate them all because he's eating him really yeah. This is

532
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,900
what you guys think also I've seen he's eating the purple. I mean I can tell

533
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,780
you for a fact I've seen him and he's green, so he eats purple people. It's

534
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,340
not per no. You saw a green and per people eater. No yeah, that's that one's

535
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,020
purple. That guy eats green people.

536
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm going to end my life. What are you going to say?

537
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,680
what before I interrupted you I does it matter I think clearly it doesn't

538
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,760
because you decided to go to something you were saying something about you were

539
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,280
saying something about a government oh I just I love you I think you would look

540
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,480
right at home being experimented on an area 51 like they would have like I wish

541
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,840
I didn't ask him what he was yeah no they have like it's not important they'd

542
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,600
have some kind of soda in like a giant hamster feeder yeah yeah yeah you would

543
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,200
would be a great human hamster great was human hamster. I think that you

544
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,060
might be a perfect candidate. Human hamster human hamsterdom. Oh my God.

545
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah, I wouldn't be a good human hamster because I would just be playing

546
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,320
my scientist. I'll be about the boy who has to stay in the bubble, but it's

547
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,600
called human hamster and I got there boy yeah, they're making bubble boy,

548
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,760
but there's nothing to a sickness or anything. It's just you want us to be

549
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,400
here which Jake Gyllenhaal or John Travolta one you would be Jake Gyllenhaal

550
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,140
on the remake. Okay, I feel I get to me, Verne Troyer. No, it's completely

551
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,560
different. It's ham, it's human hamster, so they got a different

552
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,660
lot. It's a re walking around a hamster cage with like he's got those like

553
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,220
boxers on that have all the hearts

554
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:08,080
is eating like like a protein, a great ball pellets be so awesome. Oh my God,

555
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,220
He's like shitting all over the place and be like, "What the hell is all this shit?"

556
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
I would not have it.

557
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,720
Some creatures coming in here and shitting all over the place.

558
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Little creatures, yeah.

559
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Anyway, I'll be on my wheel.

560
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
I don't know.

561
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,320
I don't think I'd like a hamster wheel.

562
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,720
I don't think that you would use the wheel.

563
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,120
I think the wheel would be growing cobwebs on it.

564
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Yeah.

565
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,120
You'd be too busy sitting in front of the theater drinking the most soda ever.

566
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
The theater.

567
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120

It's kind of gross that song is about having sex with a guy and pretending. It's a woman

787
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,940
I think that's a song is about having sex with a woman in a dress made of meat.

788
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
That's right.

789
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
Nah.

790
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Yep.

791
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,820
Lady Gaga's butt is low-key fire.

792
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,220
When it's covered in steak.

793
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,220
Yep.

794
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,700
There's something so delicious about my wife in that dress.

795
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,180
My guy's eating raw meat.

796
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,300
I would love to cook her.

797
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,980
You should link her up with liver king.

798
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,340
I would love to throw her on the grill.

799
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,620
Lady Gaga, she'd probably let you do it.

800
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,620
She's such a stupid bitch.

801
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,980
I don't know that she might be cool. Yeah, she could be cool. What's that?

802
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Everyone was like like in like

803
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:44,480
2009 or whatever like when Lady Gaga was like doing like all the fucking like the meat suits and stuff like she's doing all the

This woman is crazy. Yeah, this woman is insane. It is funny

806
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,380
I never would have expected like in like when I'm middle school or whatever hearing like like yeah

807
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,960
Seeing all the Lady Gaga stuff. I would not have expected her to have the to be in the space and culture that she is now

808
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,060
Yeah, she's just like what normal is a lady with a nice boy. She's in movies

809
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,780

838
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:35,720
where they have like the like the only thing at the in the post-credits scene of the Batman is just the Joker text that says

839
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,920
Goodbye, and everyone in the theater goes

840
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:48,140
Six society are the Riddler Joker sent a text message the Riddler sends a text at the end of the Batman

841
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:54,020
I don't think it goes to everyone's phone in the theater. I don't think that people should have like villains have phones and movies

842
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,240
Yeah, like that's not that's what he had a computer the Riddler who's paying for the phone

843
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,320
He had a computer with a webcam.

844
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,800
That's goofy as hell.

845
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,120
He shouldn't have a ring light.

846
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,280
He didn't have a ring light.

847
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
He did have a ring light.

848
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,840
Remember when he did the Twitch streams?

849
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,360
Oh, where he put the...

850
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,920
Where Riddler does the Twitch streams.

851
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,520
We should get those microphones that look like ears that people use.

852
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,120
I kept trying to tell Julio to buy one of those.

853
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,120
And he said no.

854
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,120
He said no.

855
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,120
He should do that for the Twitch.

856
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Yeah, I know.

857
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
That's what I said.

858
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
We should do Jubio ASMR.

859
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
Yeah, that's what I was trying to get him to do.

860
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,120
It wouldn't work.

861
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:39,380
What am I doing? It doesn't taste very good, but I guess I will keep doing it.

862
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:45,960
What's he eating? The ear, that's what they do. Oh, they eat the ear? They like

906
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Bet you don't.

907
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:50,780
We have a friend who lives around him, near him, next to him. And someone like...

908
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
He lives in his air conditioning.

909
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,280
Yeah, he lives in his air conditioning.

910
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,780
It lives in his ducts. It's an elf.

911
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,980
He's got a little Pomeranian.

912
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,480
We know a borrower, okay? We know a borrower. Fine.

913
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,440
he had to fight a Pomeranian. Our friend who's a borrower in Nathan

914
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,880
Fielder's house had to fight a Pomeranian with a toothpick. And it was huge.

915
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,200
Because they were going for the same ball. Yeah. Which is the problem.

916
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:23,960
The ball to a borrower is basically an RV. I mean well yeah a ball like if you

917
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,240
think about like humanity inventing the wheel, the ball is the borrower's

918
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,800
wheel. Yeah. That's like the most important invention of all time. I

919
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,360
I didn't I feel like the world would be completely different if we had invented

920
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,700
the ball before the wheel. Yeah, because the ball is a is a wheel on a three

921
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,680
dimensional wheel. I think we did invent the ball before the wheel because I

922
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,360
don't think it's just like it's just a role as a concept for a perfect a

923
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,400
perfect ball. Oh perfect. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it had to be perfect

924
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,480
in order to do it. Super bounce. Yeah, perfect ball. Once we invented rubber. I

925
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:06,520
mean boss I mean I like God I invented rubber before the week yeah you don't

926
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:13,400
have we have all this rubber but we don't know what to do with it rubber

927
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,280
rubber is a naturally occurring no it's not so you invent you invent a ball you

928
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,280
don't invent a ball you invent a ball but not rubber is what you're saying

929
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,360
yes no you're wrong a ball is not naturally occur before the wheel we'd be

930
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:30,200
bouncing everywhere yeah same if we invented rubber I think we'd be better

931
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,720
rubber comes out if we invented rubber at first rubber first we would have

932
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,800
flubber by you guys are pissing me off rubber is a tree thing yeah but you have

933
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,560
to turn it into the rubber nope you just spit on the rubber buns and liquor

934
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,280
remember that joke no what are you even saying I don't remember it either I just

935
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,440
