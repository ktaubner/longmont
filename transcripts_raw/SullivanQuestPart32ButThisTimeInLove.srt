1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
*snoring*

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
*cough*

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh fuck, what time is it?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh shit!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, uh, okay, I gotta finish.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Um, uh, where was I? Where was I?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I see there was a frog in the...

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh yeah.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Level up!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're at a fizzy drink.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm gonna go get some.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just hold up until I get back.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's still my turn.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, come on.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Just go on your phone, man.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll be back in like five minutes.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Fine.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Remember to get grape, okay?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No promises.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And a promise is a promise.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Repeat that.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A promise...

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is a promise.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is a promise.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is a promise.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is a promise.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is a promise.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is a promise.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is a promise.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is a promise.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is a promise.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is a promise.

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,400
That is a promise.

35
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,160
And committing to that is key, young Thomas.

36
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,680
It is how you will elevate not only yourself, but the collective as well.

37
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,560
It is the integrity of such...

38
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:19,800
Oh, oh, oh, well the integrity of my bowels seems to have been called into question.

39
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,840
I'll be right back.

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
Now don't you go reading ahead, young Thomas.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I won't.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now...

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's see here.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Great work team! Let's keep going!

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Indio, earlier you were saying that hybrid creatures are new. What did you mean?

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
With my friends and I jam out in the woods, sometimes we see like birds with little antenna

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,600
and stuff, or a vine covered in fur.

49
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,120
No scientist necessary.

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,360
Usually we're on some extremely intense psychedelics though, so nobody really believes me or my

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
friends.

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
We saw a real massive hybrid on our way here.

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
You saw Roger?

54
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Roger?

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
That's Roger!

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,880
The biggest hybrid in the woods!

57
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,200
Monkey once swore he saw him while he was tripping and even we told him to fuck off.

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
That's insane man!

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,200
Monkey's gonna be stoked.

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Did you guys see these creatures before Dread came a few weeks ago?

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Definitely.

62
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,840
And the few we saw were always really peaceful, if a bit skittish.

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,240
That Venus milk truck and those rat things have really bad vibes.

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
The parts mashed together is like, like forcing a collab, you know?

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,880
Don't I know it.

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,080
There's so many extra lines in here.

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,880
Where did these come from?

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Yo, Sullivan.

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Hey, bro to bro, Belinda is super hot.

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Nice work.

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Oh, uh, no. We're just friends.

72
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
No, dude, seriously.

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,880
The best intimate coupling of my life was with this girl Sky Seed.

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
We stared into each other's eyes for like a week, but then she had to go back to work

75
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,000
doing UX design for a defense contractor.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm getting very similar vibes from Belinda.

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,720
Great, thank you.

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Kekekekeke.

79
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Bullet Frog!

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:34,080
Ah, it's Sullivan McCloud himself and his new best friend, Purple Guy.

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Easy brother.

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,800
We are all children of the universe.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,800
We travel the same ley lines as our forebears, and sup from the same mother's milk.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
What the fuck are you talking about?

85
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Why are you working for the Nightmare Assassin anyway, Bullyfrog?

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
How could you stoop so low?

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
Maybe I am that low.

88
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Maybe I'm the lowest, stinkiest, creepiest dwerf of all time.

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
You ever think of that?

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
No! I just thought you had a bad home life.

91
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,440
We need to get to Dredd's lab, Bullyfrog!

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,920
We have to restore the woods!

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
Restore the woods?

94
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
HAHAHA!

95
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Don't make me laugh!

96
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,480
You two have always been such goody goodies!

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,080
The world is a harsh place with fathers who hurt you, who call you lame, and make fun of

98
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
your creative endeavors!

99
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
You two...

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
SHUT UP!

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
JOIN

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
JOIN OFF

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
JOIN OFF

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Well, it looks like the ultimate sewer hybrid is here.

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
The ultimate sewer hybrid?

106
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,080
After I told the scientist what you doers were up to, he made sure to send the ultimate

107
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
sewer hybrid your way.

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Looks like I stalled for just enough time.

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Good luck losers!

110
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Ha ha ha!

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Oh boy.

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Here we go!

113
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh shit.

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
No no.

115
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Oh fuck, I don't know if I saved.

116
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,080
*Screams*

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
This thing has tons of tendrils on it.

118
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,080
I'll go for those first with multi-attack!

119
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Uh oh.

120
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
That didn't seem to work too good.

121
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Ah shit. Ah shit. Okay.

122
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Um, fuck, fuck, thank you. Um...

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Oh!

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Fuck yeah!

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Shaka beam!

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Nice!

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll just have Belinda stun gun the main body.

128
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Nice, okay.

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Look at all this art.

130
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Look out!

131
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:41,160
It's shooting a sludge laser from the flower coming out of its beak!

132
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,240
This thing is wild!

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Ow!

134
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay, that was like a defense buff thing it just did.

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:06:03,680
So, that does damage and debuffs.

136
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,640
Alright now I got this.

137
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
We did it!

138
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,640
Whoa...

139
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Uncle Jake...

140
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Level up! Very chill!

141
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's hurry outta here to the rev!

142
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Oh wow...

143
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,640
This place...

144
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
eradicating my soul.

145
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,640
All these different creatures floating in these tubes.

146
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
This seems wrong.

147
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,640
This is the type of person Gun City churns out.

148
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Profit-seeking innovators.

149
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Broken spirits all.

150
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,640
No concern for how all the towns that supply their labor live.

151
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,640
We are tools for their complete and total exploitation.

152
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Isn't your dad really rich?

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Hey, look at this!

154
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Look at this!

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Nice, a computer.

156
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,200
Let me see if I can hack in here.

157
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,640
Oh cool, a rhythm game thing.

158
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Okay.

159
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Got it!

160
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:23,200
I bet his log entries can give us some more insight into what Dredd is planning.

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Probably the last one is all we need to read.

162
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh sick!

163
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I can read all of these.

164
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:38,080
Seintschlug, Stardate 10325023, Actual date October 3rd.

165
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
It seems that my hunch was correct.

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,240
There is some peculiar activity in the Nono Woods that will contribute greatly to my research

167
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,600
of hybrid creatures.

168
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Much of this activity is stemming from a clearing in the woods.

169
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,040
No one seems to frequent it, except that foolish hippie son of the mayor.

170
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,400
I will have to ensure that no one can enter these woods until I've completed my research.

171
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I will ask the mayor to put the barrier up for me.

172
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Scientist's log, star date 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, actual date October 5th.

173
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,640
My grad student slaves have been excavating day and night beneath that clearing in the

174
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
woods.

175
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,320
There is a greater source of power than I even anticipated.

176
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,760
We will find it soon.

177
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,520
Meanwhile, I have developed the first man-made hybrid, the Venus Milk Trucks.

178
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,000
And they are beautiful.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,240
From extracting chemicals from the soil of the woods, I am able to create these man-made

180
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
hybrids.

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:45,240
However, there seems to be the occasional anomaly of a natural hybrid.

182
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,400
I will have to take care of those as well.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,240
But anyway, while these Venus milk trucks will live miserable lives, their anatomy does not

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,400
support the weight of the others.

185
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,400
They produce a curious milk product that, when treated properly, is not as pleasant.

186
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
When I eat it, it kills my breast feeds.

187
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
But imagine a town dedicated to eliminating these studies.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
This is an entirely new product stream for support premium agriculture.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:24,400
The only problem is that taking care of these creatures requires a number of training efforts that my grad student slaves and I simply do not have.

190
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I will have to solve this.

191
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Scientist's log, start date... let me see... 100, that's fine.

192
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Actual date, October 10th.

193
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:42,400
My work on the sewer hybrid is near completion, and the rat creatures are already scouring the sewage.

194
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Soon I will have everything I need to control this town and turn it into an outpost for

195
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
ze board.

196
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,760
The pathetic mayor is so desperate to be loved he doesn't even notice this is happening right

197
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
under his stupid purple nose.

198
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,160
Since I was a student I've always believed in the potential of hybrid creatures.

199
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,960
I would draw little doodles of a dog kissing an antelope and this would make a doggalope.

200
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,520
Because of this my parents pretended I wasn't their kid.

201
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,160
Or we don't know him, he's just some little boy who looks like us and follows us around.

202
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,920
I was shunned by all, and it was never a horny thing.

203
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
Everyone thought it was a horny thing.

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,320
I have never been a horny.

205
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,560
The profit potential in this endeavor alone was enough reason to persist.

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,560
But to show those naysayers that I'm no fool, that I am a once in a generation genius, I

207
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
would do this for nothing.

208
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
I would do this for nothing.

209
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Woah.

210
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Gee, Sullivan, you're sure being thorough about these logs.

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
I think we only need to read the last one.

212
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
Oh, shut up.

213
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Scientist log, blah, blah, blah.

214
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
I have found the solution to my Venus milk truck problem.

215
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,060
I will give these to the gullible ninnies who live here.

216
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:14,060
They can feed them and take care of them and once they grow irritable they will probably try to eat them.

217
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,060
But that's not going to be an issue any longer.

218
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,560
You see I am done with the board. I am done with profit.

219
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,060
Tomorrow my grad students will have dug up the source of power beneath the clearing in the woods.

220
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,560
and through that I shall make hybrid creatures that roam all of Yibam.

221
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,560
It will be about me for once.

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Just my domination.

223
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,560
I shall become the Chimera King!

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,560
The power is too great to ignore.

225
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,560
It needs to be mine and mine alone.

226
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
Uncle Jake's gonna...

227
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
skip some parts.

228
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Tommy!

229
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Uh-oh.

230
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Patrick!

231
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Whoa!

232
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
That big monitor just turned on.

233
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
It's dread.

234
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
I see that you've been doing some research.

235
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm glad that Ovishtole told me about your thing.

236
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,560
I thought it laughable, but he spoke of your strange powers,

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,560
and indeed the death of Twiggy Hancock had reached the board's ears.

238
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,560
They had sought Twiggy for the lost cause, but it turns out his discovery of the power

239
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,560
of these amber shards and his untimely demise has made us all very, very curious.

240
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,560
My grad students will soon finish their excavation and the shard and its power will be mine.

241
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,560
So for that I must thank you, Froggy, for going on this quest for the shards.

242
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Because now this one's mine.

243
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,060
Come on man, I told you not to play without me.

244
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,560
Dude, it's fine. Look, I got past the sewer exit.

245
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,060
That's exactly what I didn't want you to do!

246
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:07,060
And for you to do that to me, when I'm devoting my time to reading literature to you, it's

247
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
just so disrespectful.

248
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,560
Young Thomas, I am aghast at this affront.

249
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm sorry Uncle Jake.

250
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I was just...

251
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
I really enjoy the story.

252
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I didn't want to stop.

253
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Well it's not always about what you want Thomas.

254
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,560
It is about what is good for you.

255
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:36,560
What is good for all of us in the face of declining institutions and a cultural sickness that threatens the existence of the entire project.

256
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,560
The second I let you play it's like, "Pete you're doing this wrong. Pete stop talking to these guys. We're gonna lose."

257
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah Pat but you are doing stuff wrong. Don't you want to win?

258
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,760
game cam I want to play the story and my name is P I'm sorry the youth the youth

259
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:08,560
these days I just I know you're sick we can talk about this later let's keep

260
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,200
reading for now is that all right whatever dude here's your stupid grape

261
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Fizzy. Give me the controller. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. That's enough sorries outta you,

262
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:29,320
alright. That's alright. Do you hear that? It's the sonorous sounds of the Venus milk

263
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:53,000
But he and all of his precious citizens shall soon be devoured by the Venus Milk Trucks

264
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
as they so lovingly took care of.

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But you will get what you deserve for thinking so little of me and my efforts.

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You see the power of the man-made hybrid creature.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You see the power of the human-made hybrid creature.

277
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We are great hybrid creatures and you shall either join or die.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
(Evil Laugh)

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We have to help everyone! We have to save my father!

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Right! Let's go!

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
(Milk Truck Noises)

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh no! The milk trucks!

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The milk trucks are attacking everybody!

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is all a part of Dread's plan!

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Somebody help!

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I just wanted to help!

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just wanted to help my Hamlet!

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What have I done?

289
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh no, you dare?

290
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He's being swarmed by the milk trucks!

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I know just how to clear them away!

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Sonic Blast!

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you,

294
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
kind frog folk.

295
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Son!

296
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Papa!

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Look, son, I'm sorry.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,800
Our town, we're so desperate.

299
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,600
Even with my ill-gotten gains.

300
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Shh.

301
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Shh.

302
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
It's okay, Papa.

303
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,880
Dr. Dredd is hiding in the woods.

304
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,320
I don't know what he plans, but he seemed insane.

305
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,160
Go to the woods, brave frog folk.

306
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,720
My guards will let you through.

307
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,360
And stop this madness.

308
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,440
I can take care of the town once that bastard is gone.

309
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
You can count on me.

310
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
And me.

311
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
And I as well.

312
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm proud of you son.

313
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I know.

314
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:48,520
I feel like you think I don't know how to play this game.

315
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
That's because you don't.

316
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,560
I beat up mini boss guy by myself.

317
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,680
We're finally in the no no woods.

318
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,520
There's a clearing a bit up ahead where my homies and I jam and saw the hybrids.

319
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,720
I bet that's where Dredd is.

320
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Alright.

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Hey!

322
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Oh, oh, hey Johnny. You scared me again.

323
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Hey Sullivan.

324
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,220
Oh what the crap, there's girls of you? And a purple guy?

325
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,720
Yes. Good to meet you compadre.

326
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
You know this guy Sullivan?

327
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Yeah, this is Johnny Tinch. He sells goods and buys bones.

328
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Yeah, but the bones are for the goblins.

329
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I thought we were about to get into another fight.

330
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Nah, fat chance. No offense, cause you're a girl, but I'm basically like the best fighter at my school.

331
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
at my school and I actually had to be put in a separate gym class because I was always

332
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,720
uh they were always trying to beat me up because I loved to cuss.

333
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,320
Johnny, can I borrow some potions from you from a spandacopita to restore frog points?

334
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah, these woods are so messed up man.

335
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,080
One time I was in the woods by my house uh like hanging out with the neighbor kid and

336
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,560
he was trying to look cool and he kept playing with these matches that have um like um well

337
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,520
on the thingy that holds them uh the thing had like a picture of a squid holding like

338
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:13,320
a

339
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,480
like potions and stuff really or a spin spanning whatever but I got some herbs

340
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,640
though there's a lot of good herbs here so I made some weird stuff if you want

341
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,280
to buy it well what does the weird stuff do I got some of it that make you make

342
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
you strong like me or it can make you fast like me and I got something even

343
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,240
unlocks a new combat art but those are really expensive no offense

344
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,960
Belinda what do you think I think we should get one of those attack buffs and

345
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,120
one of those speed buffs. Try to save the rest of our tokens for that special

346
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,200
combat art thing for next time. Okay well look lady I'm not just gonna be hanging

347
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,840
on to this thing for you because you know a lot of adventurers come around asking

348
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,600
me for crap and I need money. Well then I guess we'll just have to take our

349
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:04,000
chances. Okay okay you can have it. Thank you. Is that all? I think so. How's your

350
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,720
mom doing Johnny? Um well well actually I haven't really seen her in a while but

351
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,460
She's probably fine cuz she just sits around all day anyways, ha ha

352
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,940
Anyways, I'll see you around solving good luck with whatever you're doing and make sure to bring more bones next time

353
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,960
I will and therefore that goblins not for me. Yep

354
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,720
Okay. Yeah and turn around what just do it make sure you don't look because if you do it'll be bad news

355
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,520
If you betray me

356
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,720
It'll be just like last time when I was playing

357
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,360
Dodgeball and they made me sit in another room because I was too good at throwing the dodge ball so far

358
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,360
so they made me sit in the locker room all by myself and then afterwards they tried to find me...

359
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
*sigh* Alright, let's keep going.

360
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Another hybrid creature! Do you recognize this one, Indio?

361
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,360
This is one of the ones I've seen, yeah. But it seems really agitated.

362
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,360
It probably doesn't trust anyone coming into the woods now. We must subdue it.

363
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Okay, it's a battle. So, the controller?

364
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
Fine.

365
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Okay, what about...

366
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Just do Lightbringer Blast. We know Frog Arts are strong against these guys.

367
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Lightbringer Blast!

368
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Okay, and now Belinda will use Magikize.

369
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Frog Art Magikize!

370
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Okay, let me do Indio.

371
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,440
Fine, can you just use forage though in that case? Good chance to heal Sullivan without wasting a potion or a band-aid

372
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,060
Nice okay, just use light bring her blast again, and I think we got this one sure

373
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:54,060
What the hell man again what to do I dare you tell me again

374
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:15,820
So immature dude.

375
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,700
There is no cool shit, it is just the forest level.

376
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:25,300
All of these games have forest levels, they all have the exact same stuff in them.

377
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,020
Everything has the same stuff in their shit.

378
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,180
What?

379
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,780
You should appreciate the stuff in the shit while it's there, because then it's gone,

380
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,780
and you didn't get to appreciate any of it.

381
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,180
You didn't talk to the shit and ask him questions or listen to him, you know, maybe he had cool

382
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
stories okay?

383
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,180
Pete, what?

384
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:48,580
These things are made by like 1000 incredible Japanese guys, and we're just gonna say, "Your

385
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,580
is boring, you might as well be dead like Pagin.

386
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,420
The clearing is just up ahead.

387
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Not so fast!

388
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
Bullyfrog?

389
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm tired of chasing you losers through these fucking woods.

390
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
It ends now!

391
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,180
Bullyfrog, why do you hate us so much?

392
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,420
I know you picked on me in school, but we're not in school anymore.

393
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,580
It doesn't have to be this way.

394
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,380
Because you humiliated me!

395
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,860
You two, you two, you beat me up!

396
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,180
And everybody knows that!

397
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,460
Oh, Bullyfrog I didn't know that, I was just defending myself.

398
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,620
I didn't mean to humiliate you.

399
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
WHAT?!

401
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,620
I'm sorry!

402
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
I'm sorry, that's all.

403
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,380
I didn't mean to do that to you, Bullyfrog.

404
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,420
Come on, Sullivan, we have to hurry!

405
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
Right.

406
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
See ya, Baldi-frog!

407
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,820
Wait! Get back here! I...

408
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,620
He's sorry!

409
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:04,620
Doctor Dredd!

410
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Well, well, well, you made it through the force.

411
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,620
I should have guessed you would.

412
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,620
Oh, I forgot.

413
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
I did.

414
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,520
Come, grad students!

415
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,620
Sacrifice yourselves!

416
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Literally this time!

417
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,060
Go mine grad students

418
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
*crying*

419
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,060
*sword sounds*

420
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Why am I so hard?

421
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
Ah! The grad students have laser wands!

422
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
And they won't stop crying!

423
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Here, Pete,

424
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
battle's about to start.

425
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Oh, what a-

426
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Please, just play as Sullivan, and you can be Indio!

427
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
You're just gonna tell me what to do!

428
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
No, I won't, Pete! You're your own person,

429
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,060
I trust you.

430
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:52,060
And trust you see, young Thomas, is the cornerstone of any great organization of peoples.

431
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,060
But, we must be cautious.

432
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,060
As the saying goes, trust, but verify.

433
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
You mean that?

434
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Yeah, whatever, of course.

435
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,060
Uncle Jake, can I please see the picture when the boss dies?

436
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
I know they're in the book.

437
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Please.

438
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,060
I miss him too, dude.

439
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Okay, just...

440
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Don't get any ideas in your head.

441
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Don't you see? Soon I will have endless hybrid creatures that I can control and love to my heart's content.

442
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,060
This world already has hybrid creatures! You're exploiting its wonder for your own twisted gains!

443
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Does that not leave you ill, man?

444
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
No.

445
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm gonna use Sonic Blast on the grad students.

446
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,140
I think they're gonna react to that.

447
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,020
Where's the shot?

448
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Sonic Blast!

449
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,660
We're grad students.

450
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Going to scan, Dredd.

451
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,100
Lil Hacker, scan!

452
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
Analyzing enemy.

453
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,820
Weakness to chakra.

454
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,900
Only energy that rejects orthodoxy.

455
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,620
Got him now.

456
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,340
Chakra beam!

457
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,340
Fuck, fuck, fuck you, fucks!

458
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,180
Grad students come!

459
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,940
We shall fuse by harnessing the energy of the ember shard.

460
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,940
I shall become the ultimate Chimera!

461
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Oh God!

462
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Is there anything more hideous in the entire universe than 50 grad students fused together?

463
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
A true nightmare!

464
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
They won't harsh my vibe!

465
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,940
Hey, let's try out some new combat arts!

466
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,940
With three party members, there's a lot more we can do!

467
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Good thinking, Sully!

468
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,940
Thanks! Every once in a while, I have a good idea!

469
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,940
Cam, I don't know how to do the combat arts.

470
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,940
Here, instruction manual.

471
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,300
To perform combat art, select option for frog art with frog character, then select either

472
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,020
another frog art or ability with another character.

473
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,220
Then attacking character follows button sequence on screen in time, so it's like a mini rhythm

474
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
game.

475
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,620
Okay, I'm first, so I'll choose lightbringer blast.

476
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,180
And I'll use Belinza's stun gun, and there's the combo.

477
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Light Gun Explosion!

478
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,180
You uncultured hoppity fox!

479
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,180
Why do you always gotta break out the slur?

480
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
Now it's my turn.

481
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
Blinding science!

482
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,180
Ah! We're blinded! I can't see!

483
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
Me neither!

484
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,180
Yet, I can see clearer than ever before.

485
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Whoa! Indio has a new combat option!

486
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,180
All I can do is hear the music flow through me.

487
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,180
The sounds, the rhythms, the vibes.

488
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,180
Run away!

489
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Nein, it's illogical, it's nonsense, it's complete, but fulminary.

490
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,180
It strives towards nothing.

491
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,180
No progress, no innovation.

492
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,180
I finally see. I am really, really rich.

493
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,180
But this time, in love.

494
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Alright, take a look.

495
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
No!

496
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,180
No!

497
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

498
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

499
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

500
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

501
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

502
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

503
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

504
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

505
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

506
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

507
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

508
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

509
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

510
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

511
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

512
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

513
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

514
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

515
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

516
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

517
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

518
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

519
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

520
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,180
Suck my dick pussy bitch!

521
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
This is the only way to see.

522
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,640
Okay.

523
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, I guess it's time to eat this fly.

524
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,860
I can sense...

525
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,660
That golden gift.

526
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,700
You're in.

527
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,200
Come on!

528
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:48,260
Back here again.

529
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:54,660
This is your power, Sullivan. Your quest. The organism demands it.

530
00:27:54,660 --> 00:28:01,660
New frog art online.

531
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Oh my gosh!

532
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,660
The forest! It's filled with all types of creatures!

533
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Rabbit snake lilies, squirrels that grow from tree branches, they got little leaves on their back.

534
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,660
It's like a massive single organism.

535
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,660
Intertwined.

536
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,660
It is an ecological, biological wonder with infinite possibilities.

537
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,660
When the rest of our people come to this planet, places like this will be remarkable resources

538
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,660
for food, medicine, lumber and agriculture, as long as we know how to live in harmony

539
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,660
with it.

540
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,660
This is really something, Sully.

541
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
This is really something, Sully.

542
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,780
Hey! Whoa!

543
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,340
So many critters and creatures!

544
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

545
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,620
It's that big hybrid from before!

546
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Roger! You've come as well!

547
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,620
[ROAR]

548
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
[ROAR]

549
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
Whoa!

550
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,620
He won't hurt you, brother.

551
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,620
I know him.

552
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,620
We all know him.

553
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Well, I'm not scared, so shut the fuck up!

554
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
Shut the fuck up!

555
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
Indio!

556
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Indio!

557
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Papa!

558
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,220
You called me by my name.

559
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,740
It's a miracle Indio.

560
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740
The Venus milk trucks have calmed themselves.

561
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,060
What has happened here?

562
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,060
Many things have passed Papa, many things.

563
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,260
Sullivan, I must stay here.

564
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,980
My people are going to struggle with these strange woods.

565
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,740
They will need someone to guide them.

566
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,140
I believe Roger and I are up to that task.

567
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,540
Yeah, I can't think of anyone else better to lead them.

568
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,340
If what your Sullivan's Quest says is true,

569
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,220
then we'll all have to reckon with the bounty of our world.

570
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,100
Our people have a way of saying goodbye.

571
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,700
We say, good journey to you.

572
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,140
And so I say that to you now.

573
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,620
Good journey to you.

574
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,660
Good journey to you, too, Indio.

575
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,540
Farewell, both of you.

576
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:16,540
You will always be friends of No-No.

577
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,780
Hey, Sullivan!

578
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,620
Hey, Bullyfrog.

579
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,060
Can I...

580
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,300
Can I...

581
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,860
Can I come with you?

582
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,700
You're not gonna try to kill us, are you?

583
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,560
No, I'm not.

584
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,900
Well then, come on!

585
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,400
Yeah!

586
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,400
New party member unlocked!

587
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,400
But don't think this means you can be annoying or stupid around me.

588
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I'll do my best!

589
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Where are we headed next, Sullivan?

590
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Come on, I'll show ya!

591
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Foolish toad.

592
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:09,400
*Suspense music*

593
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Honorable board, I beseech you.

594
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Yes, yes, get on with it.

595
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Quiet, member number one. Let me just speak.

596
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
We're told to talk, you interrupt every moment you get.

597
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
*Drum roll*

598
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Go on, go on.

599
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Looks like he wants to hear what you have to say, Mr. Sasson.

600
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Thank you, Honorable Board and Chairman.

601
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,400
It seems the amber shards that Hancock raved about are real.

602
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,400
Moreover, a group of teenage frogs seem to be collecting them.

603
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,400
The very ones associated with my former colleague, Bullyfrog the Toad.

604
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:56,400
The Granwy's Journal, whatever it is that exists within it, could be the key.

605
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Chairman, I trust in the wisdom of yourself and the board for how to proceed.

606
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I await your orders.

607
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Very well. I shall proceed thusly.

608
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Blessings upon you and the board. Farewell.

609
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Oh, blessings upon you and the board as well!

610
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Gentlemen, it is clear to me that we must take the shards and use them.

611
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,400
They have tremendous power held within them.

612
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Why not take them for ourselves?

613
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
What about the Dread Hancock?

614
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
You think that's the best path?

615
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Surely prophets could increase 500% over a man-

616
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,400
But board member number 3, surely profits will only get us so far.

617
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Now you're gonna get number 6 started.

618
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
The minions! The best customers we've had!

619
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,400
Face those! Face those! Face those! Face those!

620
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,400
And someone shut him up!

621
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Um, yes chairman, of course.

622
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
My apologies.

623
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,400
We of the board are at your command.

624
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,400
And we members will conduct ourselves responsibly.

625
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,400
(music)

626
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Yo!

627
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
Oh, you beat the chapter.

628
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Yeah, well, you had other plans.

629
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
True. But it's all good news, I promise.

630
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Fizzy drink? In the fridge.

631
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Okay, so, I was hanging with Price, and he has a pretty big opportunity for us.

632
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Something that I think a lot of people would dig.

633
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
A Patches Benefit concert.

634
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
What?

635
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,900
Okay dude, it would be this huge concert at the garden, we'd have all these podcasters there and some shitty bands that follow us on Twitter would play.

636
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,900
And then at the end we'd do a full D&D session with a Patches hologram as the DM.

637
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,900
Then we can end the night with the unveiling of the Patches statue.

638
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,400
And all the women he saved will sing "America, the Beautiful".

639
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Woah, that's pretty intense.

640
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
It would be so sick.

641
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,900
Plus at the garden? We've never done the garden!

642
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
This shit would put us on the fucking map!

643
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
I won't do that.

644
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,400
What?

645
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm not gonna do it. Do you want to talk about hologram a

646
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,760
Patches hologram fuck dude. I

647
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,680
Can't do this. I'll see you guys tomorrow. He what the fuck

648
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,640
God damn it. I mean you know what he means

649
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,320
cool, dude

650
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Well, hope you had a good dinner. Yeah, all right. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. All right, okay

651
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:42,360
Bye, okay, just leave I love you. Okay. I love you, too. No, you're leaving or I'm leaving. Bye. Bye. I love you

652
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,440
Okay. Yeah

653
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:54,200
That's my take

654
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,040
How will they ever resolve this I do wonder

655
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
me too

656
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,580
Well young Thomas another chapter done in podcasters who play video games

657
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,220
Another night of rest for you

658
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,980
Uncle Jake I

659
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,080
Really want to beat this illness I

660
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,520
Know you do son. I know believe me. I was wondering

661
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,360
Do you know what it's called? I?

662
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,120
Want to be able to put a name Oh young Thomas

663
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Some things are not worth knowing.

664
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,920
It would upset you too greatly.

665
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,200
Cause you undue stress.

666
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,500
Okay...

667
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Plus we already showed you them pictures tonight.

668
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,560
That's enough excitement, don't you think?

669
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,200
Sure...

670
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Well, goodnight.

671
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,880
Goodnight, Uncle Jake.

672
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm...

673
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Horny?

674
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Uh, I'm horny.

675
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
When I finished recording I started zoning out.

676
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,040
Then my Alibaba bracelet started beeping because it thought I was dead.

677
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,240
So I uh, crammed a few supplements in my mouth and I walked out of my balcony.

678
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
It was night now.

679
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,240
The streets were real quiet.

680
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:34,000
If another cataclysm comes, I don't think I'll make it.

681
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,360
Curiosity got the better of me.

682
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,360
If Caleb was here to see the other guys, that means they must all still be in New York too.

683
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,880
I looked up Cameron.

684
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,840
He's some schlock horror director now, no surprise there.

685
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,880
He won a couple of ten cent grants for propaganda work and could fund the rest of his shit with

686
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,480
the proceeds, I guess.

687
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
He always liked that crap.

688
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,480
That horror stuff.

689
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,480
I started to look up Pat.

690
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,480
The only thing I could find was the podcast and an album called Big Patty Style Boston Delights.

691
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Which came out a year after I stopped talking to them.

692
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Then nothing else.

693
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,480
No trace. It's like he vanished.

694
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,360
With my allotted Baidu time used up, I decided I should try to maybe get a real night's sleep

695
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,840
for once.

696
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:36,980
I headed over to the couch, and for the first time in what felt like years, I saw the picture

697
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,000
of my wife and I that sits on the side table next to it.

698
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,040
She and I were smiling.

699
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,240
It was at the height of the whole podcast.

700
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,760
I remembered when my wife was going into labor, I made sure we moved one of the tour locations

701
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,840
around so I could be at the delivery and then perform the same night.

702
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,400
Why the hell did I do that?

703
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Nice a computer.

704
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
