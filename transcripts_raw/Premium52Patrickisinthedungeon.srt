00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
But we can't find true love

58
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:09,220

crunk okay that might be good crunk so is Dautry

60
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:22,700
right so it's the Dautry voice but the lyrics change to be yeah okay so it's

61
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,740
Dautry but he's singing like Cobra Starship snap your fingers and do your

62
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,620

65
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,980
song with him it's just R. Kelly it's just Daughtry and R. Kelly I was gonna

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,420
say like a Dautry and David Cook sing same girl together. Dautry and Dane Cook that might be

67
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,700
a hit. Oh my god that would be great. How did Dane Cook never make a rock album? He should have.

68
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,620
Before he died how did he never do that? You would think that that's like. Dude he could call it Dane

69
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,260
Rock. That would be great I would love to see him walk into a guitar center and point at like one of

70
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,500
those V guitars. Yeah. Immediately just be like that one. Yeah. That. Not the Gibson one but like

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,820
like the Randy Rhoads signature one. Yeah, yeah, like a Walmart guitar.

72
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,940
Like that's it. Dane Cook has a new line of first act guitars being sold at

00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:40,220
Walmart. This is actually news. This is just... I'm just reading the news. Is this news? Are you breaking this right now? Yeah.

Whoa dude. This is huge. Yeah, Dane Cook, one of the first... Dane Cook, I mean, come on.

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,700
When he played with the Stones it was just, it was crazy. It was just electric, you

76
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:57,980
know yeah yeah when he picked up the the Grateful Dead spot after John Mayer also

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:05,020
died yeah that's huge man yeah yeah two great comedians filling in for Jerry

78
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:11,260
Garcia. Dane Cook on iTunes they used to have like celebrity playlists

79
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,420
like they would ask celebrities to post like oh what's on your iPod right now

80
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,660
and the Dane Cook I listened to the Dane Cook playlist a lot yeah one and the

81
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,080
Carlos Mencia one. Carlos Mencia had a lot of disturbs.

82
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah, he had the disturbed sound of silence. No, but he actually he had liberate by disturbed

83
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,560
on it and I thought that was cool because it was in Tony Hawk's Underground too.

84
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,200
And he was like and you got to listen to the lyrics too because it's saying

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,880
liberate your mind and people don't do that nowadays. Yeah. Do you think Carlos

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,760
Mencia has ever done any any mind expanding drug like LSD or mushrooms?

87
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,700
No. I don't think he doesn't need to. He doesn't need to. He's already got a mind. Dude, if

88
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,980
you if you put LSD in the mind of Mencia he would be normal. That's right, yeah.

89
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,240
You can, if you pretend to be Mexican long enough you start tripping. Mm-hmm.

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah, it's true. Yeah. Yeah, it's called the mind's peyote. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's right.

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,960
Yeah, his pineal gland. Yeah. Yeah, puts out peyote. Mm-hmm.

92
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,440
peyote is the one psychedelic I don't think I would do the one you would do

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,800
ayahuasca you do salvia on a dare a dare that's a disrespecting the fucking tree

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,040
gods dude you can't do that no I wouldn't do ayahuasca either I think I

95
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,000
think if it's got too much of like a spiritual thing I know that it's just

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,640
like if it's not just like LSD or mushrooms or it's just like you do it

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,240
with your friends you know you're gonna leave that leave that to the engines no

98
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
No, that's not what I'm saying.

99
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
That's kind of what you're saying.

100
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
You're a cowboy and there are engines.

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I don't want to appropriate their drugs.

102
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
You want to get rid of their drugs and the people who use them?

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
We should do an ayahuasca trip, dude. Wouldn't that be sick?

104
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
No, are you kidding me?

105
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Freak the fuck out.

106
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,240
It'd be the next documentary we do. It's us all going to fucking Brazil and vomiting.

107
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Yeah, just having the worst time of our lives.

108
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Just all of us just screaming.

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,500
(laughing)

110
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,600
My eyes are too big for my head!

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,320
- Our heads are being patted by the Oompa Loompas

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,400
fucking giving us the drugs.

113
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
And we're just screaming, no!

114
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,720
- I think it would probably ruin all of us forever.

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,760
- Yeah, I don't think that.

116
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't think I would survive ayahuasca.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
- I don't think any of us would.

118
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,480
- Everybody who does ayahuasca,

119
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,600
everybody either invents Google,

120
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
or they come back and they're like,

121
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,720
yeah, I haven't been able to look at a TV for like 15 years.

122
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,560
- Yeah.

123
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,840
- They just freak out too much.

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,680
- Yeah.

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,960
I left my wife there. She's still doing ayahuasca.

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,040
He had unlocked a demon that was in my house the whole time.

127
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,920
I would do...

128
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
The textures in my house don't load anymore.

129
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
[laughter]

130
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Gary's mod errors is everywhere I look.

131
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
And my son...

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
My son's just a floating, giant, red, flashing error.

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
Yeah, the G-Man is in my house now.

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

135
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I would do Salvia with you guys. I want to get trapped in Salvia like Ari Shafir did.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,140
It's legal in Mass too. I've said so many times that I would do it and Caleb's like,

137
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,440
"I don't think you would." And I kept saying, "I changed my mind."

138
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
You did change your mind just now?

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I don't think I could do it.

140
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I just remembered Ari Shafir got stuck in a fish society when he did Salvia.

141
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Yeah.

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
yeah he took Salvia on a podcast and then he just like passed out and then woke up

143
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,680
and he's like put me back in put me back in what happened he's like I lived seven

144
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,600
years as a fish and my family got destroyed when I woke up that's that's

145
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,280
what every Salvia trip I've ever heard of is like it's like oh I turned into I

146
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,200
turned into a barrel and I rolled down a hill for 10,000 years and I had an entire

147
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,520
family of barrels up Patrick froze yeah I just froze he just did he froze cuz he

148
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:12,820
did salvia yeah I froze I did salvia and I froze yeah it's always fish I always

149
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,160
hear fish stories about salvia I always hear wood I hear a game a I hear came a

150
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,840
carpet yeah I hear wooden object stories mostly I feel like people are like I

151
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,640
turned into a fence or a table or something my friend's brother said is uh

152
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,760
uh... his he took it and then

153
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,420
everybody around him had fish heads

154
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,040
that's kinda cool like a captain beefheart thing yeah yeah or like the

155
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
song fish heads maybe he was listening to the song fish heads and that's why that happened

156
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
he wouldn't even take the salvia

157
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,200
what if his friends were fish and salvia just let him put on the

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,520
they live glasses exactly that's what they fish that's what salvia does

159
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,640
they some fish it shows you that you actually have been

160
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,680
you actually have been a carpet for a thousand years and salvia just kind of opens your eyes.

161
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,720
Yeah it expands your mind to realize that oh no reality is just like I am an oscillating

162
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:13,520
fan oh reality is just carpets barrels made out of wood and fish people and nobody actually

163
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,040
realizes that until they smoke salvia. Yeah it's not DMT that takes you to the higher

164
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,260
dimension it's salvia. Yeah the real higher dimension is is where everyone is a blade of

165
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,900
grass and there's a dog peeing on us yeah that's what it's like I feel like I

166
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,660
can't do the only time I can do psychedelics is like watching Austin

167
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,020
Powers the only time it's worked for me yeah I don't think I can nature thing

168
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,100
yeah it just ruins me I don't think I could do psychedelics for like I think I

169
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,580
would have ears I would have too many like like cups of coffee unlock memories

170
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,360
in me yeah I can't do fucking like seriously I had a cup of coffee like a

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,800
month ago and remembered that I saw a double murder suicide scene one time in

172
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,000
high school and I was like damn this is a strong drug this is stronger than like

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,600
caffeine strong as shit yeah and I then I just had I just replayed that in my head

174
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,080
for like a week it like ruined my week cuz I just was thinking too hard yeah

175
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:17,920
it's bad bro it sucks yeah you know I hate getting too much coffee I actually

176
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,500
I feel like that's a good zone to be in.

177
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Patrick drinks too much coffee on purpose.

178
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,320
I drank too much just before this.

179
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
On purpose?

180
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
That's true.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Yeah.

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Is that why you're so sing-songy today?

183
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Maybe.

184
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Because you have to shit and you're doing the pee-pee dance?

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Maybe.

186
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,920
I haven't shit yet, so maybe that's it.

187
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Uh-oh.

She'd be like, "Oh, it's a prank."

209
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
"Oh, it's a prank."

210

She saw the blood and she thought that they were trying to kill her.

212
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
If she had seen poop, she would know it was just a smelly prank.

213
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Yeah, she would think that there's a big animal taking a crap on top of her.

214
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,780
She would have used her telekinesis to like play really cool music for everyone to dance to.

215
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,780
Everybody still would have died from just laughing so hard though.

216
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
Yeah, that's true.

217
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
It would have been the same ending.

218
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,500
they would have gone just completely berserk laughing and slapping they would

219
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,700

233
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
No.

234
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,060
That's my bad.

235
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,500
How much hair do you think you would have to put in a bag for it to like actually hurt

236
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,740
you if it fell on you?

237
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,540
Like hair, hair from the top of a building.

238
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
What kind of bag?

242
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,580

243
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,620
Building I could I think I could my skull is very I'll be wearing a hat first of

244
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,780
all yeah I think a hole would go through your head like a sniper a hole would

245
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,300
realize I would hit the brim the brim of what the brim on camera tatted my

246
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,700
baseball hang so penny would fall and it would bounce off the brim and it would

247
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,140
kill you do you think it would go through the brim no yeah not my brim I

248
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,580
have a special brim no I've got any going it I got a different I've got a

249
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,180
different kind of brim I put kind of rim I put special metals and chemicals into

250
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,900
my brim you don't have a fucking I have a power for him did it's basically it's

251
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,520
it's invented so that if a super villain could try to attack me I could deflect it

252
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,140
using the brim only they should do like a cool metal hat yeah it's called a helmet

253
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,220
have guys like a hat that's hard just have like just have like like like lids

254
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,940
like new era like wiggers walking around with their heads we should bring back

255
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:52,100
chain mail punched Oh do the chain mail hat no I think I think we should bring

256
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,380
back chain mail but specifically like those jokes your grandparents send you

257
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,540
yeah about fucking Polish people yeah yeah that's what I'm down I got a lot of

258
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,460
those is a king that back yeah that's what I meant maybe I should start I know

259
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,220
that's what you meant original that's what I know we should maybe I should

260
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,780
start wearing chain mail shut up to me you shut up shut up dude you shut up shut

261
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,380
up Caleb if you got on wait Pat can you hold on having a shut up war shut up you

262
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,460

263
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:33,100

264
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:41,980
the su word I don't know you're talking about shut up I went falling into my

265
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,140
friend's trap Caleb if you got if you got chainmail or any kind of Knight's

266
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,260
armor people would think that you're too into Crusader Kings and I think that

267
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,380
would be a problem yeah no I was a great gamer yeah what a nightmare

268
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,580
Is that like people were radicalized by Crusader Kings or something? That's why they say like days full to really like the alt-right people

269
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,460
I think I think they just like history

270
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,260
Deis was in they said it in some I don't know if it was Crusader King Crusader King

271
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,060
That that radicalized all those are all right people

272
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,180
I think is I think the people who said deus vault were in a different game

273
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,460
But I think castle crashers definitely did turn people to the Nazis

274
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,740
Not after I sure is fucking Crusader castle crashers

275
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,940
Turns people it's the chainsaw. It's the chainsaw that does it they see it, and they're like this is we need to go back to living

276
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,940
like yeah

277
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,420
Embrace tradition yeah

278
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,020
Three guys who look like you different colors. Yeah, we need to start dressing in different colors again. Yeah

279
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:47,700
Yeah, we would have been a good a good night trio. I think we have I

280
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,340
I think we could we could probably take down like a Medusa.

281
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,740
Yeah or a dragon I feel like. We could kill a dragon.

282
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,740
What would you guys knight adjectives be?

283
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,500
Sir Patrick the...

284
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,700
The round.

285
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,020
You would be yeah you would be like the round table.

286
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,340
Yeah.

287
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,860
They'd call you the round table.

288
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,060
They'd call me the pound.

289
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,620
I'd sit at you.

290
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,980
Sir Patrick the pound.

291
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah.

292
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:11,620
Whoa.

293
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,940
That sounds pretty cool.

294
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,100
Obviously I'd be Caleb the Great.

295
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,860
I'd be Cameron the Greatest.

296
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:24,860
I think that might be the plunderer.

297
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:33,860
If there was a group of knights and one of them was the great and one of them was the greatest.

298
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
I am Caleb the Awesome.

299
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,860
And I'm Derek the even more awesome.

300
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,860
King Arthur the most greatest.

301
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
King Arthur the king is his.

302
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,160
Arthur the I'm on a boat mm-hmm that might be scary

303
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:57,060
King Arthur the swaggy and then he's uh-huh yeah yeah yeah King Arthur the

304
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,520
Mr. two-fly we should have we should that's what we should instead of buying

305
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:08,000
a house or doing whatever with it the castle yeah yeah I feel like we could

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
afford one in like Malaysia have you seen that uh you know that episode of

307
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,920
doomsday preppers where the guy has a castle and he's making his family

308
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,760
compete to see who gets to live with him in the castle but it's like a really

309
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,200
shitty castle we could probably buy a castle like that yeah have you guys seen

310
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,880
that episode I think I have it's really the best one is the the out the ranch

311
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,120
one yeah that one's so good a muzzle break where the guy yeah yeah that's my

312
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,280
date or the guy cries yeah I think the only one I've seen is the one with the

313
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,640
like the 13 year old kid whose mom is like would you save me if we were in an

314
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,500
apocalypse yeah she's like no no and she's like you're grounded and he's like

315
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,180
"Okay, fine, I'd save you!"

316
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,380
Wait, I'm trying to find the text.

317
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,780
This is the best episode of Doomsday Preppers.

318
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,660
Let me...

319
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,220
It's called the Alamo Ranch or something?

320
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,540
And the guy looks exactly like Quentin Tarantino.

321
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,180
Not exactly.

322
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,260
He looks like he could be Quentin Tarantino's cousin.

323
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,100
And he's got all the fucking mannerisms and everything,

324
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,180
but it's just Quentin Tarantino as a Doomsday Prepper.

325
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,820
What about Ben 10 Tarantino,

326
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,540
and he uses his casio to turn into the Wu-Tang Clan?

327
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,620
Yeah, so then he can say the N-word.

328
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,140
That might be kind of cool right?

329
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Yeah.

330
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
It's so quintessentino kid.

331
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,980
No I was the Wu Tang Clan when I wrote that script.

332
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Yeah.

333
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,580
He don't understand.

334
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,820
Season 2 episode 4.

335
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,180
You guys should watch season 2 episode 4 of Doomsday Preppers.

336
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,140
It's one of the best TV episodes of all time.

337
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Yeah.

338
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Yeah.

339
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,140
Keep going.

340
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Of all time?

341
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
It's so good dude.

342
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
It really is so good.

343
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,300
Usually they do two families in an episode but this family is just so fucked up they

344
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,140
do the full episode on them.

345
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,020
It's like I'm going to rewatch it after this.

346
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,220
- How do they decide who gets to live in the castle?

347
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,060
Does he put them in trials?

348
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,020
- No, that's a different episode.

349
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,860
- That's a different one, yeah.

350
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,680
- Wow.

351
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,520
- This is the ranch.

352
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,580
- They live on a ranch in Texas,

353
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,340
and yeah, it's really something.

354
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,180
Highly recommend.

355
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,300
- What would we call our castle when we buy one?

356
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,900
- Castle Cameron?

357
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,740
- I said it first.

358
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,220
- I was thinking Castle Daylock Caleb.

359
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,060
(laughing)

360
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,380
- I was thinking the three guys.

361
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,020
- I was thinking Castle Tayo Cruz.

362
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,580
- Hmm, Castle Dynamite?

363
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,420
- Yeah, Castle Dynamite.

364
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,260
- Castle Dynamite sounds pretty cool.

365
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,900
- Castle Dynamite's pretty cool, yeah.

366
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,600
- Nobody has to know it's named after the Taya Cruz song.

367
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,100
- Right, but it is the doorbell.

368
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,600
(laughing)

369
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,460
- But people think that's just the theme.

370
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,300
- Yeah.

371
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,860
- People will be like, well that matches the dynamite.

372
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,700
- They won't, yeah.

373
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,120
They don't know that we actually do have Taya Cruz

374
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,240
in the dungeon and he performs for us.

375
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,080
- Every single time somebody presses a button,

376
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
it pokes his belly button.

377
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,800
(laughing)

378
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,920
- He sings into a little gramophone horn.

379
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,400
- He lights up the door.

380
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,860
- He starts singing.

381
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,440
- Every time that they ring the doorbell,

382
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,140
the feeding tube feeds him.

383
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,260
- So, he gets one drop of sweet water.

384
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,100
- Yeah.

385
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,400
- He gets a snack that looks like him.

386
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,300
(laughing)

387
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,920
- Would you sing the doorbell song for a Tayo snack?

388
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
- Yes.

389
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,720
- Yeah, and he says--

390
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,700
- I think, no, I would let Tayo Cruz live with us.

391
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,540
- I would let Tayo--

392
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,400
- Just like a guy.

393
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,080
- Yeah, but in the dungeon and he can't get out.

394
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,520
- I wouldn't let him live in the dungeon.

395
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
I would let him get out.

396
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,180
- I would torture him.

397
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:15,180
I would put on a big wooden plate. I would throw knives at him. I would hear his party stories about how he hung out with David Guetta.

398
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:27,180
I would do it for no reason. I would literally torture him to death for no reason. He wouldn't do anything to me and I would just hurt him really bad. I'm serious.

399
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,180
I would put him into a big bowl filled with hot black oil.

400
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,120
Pat, you can't be a-- we're not gonna let you be a knight if you're not gonna be

401
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,500
willing to torture somebody. There's no such thing as a knight who doesn't kill people.

402
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,220
Well, what did he do? He hasn't told us about any gold. I believe I'm Patrick the Fair.

403
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:52,620
Yeah, he's in the dungeon, so he has to have done something. Patrick the Fair, because you're eating funnel cakes and corn dogs.

404
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:59,820
That's right, bitch. Yeah, I'm guessing my weight constantly. I'm bringing you to the dungeon, but the dungeon in our

405
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,940
castle full arcade Chuck E. Cheese style yeah with a mini carnival. That's why I'm called

406
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,060
Patrick the Fares because I set up a fair. It has one of those roller coaster simulators in it mm-hmm

407
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,860
that are really awesome. Yeah I got the VR one that has Rayman Raving Rabbids on it. Has Rainbow Six Siege in it.

408
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,140
Yeah you're getting you're getting the input of a roller coaster you're shaking around playing it

409
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,980
trying to play Rainbow Six Siege. Yeah you're playing Rain Man Six Siege. Yeah yeah you are

410
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,700
Yeah, you are I'm playing it. I was talking to Patrick. No. Yeah, you are Patrick. So

411
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:40,380
Me Kayla when we and Caleb said you we both are talking about Patrick anytime. Yeah, and all those times we said shut up earlier

412
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
It was a bad

413
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:51,620
Why do you guys like to torture you in the dungeon with Tyo Cruz, I think maybe if you don't get this castle

414
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,140
I think maybe this castle is better

415
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:58,640
But dude, you better put on shoes or the castle creep is gonna tickle your feet while you're sleeping in the dungeon.

416
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Oh, I would hate that.

417
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm gonna chain you up.

418
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I would hate that so much. Don't let him do that.

419
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm gonna have a 50 foot long feather that I tickle you with from upstairs while I watch TV.

420
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Don't!

421
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm gonna do it.

422
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Don't, dude!

423
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,640
I'm gonna actually, I'm gonna outline different parts of you like I'm doing plastic surgery on somebody with a sharpie.

424
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
And those will be the tickle spots.

425
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, serious?

426
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,160
feather I'm serious it has a curve to it the feather so that I can reach it

427
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,760
downstairs and then I'm gonna tickle your feet and your belly button I'm gonna

428
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,680
Patrick I'm gonna chain you up and I'm gonna give you your bass your bass

429
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,920

00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,340

437
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,000
what would how would you torture us I feel like I'm pretty immune to nature

438
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,240
You couldn't get any info. I don't think I would torture anybody. No, I'm saying if you if you had to torture if we all

439
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,600
Had to torture. It would be so easy to torture. You just keep him up past 11 o'clock and he'll start crying

440
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:39,480
No, no, I'll do I'll paint I'll paint eyes on my eyelids so you think I'm still awake

441
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,040
well, well, we'll

442
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,480
defend against that I

443
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,640
I will simply counter that actually so it's easy.

444
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Yeah.

445
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,920
Cameron, I'd pull his hair like I'm picking a beet out of the ground.

446
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
It would just come out.

447
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
It's not real.

448
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
No.

449
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Really?

450
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,920
You have a piece?

451
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,440
No, I have a lot of them.

452
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
Each one is fake.

453
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,160
Maybe I should get into toupees now that my hair is short.

454
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I thought about it.

455
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,480
I thought about getting a toupee.

456
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
It would be pretty funny.

457
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
I thought it would be really funny.

458
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
Right?

459
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,120
Oh yeah, I forgot about Patrick's funny hair right now.

460
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Yeah.

461
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
It's not that funny.

462
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
It's pretty funny.

463
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,620
No.

464
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,120
How is it funny?

465
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,420
It's not funny. It's normal.

466
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:17,920
Yeah.

467
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,120
What's funny about it, Cam?

468
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
It was funny. It was funny to look at.

469
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,320
Why is it funny?

470
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,620
Just the way it looks.

471
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,120
How?

472
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
It doesn't look good.

473
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
What's funny about it?

474
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,620
It's like orange. Bright orange.

475
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,120
It's normal. That's a beanie.

476
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
That's a hat.

477
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh, my mistake. Oh, his hair isn't funny.

478
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,120
I thought that was his hair on the top of his head.

479
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
You fucking hairy piece of shit, Cameron.

480
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
You don't know what we go through, dude.

481
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I don't care.

482
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,120
I don't have to care about it.

483
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Yeah, you're right. You're right, it's our fault that we're bald. Yeah, you guys should have worked harder.

484
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,780
At least all my hair will grow back. Yeah. I spend a lot of time meditating and focusing.

485
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:03,560
My hair doesn't grow on its own. Yeah, you focused on how to not get testosterone.

486
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:10,400
Yeah, that's right. Mm-hmm. Me and Pat are just high-T'd. We're too high-T. That's the problem.

487
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:17,680
Yeah, people look at me. They think that guy is running on only testosterone that motherfucker. He'd be dead if one for testosterone

488
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:26,040
Mm-hmm. Yeah, my balls are pumping too much. You have no blood in you. It's all he all tea purity high tea

489
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,580
Yeah, yeah British tea like an old British lady. Oh, see only you would think that cuz yeah, you're

490
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,080
Immediate thought is your grandma. Yeah, my grandma's not

491
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Yeah, she is.

492
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
That's not true.

493
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Yeah, she is.

494
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
No.

495
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
Her name is Agnes Francis.

496
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
That's not true.

497
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Get Agnes Francis Cameron.

498
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,600
When you guys are trying not to cum while you're having sex, do you imagine-

499
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,360
I don't imagine my grandma, if that's where this is going.

500
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Not your grandma.

501
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
A grandma?

502
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
But an old lady.

503
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,360
That would just make me bust quick.

504
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,120
Because I was talking to Noah about this.

505
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,120
You basically have two moves you can make there.

506
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Baseball or grandma.

507
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:15,100
bit no I go poop or grandma sometimes I imagine poop yeah yeah and and I have

508
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,680
had to stop because I just lost it and it just killed it for me dude I don't

509
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,320
know I have ADD I can't think sorry baby my imagination is way too good I'm just

510
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,480
way too talented as yeah I thought of 3d 3d rotating a poop in your head sorry I

511
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,160
baby I just I was thinking about poop and then I ended up thinking about a

512
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,680
really great movie idea and now I'm gonna go write that down instead of have sex

513
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,720
with you yeah I thought of the best sitting completely naked at a

514
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,720
typewriter and just clacking out the 3d poop that was that I was fucking to

515
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,720
care of a poop character to my penis you know it's probably the best thing to

516
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,680
think about to keep your to keep yourself going but it's definitely not

517
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:07,640
good is uh any ISIS beheading you think that would stop me you think I don't

518
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:18,680
would stop you think that would ever stop me you think I don't know me with

519
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,320
You think you could stop me by making me think about that?

520
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
I'll never stop.

521
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
You can never stop fucking.

522
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,360
Even if you behead me, I will never stop.

523
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,920
It doesn't fucking matter.

524
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Yeah.

525
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,320
I won't stop, dude.

526
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,520
No, 'cause there's...

527
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,600
You can't do anything with a hole, 'cause I'll just zone in.

528
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Doesn't matter, dude.

529
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Okay, what about just like...

530
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,040
Just zooming in really, really far in your imagination.

531
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,240
If you squint, the trachea could be a pussy.

532
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Oh.

533
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh.

534
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Caleb.

535
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Jesus Christ.

536
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
First you do a Saturday Night Live Hitler.

537
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Now you're talking about a fucking...

538
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
When I want to keep myself going

539
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I uh...

540
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
I think about Jim Gaffigan.

541
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Yeah, but then I'm thinking about

542
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Hot Pockets and then I'm hard again.

543
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Yeah, then I'm getting hard again.

544
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I got a Hot Pocket for ya.

545
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Hot...

546
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Penis.

547
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
That's right dude, that's pretty good.

548
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Dude, he's a stand-up.

549
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
What about-

550
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,400
We could get him on the show and you're crushing, you're burning that bridge.

551
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,360
Hey, make America gaff again.

552
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Whoa.

553
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360

Yeah.

557
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
How about that?

558
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
That's good.

559
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,960
When he takes down Trump, he already did.

560
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I think that-

561
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
He did.

562
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Yeah, he was mostly-

563
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
What the fuck is-

564
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,400
What is Jimmy Kimmel gonna cry about now that Trump isn't president?

565
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,680
The healthcare again?

566
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,480
No, he's gonna be like, "It's all fixed."

567
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
No, 'cause he wouldn't cry.

568
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,600
yeah he wouldn't cry about health care yeah he only was crying because his son

569
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,960
that whole thing was like yeah people need health care I mean yeah I'm crying

570
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,080
because my son is who is the son of a billionaire is getting like the greatest

571
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,120

573
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,760

Dude, SNL is screwed.

578
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
They're just gonna keep doing Trump material.

579
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
That's true.

580
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
They will, yeah.

581
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,440
For the next few months they're gonna do like

582
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Trump realizing he lost the election sketches every week

583
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
and then after Joe Biden's president

584
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
they're gonna be like, here's what Trump is up to

585
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440

586
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440

Like just follow him until he's dead.

589
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
He'll do it. He'll do it right after

590
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
he's out of office. He's gotta do it.

591
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,960
of like keeping up with the Kardashians,

592
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,560
but it's just him like renting out like water parks

593
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,980
and rides by himself.

594
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,720
- Yeah, dude, he'll never die.

595
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,200

- Yeah, the fact that he beat COVID is so insane.

599
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720

600
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,880
- He can't die.

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,320
- The fact that he beat COVID is so insane.

602
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,160

- Mm-hmm.

661
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,780
- Yeah, we're gonna play so much in your apartment, dude.

662
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,380
- Yeah, dude, we're gonna play around.

663
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,860
- Caleb is leaving for an evening to go,

664
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,100
I heard he was going to like some male toy store

665
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,940
or something.

666
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,780
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,620
- Something like--

668
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,740
- I belong there.

669
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,660
- Yeah, you're the test subject.

670
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,020
- Yeah, I'm one of the toys, like Richard Pryor.

671
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,860
- Yeah.

672
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,680
- Yeah.

673
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,520
- Yeah.

674
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,380
- It's some kind of toy store that's like--

675
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,700
- Me and Patrick are gonna play so much in your apartment.

676
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,740
- Caleb's going to an adult toy store.

677
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,860
- We're gonna run from the kitchen,

678
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,260
we're gonna run from the kitchen to your bedroom

679
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,120
back and forth, we're gonna jump on the bed,

680
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,500
we're gonna finger paint on the walls,

681
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,980
we're gonna use this stuff.

682
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,260
- Caleb and Jenna, look what we made you!

683
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,900
(laughing)

684
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,560
- If we paint the fridge completely black.

685
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,260
- We put chalkboard paint on it.

686
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,460
- We're gonna take all the food out of your fridge

687
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,400
and freezer and we're gonna play army men with it

688
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,900
'cause you guys don't have any army men.

689
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,460
- I'm gonna get one of those like kids cash registers

690
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,300
and put it down and be like,

691
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,940
"Can you guys watch the register while I'm gone?

692
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,220
"Like this is your job."

693
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,540
And I'm gonna hand you those like plastic baby car keys.

694
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,940
- We're gonna have a twins pool party

695
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,620
in the toilet and bathtub.

696
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,020
(coughing)

697
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,620
Where we hold hands across.

698
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,140
Twins you say?

699
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah, 'cause one of us is in the toilet

700
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,540
and one is in the bathtub.

701
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,380
Yeah.

702
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,580
If you come home early, you get a piece of it.

703
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,420
I can guess which one you want.

704
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,260
You get a piece of the action.

705
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,780
You want a piece of me?

706
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,620
Hey man, you want a piece of us?

707
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,460
You want a piece of me?

708
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,140
We're gonna be playing in the toilet and the bathtub

709
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,980
if you want.

710
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,260
I have been wanting to go to the pool really bad.

711
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,540
Hey man, you wanna step outside

712
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,780
and play in the toilet and bathtub with me and my friend?

713
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,620
Hey man.

714
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,220
Hey buddy, how about we step outside

715
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,340
and play in the toilet?

716
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,460
(laughing)

717
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,300
- How about that?

718
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,140
- How about we split?

719
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,220
- It's gonna be you, me, the port-a-body.

720
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,060
- Yeah, you and me.

721
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,420
- We're gonna be splashed around.

722
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,740
- The bathroom, a few plastic beakers,

723
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,700
maybe a spoon, an eyedropper,

724
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,020
one of those little floaty rubber duckies.

725
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,220
- And I got a Chewbacca toy.

726
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,060
- There's a log in there,

727
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,900
there's a log in there

728
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,620
'cause I couldn't figure out how to flush.

729
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,660
- I got this Chewbacca, it kinda looks like a poop.

730
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,420
(laughing)

731
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,060
- Why do you have a Chewbacca toy with you?

732
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,740
- I do actually have a Chewbacca with me.

733
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,380
This is Chewbacca, Shadows of the Empire.

734
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,300
This is him in Bounty Hunter disguise.

735
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,740
Yes it is, look it up.

736
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,460
- Okay.

737
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,120
Says no.

738
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,960
- It is.

739
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,740
- No, I just looked it up.

740
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,700
- No.

741
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
- Yeah.

742
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,380
- You're, don't even try to lie to me about this.

743
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,940
- Sorry, am I ruining your fun?

744
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,780
- You are.

745
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,100
- Don't care.

746
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,620
- Damn, I should have bought this in the pack

747
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,940
instead of just at a flea market

748
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,820
because in the pack it comes with an axe and a big gun.

749
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,140
- I hate you. - Wow.

750
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,380
- I actually hate you.

751
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,020
- Could have had a cool toy, but no.

752
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,100
My toy is not cool enough at this point.

753
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,660
- Of course Patrick is the only guy

754
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,860
who would have a cool toy and say,

755
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,620
"Oh, it's not cool enough."

756
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,580
- Also, that toy is style over function, dude.

757
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,420
- What do you mean?

758
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,260
- I don't care if it--

759
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,380
- He's in a bounty hunter disguise.

760
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,060
- Style, that's style.

761
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,540
Sorry, sorry, excuse me, this is--

762
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,760
Do you know what that does for the story?

763
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,360
Does his gun shoot a projectile?

764
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,880
No, it doesn't.

765
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
But he has an axe.

766
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,880
He has a vibro axe.

767
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
No, it doesn't shoot a projectile.

768
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,640
What the f- What can you use the toy to do?

769
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,240
Okay, so if you have the other, if you have regular plainclothes Chewbacca.

770
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,520
Which you don't.

771
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
How do you know I don't?

772
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,360
You can play a game where he becomes a bounty hunter, but you don't have that.

773
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,360
Exactly.

774
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,700
- I'm at 2,200 by default, dude.

775
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,460
- You guys are so rude.

776
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,560
- You're rude.

777
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
- What do you mean I'm rude?

778
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,520
You're fucking rude about my toys.

779
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,700
- This is a real toy, okay?

780
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,540
- No, that's a PlayStation controller.

781
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,840
- This is a PlayStation 4 controller.

782
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
- That's not a toy.

783
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,600
- This is function over style.

784
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,440
- No, it's not. - This is not a toy.

785
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,040
- No, it's not a toy. - This is an adult's toy, okay?

786
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,880
- No.

787
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,080
- What you have is a toy for a paralyzed child, okay?

788
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,640
What I have is a toy for a thinking adult.

789
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,560
You love you.

790
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,640
- Nobody say what this is.

791
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,080
Nobody say what this is.

792
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,520
But this is an adult's toy for you.

793
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,800
- A penis pump?

794
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,840
- No, it's a penis pump.

795
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,800
Yeah, I use it to fucking make orange juice.

796
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,680
- A syringe full of saline?

797
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,120
(laughing)

798
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,720
- Yeah, dude, it's an adult toy.

799
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,360
- You freak.

800
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
Freakazoid.

801
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,320
- Does the Chewbacca's arms and legs move?

802
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,160
- Yes.

803
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,000
- Are they fully articulated?

804
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
- It doesn't have, no, it doesn't have.

805
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,200
- How many points of articulation?

806
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,060
- It has four points of articulation.

807
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,680
It was a 90's-- - That's so few.

808
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh my God, he's a baby. - 90's toy.

809
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,840
Look, it's not a baby's toy.

810
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,680
- It actually is.

811
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,760
- It's not. - So why,

812
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,600
then tell me why it rattles.

813
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
- It doesn't rattle.

814
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,720
- It rattles when you shake it.

815
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,560
- Okay, shake it right now.

816
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,240
- Shake it right now. - Shake it in the microphone.

817
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,600
(shushing)

818
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,440
- That's you doing that.

819
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,280
- That is you doing that with your toy.

820
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,200
- No, that was you rattling.

821
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,220
- I hate this.

822
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,200

No. Who am I?

837
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
Caleb.

838
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Wrong.

839
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,040
It's Caleb.

840
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
You're wrong.

841
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Guess who has double dungeon duty?

842
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
Mr. Fucking Farting Nazi.

843
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,380
I'm not a farting Nazi. You're not a party. Not that's a farting Nazi. I'm not the farting not sir Patrick the farting Nazi

844
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,740
Yes, you're a sodding tosser

845
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,280
Whoa, oh my god, you just sold a Polish man. He's a sodding tosser. Yeah, not cool

846
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,740
It's kind of guess this guy really does have tea in his veins instead of blood if you know what I'm saying

847
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,320
That's right the tea for the Third Reich

848
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,860
No, yeah

849
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,400
You guys, can we just have one episode where I'm not the punching bag?

850
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,780
No.

851
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,280
What did you say?

852
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,780
Like, what?

853
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,440
Stop dressing like a punching bag.

854
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,360
The punching bag.

855
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,600
Punching bag.

856
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,440
You are the punching bag, because you're chained up in the dungeon and we're fucking

857
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,200
trading blows on you right now with a wooden sword.

858
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,040
Yeah, you guys are trading blows on me.

859
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,040
Yeah, we are.

860
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,800
You chained me up so you could suck me.

861
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,200
Now we're blowing at you like a wolf at a brick house.

862
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Yeah.

863
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,120
You better not.

864
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
I'm going to blow you away.

865
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm serious.

866
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
You better not.

867
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm going to blow you away, you little piggy.

868
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
Better not blow me away.

869
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
I'm going to come to your house.

870
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
I'm going to blow it away, brother.

871
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:18,760
No, you better not do that.

872
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
You're getting blown.

873
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,480
Oh, oh, curses.

874
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
I hate that.

875
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,160
I hate getting blown away.

876
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,360
I'm gonna put you on a peloton in the dungeon and make you fucking sweat.

877
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
AHH NO!

878
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Yeah.

879
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
No.

880
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,160
I'm gonna put a picture of a donut on the iPad and make you fucking--

881
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
You better not!

882
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160

884
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,160
You better not.

885
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Stop pretending you like the dungeon!

886
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,160
This is not gonna work on me.

887
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
I'm not gonna let you down there.

888
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
You hate the dungeon.

889
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160

You better not do that.

893
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,160
If you like it, it's because it smells like your fart.

894
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,160
There's no computer in the dungeon.

895
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,520
I'd hate being in the dungeon so much.

896

- Oh, you like it so much in the dungeon, Pat?

901

Yeah, no, get out of there.

909
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,240

910
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,080

911
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,900

- Listen.

915
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,960
- Please let me stay in the dungeon.

916
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,000
- Listen, I'm telling you right now,

Yes, for a couple more minutes.

Can you stop?

919
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,500
Just get out of the dungeon.

00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Just get out.

921
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,500

Alright, you're going back in.

927
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,500
No!

928
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,000
You're back in.

929
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,500
Alright, it's locked.

930
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,000
This didn't work like I planned.

931
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Are you stuck in this voice now?

932
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000

939
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,520

00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,580
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1016
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,420
- Yeah.

1017
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,020
- Yeah, it's called-- - That's what I'm saying.

1018
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,500
- It's called Finding Hitler.

1019
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,500
- Finding Hitler at the end of the world.

1020
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,580
- Yeah, and it's called Jojo Rabbit.

1021
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,420
- Yep.

1022
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,820
The thing about Jojo Rabbit is he did teach that boy

1023
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,220
a lot about friendship.

1024
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,420
- Yeah.

1025
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,460
- I haven't seen it.

1026
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,740
- I saw it, it's pretty bad.

1027
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,580
- Yeah.

1028
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,380
- Pretty not good.

1029
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,620
- They took back Hitler.

1030
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1031
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,540
- Finally, somebody did it.

1032
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,020
I'm gonna get it. Just Tycho, just Tycho Atiti did. Nobody else did. Yeah. It was just him.

1033
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,940
Everyone has to do it. If we really wanna, if we really wanna get rid of the power that

1034
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,860
Hitler holds over us, even today, everybody has to dress up like him. Yeah. Tycho Atiti,

1035
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:50,860
you call him Psycho the Creepy. What kind of guy makes a Hitler movie? I mean, come on.

1036
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:57,860
Yeah. Steven Spielberg, I call him Scary Screamsburg. Why the hell would he make a movie about Hitler?

1037
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,860
I think that's probably what Hitler would call him.

1038
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,860
Yeah.

1039
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,940
I think you're inching towards being Hitler right now.

1040
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,860
Okay I would call him my favorite director.

1041
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,440
Now he feels like you're compensating.

1042
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,500
What did Steven Spielberg make?

1043
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Everything.

1044
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Uh, Hitler.

1045
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
E.T.

1046
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,500
The Jaws.

1047
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,500
He made Jaws.

1048
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
He made The Twilight Zone.

1049
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Jurassic Park.

1050
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
No, did he make The Twilight Zone movie?

1051
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,220
No, that was that was uh, that was Jordan Jordan peel. You're right. Yeah, I

1052
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:38,340
Think yeah, I think he made the mid made he made war of the worlds the 9/11 version

1053
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,860
Steven Spielberg made

1054
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,640
The Twilight Zone movie and then denounced John Landis or something, right?

1055
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,940
No, I think that's true. It indiana's down. Yeah, he was a director of a party

1056
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,540
So he made the Indiana Zone movie. Oh

1057
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,980
Right and he denounced John Lennon. Yeah, you're so stupid

1058
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,900
Yeah

1059
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,760
It's crazy that that's where there is named Indiana Jones

1060
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,300
The what the character of Indiana Jones being named India?

1061
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,720
There's probably this is probably like a stand-up bit from 2006 like kids in the hall sketch

1062
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,980
No, yeah, I bet it is

1063
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,980
What's that what is it say what you say what the joke is that you're stealing the joke would be like some guy

1064
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,580
I'm not seeing the joke here. Well one of those schlubby like 2006 comedians being like

1065
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,380
So you because you're the one who said it. Isn't it weird that his name is Indiana Jones?

1066
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,540
You can't you're the one who just said it so it's not good to say what just

1067
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:40,060
literally just say it. It was the thought that I had in my head. Just say the thought you had in your head.

1068
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,060
It's weird that Indiana Jones is named Indiana Jones because that name could

1069
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:50,860
have been anything his name could have been Arizona Smith or like Montana

1070
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,220
that's great no that is a good 2006 comedian joke yeah you just put yeah

1071
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,580
just it's just like a plug-and-play yeah you just switch out one of the words

1072
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:04,140
Kanye West how about Kanye East yeah you know one of those kind of thing yeah so

1073
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,580
this so this Snoop Dogg fellas thinks that says that when the pimp is in the

1074
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,300
crib I drop it like it's hot is that a crib he wants me to drop my baby okay I

1075
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:17,420
think hip-hop is seriously a disease all these hip hoppers going in a baby crib

1076
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:22,540
that was that was a big that was a big thing then and stand up to is like these

1077
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:28,660
rap rap fellas are backwards like their hats yeah I'm sick of these rappers

1078
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:31,940
wearing their pants backwards and telling me they're gonna make me jump

1079
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,980
crisscross wear their hats forwards and the rest of their their body back no I

1080
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,620
think they wore everything backwards cuz it was wiggity wiggity wiggity wack how

1081
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,140
do you wear your shoes backwards you get special I think maybe they didn't wear

1082
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:50,060
laces and the shoes like MDMC maybe they had backward shoes it was just the pants

1083
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:54,020
that way they could have backwards shoes how do you mean in that you have to take

1084
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,580
your pants all the way off oh yeah you're just going to a stall or you just

1085
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,500
eat your pants pee out of your butt yeah I think crisscross is called crisscross

1086
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,580
because they the crisscross their penis between their legs to pee behind nice

1087
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,060
their bodies could have been backwards you know and they were close normally

1088
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,420
that's true I didn't think about that maybe their head was back maybe that's

1089
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,620
That's why that guy died so young, because his whole body was backwards, including his

1090
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
internal organs.

1091
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,620
He had backwards body disease.

1092
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,620
Yeah.

1093
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,860
His heart was backwards and it gave up on him.

1094
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:27,100
His body got confused by his clothes.

1095
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,660
Every time he looked in the mirror, his kidneys just didn't know what to do.

1096
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Yeah.

1097
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,940
They started pushing the toxins into his mouth.

1098
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,940
Yeah.

1099
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:39,580
Dialysis is wiggity, wiggity, wiggity, wiggity whack.

1100
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,260
I'm bringing wiggity whack back.

1101
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,260
No, you're not.

1102
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,260
Yeah, with how you look and act.

1103
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,260
Because you're wiggity wet.

1104
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,260
Oh man. That's like an arrow to my heart.

1105
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,260
And you're gonna get slippity slapped.

1106
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,260
Oh, you better not slap me.

1107
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,260
Yeah.

1108
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,260
I wonder if those crisscross guys

1109
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,260
when they were older and like fucking groupies

1110
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,260
if a girl ever like

1111
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,260
unzipped

1112
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,260
their pants

1113
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,260
and sucked their butt.

1114
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:26,060
you I know what you want zip Oh Pat froze again no no no you're bad you're unfrozen

1115
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,060
you'd be thought okay my internet connection is unstable even though I

1116
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:34,180
have it plugged in the fuck thank God is at the end of the episode I think it

1117
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,100
knows you're in a dungeon right now no yeah they don't know I'm in a dungeon I

1118
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,740
I think Comcast is getting revenge on us for our shenanigans towards them.

1119
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,740
Yeah.

1120
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,740
Yeah, that's true.

1121
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,740
I forgot about that.

1122
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,740
Yeah.

1123
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,980
They probably narrowed down Patrick's address.

1124
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,940
Oh, they finally did.

1125
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
Yeah.

1126
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,940
Yeah.

1127
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
Yeah, one dungeon road.

1128
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,700
I'm going to narrow down Patrick.

1129
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,420
I think my router just got here.

1130
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,420
Whoa, dude.

1131
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,260
That's why it was so slow before.

1132
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,700
Your router wasn't even here.

1133
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,700
It was...

1134
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,700
That's true.

1135
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,940
You were connecting to it in the mail truck.

1136
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,860
That's a bad connection.

1137
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,700
uh-huh i've been thinking about becoming a mailman

1138
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,140
yeah really be cool yeah honestly i feel like that would be a cool job i think my

1139
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,420
brother was a mailman for a little bit i think you get like all the holidays off

1140
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,020
and like government benefits including mailman day yeah it seems like it seems

1141
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,740
like a cool job you'd walk around a lot too

1142
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,500
yeah the two best jobs two best government jobs to get are probably new

1143
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,060
hampshire liquor store and mailman or and president white white

1144
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,740
house white house uh not too much

1145
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,220

1147
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:55,820
okay all right yeah tester candy tester poison tester that's actually a really

1148
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,780
good no because then you then you you should be the second poison tester the

1149
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:04,140
one who gives it the double check just to make sure in case the first one is like

1150
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:10,440
this is like a bride like style he's been yeah the poison exactly exactly so yeah

1151
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,460
and then if the if the first guy dies you don't have to eat it yeah how could you

1152
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:20,020
not tell that something what poison testers like green poison tester yeah

1153
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,940
they give the poison tester like all right you have to test the Kings porridge

1154
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,940
It's like I don't like porridge

1155
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,660
Yeah, that's not for me. No, can we put more salt in this please?

1156
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:42,800
Texas Pete I don't like chalula. I'm not gonna eat this porridge until I I don't eat porridge unless there's an antidote in it

1157
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,800
Yeah, just

1158
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,140
Just come that's what they should do put the antidote in everything the president eats

1159
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:54,580
just covering the entire pig roast with ketchup just to taste one bite of it.

1160
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,860
Just ruining the whole feast. Yeah, you know what's poisoning me?

1161
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:07,300
Cilantro. That's what. Drinking out of the soup cauldron with a straw and just spitting back into

1162
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:13,460
it. Man, I used to, when I worked at Clover, I used to sample the soup the whole day.

1163
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,340
Really? Just with a spoon?

1164
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:21,340
Yeah, you get little sample cups and I would just drink soup out of a Dixie cup.

1165
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,340
Do you guys wish you could swim in a giant pot of soup if it wasn't boiling and didn't burn you?

1166
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:29,340
If it was at like 100 degrees, no.

1167
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,340
Well, I just said if it's not gonna burn you, it'll be...

1168
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:40,340
Okay, here's the parameters, okay? Would you guys swim in a giant bowl of soup if it was the best experience of your life?

1169
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,820
- It would have to be, first of all,

1170
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,320
it would have to be clear soup.

1171
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,720
- Excuse me?

1172
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:46,540
- What?

1173
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,580
- You know, have you seen those YouTube videos

1174
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,140
where they make tomato soup clear?

1175
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,980
- No.

1176
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,540
- No.

1177
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,060
Oh, well, they did it.

1178
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,340
- So it would have to be--

1179
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,180
- It would have to be that soup.

1180
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,380
- So it would have to look like water.

1181
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,180
- Why would you want it to be clear?

1182
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,460
- Well, 'cause--

1183
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,660
- Would you swim in prep powder?

1184
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,560
- No, let him answer.

1185
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,460
- If it's like a thick soup.

1186
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,580
Oh, I froze out again.

1187
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,900
- Oh, you got frozen again.

1188
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,780
Oh, man.

1189
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:15,100
gonna get my answer. Unfreeze dude, come on, get your shit together man. It's almost over.

1190
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,540
Hurry up. We literally just wanted one answer from you and then the episode can end. And

1191
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:25,540
this is what you fucking do to us dude? I said my answer while I was frozen. No, you

1192
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:31,500
have to repeat the answer. Okay. Well now I forget what we were talking about. Why does

1193
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,300
it need to be clear? Why does the soup need to be clear for you to swim in it? Cause it's

1194
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:45,940
soluble or whatever what yeah okay what are you imagine okay the whole pool and

1195
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,900
some more water what are you talking about what I didn't know what water

1196
01:00:50,900 --> 01:01:02,760
soluble meant why do you want it to be clear I cuz then it wouldn't phase me as

1197
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:09,320
much that it was soup. Because if it looks like water I can be like yeah this water

1198
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:20,040
tastes like tomato soup. You would be scared if it didn't look like water? No it would be weird. I just wanted to feel normal.

1199
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,440
In that river in Chicago on St. Patrick's Day when they make it green? Well it's still

1200
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:30,720
water. But it looks not like water. Yeah but I know it's water. Would you swim in clear

1201
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,560
soup if you thought it was water? Yeah. Why wouldn't you swim in- That's what I was trying

1202
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,080
to say. I was saying it in a roundabout way. You would have to think it was water in order

1203
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:44,480
to swim in it? Yeah. So you wouldn't swim in soup. You would only swim in soup if you

1204
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,960
thought it was water. Yeah. Well then it's a surprise. Okay, so you'd just have to say

1205
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,760
no. You wouldn't swim in a bowl of soup. If- then it would be a surprise and then a- So

1206
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,760
You have to be surprised. Yes.

1207
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:04,640
All right, well when you get to Caleb's house, there's gonna be a big bowl and it's full of water, okay?

1208
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:12,160
Yeah, red water, but it's water. Okay. I promise you that. All right. All right. I'm gonna go set up this fucking router

1209
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,920
All right. Yeah. All right. Bye y'all. Bye

1210
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,760
Bye.
