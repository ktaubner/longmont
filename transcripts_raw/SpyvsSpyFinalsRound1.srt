1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
- All right, everyone.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,820
It's time.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,000
Spy versus Spy.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Finale.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,640
- The gauntlet.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,920
- Finals.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,440
- Finals.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,280
- From what I understand--

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,160
- Maybe not finale.

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
- From what I understand,

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,560
the bracket looked a little bit like this.

12
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,680
It was Caleb versus Patrick,

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,680
and I believe Patrick emerged victorious.

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,520
Is that correct?

15
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,340
- That's correct.

16
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,480
- And then it was me versus Caleb,

17
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,200
and Caleb lost yet again.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,680
So which only leaves one final matchup.

19
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,920
- That's correct.

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
- It's a very small bracket.

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,080
(laughing)

22
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,160
Unless we do, unless we do

23
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,160
you versus the winner.

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,140
- Me versus the winner?

25
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,480
And then I make all the rules and everything?

26
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,020
- Spy versus God.

27
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,600
- Spy versus God would be so fuego.

28
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
That'd be gas.

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,600
- I'm interested.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,640
- Me too.

31
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,880
- We'll talk about that.

32
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,880
'Cause here it's, right now it's white spy versus Cameron.

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,400
And--

34
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,220
- I'm white spy?

35
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,420
I thought I was black spy.

36
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,440
- No, Caleb is black spy.

37
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,000
- Well, okay.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,940
- Does that change something for you?

39
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,040
- No, I just had to change it in my roll 20.

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
- Oh, were you actually black spy?

41
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,680
- I don't remember.

42
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,420
- I have you in here as white spy.

43
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,660
- Okay, well that's probably right then.

44
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,920
- Yeah.

45
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,200
I think we flip the coin to find out who was Black Spy

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
and who wasn't. - Yeah.

47
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,480
I think I might have given Caleb Black Spy.

48
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,880
- That makes sense. - 'Cause of his tendencies.

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,560
Let's go to the first arena.

50
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,360
- I want to juggle three butts.

51
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
- What? - What?

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
- What?

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,320
- Did that work or no?

54
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Oh, now they have it all-- - No, it didn't work.

55
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,040
- Roll 20 now has it all broken up in a different way.

56
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,960
- Ah.

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,920
- All the UI redesign.

58
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
- Yeah, they just don't want to--

59
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,880
- I just wanted, for the audio listeners,

60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,640
I just wanted to explain that I'm dressed up

61
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
currently like a spy.

62
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
So you don't have to--

63
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,680
- You're not dressed as a spy.

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,320
- You don't have to, no, I'm dressed up exactly like a spy.

65
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,680
- You're dressed up as an extra

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,280
in a Five Finger Death Punch music video.

67
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,080
- No, I think I look more like a spy.

68
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,600
(laughing)

69
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,960
- You got your ass beat up, son.

70
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,080
All right, what does it look like now?

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,060
Are we where we need to be?

72
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,240
I see a place with two bathrooms.

73
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,420
Yep, this is an office, isn't it?

74
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,800
It is the bank.

75
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,940
Oh, I see the vault now.

76
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,080
It is the bank.

77
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,280
So we're gonna start, it's gonna escalate

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,960
until we get to, you know where we're gonna go to, Pat.

79
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,060
Don't spoil it for everyone else, though.

80
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,560
How do I know?

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,180
Because you, we talked about it.

82
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,400
because I sent you guys a picture of your old drawings.

83
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,120
- Oh, okay.

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,960
- Wait, what?

85
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,880
- Oh, okay, nevermind.

86
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
I wasn't sure, I thought Pat knew.

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Okay.

88
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,040
- No, I don't know, but I was just--

89
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,000
- Don't look at your old texts.

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,640
- I was trying to be reassuring.

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
- Okay.

92
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
- I thought that you needed that.

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,900
- No, I didn't, I'm good.

94
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,740
That's very sweet.

95
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm sad I give off that kind of energy, though.

96
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,560
It's not great.

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
(laughing)

98
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,520
To know about me.

99
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
So, okay, we have--

100
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
- These are like the dirtiest glasses in the world,

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,220
I can't even wear 'em, sorry.

102
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,200
- No, you're fine.

103
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,280
The white spy, Pat, you are at the bank right now,

104
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,880
somebody's putting cards.

105
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,120
- Yeah, where'd these cards come from?

106
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,200
- I found out that you can draw cards.

107
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,840
- Don't do it, why would you teach others that?

108
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
- It was an accident.

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,520
I made a deck up here and I was dragging cards out of it

110
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
and I didn't know if it could see them.

111
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
(laughing)

112
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,480
It was my bad, y'all.

113
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,520
- That's so good.

114
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
There's lots of games we can play.

115
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,840
We can even add deck drawing elements to D&D

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
as like a mechanic.

117
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,120
- Yeah, I was honestly just trying to figure out

118
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
how to whisper to Julio so I could say something

119
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,540
so nasty to him, but I just accidentally started

120
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,880
drawing cards from a playing card deck instead.

121
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,200
(laughing)

122
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,240
- Cam, you were at the ATM.

123
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Pat, you were at the desk at the teller.

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,540
You guys, your job, as always, is to kill each other.

125
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,240
But we're gonna start with you guys figuring out

126
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
what gadgets you have in this here bank.

127
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,240
So, I did a little bit of swapping.

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Cam, I see the message you sent.

129
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,680
- I didn't send anything.

130
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
- Okay.

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,760
(laughing)

132
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,680
- I didn't say anything.

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,640
- For the listeners at home,

134
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,520
he said I wanna juggle three butts,

135
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,920
I wanna join the circus as a butt swallower.

136
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,360
It made me laugh.

137
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,520
So you guys roll three d20s.

138
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,120
I added some new items, removed some other ones.

139
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,600
So we're gonna have some fun with that.

140
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,440
And once you guys roll those three 20s,

141
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,280
I will send you your results.

142
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
- Three d20s?

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay, I'm gonna roll them right now.

144
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,160
- I rolled mine.

145
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,900
- Nice.

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,360
- Okay, is it 10, seven, one?

147
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,840
- Oh, I didn't roll, sorry.

148
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,200
- No worries.

149
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,420
- Wait, no, I did that wrong.

150
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,580
Let me--

151
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,420
- No, it still worked.

152
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,440
You can see the three results.

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,380
- 13, 18, 13.

154
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,680
- No, the first 13 is the sum of three D20s.

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,320
- All right, that's a good point.

156
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,020
- Yeah, don't stress so much about that kind of thing.

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,520
All right, Cam, I'm sending you your three items.

158
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,760
- Okay.

159
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,280
- Ignore that number, it's the new, from the new list.

160
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
- There's a new number?

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,960
- Yeah, there's a number I put that's on there,

162
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
but it's from my new list.

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
- Oh, I see it.

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,640
- Yeah.

165
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,560
It's 'cause I'm doing it all on one giant list

166
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
and then just saying, getting rid of these 10,

167
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
adding these 10.

168
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
And what else did you get?

169
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,080
Okay.

170
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Okay.

171
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,120
Oh, you got like kind of a cool mix.

172
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,960
- You heard that?

173
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
I got a cool mix.

174
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
- Oh, you got two 13s.

175
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,300
- No, the first 13 is three D20s added together.

176
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,560
- Oh, okay.

177
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
Okay, we'll just take those three then.

178
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,120
- I made it confusing.

179
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah, that's my bad.

180
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,160
- No, I should have just read that too.

181
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,040
Okay.

182
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,440
All right, we're gonna be done in the...

183
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,540
And then was that six and then five?

184
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,380
- Julio.

185
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,700
- And then what is that, two?

186
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,380
- Julio, can I ask you a question really quick?

187
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,260
- Pat got some classic items.

188
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,860
- I think if you ask him a question,

189
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,060
it won't come a pick up at all on the episode.

190
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,140
- All right, here we go.

191
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
You guys have your items.

192
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,240
- I just wanted to ask him if I looked like a spy.

193
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,100
- You look like a spy.

194
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,180
Just, I mean, like you don't,

195
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,740
You look kinda, I mean it's a little bit more

196
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,960
like Steven Seagal than a spy.

197
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,300
- I think that's what I'm going for.

198
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,900
- Okay, yeah, he kind of is always a spy a little bit.

199
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,620
- He is always a spy in everything he's in, exactly.

200
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,180
- At least a little bit he is.

201
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,140
He's like elite always.

202
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,900
All right, cool.

203
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,820
Now both of you guys roll one more D20

204
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,860
to determine who's gonna go first here.

205
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,700
- Okay.

206
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,420
I heard this thing the other day.

207
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,340
Oh wow, damn.

208
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,020
Oh wow, what terrible rules.

209
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,220
I know, so horrible.

210
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,060
Let's get him out of the way.

211
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,020
We got a three and a one.

212
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,780
That's gonna go to Pat though.

213
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,100
So Pat, you're gonna go first.

214
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,620
Cam, take off those earmuffs.

215
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,100
All right, well, I guess because I look like him,

216
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,220
I am Steven Seagal now.

217
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,420
Okay, cool.

218
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,380
So I'm looking at the bank teller and I'm like.

219
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,500
Hi sir, what would you like to do today?

220
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,820
How can I help you?

221
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
I came here to make a withdrawal,

222
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,500
But I think now that I look at you,

223
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,220
I want to make a deposit.

224
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,780
Baby girl, me want it, punani.

225
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,100
- Okay, yeah, roll, let's have you roll charisma.

226
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,180
Right, just out the gate.

227
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,260
Let's have you do that.

228
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,820
- I'm gonna roll with disadvantage.

229
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,300
- I think it's persuasion, really.

230
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,140
- You should roll--

231
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,700
- I'm gonna roll, every persuasion roll I've seen

232
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,100
once a go is roll with disadvantage.

233
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,740
- Yeah, definitely is.

234
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,700
Okay, a two.

235
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,960
(laughing)

236
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,280
Roll a perception check.

237
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,140
(laughing)

238
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,820
- What, the security guard's gonna go shoot me?

239
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,060
(laughing)

240
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay, a 10.

241
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,260
- Okay, you see her visibly shift

242
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,140
and it looks like she might be pressing something

243
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,340
underneath her desk.

244
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,580
(laughing)

245
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,940
- Okay.

246
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,660
Am I perceptive enough to know that she...

247
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,660
- Yeah, you've been in these types of situations a few times.

248
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,580
(laughing)

249
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,260
That's why I'm giving you the 10.

250
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,060
You know what this looks like.

251
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,500
- And I just say...

252
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,700
- It's usually at a chick-fil-a,

253
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
I tried to, I tried to, um, I tried to resolve the situation.

254
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,100
Okay, okay. What do you do? What do you do?

255
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,860
And I mean, make a deposit in your pussy.

256
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:54,060
Just to clear things up.

257
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,700
I mean that I'm, I want to make a deposit into your pussy with my cum.

258
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,740
I'm Steven Seagal.

259
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,820
You just have no money.

260
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,900
- Steven Seagal from the movies.

261
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,420
- Okay, this security guard is coming near you now.

262
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,420
- Okay, then I'm gonna use my teleporting umbrella.

263
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,100
(laughing)

264
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,220
That I've been pretending is a cane this whole time.

265
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,500
- Okay, pick a spot on the map.

266
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,380
- I'm gonna go into this break room

267
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,540
where the cool drinks are.

268
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,340
Let me read what the umbrella does.

269
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,660
- Yeah, yeah, please do.

270
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,980
This umbrella is enchanted to transport the user

271
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,700
to a previously marked location.

272
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,620
Oh, okay.

273
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,940
Previously marked, so.

274
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,900
- I'll say you walked into the bank.

275
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,460
So like, you know, this doesn't,

276
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,740
so here's the thing.

277
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,400
The entrance to the bank is back down where Cam is.

278
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,580
Like you see where Cam is, where it's by the ATMs.

279
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,540
- Yeah. - So it's like, like--

280
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,400
- Okay, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go outside.

281
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm gonna go outside, but all I'm gonna do

282
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,420
is put my sunglasses on

283
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,340
so that they think I'm a different guy.

284
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,300
- Okay, you're gonna go outside the bank.

285
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,900
bank. Don't move your character yet though. Don't move your character yet because

286
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,620
Cam technically would not know that you disappeared from the bank so we're gonna

287
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,540
do a little like we're just gonna we're going to have it that when he enters the

288
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,220
room okay I'm gonna remove your token okay and then I will place it where it

289
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,020
needs to be once he knows where you are but he's not gonna know where you are

290
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,660
yet so we'll have that be the item that you used the security guard is gonna be

291
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,220
like kind of looking around for a guy like you,

292
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,820
but we'll resolve that after.

293
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,380
So that was a great turn.

294
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,020
All right, take off your headphones.

295
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,860
Okay.

296
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,100
Okay.

297
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,020
- Okay.

298
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,700
- All right, man, you're at the ATM, it looks like.

299
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
What are you, are you trying to go,

300
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,620
you going into the bank?

301
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,260
It seems like you might've tailed him in here.

302
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,620
- No, I'm leaving the bank.

303
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,460
- You're done?

304
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,960
You're leaving the bank? - I'm leaving to go home.

305
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,500
- Okay, cool.

306
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,180
- No, I'm going into the bank.

307
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,020
- Okay.

308
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,300
- I'm going to the ATM, I suppose.

309
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,820
- All right, you're already right by the ATM.

310
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,660
What do you wanna do?

311
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,020
You can also like, you, I think the fiction here

312
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,180
in my mind was, White Spy was going in here.

313
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,700
You followed him in here.

314
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,260
That was my fiction, I think.

315
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,740
But like, it's up to you how you were planning this.

316
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,220
Have you been casing this joint?

317
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,160
You know he goes here often.

318
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,020
You know?

319
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,700
- Yeah, I guess it's, in a normal world,

320
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,820
it's hard to miss a white spy. A cartoon white spy.

321
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,620
So maybe I saw him going in here.

322
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,860
>> Mm-hm.

323
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,260
>> Should I read out my items also? Do I need to do that?

324
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
>> Only if you want to.

325
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,940
Pat, then read out his items to give you a hint.

326
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,140
>> Okay. Then I won't do that.

327
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,940
>> A hint of what you can do.

328
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,980
>> Yeah. So, I guess I'm pretending to use the ATM.

329
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,300
>> Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

330
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,580
and I'm gonna use my eavesdropper,

331
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,140
my sonic eavesdropper while I do that

332
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,100
to try and listen and hear if I can get any insight

333
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,500
into what the white spy is doing inside.

334
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,780
- Okay, cool.

335
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,700
All right, cool.

336
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,660
So when you use that, you hear some muffling

337
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,540
and then you hear someone go, "Where did he go?

338
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,500
"Where'd that guy go?"

339
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
And then you hear a woman's voice go,

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,880
"I don't know, he was just here, he was just here.

341
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,280
He was he was saying all kinds of awful things and uh yeah, and that's what you kind of hear

342
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,920
okay, then I

343
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,720
That makes me think that I'm afraid

344
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,640
Of being ambushed

345
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Makes me think I'm afraid so I what I would like to do is

346
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,160
I'd like to I kind of if he's vanished maybe in my mind. I'm thinking he's pro

347
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,240
He either knows I'm tailing him or he's about to go on the offensive

348
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,720
So I want to move outside and kind of like stand next to the door

349
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,680
Like as if I'm hot, you know hiding off to the side of the door

350
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,080
So the door opens I can immediately grab somebody or something

351
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:11,180
All right, cool. Move your move your character to where you want to go then I go like here

352
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,840
Cool

353
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,600
You see the white spy right in front of you Pat put on your headphone Pat show Pat to put on his headphones

354
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,360
Pat

355
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,100
So, Cam used the eavesdropper device and heard the commotion outside of a security guard

356
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,100
going "Where did he go?

357
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Where did he go?"

358
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,460
And then he was like, "He's gonna try to ambush me.

359
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,340
I gotta make sure that I get the jump on him.

360
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,540
I'll go outside and wait for him."

361
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
And here you were.

362
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm right in front of me.

363
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
So is that the end?

364
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
I take mine off?

365
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
That's the end of your turn, yeah.

366
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Okay.

367
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
So take yours off.

368
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Okay, Pat.

369
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,100
Okay, okay, so I know that he's right in front of me, right?

370
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,780
Can I use the umbrella again or is it once per turn because it doesn't say once per turn the umbrellas?

371
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,520
We were it's a way we were doing it before was like you can only use the item once

372
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,220
so I

373
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,520
I think we'll probably have to keep doing that for now just cuz I haven't okay fine-tune these outside of that

374
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,660
So I see him immediately

375
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:25,520
Yeah, okay, then I'm right in front. I'm just gonna throw the explosive canary. I love it. Okay, cool

376
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:33,040
Cam yeah, I'm telling cam to put on his headphones though. Can you help help me tell him? Yeah? Yeah? Yes nodding nodding?

377
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,620
It's got to be another way. Oh, yeah, you just have to think of I mean to what else is message

378
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,260
You would just do a fucking idiot do a thumbs up. Oh, yeah, I was doing that before

379
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,300
They go like like I'm supposed to register this

380
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,200
Yeah, Jibio can do the discord soundboard thing. Yeah, I should

381
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,900
Yes, just do a thumbs up that's okay, I feel like my big-ass thumb

392
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,900
- Oh yeah, I need to open up my character sheet real quick.

393
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,380
- That's an 11.

394
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,220
Okay.

395
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,740

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,100
- You take 11 damage, he throws an exploding canary at you.

399
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,940
- What?

400
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,780
- Yeah.

401
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,540
- Wait, am I supposed to be at half health right now?

402
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,780
- No, you should be at full health.

403
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,900
- Okay.

404
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,740
- Sorry, yeah.

405
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,380
- I take 11 damage, I'm not gonna say how much I'm at.

406
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:00,140
- Yeah, you just like walk outside and see Steven Seagal

407
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,460
and he just throws a bird at you and it explodes.

408
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,060
- Looks like I flipped you the bird.

409
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,900
- Damn.

410
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,940
- Okay, I think we just keep the headphones on right now

411
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,060
until you guys are separated again.

412
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,660
You're up, Cam.

413
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,700
- Okay, I would like to use my item to turn invisible.

414
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,380
- Ooh, nice. - Dang.

415
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,500
- Do it.

416
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,900
You turn invisible. - I do it.

417
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,740
- Okay.

418
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,540
At the end of this, this is an item

419
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,620
that you can use continuously, but at the end of the,

420
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,740
well, actually, yeah, so what we should do,

421
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,140
- Well actually, so before you use it,

422
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,340
sorry I didn't tee this up correctly.

423
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,860
The point of it being malfunctioning is that

424
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,780
you'll roll a d20 and if it's greater than 10 it works,

425
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,980
if it's less than 10 it doesn't work.

426
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,620
But then it will-- - Oh shit, really?

427
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,060
- Yeah, yeah. - Oh, I don't wanna use that.

428
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,940
That's, I don't like those odds.

429
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,100
- Yeah, no, it's not great odds right now.

430
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,700
- I say, I go up to Steven Seagal, white spot,

431
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,820
and I go like this, hey buddy, you better watch it.

432
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,300

440
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,220
the christianity through here that hits him

441
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,200
yet i was gonna ask with my i_q_-eight and i got to that but

442
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,300

443
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,420
now now it's even cigars i can say hey buddy what's the big idea and then i

444
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,420

445
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Alright it's your turn now Steven.

446
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Looks like we're in the belly of the beast.

447
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Oh because I stabbed you in the belly.

448
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Yeah and you're a beast.

449
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,420
And that's the movie he was in.

450
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
And you behave beastly.

451
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
That's a movie he was in.

452
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Oh yeah.

453
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Was that his production company or someone else's?

454
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,420
I think so, it's some Romanian thing.

455
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,420
It's probably his then yeah.

456
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,580
Um, what do I do now?

457
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,420
Okay, so I have a stab in the belly and

458
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,740
you have what I do.

459
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,780
I have a I have a cunning action.

460
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,660
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to Ike

461
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,220
you know, we're all rogues, so I'm going to Ike to roll

462
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,940
like on my back, you know.

463
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,420
Yeah, I'm going to roll.

464
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,040
down the street to my right.

465
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,440
And can I roll,

466
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,940
can I roll a d20 to see how far I can go?

467
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,340
Like maybe that'll determine the yards or feet or?

468
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,640
Hold on.

469
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,840
Yeah, that'll determine the feet.

470
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I can roll up to 20 feet.

471
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,140
Yeah, this is distant.

472
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,740
You're trying to do is use a cutting action to disengage.

473
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,240
Yeah, doing it in the form of an Aikido roll.

474
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,140
Uh-huh.

475
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,540
I'm rolling

476
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,940
my right

477
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,640
towards the bathrooms.

478
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,320
I'll let your, I'll let your, your Aikido roll also determine

479
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,140
if you get like an extra 10 or 15 feet.

480
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,040
Okay.

481
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,020
No, just let them roll and then have that be the number of

482
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,440
feet.

483
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,940
Yeah.

484
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah.

485
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,440
Do that.

486
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,840
Roll.

487
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah, do that.

488
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,040
Roll, roll a d20.

489
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,240
I want you to do that.

490
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,940
Okay.

491
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,440
For my.

492
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:27,940
Yeah.

493
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,540
10.

494
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,040
Yep.

495
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,840
That's, that's two squares y'all.

496
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,540
Yeah.

497
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay, cool.

498
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,340
- Wait, that's, oh.

499
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,720
- That's much smaller than if you just walked.

500
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,620
- You also have a move at, no, well, that's his disengage.

501
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,900
You also still have a move.

502
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,500
- Okay, then I'm gonna go, I'm gonna move towards.

503
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,340
- I'm sorry.

504
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,660
- A 10 foot roll is impressive.

505
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,380
- 10 foot roll and then I'm gonna.

506
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,180
- Sounds like somebody has a light load.

507
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,460
- I'm gonna run through this window right here.

508
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,300
(laughing)

509
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,140
- Okay.

510
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,060
- I'm gonna map this out.

511
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,900
- Okay, so I rolled here,

512
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,660
and now I'm all fours on the ground.

513
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,500
- Yeah, you're outside, so for the people--

514
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
- Steven Seagal, all fours on the ground.

515
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
- He's outside for all through the window.

516
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,180
He's in the front of the bank, by the way,

517
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,820
there's all these offices where like,

518
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,220
there are like consultants you can meet with,

519
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,700
they're like, yeah, like,

520
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,580
and so there's just people who's like,

521
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,880
I had one of them in here,

522
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,340
but I'll move him in the window you're gonna roll into.

523
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,180
Like one of the--

524
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,780
- I think, I thought it was this one.

525
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,020
- Whatever one you're trying to roll into,

526
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,860
there are people into that. - Yeah, I'm gonna go

527
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,980
into this one here.

528
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,300
- So. - You can add all the figurines.

529
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,620
- So I do a 10 foot roll over here.

530
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,780
Now I've landed, I'm on all fours,

531
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,620
like that photo of Shemar Moore.

532
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,780
- Jesus Christ!

533
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,100
- Says somebody as you crash through the window.

534
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
- Yeah, then I jump, well, I leap from all fours

535
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,980
on this tile through the window.

536
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,620
So I think I should roll athletics for that.

537
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,220
- Oh yeah, definitely you should.

538
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,660
- And that'll determine, or acrobatics rather.

539
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,220
And then-- - Either one is fine.

540
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,480
- Okay, and then we'll see how that,

541
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,920
we'll see if I even make it to the window

542
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,860
from that tile on the street.

543
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,360
Oh my God, it's a perfect leap.

544
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
- Fucking graceful.

545
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,460
- That's what he wanted.

546
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,360
- It's, it's, it's, uh.

547
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,240
- It's such a graceful leap through the window

548
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,400
that it just leaves like a perfect Looney Tunes

549
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,360
like hole in the shape of your body.

550
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,840
There's no shattering at all.

551
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,920
- Well, no, no, the reason,

552
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,760
- It's hard to kill Aerosagal right now.

553
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,980
- That's like what you tapped into.

554
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,020
You tapped into something ancient.

555
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,340
- The reason that it left such like a perfect hole

556
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,260
is 'cause I'm so big that I was already

557
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
the size of the window.

558
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,400
- Yeah, it just sloughed off basically.

559
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,340
Like, you just like removed the window basically

560
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,940
by crashing into it.

561
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,240
- It didn't shatter.

562
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
- Yeah, it just did.

563
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
- It just like, whoop.

564
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,780
(laughing)

565
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,740
- Cool, okay, you're in this guy's office now.

566
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,860
He's like, get, get, get.

567
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,440
Like this guy's like freaking out. He doesn't know how to react. He's like stepping away back to his desk

568
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,640
He's getting nervous. You also still have an item that you can use this turn. Oh, okay. Let me just

569
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,900
Look through my items right quick

570
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,200
I didn't get any good items man. You have one more item bullshit. Yeah

571
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,900
I'm gonna I'm gonna wait on my items, and then I'm gonna oh no. I'm gonna put my

572
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,500
You've only one item left to you by the way yeah

573
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,720
Then I'd have no items if you're gonna use the item and you want to use it stealthily just or something like just

574
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,840
I want to use it on okay

575
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,260
Like now that you're separated from each other

576
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,340
We'll do the turns like you're not really separated from each other

577
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,220
But you're far enough that like we'll do the turns back to the way they were okay. Should I take my headphones off?

578
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,380
Pat if there's something you want to do or you want to yeah, yeah, I'm gonna okay. Yeah, take off your headphones cam

579
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,540
- Yeah, yeah.

580
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,100
- Okay, I'm gonna throw my caltrops

581
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,740
in front of the window.

582
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,340
'Cause if it shattered the glass,

583
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,780
then that would've, yeah, I wouldn't have thrown them

584
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,620
if I didn't shatter, or if I did shatter the glass.

585
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,740
- Okay, roll sleight of hand to see kind of like

586
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,220
if you can place them quickly and like ably

587
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,820
within this turn in such a way.

588
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,660
Okay.

589
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,300
- I put one down meticulously, so I have--

590
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,140
- Okay.

591
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,740
- Next time, I should have had you do a whisper roll.

592
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,900
Next time we'll have you do that

593
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,840
so that it only shows up on my end.

594
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,660
Yeah, it's okay, it's fine.

595
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,560
Yeah, a couple, like one of them kinda like--

596
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,500
- I put one right in the middle.

597
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
- Yeah, one of them sticks out a little bit,

598
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,660
but we'll still have to roll like an insight

599
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,980
to see if he sees it.

600
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,380
- And then I look up at the guy that I just jumped--

601
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,220
- I was about to say that guy was like looking down

602
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,460
and like kind of regarding them in a freaked out way.

603
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,860
I look at him and I say, "I'm out for a kill, baby."

604
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,500
- The guy is like trying to find the button

605
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,620
under his desk now.

606
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,580
He's like frantically looking for it.

607
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,280
All right, we'll end your turn here.

608
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,240
We'll go to cam now, so.

609
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,640
Thumbs up.

610
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,980
- Yo.

611
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,620
- Pat, take off your headphones.

612
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,140
Okay, your headphones are in?

613
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,980
- Yeah.

614
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,220
- All right.

615
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,760
Yeah, I mean you saw that unfold in front of you over the last six or so seconds, so

616
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,500
So I mean or this is also concurrently happening. You know did you?

617
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,060
Did you chase him?

618
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,940
Did you go another way?

619
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,380
What'd you do?

620
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,940
well now that

621
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Pat's headphones are off. I will say I'm so dangerously low on HP that it's I know I was I was like

622
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,340
I know I was thinking about that when he hit you with the canary

623
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:50,220
Yeah, I have two very good items so I kind of am terrified so

624
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,180
Can he see me from where I am?

625
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,620
No, he would not be able to see you unless he like pokes his head out. Okay, I'm gonna use my last item

626
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,260
okay, and it's a

627
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,300
disguise kit and

628
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,220
I'm going to

629
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,080
Use it to disguise myself and

630
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:19,260
Yeah, any roles you do to make sure you're doing like a whisper role sure I'm gonna disguise myself as as Billy Eilish

631
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,900
Okay

632
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,820
You just do that that's what the disguise kit is for

633
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:34,640
No, yeah, normally I would have you do like a charisma roll or something but now this is the skies kit. He's just do it. Okay

634
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,300
So I'm just thinking so

635
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,380
What do you want to do and I'm gonna figure out well, I'll give you a separate token and I'll move that token

636
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,420
Yeah, I just want to walk into the bank

637
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:54,540
You just want to walk like I'm going to I'm going to open a checking account my first checking account. I just turned 18

638
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,580
Okay, cool, I'll guess finally time

639
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:08,920
All right, let me okay, let me get Billy Eilish in here that's a perfect that's a perfect

640
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:18,360
bait for Steven Seagal. Let me add her in here.

641
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:27,520
Let's pick one with her with one of her big-ass sweaters. Remember hip-hop sort of

642
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,760
looks. And one where she's rapping. Does she rap or just sing? She basically, she

643
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,360
She does, I don't think she raps.

644
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I don't think she does.

645
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,200
- Me neither.

646
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,880
- Wonder if this'll work.

647
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,440
I bet it's gonna be giant.

648
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,920
- It's gonna be pretty big.

649
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,220
- It's gonna be--

650
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,020
- It's gonna make Patrick's eyebrows raise.

651
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,600
- I'm gonna make it smaller,

652
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,380
but first it's gonna be pretty big.

653
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,440
- All right, let's see it.

654
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,000
- It's uploading.

655
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,160
- It's uploading.

656
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
it's uploading.

657
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Oh my god, it's giant!

658
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Okay, I'm seeing Patrick's middle.

659
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
It's so big, man.

660
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
You have to make it smaller.

661
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
He's gonna notice.

662
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
He's gonna notice it, man.

663
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
I'm making it smaller.

664
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
You gotta make it a lot smaller, man.

665
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Okay.

666
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
All right, your turn's over.

667
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Take off your headphones.

668
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Pat.

669
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

670
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Okay, I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

671
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

672
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

673
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

674
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

675
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

676
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

677
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm gonna make it a lot smaller.

678
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,960
smaller. Okay. All right. Your turn's over. Take off your headphones.

679
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,200
Pat.

680
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:41,520
Okay. What's up? What happened? I don't, I can't tell you what happened.

681
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,360
You're still in the bank. You have these Cal trips. There's no sign of,

682
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,120
I'm going to roll persuasion and you will tell me what happened. Okay.

683
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,800
Seven. Hmm. It's not going to work. Um, uh,

684
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,520
Yeah, you don't see like any sign of Cam following you through the windows.

685
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Okay.

686
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
Because he has invisibility.

687
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
He does.

688
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Uh huh.

689
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
So, with...

690
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Well you heard him talk about that, but yeah.

691
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,560
Yeah, I heard him say that.

692
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,880
And I know, okay.

693
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,480
Can I roll perception to see...

694
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:18,440
Roll persuade, I'm gonna roll persuasion again to ask the guy in the, is the guy in the room

695
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
still there?

696
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
Yeah, you can just, what are you gonna ask him?

697
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Just ask him it.

698
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,220
Did you see Cameron Fetter walking in here?

699
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:25,720
*Chuckles*

700
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,720
My immortal enemy, Cameron Fetter.

701
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
No, no.

702
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
I've seen Cameron Fetter on a bayou.

703
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I haven't- *Chuckles*

704
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I haven't seen anyone walk in here except you just crashing through my window.

705
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
I can sense your nervous behavior.

706
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,720
And what I'm gonna do is put you in a stranglehold until you tell me what I wanna hear.

707
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
*Chuckles* Okay.

708
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:56,160
So I'm trying to put this guy in a full roll roll an attack roll. Okay, there's strength check. He has a grapple what you're doing

709
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:04,480
I mean, I guess it's a contest. So he has to try to resist

710
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,920
Oh

711
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,680
My god, he got a -

712
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,680
Full Nelson in the web like he can escape, but he's just scared. Yeah, he's like, please stop. He's just like

713
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, yeah

714
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,480
What are you doing

715
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,860
You know what I'm doing. I was born to raise hell. I don't know anything about Cameron

716
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:38,720
I can go I'll go get somebody who can help you. Maybe you're about to be submerged. Please. Let me go

717
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,840
You're gonna be submerged in my body. Don't put me in your butt sir. I'll help you

718
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,680
Tell me did you see a guy come in here who may have had invisibility powers? No. I didn't see anything like that

719
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,360
Okay, I've decided to trust you you're checking your savings

720
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,680
I've decided to trust you okay. Do you let him go?

721
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,400
Now give me the bank tellers cell phone number

722
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,600
The woman give me a cell phone number

723
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,320
Air drop it. Ashley, you can't air drop it.

724
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,120
I have a different kind of phone.

725
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,120
I'll look at the directory I guess. Just hold on.

726
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,320
And then give me your clothes too.

727
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,800
Meanwhile, the security guard is now at the door.

728
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Is everything alright in there?

729
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Everything is fine in here.

730
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Wait, I think I'm starting to piece together what Cameron did.

731
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,360
Who's that?

732
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Can I ask you what I think Cameron did?

733
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,320
Yeah, I'm not going to tell you though.

734
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,680
Okay, I think that he disguised himself as Billie Eilish.

735
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm not going to tell you what happened.

736
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
He did, didn't he?

737
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm not going to tell you even if he did it.

738
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,840
Alright, okay, okay, okay.

739
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,600
I'm going to pick up the guy, right?

740
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Okay.

741
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,920
(laughing)

742
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,360
- I pick him up and tell him to tell the security guard

743
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,560
that, to tell him that everything's fine in here,

744
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,720
but it's a glass wall.

745
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,980
(laughing)

746
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:24,600
So can I roll to see, can I roll to see if...

747
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,040
- Security guard's gonna bust in here.

748
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,760
- Yeah, the security guard, it's a glass wall,

749
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,800
but I wanna roll to see if the security guard

750
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,200
doesn't like do anything.

751
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,040
- He's gonna, he's gonna do something.

752
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,440
- 'Cause he can see everything.

753
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
He can see everything.

754
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,780
- If you touch this guy right now,

755
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,880
he is gonna do something.

756
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,120
You cannot roll your way around that.

757
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,040
If you are touching a man who is employed at the bank,

758
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
the security guard is going to come in

759
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,760
and apprehend you or worse.

760
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,220
- Then can I shut the blind?

761
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,360
- While he's standing outside the window.

762
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,140
- Everything's fine.

763
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,580
- Everything's fine.

764
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,600
We're just about to make out.

765
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,840
(laughing)

766
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,620
- Okay, roll deception with disadvantage.

767
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:22,980
Okay, security guard is coming in to apprehend you.

768
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,860
You're in the middle of shutting the blinds

769
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
and he's just opening the door.

770
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,060
Okay.

771
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,100
- He's gonna try to attack you.

772
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,940
- Okay.

773
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,620
I look at him and I say,

774
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,900
you don't wanna do this man.

775
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,420
You're out of reach.

776
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,380
I'm gonna throw you into the sun.

777
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,420
- Okay, that hits for sure.

778
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,360
- Oh no.

779
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:50,280
- Oh shit.

780
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,180
- How bad?

781
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,620
- Not that bad, he's just a security guard.

782
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
- Okay.

783
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,500
- He's whacking you with a baton.

784
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,900
He does four damage to you.

785
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,580
- I have two HP.

786
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,420
- Okay.

787
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
(laughing)

788
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,100
Okay.

789
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,900
You still have a chance, you have no more items left.

790
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,900
Mm-hmm.

791
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,260
But I do have my short bow.

792
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,940
You can attack him back.

793
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,260
I'm gonna shoot him with my short bow.

794
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,300
I'll let you do that, I'll let you do that, yeah.

795
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,860
How do I roll that?

796
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,060
Even though I kind of skipped you there.

797
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,100
Probably should have rolled for initiative there, that's fine though.

798
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,740
Oh, just roll 1d20 and add your dex.

799
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,900
I mean, if it's not on your character sheet.

800
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,300
You should be able to just hit it on your character sheet.

801
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,580
(laughing)

802
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,420
Not that.

803
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,360
- All it did was--

804
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
- No, do not.

805
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,140
Open your character sheet and hit short bow.

806
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,960
- Yeah, I did that.

807
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,720
- No, in the middle.

808
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,600
In the middle.

809
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,780
In the middle of the character.

810
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,620
- Oh, there we go.

811
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,460
- Your attacks.

812
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,780
- Okay, I got a 10.

813
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,100
- Okay, that, and it's also with disadvantage

814
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,700
'cause you are right next to him.

815
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,540
- Are you kidding me?

816
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,380
- Okay, yeah.

817
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,340
- I got a crit 20.

818
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,900
- No, this guy, this guy does not--

819
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,380
- I got a 22.

820
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,940
- You take out your bow and you just sort of shoot it

821
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,340
at the ground around his feet.

822
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,300
Okay, I'm gonna take off your headphones.

823
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,500
Your turn is done.

824
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,820
It's a crazy turn.

825
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,660
(laughing)

826
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,460
Okay, okay, Cam.

827
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,100
- I don't like seeing that pop up.

828
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,940
- Okay, yeah.

829
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,460
- I don't like seeing the word shortbow with a 22 pop up.

830
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,860
- It's okay.

831
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,140
You as Billy Eilish just hear a lot of commotion.

832
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,580
You see a Steven Seagal-like figure.

833
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,900
You see a security guard go to a place and say,

834
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,580
go to a bank teller's window area

835
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,200
'cause it's perfectly clear glass.

836
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,300
You see Steven Seagal put a guy in a full Nelson.

837
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,820
Then you see a security guard come over

838
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,060
and say, what's going on in there?

839
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,020
But you see Steven Seagal trying to close the blinds.

840
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,780
And then you see that security guard go in there

841
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,860
and start hitting Steven Seagal with a baton.

842
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,620
We see Steven Seagal take out a crossbow and miss

843
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,900
from point blank range.

844
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,620
So that's what happened.

845
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,220
You see all that as Billie Eilish.

846
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,060
- Yeah.

847
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,900
- So what do you--

848
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,340
- Is there another security guard around?

849
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,020
- There are--

850
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,940
- Are they armed?

851
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,180
With guns?

852
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,580
- They just have batons.

853
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,060
- Is there anybody with a gun in the vicinity?

854
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,220
What state does this take place in?

855
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,900
I mean, nobody has a gun right now, I will tell you.

856
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,740
Well, I should correct that.

857
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,980
- What's the deadliest weapon I can see?

858
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,520
- There is a security guard with a gun by the vault.

859
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,360
- Where's the vault at?

860
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,600
It's up in this top right corner?

861
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,440
- Yeah, top right.

862
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,020
- That's kind of far away.

863
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,860
Okay, I'm gonna waltz over there.

864
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,940
- Okay, how are you going?

865
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,620
So, what do you mean waltz over to the bank?

866
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,220
- Just walk up to it with no trouble.

867
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,500
- Come on, come on.

868
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,460
What you saying?

869
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,960
- Yo.

870
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,100
I'm Billy Eilish.

871
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,420
So you're going up to the bank in this case.

872
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,900
Yeah.

873
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,980
I am researching my new album.

874
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,420
That's about depression and all types of dark thoughts.

875
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,540
And I need to have a gun.

876
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,260
Okay.

877
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,940
Roll persuasion to write my album.

878
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,980
Uh, is this on whisper?

879
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,380
Yeah.

880
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,140
18.

881
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,780
Okay.

882
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,100
Yeah.

883
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,500
Fuck it.

884
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,060
why not? Yeah, the bank, I mean, Pat's gonna die. The bank teller is like, "Sure, I love

885
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,540
Billie Eilish's music." And yeah, you get to go in-

886
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
You mean my music?

887
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Mm-hmm. You get to go into-

888
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't know why you said it like that. It's me, Billie Eilish.

889
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,100
And you get to go into the vault.

890
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,180
Well, I don't need to be in the vault. I just need to go-

891
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,820
Okay, she goes back and then-

892
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,940
I go, "Yo, wait." I go, "Yo, wait, wait, wait. There's no need to let me into the vault.

893
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,140
I don't want to compromise the security of your operation. I just really-

894
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,700
- You're so conscientious.

895
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,340
And so, she goes back, talks to the security guard,

896
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,180
and then she comes back to you and hands you the gun.

897
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,420
- Okay, I tuck it into my whatever type of pants

898
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,660
Billie Eilish wears.

899
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,180
- Yeah, you don't know enough about that.

900
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,780
- It's the perfect concealed carry,

901
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,500
giant puffy Michelin man t-shirt.

902
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,340
Impossible to tell I have a gun,

903
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,140
and I say, I'll be right back, I'm gonna hit the stew.

904
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,700
- Okay, cool.

905
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,540
- Cool.

906
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,620
- And I start to walk over to Steven Seagal.

907
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,460
- Okay.

908
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,280
- But I'm kind of trying to act

909
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,340
like I'm not walking that direct,

910
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,620
like I guess I'm not really walking directly towards there.

911
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,460
- Just show me where you're--

912
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,580
- I'm just walking back towards the exit.

913
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,700
- Okay.

914
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,440
So you're like here now?

915
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,740
- Yeah, I wanna get as close to Steven Seagal as possible

916
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,980
without making it look like I'm beelining.

917
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,260
- Okay, I mean you didn't really do any,

918
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,820
I mean all you did was persuade,

919
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,980
so you have your dash action still.

920
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,700
- Okay, so yeah, I'll dash.

921
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,940
(laughing)

922
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,620
(laughing)

923
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,780
- How far can I dash?

924
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,380
- Well, let's see, you were here,

925
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,640
and then you went here,

926
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,020
and now you'd be going another,

927
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,740
you have like 40 more feet.

928
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,180
So you could go--

929
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,260
- Where's the window?

930
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
- Like you can go up to,

931
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,100
you could go up to, wow,

932
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,340
you could go up to like,

933
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,780
like here.

934
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,180
- Okay, I'll go like right here.

935
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,220
- 'Cause yeah, you're gonna want some distance too.

936
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,340
- Yeah, yeah, I wanna be right here.

937
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,620
I mean Billy Eilish does.

938
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Alright, move yourself.

939
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,220
Oh, I have to move you, right, it's really...

940
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Okay, cool.

941
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,900
Alright, and that's what I got.

942
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
That's the end of your turn.

943
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Okay, cool.

944
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Alright.

945
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Pat.

946
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Pat.

947
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Pat.

948
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
This is a nightmare.

949
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,900
Pat.

950
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
What is he looking at?

951
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,900
He's definitely...

952
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,900
He's in full Suica mode.

953
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,900
nightmare.

954
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,220
Pat.

955
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,460
What is he looking at?

956
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,980
He's definitely, he's

957
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,500
in full Suica mode.

958
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,700
Yo.

959
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,140
Yo.

960
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,900
OK.

961
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,340
You're in the midst of a fight.

962
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,060
Yeah. And OK,

963
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,300
the Billie Eilish moved closer.

964
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,660
There's no way that that's not

965
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,980
Cameron. Also,

966
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,860
I saw

967
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,220
Like this, my screen was still open.

968
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,980
I saw it moving.

969
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,560
I couldn't hear, but I saw it moving.

970
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,260
I think that's a huge oversight.

971
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,180
- No, I think it's fair.

972
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
You have a glass window.

973
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,620
He saw all the stuff you were doing in there.

974
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,460
- That's true.

975
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,740
- Yeah, you saw her go to the bank teller.

976
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,580
You saw the teller go to the back, go back up to her.

977
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,940
And then you saw her move over here.

978
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,020
- Okay.

979
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,500
I'm realizing that this is a zero sum game.

980
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,860
- In what way?

981
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,540
There's no way that I'm going to win.

982
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,100
- Well, some of the stuff you did

983
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,180
put yourself in that position.

984
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,180
- Yeah, and that's because I was not embodying white spy.

985
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,060
- You're embodying yourself.

986
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,060
- And I kind of went into this with the Seagal mindset.

987
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,380
- Yeah.

988
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:58,580
Which is just being kind of a crazy raper.

989
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,420
- Yeah.

990
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,500
Basically a big piece of shit.

991
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,700
- So what's your plan?

992
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,540
- Which one?

993
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,220
- Can I use the umbrella again or no?

994
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,520
- No, I think next time I'll have you guys

995
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,820
use items more than once, depending on the item.

996
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,280
You also use, did you use all three of your caltrops?

997
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,120
Groups of, like your--

998
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,100
- I used two, or one.

999
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,480
I have two.

1000
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,740
- So you have two others.

1001
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,420
So that is true too.

1002
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,340
So you can use an item,

1003
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,200
and I think I originally did it

1004
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,660
where it's like you can use an item and a tag.

1005
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,740
- Can I roll persuasion

1006
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,500
and just tell the guy to stop hitting me?

1007
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,180
yeah for sure

1008
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,620
listen man

1009
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,340
you gotta stop hitting me alright

1010
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,160
i have an attack force that

1011
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,020
you couldn't even believe

1012
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,100
they call me the shadow man

1013
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,580
okay i'm a

1014
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,220
they call me my giant

1015
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,400
they call me the glimmer man

1016
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,260
and i'm out for a kill

1017
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
because i used to be the foreigner

1018
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,340
stop

1019
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,480
And but now I'm the keeper.

1020
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,320
- All right, roll.

1021
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,980
- Before I hit you with this machete

1022
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,740
(laughing)

1023
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,780
and send you to absolution.

1024
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,100
- Was he in Machete?

1025
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,940
- Yeah.

1026
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,620
- That's awesome.

1027
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,460
Yeah, I mean roll it with the T-80.

1028
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,860
- And you're gonna get pistol whipped.

1029
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,820
(laughing)

1030
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,020
If you don't stop.

1031
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
- Roll intimidation.

1032
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,900
- Is it the movie called Pistol Whipped?

1033
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,100
(laughing)

1034
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,300
- Roll intimidation with disadvantage.

1035
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,540
That is a crazy movie name.

1036
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,740
- Intimidation?

1037
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,060
- Yeah, with disadvantage.

1038
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,800
'cause we established that up top.

1039
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,660
All right. - 15 and eight.

1040
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,820
- I mean, he is just, like, this man is mostly brain dead.

1041
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,180
I need to just get him outta here.

1042
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,740
So he's gonna try to grapple you.

1043
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,180
- What if, what if I, what if,

1044
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,980
in a Hail Mary attempt,

1045
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,120
I convince him to throw me out the window again?

1046
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,020
- I will let you try to do that.

1047
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,060
- Okay. - This'll be your last try.

1048
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,900
- Okay.

1049
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,780
- What do you say?

1050
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,820
- You better throw me out of this,

1051
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,780
you better throw me out of that window

1052
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,980
'cause I'm gonna hit you with the force of execution

1053
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,980
so hard with the perfect weapon

1054
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,660
that the last thing you'll see is the end of a gun,

1055
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,900
you China salesman.

1056
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,340
- Okay, let's make this a China salesman.

1057
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,340
I like that you're just-

1058
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:36,340
'Cause I was born to raise hell, and you're gonna get some urban justice!

1059
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,340
Today you die!

1060
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I like the idea of this being reverse psychology so there's no more disadvantage.

1061
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
Uh-huh.

1062
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,340
So just roll regular persuasion.

1063
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
Whoa!

1064
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
Holy shit!

1065
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:53,340
[Laughter]

1066
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
You gotta crit, folks. Okay.

1067
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
[Laughter]

1068
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,540
This guy says, "Man, you're hard to kill,"

1069
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,460
and throws you out the window.

1070
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,100
You crash- - No, no, no, the other way.

1071
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,020
- Oh, the other way?

1072
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,380
Okay, yeah. - Onto the street.

1073
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,800
- He throws you out the window onto the street.

1074
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,580
There is no camera in there.

1075
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,620
- I know, I knew it.

1076
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,860
- You're correct about that.

1077
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm just gonna move his icon over to this side.

1078
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,580
But you're back outside.

1079
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,780
What do you wanna do? - Do I have a move now?

1080
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Uh, you can still move, you can still--

1081
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Okay, guess what I'm gonna do.

1082
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
What?

1083
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
Oh, I guess--

1084
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
You-- you have-- I will say--

1085
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,780
I can move, but I can't do another Aikido roll, huh?

1086
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Uhhh, you can either-- so here's-- you can either--

1087
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
I'll just-- I'll just walk 30 feet.

1088
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,780
Here's the thing, you have-- you have a clear line of sight to cam.

1089
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,780
Yeah. I'm gonna walk 30 feet, though, 'cause I want to-- I want to confuse him, so I'm gonna go here.

1090
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Okay, cool.

1091
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,780
To this tile that's 30 feet away.

1092
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,700
- Okay, cool.

1093
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,940
Move on over there.

1094
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,780
- Okay.

1095
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,460
- And that's not by the window pane,

1096
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,300
so you'd be out of the like, sight of that.

1097
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,140
- Yeah.

1098
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,960
- Okay, cool.

1099
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,340
All right, take off your headphones.

1100
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,860
- Okay.

1101
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,060
- You heard him babbling, vaguely.

1102
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,360
- I heard him babbling?

1103
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,160
- Yeah, I mean you saw the security guard

1104
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,300
throw him out the window.

1105
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,220
- Okay.

1106
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,980
And then you saw him walk off to his right.

1107
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,860
If he were facing you.

1108
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,100
Okay.

1109
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,340
Well, I'm just going to keep going out the exit.

1110
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:40,340
Okay.

1111
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:46,260
Um, yeah, I can't control myself, but I'm just going to try to leave the bank as if

1112
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,980
I'm Billy Eilish leaving the bank.

1113
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,620
Okay.

1114
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,780
Do you want to go straight towards out of the exit then?

1115
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,460
Okay, so it's 30 feet here.

1116
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,460
Okay.

1117
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Mm-hmm.

1118
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Um...

1119
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,460
And I can't see him from where I am right now?

1120
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,460
No.

1121
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,460
Let me then do a secret roll to you

1122
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,460
of my cloaking device and see if I can get that off.

1123
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,460
Got it.

1124
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
But I'm not too pressed about it.

1125
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460
How do I do that?

1126
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,460
How do I roll a secret...

1127
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,460
Whisper? I think it's...

1128
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,460
Oh, God, what is Whisper Roll?

1129
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:26,460
I remember or as in guess it doesn't matter I have googled it before oh yeah

1130
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,140
it's just slash W slash W followed by the player name you want to whisper why you

1131
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,140
want to whisper to us the player name whatever man I'm just gonna - whisper

1132
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,300
just space GM I'm gonna roll a plus zero athletics roll to you okay I can do that

1133
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,800
That's fine.

1134
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,300
That's fine.

1135
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,300
That's a 17.

1136
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Okay.

1137
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,300
Yeah, that succeeds.

1138
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:54,300
So, he basically sees you still here then, really.

1139
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,300
Okay.

1140
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:00,300
Or did he saw you walk off and then, so you're gone and then now you're there, but you're invisible.

1141
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,300
Okay, cool.

1142
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,300
And I can't move anymore?

1143
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,300
No, that was, no, I actually decided that the items are like their own separate action.

1144
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,300
I just did that with Pat, so.

1145
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
so.

1146
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,540
All right. I'll go outside then.

1147
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,540
OK, cool. Where do you want to go?

1148
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,980
Just just tell me where you're.

1149
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,340
Actually, no, I I'm not sure because I

1150
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,440
don't want the door to look like it's

1151
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,820
opening on its own now that I think

1152
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:24,220
about it.

1153
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,940
Yeah. He would get a chance to

1154
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,540
perceive that.

1155
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,020
Yeah.

1156
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:34,180
I will just kind of stand right

1157
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,040
next to the door, my invisible body

1158
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,060
right next to the door.

1159
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,380
I guess.

1160
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,380
Got you. All right.

1161
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:42,280
Or even, you know what, here I'm gonna play 4D chess,

1162
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,080
watch this, I'm going to open the door and close it

1163
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,880
invisibly without going out.

1164
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,440
- I do love that, okay cool.

1165
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,520
- All right, that's what I'm gonna do.

1166
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,880
- Yeah, all right, take off your headphones.

1167
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,720
- Okay.

1168
00:47:52,720 --> 00:48:01,720
- Okay, Pat, you see the door open and close,

1169
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:07,080
but you don't see anybody do anything.

1170
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,780
- He's invisible.

1171
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,720
I know that he's invisible,

1172
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,940
so I'm gonna do another Aikido roll.

1173
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,460
- An invisible Billy Eilish?

1174
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,180
- Yes, I can sense an invisible Billy Eilish

1175
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,660
with my Aikido training.

1176
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,900
Okay.

1177
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,900
- You do another Aikido roll.

1178
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,640
- I want to do an Aikido roll into this room.

1179
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,500
It will be 15 feet.

1180
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,420
- Athletics or acrobatics check.

1181
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,460
Okay.

1182
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,520
- Oh, 12.

1183
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,060
- It's good enough.

1184
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,300
It's just much messier,

1185
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,060
but you still crash through another bank teller's room.

1186
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,020
You just crash through it.

1187
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,460
And they're like, "Oh, say, what's going on here?"

1188
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,620
- Look, I'm gonna level with you.

1189
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,860
I'm drunk.

1190
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,940
- You hear a security guard.

1191
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,780
(laughing)

1192
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,580
You hear a security guard walk out of that room

1193
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,080
and start sprinting towards you in the other room.

1194
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,360
You heard a crash.

1195
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,200
(laughing)

1196
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,160
It's like, not again.

1197
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,360
- This is the worst character I've ever played.

1198
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,960
(laughing)

1199
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,120
I just can't keep, I can't keep myself from fucking up.

1200
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,360
(laughing)

1201
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:34,280
- You're having too much fun.

1202
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,280
It's just, it's like no, zero good roles.

1203
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,060
(laughing)

1204
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,520
It's the worst.

1205
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,520
Zero good decisions.

1206
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,080
There's not been a single smart thing done.

1207
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,920
(laughing)

1208
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,500
You just began it by sexually harassing a woman.

1209
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,060
(laughing)

1210
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,560
I'm really embodying Steven Seagal.

1211
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,640
Yeah, you're doing a great job.

1212
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,320
I'm doing such a, I think the next campaign,

1213
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,240
I think I should just be Steven Seagal.

1214
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,800
You should, I think you'd be great.

1215
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,800
I think this is the intro of the perfect character.

1216
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,800
I love that.

1217
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,800
I like the idea of us testing that out here.

1218
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Beta testing.

1219
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Your perfect character.

1220
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:19,800
The most horrible character in all of D&D.

1221
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Fucking rocks.

1222
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,800
Alright.

1223
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Alright, so the security guard comes in and shoots me.

1224
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,400
(laughing)

1225
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,480
- We might have to do a mercy kill, but not yet.

1226
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,360
He doesn't have enough movement yet.

1227
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,280
So he's just in the room.

1228
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,280
So take off your headphones.

1229
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,240
- This has a glass wall as well?

1230
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,520
- Yes, it does, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,820
- I can't hide under the desk?

1232
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,960
- No, I mean, it's open.

1233
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,880
Oh, well, yeah, you can hide under the desk if you want to.

1234
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,040
- I'm gonna try.

1235
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,520
- All right, so before he gets there,

1236
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,400
then roll a stealth roll, yeah.

1237
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,240
- 16.

1238
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,740
- Nice, you are able to hide in a,

1239
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,180
I mean, I'll roll actually, I guess, inside for him,

1240
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,080
but he's not gonna, he's probably not gonna pick up on it.

1241
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:17,980
Yeah, no, he just barely is not able to though,

1242
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,820
that was pretty close.

1243
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,800
He was going for 14. - Oh, hell yeah.

1244
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,620
- So he walks over there and does not see you in there,

1245
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,980
but he does see the like broken glass

1246
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,220
of the window in there.

1247
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,460
- I hold the crossbow, I'm under the desk with my crossbow up

1248
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,020
at this bank teller's nutsack.

1249
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,580
- Oh, please, don't!

1250
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,640
- I say to him, I say,

1251
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:41,740
I'm a dangerous man.

1252
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,660
And I've been driven to kill.

1253
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,780
If you tell that security guard that I'm in here,

1254
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,220
you're gonna get a gut shot straight to the gut.

1255
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,340
Security guard walks in and goes,

1256
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,740
I know you're in here, where are you?

1257
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,340
Oh, he's not here, he's not here at all.

1258
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,520
He's like, you don't have to be afraid,

1259
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,220
just tell me where he is.

1260
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:14,140
He just left actually, he went outside.

1261
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,140
And we're gonna roll a deception for that guy

1262
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,260
against the security guard's knowledge of what's going on.

1263
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,540
That guy got a 20 on deception, nat 20.

1264
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,700
So unless the security guards,

1265
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,420
insight check, is that good?

1266
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:34,300
Nope.

1267
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,780
He then goes, all right, just stay put.

1268
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,120
And he walks outside.

1269
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,300
He walks outside to go there.

1270
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,580
He's using the rest of his dash action.

1271
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:47,740
So he is now gonna look for you outside.

1272
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,700
You are now under this guy's desk,

1273
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,100
safe with the crossbow pointed to his belly.

1274
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,920
And we'll end your turn there. Take off your headphones.

1275
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,420
Okay.

1276
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,420
Very nicely done. Okay.

1277
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,920
That's right.

1278
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Yo.

1279
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Yo. I don't know how we're gonna get to all the other maps.

1280
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Probably have to time for do one more map.

1281
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,920
This has been a good one.

1282
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Well, is this over?

1283
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,920
No, it's just, it's not somehow.

1284
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,920
He somehow avoided dying just now.

1285
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,920
I won't get into the details, but anyway.

1286
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,920
You just heard another crash through another window.

1287
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,420
Okay, that's all you heard.

1288
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,320
But you're still in the ATM area, invisible.

1289
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,680
Okay, I'm not trying to metagame,

1290
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,040
but based on hearing another crash,

1291
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,140
I'm gonna assume that he went back inside.

1292
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,360
It's not metagaming, that's like what you heard

1293
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,000
and what you've seen him do already.

1294
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,400
Right, but the reason I say that

1295
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,480
is 'cause I can see his tile inside.

1296
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,540
Oh yeah, that's fair.

1297
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,880
So I think I will invisibly go back into the bank

1298
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,600
and scout around and try and see if I can see him.

1299
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,680
I really, at this point, I have one,

1300
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,040
my only thing I'm ever gonna do on a turn from now on

1301
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,840
is just try to get close enough to shoot him in the head.

1302
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,640
- Okay. (laughs)

1303
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,880
- I have no more items left.

1304
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,640
I have two HP.

1305
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,680
I am a teenage pop star on a mission.

1306
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,520
- Okay.

1307
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,920
On your next turn, we're gonna roll again

1308
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,440
to see if you stay invisible.

1309
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,040
- Okay. - Okay, cool.

1310
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,800
So you're just in the bank generally.

1311
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,400
I'm gonna like say that you are,

1312
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,320
I mean I know there's another way to do this,

1313
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,720
but I hate it, so, but like I know where you are generally.

1314
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,440
We'll get there. - Sure.

1315
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,360
- We'll get there, okay cool.

1316
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,000
All right, take him off.

1317
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,500
- Okay, or should I roll perception

1318
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,200
to see if I can see where he is?

1319
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,120
Does that matter?

1320
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,480
- You can roll, you can roll perception.

1321
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,760
Let's roll perception to see if you got

1322
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,720
sense of like of where he is right now. Yeah. Um yeah I mean that would only be

1323
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,880
to confirm what you're already metagaming I would say. Okay all right.

1324
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,040
That's like the most information you'd get out of it. Yeah. Okay. Okay cool. All

1325
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:14,840
right. Take off your headphones. Maybe text Pat. Pat. Pat. Pat. Pat. Oh he's so

1326
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:21,480
close he's almost his eyes are almost up

1327
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:29,240
folks at home Pat I think saw a stain on his shirt and so he's just trying to rub

1328
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:42,680
it out he's definitely not texting someone or looking up his information

1329
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,360
- Looking. - Musical movies.

1330
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,000
- Yep, nope.

1331
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,400
If you want me to be completely honest.

1332
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,480
- Yeah, for the viewers at home, yeah.

1333
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,480
- I was watching videos of what different basses sound like

1334
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,200
when you play slap bass.

1335
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,040
- Well. - I thought that

1336
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,300
I had more time.

1337
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,360
- No, that's fair, his term was short.

1338
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,660
You don't notice anything has happened, really.

1339
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:08,200
- Shit, that's not good.

1340
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,220
but the Billie Eilish is still at the door.

1341
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,100
Okay, so I'm still under the desk

1342
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,740
and the guy is still in the room.

1343
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:22,020
- Yeah, you're cross-boded.

1344
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,940
- So I look at him and I say,

1345
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,420
my man, you need to take off all your clothes

1346
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,260
and then you need to give me your clothes

1347
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,980
and then you need to dress up in my clothes.

1348
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:42,140
And then, so, and then you wear,

1349
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:48,540
and can I have, and then you wear my clothes.

1350
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,740
- Okay.

1351
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,860
- He nods like, like--

1352
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,460
- We're gonna change clothes.

1353
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,660
- Yeah, he nods, and you guys do this.

1354
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,460
You guys do change clothes.

1355
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,300
- Okay.

1356
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,500
- All right, what do you wanna do?

1357
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,260
- So now I look like a bank teller, huh?

1358
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,860
I mean, you look like Steven Seagal as a bank teller.

1359
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,860
- Yeah, the shirt's a size...

1360
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,860
It's like a size 14, 30 dress shirt.

1361
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,260
Does not fit me.

1362
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,100
- No.

1363
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,740
- I'm wearing size, they're size like 28, 36 pants.

1364
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,140
- You look like you're dressed up as a slutty school girl.

1365
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,660
- Yeah, pretty much.

1366
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,840
- Yeah.

1367
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,680
- All right.

1368
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,320
I'm just, I'm gonna walk on out of here

1369
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,080
Like a normal bank teller.

1370
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,800
And no one's gonna even know

1371
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,480
that I'm gonna go into this bathroom, which is...

1372
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,160
Wait, hold on.

1373
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,360
How do you do the, oh yeah, there we go.

1374
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,320
I'm gonna take my 30 feet of movement

1375
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,860
to go into this bathroom.

1376
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,080
Okay.

1377
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,900
So I'm gonna do that.

1378
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,740
So I'm gonna take, yeah,

1379
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,100
I'm gonna use all my movement points

1380
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,800
to just go into the bathroom.

1381
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,640
- All right, cool.

1382
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,800
Well, not you, the bank teller really.

1383
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,880
Okay. - Yeah.

1384
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,800
- Hold on.

1385
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,000
Don't take off your headphones.

1386
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
- Me? - Yeah, don't take 'em off.

1387
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,400
- Okay. - Okay.

1388
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,920
- All right. - Cam, I'm having Pat

1389
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,800
keep his headphones on for a second.

1390
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,000
Roll perception, Cam.

1391
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,840
- Okay.

1392
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,040
A crit one.

1393
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,880
- Okay.

1394
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,980
Take off your headphones, Cam.

1395
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:43,440
I don't know how you did it,

1396
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,960
but he thinks that's just a regular bank teller.

1397
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,600
(laughing)

1398
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,880
Walking into the bathroom.

1399
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,360
So that does happen.

1400
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,400
But he does see that coming out of there.

1401
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,040
- Who does?

1402
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,280
- He sees a bank teller coming out of the,

1403
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:10,280
that room. Okay. Which is you. And now you're in the bathroom. Okay. Okay. What do you want to do in there?

1404
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:17,260
Is there tile ceiling in there? Sure, yeah. Okay. I'm open to it. I'm gonna go

1405
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,800
Breakfast Club. Okay. Yeah? Yeah. Alright. John Bender and Breakfast Club. I'm gonna

1406
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:31,240
do that. Yeah. Roll athletics to jump up there. Or acrobatics. Whichever one.

1407
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:38,440
13 okay yeah you're able to climb in there into the vent okay okay

1408
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:52,200
tick off your headphones okay okay yeah you don't notice anything in particular

1409
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:04,560
to

1410
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,920
- Ooh, then what do I do?

1411
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,620
I'm still looking for him.

1412
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,220
- Yeah, roll a d20 first.

1413
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,180
- Oh, true.

1414
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,020
- We'll see.

1415
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,500
- 10.

1416
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,260
- Okay, yeah, you survive.

1417
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,100
- Woo!

1418
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:24,180
So I'm still just looking for him.

1419
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,420
I mean, since I didn't try to do a perception last time,

1420
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,100
I guess I don't know where he is.

1421
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,740
- Yeah, I mean, you can try to see

1422
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,260
like which of the offices you thought he came into

1423
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,220
or whatever. They're all glass windows, so you can just peek in.

1424
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:40,900
Yeah. I'm still just looking for him.

1425
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:44,100
You also see this security guard run outside too.

1426
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,340
As well.

1427
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:50,740
Okay, I don't...

1428
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,940
That seemed to start happening before you came in though.

1429
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,740
Yeah, I also feel like if the security guard is going outside,

1430
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:03,380
maybe Steven Seagal is just going inside and outside over and over.

1431
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:08,780
I'm not gonna do that.

1432
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,580
So I'm just gonna go look into all the offices and see if I can figure out where he is.

1433
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Okay.

1434
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,580
Check the first office.

1435
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:18,620
Check the first office, you don't see him in there.

1436
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:21,860
Second office, you don't see him in there.

1437
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,860
Third office.

1438
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,780
Pat, get that shit off the fucking screen.

1439
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,220
Alright, roll...

1440
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:42,380
insight. Okay. 19. You see a very scared bank teller dressed as Steven Seagal in the third

1441
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:49,960
office. Okay, can I walk up to the bank teller? Yeah, you can walk into the office. Okay,

1442
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,360
and do I still have an action for my gun? Okay, can I tell Pat to put his headphones

1443
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:02,180
on and narrate what I'm gonna do? Absolutely, you can. Can I narrate it? Of course you can.

1444
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:13,580
Pet. Yeah. You see none other than one of the most beautiful celebrities in the world,

1445
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:20,260
Billie Eilish, walk up to you and she smiles at you.

1446
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,100
- Mm-hmm.

1447
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:25,920
- You know it's a scared bank teller

1448
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,820
dressed as Steven Seagal.

1449
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,460
- Fucker!

1450
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,300
- Okay.

1451
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,140
Then what do I, then nothing happens.

1452
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,100
- Unless you--

1453
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,900
- Then I still believe it's Steven Seagal.

1454
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,860
- Despite knowing that,

1455
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,580
unless despite knowing that,

1456
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,300
you do what I think you're gonna do.

1457
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,740
- I thought the other way around.

1458
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,860
- No, no, no. - Yeah.

1459
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:52,300
- Well, I still do what I do then.

1460
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,140
- Yeah.

1461
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:53,960
- I'm gonna shoot this person in the head.

1462
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,460
- Okay. - With my gun.

1463
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,720
(laughing)

1464
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,580
- Yeah, so--

1465
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,140
- Which that's gonna alarm security, right?

1466
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,260
'Cause there's a gun. - Oh yeah.

1467
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,300
Oh yeah.

1468
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,880
- Oh, it's Billy Eilish.

1469
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,340
- You hear a gun go off.

1470
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,180
Security guard's like, "Fuckin' A."

1471
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:10,440
And just starts running back inside.

1472
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,140
- Okay.

1473
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,180
- But he's not there yet.

1474
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,440
Your turn's done.

1475
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,020
Take your headphones off.

1476
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,860
Wait, I'm also still invisible.

1477
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,100
Yes, you are still invisible.

1478
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,660
Okay, so nothing of what I said made any sense.

1479
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,740
Yeah, I thought you knew what was happening

1480
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,580
and you wanted to tell him

1481
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,400
that you were about to kill him.

1482
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,380
No, I completely, I thought the opposite of what you said.

1483
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,900
You said a bank teller dressed as Steven Seagal

1484
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,620
and my brain heard Steven Seagal dressed as a bank teller.

1485
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:39,340
No, no, it was the other thing.

1486
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,460
All right, take him off.

1487
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,420
That's that, I guess.

1488
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,740
Okay, Pat.

1489
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,860
So, yeah, you hear a gun go off

1490
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,620
but just you're like, you hear a gun go off,

1491
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:52,860
you hear people screaming, you're in the vents.

1492
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,220
- He must've been killing Salazar

1493
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,380
because of the Onion movie.

1494
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,980
- Okay.

1495
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,500
All right, so what do you wanna do?

1496
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,220
You're in the vents right now.

1497
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:10,260
- I'm just gonna crawl until,

1498
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,260
yeah, I guess I'll just use all my movement to crawl.

1499
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,140
- Yeah, roll, where are you trying to crawl to,

1500
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:15,980
I should say?

1501
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:16,980
Um.

1502
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:22,300
The break room, no, no, no, no, no.

1503
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,820
I think I'm going to crawl.

1504
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:30,840
I guess to where the gunshot is to see what it was.

1505
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,660
Roll a perception just to like make sure you're pinpointing that correctly.

1506
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:36,680
Eight.

1507
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,420
That's fine.

1508
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:38,620
It doesn't actually really make sense.

1509
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,420
What I just said, but, uh, yeah.

1510
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:40,780
All right.

1511
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,820
We'll do another roll.

1512
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,640
Yeah.

1513
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,620
Maybe insight.

1514
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,140
No, I just mean that you're kind of fine.

1515
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,420
Like you would kind of know where the gunshot is.

1516
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,460
- Yeah, it was next to the bathroom.

1517
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,300
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

1518
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,820
Like you wouldn't have to roll perception for that.

1519
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,520
And you probably would have deduced that it was like,

1520
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,340
you know, where you were.

1521
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,500
Like, I just don't think that's, that makes sense to do.

1522
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,340
- Yeah.

1523
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,980
- So what you can do though, is roll a like,

1524
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,220
I will have you though roll an intelligence check

1525
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:08,100
just to see if you can like remember,

1526
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,660
like by crawling through the vents,

1527
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:12,300
it's like, how am I getting back to that room?

1528
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,140
- Eight.

1529
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:13,960
- Okay.

1530
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,040
kind of just end up going like towards closer to the second room.

1531
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:22,240
But yeah, you could start to pop out and you can see below you like the

1532
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,760
main area of the bank, you see a guard running towards that room.

1533
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,920
So you're not back towards that third room.

1534
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,480
You're kind of hovering over right in front of the second room.

1535
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,320
And for people listening, there are like three rooms that are like facing outside.

1536
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,280
Each of them are like glass windows.

1537
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,400
And that's where all these like different tellers have been and where

1538
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,760
Steven Seagal has been jumping in the windows and cam went into the third one,

1539
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,360
much where Steven Seagal last was.

1540
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,520
Sorry, I just want, okay, yeah.

1541
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,200
So what are you gonna do?

1542
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,600
You can pop out of there, like he won't notice.

1543
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,440
- You know what I'm gonna do?

1544
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,160
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, can I roll,

1545
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,200
I'm gonna roll sleight of hand,

1546
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,960
I'm gonna drop my caltrops, the remaining caltrops.

1547
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,500
- That's pretty nice, okay.

1548
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,160
Okay, yeah, do it.

1549
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,560
- 16. - Nice, yeah.

1550
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,580
I'm gonna roll insight for the security guard running by.

1551
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,840
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1552
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,200
(laughing)

1553
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,540
- If that's what you're doing.

1554
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,440
- No, I wasn't trying to kill the security guard.

1555
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,160
I was trying to just place them down

1556
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,440
so that if Cameron comes out.

1557
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,240
- Oh, okay, you're just placing them outside the door, okay.

1558
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,280
- Yeah, 'cause I think that he's in the second room.

1559
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,640
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, cool.

1560
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,880
So you place it outside the front of that door.

1561
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,640
He's the security guard, he's not gonna run over those.

1562
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,660
He doesn't notice them though.

1563
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,240
But yeah, he's gonna keep running.

1564
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,960
- Okay, then that's-- - That's your turn?

1565
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,240
- Yeah, then I end my turn.

1566
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,120
- Okay, cool, all right.

1567
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,080
Yep, you're good.

1568
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:48,520
Outside of the outside the blood on your Billy Eilish ass outfit.

1569
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:49,520
Invisible.

1570
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,160
Invisible outfit.

1571
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,080
Security guard comes out here.

1572
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:59,920
Another one is going to come back this way is moving towards you this way.

1573
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,520
But you're just standing there.

1574
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
Invisible though still.

1575
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,520
Invisible.

1576
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,520
Invisible.

1577
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,560
And they just see a bank teller dead.

1578
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,080
uh... we couldn't handle the pressure

1579
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,580
he just say that

1580
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,800
uh...

1581
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,640
uh... yeah there's a lot of cases

1582
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:23,000
uh... god i'll have a good line though if i do if i get to do this if i get to

1583
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,600

1584
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,160
uh...

1585
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,300
that fucked it up

1586
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,120
okay we did it

1587
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,160
as the window in this room broken

1588
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,500
yes it is

1589
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,920
and it's not as cleanly broken is the other one

1590
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,400
team that's not nice

1591
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,200
patrick is watching video right now we can be here in a few years and i would

1592
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,200
consider it

1593
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,240
uh... it's the second bucket idiot table my pick

1594
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,800
come on

1595
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,700
uh... ok i'm gonna try to go out the window

1596
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:56,340
very carefully

1597
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,340
uh... you're able to do that that's fine they come again to make you roll for

1598
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,680
that do i see him outside

1599
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,740
you do not

1600
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:13,740
then I guess I will just loop back around and go back into the bank.

1601
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:19,060
Okay, you're going to use your dash action and everything, so let me just measure that.

1602
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,700
Cool. You'll make it from that way into the ATM area.

1603
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,860
Okay, yeah.

1604
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,860
Okay, cool.

1605
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:31,060
Yeah. Cool. T.A.D.'s a good game. Okay, yeah, take off your...

1606
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:36,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1607
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:41,220
You see the guards just run by that second room and just open the door and go, "Oh,

1608
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:45,260
Jesus Christ!" and nothing else.

1609
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,660
Okay.

1610
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,100
Um...

1611
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:53,940
What do I do now?

1612
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,980
I don't know.

1613
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,620
I don't even know.

1614
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,300
I think I'm just gonna stay in here.

1615
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,300
I'm gonna do nothing.

1616
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,300
I'm gonna yield my turn.

1617
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,300
Cool.

1618
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,300
Do it.

1619
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,300
Alright.

1620
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,140
- That's that.

1621
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:11,860
You're both in a similar place if you couldn't tell.

1622
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:16,160
You're both waiting for the other one to strike.

1623
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,600
- Yeah, well I have no clue where he is so.

1624
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,520
- You can do an investigation too.

1625
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,160
- Okay, that's what I kind of have all been wanting to do

1626
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,360
is to simply find out where he is.

1627
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,320
- Okay, do an investigation check, yeah.

1628
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,760
Yeah, for inside the bank.

1629
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,600
- In the jail. - 17.

1630
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,640
- Very nice.

1631
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,880
(laughing)

1632
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:43,240
- You notice, you're investigating around,

1633
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,280
you're like, where could this guy be?

1634
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,600
And you notice a slight depression

1635
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,680
on one of the ceiling tiles.

1636
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,920
(laughing)

1637
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:59,800
- Okay, and how far away am I from the ceiling tile?

1638
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,400
- You look down from the ceiling

1639
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,800
and you see like three small caltrops on the ground

1640
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,740
from where that ceiling tile is.

1641
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:09,440
- Okay.

1642
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,960
- The ceiling tile is like right outside the second room

1643
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,360
where the depression is.

1644
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,320
He got a 17 investigation for those listings.

1645
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,240
- Wait, is the depression meaning like a sagging ceiling?

1646
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,680
- Yeah, like a sagging ceiling tile, yeah.

1647
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,360
- And underneath it there's caltrops?

1648
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,600
- Yeah.

1649
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,480
- Okay, I'm gonna walk over to as close

1650
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,720
to the ceiling tile as I can

1651
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,080
without stepping on the caltrops.

1652
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,080
Yeah, you're fine.

1653
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,580
And I'm still invisible, right?

1654
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:34,580
You are.

1655
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,580
And the security guards are all in the other room?

1656
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:37,580
They are.

1657
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:41,580
Okay, I shoot the stacky part of the ceiling tile.

1658
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:42,580
Okay, roll an attack roll.

1659
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,580
With my gun.

1660
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,580
Okay, what's a gun attack roll?

1661
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,580
It's gonna be 1d20.

1662
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,580
Yeah, it's just the same as shortbow.

1663
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,580
Okay.

1664
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,580
Goddamn.

1665
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,580
24.

1666
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,580
You're gonna kill him.

1667
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,580
You're gonna obliterate him.

1668
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,580
Do you want him to put on his headphones?

1669
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:58,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1670
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,580
Yeah, okay.

1671
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:00,660
- Yeah, okay.

1672
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:01,500
- All right.

1673
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,900
So, Cam walks in to the bank.

1674
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,420
He does a little investigation,

1675
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,860
and he notices a sagging ceiling tile.

1676
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:13,100
(laughing)

1677
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,900
- Oh man, I almost fucking had him.

1678
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,220
I was gonna wait, you know what it was?

1679
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,300
I was gonna wait until he was under me.

1680
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,200
- Yeah.

1681
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,220
- And I was gonna wait,

1682
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,180
and then the weight of my body,

1683
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,660
I wanted to kill him by the ceiling tile.

1684
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:36,260
- There were two very funny endings possible here,

1685
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,100
it's true.

1686
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:38,500
- Here's what I do,

1687
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,140
I walk over to right next to the caltrops that you left,

1688
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,580
and I just take my gun out,

1689
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,180
and I just shoot the sagging part of the ceiling tile,

1690
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,660
and it breaks, and you fall down,

1691
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,380
and you land on the caltrops,

1692
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,460
and then I go, I decloak like a predator,

1693
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,020
and I'm Billy Eilish,

1694
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,260
And then I point the gun right in your face,

1695
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:59,580
and I start singing a song.

1696
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,300
You know what I sing?

1697
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,300
- I'm the bad guy.

1698
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,700
- I'm the black spy.

1699
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:05,980
Duh.

1700
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:07,380
- Oh man.

1701
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,980
- And then my gun does the beat of the song,

1702
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,120
like a YouTube poop.

1703
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,960
- Yeah.

1704
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,060
That was great.

1705
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,740
That was so much longer, obviously,

1706
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,100
than I thought it would be.

1707
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,660
- I mean, that was great.

1708
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,100
That was by far the most--

1709
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,780
- The most involved one we've done.

1710
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,500
So I think I can't I can't I guess this is gonna have so bad

1711
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:37,220
Multiple rounds I think in that case like what I mean like this is just part one

1712
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:42,940
Like oh like we're gonna have finals will continue the finals will continue because there's yeah

1713
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:47,580
What do we have three rounds that we have to do of this? I was good. I was gonna do best three of five

1714
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:52,740
Damn, I have four. I should do best two or three. I think the next one should decide

1715
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,080
Yeah, I'm down for that too. Yeah, okay cool. All right

1716
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,840
Yeah, that was that was great cuz then Caleb gets left out, and he's not yeah, but I don't really

1717
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:09,880
He likes being left out he does he's obsessed hey Caleb, that's right. Hey Caleb eat this

1718
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:15,840
Nice

1719
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,200
All right, so that's one victory for Cameron black spy

1720
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:28,200
And one long to tell you I did I did not deserve it for Steven Seagal whites by yeah

1721
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,520
He really messed that up at one point. You just killed a bank teller I

1722
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,520
Am but it worked in my favor because it got all that security

1723
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:43,200
It's true. It was a weird way that it all kind of worked out that way. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be honest

1724
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,000
Mm-hmm. I think I was made to play this game

1725
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,520
- I think you brought it, man.

1726
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,840
- Yeah, you missed, yeah, Cam,

1727
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,680
'cause you didn't get to hear

1728
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,920
all of his great Steven Seagal moments.

1729
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,800
It was really fun.

1730
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,160
- I could tell he was doing the voice

1731
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,680
by seeing his body language.

1732
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,840
(laughing)

1733
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,360
- He did some really great moments

1734
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,100
that weirdly worked out in his favor

1735
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,040
because of just the improvisational,

1736
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,600
the extra improvisational nature of this thing.

1737
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,560
- There were so many moments where I fucked up

1738
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,760
because I was so in character.

1739
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,600
- It was great.

1740
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,680
- That it was just me bumbling and being just like,

1741
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,640
how Steven Seagal would act in an actual action scenario.

1742
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,440
- Were you just going inside and outside the windows?

1743
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,200
- Yes, pretty much. - Yes, that's what I thought.

1744
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,400
- Crashing in them and going outside of them

1745
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,880
and holding somebody hostage.

1746
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,480
- Yeah, I would be like looking,

1747
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:31,560
my turn would start and I'd be like

1748
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,840
looking for you inside the bank

1749
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,680
and then Patches is just like,

1750
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,080
"You just heard another window crash."

1751
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,320
(laughing)

1752
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,400
- Oh my God, this comes off so easy.

1753
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,040
- Yeah, it sure does.

1754
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,840
All right. - This is acrylic paint.

1755
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
Take it easy everybody.

1756
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,840
I didn't have any eye black at the office.

1757
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

1758
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Bye bye.

1759
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

1760
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

1761
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
Happy Thanksgiving.

1762
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:04,120
A sandwich I ate the other day gave me indigestion so bad that my whole chest felt like it was

1763
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:05,120
jumping out of my chest.

1764
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,120
I feel like I can't even eat turkey ham anymore without the nitrates going into my system and

1765
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,120
just totally bubbling me.

1766
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:19,120
I feel like I got bubbles in my stomach and chest almost every day I wake up.

1767
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:22,120
Walking to the train station I feel this gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp.

1768
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,120
I shouldn't be eating that turkey or that ham man or the turkey ham.

1769
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,120
This stuff is destroying our men and our women.

1770
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,120
Mostly men usually eat more cold cuts than women.

1771
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,120
On average, on average, okay.

1772
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,120
I've developed an adult gluten allergy.

1773
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,120
I never thought it would happen to me.

1774
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:47,120
But here I am, close to 27 years old, and the only bread that I can eat is sourdough.

1775
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,120
Sourdough's good for breakfast, and it's good for sandwiches.

1776
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,120
I can't eat Hawaiian rolls anymore.

1777
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,120
Those are my favorite savory breads.

1778
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,120
Just the other day, man, I was cleaning out my humidifier.

1779
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,120
It had a heavy mineral scaling.

1780
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,120
Mineral scales were collecting onto the humidifier's heating element.

1781
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:09,120
I soaked it in a solution of vinegar and water for about 15 to 20 minutes,

1782
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,480
I started to scrub it with a soft brush so as not to damage the element.

1783
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,560
And I was rinsing the brush under the sink so it wouldn't just have vinegar residue and

1784
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,560
minerals in it.

1785
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:25,920
I flicked back the bristle, the vinegar shot straight into my eye.

1786
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:34,120
And you know, when you think about how men are treated in society nowadays, every single,

1787
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,400
The way that women make us feel is like we always have to act like Howie Mandel.

1788
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:46,360
We always gotta be thinking about putting a rubber glove on our heads and doing Bobby's

1789
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,360
World impressions and talking like Gizmo.

1790
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:52,360
But I don't know if I can be Howie Mandel every day.

1791
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,320
Man, Hollywood has failed us.

1792
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,920
Chicken Run 2, Donna the Nugget will not be showing in theaters.

1793
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,080
Straight to streaming.

1794
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,080
Netflix.

1795
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,320
Lose out on billions of dollars at box office.

1796
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,520
Can't watch Netflix.

1797
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,360
Girlfriend's grandma watches it every day.

1798
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,520
Locks us out of the account.

1799
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:11,180
(Bowser roaring)
