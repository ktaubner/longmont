00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yarrrgh! Last time on Trebuchet Village, Tales from the Seabob, Sinbad, Virtue Good, Lady

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,520
Better. These three salty sea dogs defeated their nemesis Weirdbeard, and had a massive

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,520
beast cloaked in white mist that varnished into the ocean. Then, upon receiving confusing

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,240
Following orders from Governor Gracias Mi Amigo of Port Virtue Good, they hunted high

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,880
and low for the bandits of Isle de Cou, and found themselves face to face with a sandwich

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,360
worshipping cove of were-dolphin, the erg.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,220
But the three captains of the Caribbean Royale kept their Isle de Cou, and rescued these fiends

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,680
from a life of thievery, to instead become a hearty crew of old-fashioned sea slaves.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,120
Soon however, they were trying to make each other walk the plank, and were unable to figure

10
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,120
out why until it hit them. Their toilet looked a lot like a guy they used to bully and figured

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:10,120
they should try to recover him from his untimely demise. But how? Well first they returned to

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,760
Governor Gracias Mi Amigo to tell him of their intent and their success in routing the bandit

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,960
issue discreetly. So yeah, you guys kind of had this revelation last time that there was

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,120
something missing. And first you have to go report to Gracias Mi Amigo that your

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:38,160
mission was a success and he's very pleased to see you and he says, "Ah, hola!

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,720
It's good to see all of you." Hola. Hola. Hola, mi amigo. Yes, that is my name.

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,480
Si, gracias. Gracias. Do you think this could hold up for another episode? It has to.

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Have met very appreciative of all the work you've done for us

20
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:16,720
What's your middle name have we done that before I don't think we hit that yet me me me gracias me

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
I thought mi amigo was your last name.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,220
No, no, no, amigo is my last name.

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,220
Mi is my middle name.

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,720
Are you related to Casamigos?

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
But I'm mi.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
I don't think so.

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Who's Casamigo?

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Yeah, wait, what?

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
But he's me.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I'm me.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Yeah, he's me.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
And you're my amigo.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,720
Okay, so anyway, that's what you get for trying to sneak Spanish into this damn game.

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,220
Honestly, it was my fault.

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,220
Speak American.

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,220
Yeah, I'm trying.

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,220
I'm trying, actually.

38
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:53,220
But, uh, I hear tell that you wish to leave Port of Virtue Good just when I was going to make you privateers, officially, part of the army.

39
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
You're gonna look at my- what?

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,220
What?

41
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,220
You're gonna-

42
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,220
Oh, no, no, no, no. Privateers.

43
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,220
Private-

44
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,220
Private ears?

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
What?

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,220
Is it-

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
I-

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,220
Look, I don't have any private ears. Ladies have private ears downstairs.

49
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
Mm-hmm. They have ears-

50
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
I've heard that too. It's an ear down there.

51
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Yeah.

52
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Yep. That's why it's got flaps.

53
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
Yeah, it's all the different-

54
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,220
Those are the lobes.

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Yeah.

56
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,220
It's all cartilage.

57
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah.

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,220
Right. I mean, look, I don't know where the women you come from, they could be all...

59
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,220
I come from space.

60
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,220
We don't know what that is yet.

61
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,220
But why do you wish to leave? Tell me.

62
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,220
I think we need to shit in a different toilet.

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Ah, yes.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,220
I can't remember.

65
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,220
The hunt for the golden toilet, of course.

66
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,220
- Many have tried. - No, it's different.

67
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,220
- It was a different one. - It was a green toilet.

68
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,220
- It's a different quest. - Yeah.

69
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
- The Emerald Toilet. - It's like a frog.

70
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,220
- No, no, he's like meat. - The Hunt for the Amphibian Toilet.

71
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,220
You're going to kiss a toilet so it turns into a prince?

72
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,220
No, we're not gonna kiss a toilet. What's wrong with you?

73
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,220
- Well, if I have to. - I'm just trying to see.

74
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,220
Nah, I wouldn't kiss this toilet if he was a man.

75
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Which toilet?

76
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
- The toilet. - The toilet.

77
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,220
- You wanna come see it? - Wait, hold on, hold on.

78
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,220
- It'll be easier if we just show you the toilet. - The banyo.

79
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
I guess I could go...

80
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
Oh!

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,220
No, that's the bathroom.

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
Ah, yes, the bathroom!

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
No!

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
(laughter)

85
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,220
Oh, you get it.

86
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Well, I guess I could go...

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Bueno ir el baño.

88
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
Yes, let me see your toilet.

89
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
That's not what that means.

90
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,220
Can we take him to the ship?

91
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Is that what that means?

92
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,420
I thought that means I have to go to the bathroom.

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
I'll take him to the ship.

94
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
I don't speak Spanish.

95
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,420
(laughter)

96
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,420
And I'll show him to the Sullivan toilet.

97
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:47,100
okay he looks at he says it this looks like a guy yeah that's what we're saying

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:57,140
did you know this guy I think so yeah might have been my I think he maybe was

99
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,900
married to him I don't know about that part but we know I think he was a slave

100
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,080
No, I think wait. I think you married this

101
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,480
Married a slave you married a toilet slave. Yeah, I don't think that or a slave

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,020
No, regardless slave to the toilet. Mm-hmm whether the toilet was free or enslaved

103
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,460
I think I need to bring you all to the court wizard. I think that's the only way the basketball court wizard

104
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,940
Yeah, he is quite tall. I'd like to go to the food court wizard. I'm hungry as hell. We had to get rid of him

105
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:40,300
What? I'll bring you to our wizard. His name is Fook-Me. We're standing right in front of the wizard.

106
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,140
What? We're standing right in front of the wizard. Oh, the wizard. I see. That's pretty funny.

107
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:55,860
Gracias, amigo. Say the name again. Wizard. No. The name of the court wizard. Oh, Fook-Me.

108
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
(Gasp)

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,860
If I have to.

110
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,460
I'm about to wash your damn mouth out.

111
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,860
The soap's over there.

112
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,860
Okay, come here.

113
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Okay, I have the soap and I stick it in his mouth.

114
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,860
Now show me that wizard.

115
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
Okay, we gotta go back to the...

116
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Let me see your wizard.

117
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
Okay, wait.

118
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
I've got lots of trouble...

119
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
We don't have time to go to his bathroom.

120
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Can I spit out the soap?

121
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,860
Can I spit out the soap?

122
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,860
Are you gonna keep saying naughty things?

123
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,860
And cussing?

124
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,860
No.

125
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,540
We can spit it out. Okay I'll take you to the wizard. And he brings you to his

126
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,020
bathroom and he says there it is and then he takes you. Why did we end it? And then he

127
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:42,860
takes you to a wizard who looks very familiar. You guys know Fook Yu. This

128
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,340
is his brother Fook Mi. Who unlike his brother. Wait isn't is Fook Yu still

129
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,700
named Fook you or did we change his name? You changed his name from Why Me to Fook

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,060
you. Why is his brother's name Fook Me? Well they both had the last name Me

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,260
until we changed it. Yeah you changed him to Fook you. He's Fook Me. So I guess we gave him

132
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,700
his brother's name. So his brother's name was Fook? No no no they're both

133
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,780
called... his name was Why and his brother's name was Fook. You changed his

134
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,300
name to Fook you. This is his brother Fook Me. Okay it's starting to make sense. You got rid of

135
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,120
his last name. Yeah, we changed his last name. Sounds awesome. We changed his whole name.

136
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,300
We changed both his first and last name. To his brother's first name and a new last name

137
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:38,020
that we might encounter later. Yes. To my last name. Dogen U. That's a huge lore reveal

138
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,860
for this episode. I did say there'd be lore in this episode. Yeah, you're Dogen U? Yeah.

obviously, but he's

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,540
he's cleaned up. He doesn't look like Gandalf. He looks like a like normal

147
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:23,900
looking person who is a scholar. He is much more confident than his brother, as

148
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,820

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,140

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
- Okay, I put it on myself.

157
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,400
- Oh no, should've been more specific.

158
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,420
- Hi Fookme, I'm Rod Dogan, you?

159
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,160
- Evil Steve, all in a little shirt.

160
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,720
- Ah, we have three, oh, these are your three privateers

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,560
you've told me so much about.

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,260
It's good to meet you all, I'm Fookme.

163
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,360
- I take his shirt off too.

164
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,480
- Oh, now, now, now, his shirt magically pops back on

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
as you take it off.

166
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
- He's a wizard, you're gonna have to do better than that.

167
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,000
- Yeah, you're gonna have to do better than that.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,080
I am a wizard.

169
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,760
- Challenge accepted.

170
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,440
- Well, that's okay.

171
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
What seems to be the issue?

172
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
These three, they--

173
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
- I have an issue, your shirt's still on.

174
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,200
- Well, now look, maybe another time, pal.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
- I'm gonna roll deception.

176
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,800
- Okay, go for it.

177
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,640
You're gonna try to deceive him to get him naked?

178
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,120
- Actually, I'm gonna roll persuasion.

179
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
- Deceive him, get me naked?

180
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,360
- You're gonna persuade him to get him naked?

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
- Get Fook me naked?

182
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Wow, okay.

183
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,880
It's not getting naked, he's just taking his shirt off.

184
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
You're gonna attack him?

185
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Yeah.

186
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Persuasively sexual?

187
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Yeah.

188
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Okay, alright.

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I mean, yeah, you laid it out for me.

190
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
It's a 19.

191
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,800
Okay, he says, "Is it customary where you're from?"

192
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,560
Yes, it's a customary where he's from and I'm trying to help him.

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,440
Alright, I guess I'm from sexo- sexo-land.

194
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Sexo-land.

195
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,760
I've never heard of that in my studies.

196
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,080
It's real look regardless. I can take my shirt off. It's all all well

197
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,360
He takes his shirt off and he's very I got him to do it bitch now

198
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,440
They seem to be they look at the toilet and they try to member a remember a slave is this right

199
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,920
No

200
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,520
Well, yeah, I guess that is right. Yeah, see it was a wife slave a wife slave

201
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,200
The toilet used to be his wife and I think our slave.

202
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
No.

203
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
And he was a green frog.

204
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,640
A green frog wife slave.

205
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,080
And then I don't remember what happened after that.

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Also we knew your brother.

207
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh, why me?

208
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,040
We still knew your brother.

209
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
No.

210
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
No, his new name.

211
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Fook you.

212
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Fook you.

213
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I pointed at him.

214
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Fook you.

215
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm Rock, don't get you.

216
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Fook me.

217
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
[laughter]

218
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,160
What's your name again?

219
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
So stupid.

220
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,840
It's all my fault.

221
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
What's your name again?

222
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Fook me!

223
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Yeah, I'm RoeDog and you're Fook You.

224
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah Fook You.

225
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Fook You.

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,960
That's your brother, your brother is Fook, we changed his name.

227
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,320
No, my brother's Why Me.

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,520
No, no listen, we changed his name, I don't remember how, and he's Fook You now.

229
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,440
Ah, he was always, well, rather.

230
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,120
Your brother's gonna Fook You.

231
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah.

232
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Your brother will fuck your butt.

233
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
I think is his name now.

234
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,920
Well, you know, I'm glad he seems to have found his way.

235
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,840
He was always a bit of, you know, a little bit different, I guess.

236
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
So - What's that supposed to mean?

237
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Ah, it's just, you know, he was smaller - You mean different.

238
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
He was shorter.

239
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,160
Well, he wasn't - I don't think that's what he meant.

240
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Maybe, I don't know.

241
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,720
He always sort of was crying about things and -

242
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Oh yeah, yep.

243
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I tried to.

244
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,440
Oh, I know what you're talking about now.

245
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,360
Yep, crying about things.

246
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Little bit of this.

247
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
Oh, oh, oh.

248
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,660
played basketball and he hurt his legs. He's doing a swish. Yep. A little bit of this.

249
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,580
Perfect three-point shot. Yep. Now I remember this guy. He looks, he's

250
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,600
looking in his his drawers. Ah, here it is. He pulls out. What's he doing in them damn

251
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:21,220
drawers? I'm sorry, I'm miming it. He's opening up drawers. Not his drawers. Oh, okay. And he

252
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,660
pulls out a sort of like, it looks like a piece of like metal that's been like

253
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,260
jagged and been ripped off of something else and it has a bit of a ethereal glow

254
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,500
to it and he says, "Okay, all of you put your hands on this. We're gonna try to

255
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,900
see what you are grasping at here." It's not okay. It's very rare to have a

256
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,180
a collective sort of coincidental memory of can I do a joke before you do that if

257

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,860
- I have a--

263
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,860
- He has dirt-a-beeties.

264
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,860
- Just get me a piece of meat or something.

265
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Just a piece of meat.

266
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Just say it's a piece of meat or something.

267
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
- How do you have a piece of meat?

268
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,860
- I mean, I could give you--

269
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
- I don't know.

270
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
He was eating earlier.

271
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
I can see the plate.

272
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
I can see the plate with the meat.

273
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Can I just have it?

274
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
- Oh, there's crumbs on his face.

275
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
He obviously eats meat.

276
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
- Okay, sure.

277
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
- Meat crumbs.

278
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,860
- Yes, here's the flank steak I was having.

279
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,660
- I have a fork and knife and I cut into it and I take a bite and I go, "Fook me, it's

280
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
practically raw."

281
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,920
(laughter)

282
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,220
- We can go back.

283
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,480
(laughter)

284
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,120
- Oh, the bathroom, I get it, that's funny.

285
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,140
Okay, so if you all put your,

286
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,980
this is a piece from another world.

287
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,100
This metal here, I'll explain, but first--

288
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,720
- Yeah, piece of crap.

289
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,060
What am I supposed to do with this?

290
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Eat it, okay.

291
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,600
- No, no, don't eat it.

292
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,720
try to eat it? He could try to eat it. He's gonna do a strength check against you.

293
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
Okay. Try to stop you from doing that. Do I need to do a strength check? Yeah, yeah. It's gonna be a

294
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,520
strength, a little strength contest here. Okay, yeah. 15. He got, he got, I mean he got 18. Yeah,

295
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,000
I see that. Plus three. Dude, that would, I could have changed everything about this damn campaign.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,840
It just would have been very confusing, but uh, he says. I could have become the thing.

297
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,120
But when you grab it, I have to say, because you, you did grab it in that,

298
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,220
You briefly have flashes of what had happened prior,

299
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,480
the events that led up to you guys becoming

300
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,560
famous privateers.

301
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,140
You know, you see flying into the,

302
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,140
you see somebody getting stabbed in a ritual,

303
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,080
but you can't make out who it is.

304
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,920
You see yourselves flying in the air

305
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,560
and landing into a forest with,

306
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,040
you think it's four people,

307
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,860
but it feels like there's a fifth person there.

308
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,800
Like you experience that briefly.

309
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,280
And can I remember it as four people and a toilet?

310
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,000
Yeah, okay. That's fine. All right. I think that's still good. You haven't got through the full

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,440
ritual yet. He says, and Fook-mee obviously senses that too. And he's like, "Okay,

312
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:25,000
there is somebody in your past. This is, please, all of you, I need all of you to put your hand

313
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,880
on this. Don't try to eat it this time." At least not yet. I'll try to eat it.

314
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,240
You're going to try to eat it? Okay. Yeah.

315
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Let's try that.

316
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
You're really good.

317
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
Okay.

318
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Okay, that's a six plus.

319
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
Where's my...

320
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
It's right there.

321
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
It's right here, bud.

322
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
I really should have him cast a spell, but it's...

323
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
You really should take off your indoor sunglasses, I would say.

324
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I can't.

325
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
Oh, he got a crit 20.

326
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Oh.

327
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Dude, what the f...

328
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
He's the strongest guy ever.

329
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Yeah, you're a wizard.

330
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
You should be weak.

331
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
I guess I don't need these anymore, because I don't need to read this.

332
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I will eventually, though.

333
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
You're going to also try to eat it, Matt?

334
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Okay.

335
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
Okay.

336
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
That is for the people who are watching.

337
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm going to try to eat it.

338
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm going to try to eat it.

339
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,240
eventually though. You're gonna also try to eat it, Matt? Okay.

340
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,240
That is for the people at home. He's just shaking it tight.

341
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Oh boy.

342
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,240
What'd you get? It's a strength. Yeah, I got 12. What'd you get?

343
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,240
What'd you get? I got a 13. No way.

344
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,240
Okay, you grab it, you eat it.

345
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Yes! Say the thing.

346
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,720
No, oh my god, folk folk me. It's practically wrong. It's practically wrong. Yep

347
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
There we go. Pretty good

348
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,280
And you like that eat or and my eyes light up. Yeah, you are having a sort of a real episode you were remembering

349
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,280
You're not just remember so God if you think about what this the implications of this would be

350
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,660
So you're not just I touch my belly to remember it - you're not just remembering

351
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,000
these lakes

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Shades of memory you remembering like moment by moment everything that happened to you leading up to this

353
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
it is like an excruciating amount of like

354
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,220
Information that is being funneled into your frontal lobe right now, so roll a wisdom saving throw

355
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:16,280
What'd you get?

356
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,760
Nice I

357
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Think you will lose your mind soon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I have a pretty strong feeling about that oh

358
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,800
Oh

359
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:38,560
Feels like you're just rolling these for no reason no it's gonna be it's it's 3d 12 that one is a weird

360
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,560
for any sort of

361
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,320
Feedback from this thing

362
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,800
Okay

363
00:17:46,920 --> 00:18:01,680
So you take 15 damage, like psychic damage from this, but you also remember Sullivan perfectly.

364
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
Not as a toilet.

365
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,320
Not as a toilet.

366
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,500
As a frog.

367
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
As a frog.

368
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
He does.

369
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,640
The toilet was a frog that we knew?

370
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Huh?

371
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
What's a frog?

372
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,560
Frog and his name was, it's a green amphibian and it hops.

373
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
What's an amphibian?

374
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,880
Kinda like a reptile.

375
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,200
What's a reptile?

376
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,240
Kinda like a Komodo dragon.

377
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Oh!

378
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Okay.

379
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,680
So basically, it's a few steps away from a Komodo dragon.

380
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,960
What happened to this toilet, Frog?

381
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Wait, I think I remember that.

382
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
We were in a...

383
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I think I remember what was happening to him.

384
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Touch his tummy.

385
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Wait.

386
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,040
touch his tummy. I can't think right now I'm like there was mm-hmm there was a

387
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,280
white woman in the water and my uncle fucked her. You remember her nose is

388
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,520
bleeding. Yeah yeah you guys touch his tummy and it comes where you guys

389
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,680
remember he basically in this sense it's sort of like he has all of the the

390
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,960
concrete details you two remember specifically going into the terrifier

391
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,000
realm and you two being the ones who convinced the prince to stab solvent 500

392
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,120
times and that is what you remember I don't remember a thing either wait

393
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,840
actually I think the toilet somebody took a doo-doo and put it into the into the

394
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,760
toilet a knife-shaped poop a very sharp doo-doo that is what I'm remembering put

395
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,240
it in and out of the toilet remembering a poop that looks like a knife you guys

396
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
he's going to roll deception on this wizard. He's trying to help you okay. I

397
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,040
was lying. It's okay. You can't it's fun.

398
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,600
I admit I'm lying and yeah still

399
00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:02,180
to do. I got a twenty. It's open three different apps. He's going to roll

400
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,400
inside on that yeah. No he's like he thinks you still think it's poop. He

401
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,720
You said you're lying.

402
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Yep.

403
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
So what do you actually remember?

404
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
I think I am...

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,780
Knife-shaped like poop?

406
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,360
I think I am remembering a knife-shaped like poop.

407
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,280
And you?

408
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,640
There was a frog named Skon.

409
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
I don't really know what you're going into more.

410
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
Do any of you know a knife-shaped like poop?

411
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,120
Do you know what the frog's name is?

412
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Brelebin.

413
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Brelebin.

414
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
Su...

415
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Son of a...

416
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Son of a...

417
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Son of a...

418
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
Scrub-a-ding.

419
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,720
Scrotum in little hold on and he goes rub-a-dub he goes to your time I think it

420
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,040
was poop or something he goes to your tummy and we name the crap that was a

421
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,720
different world and he goes to your tummy and he tries to he's like

422
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:02,720
searching and trying to remember he goes ah he died outside this realm your

423
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,160
friend or slave. You seem to have all confusing psychosexual feelings about this.

424
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,600
Friend, slave, wife. I don't know. I'm pretty, now that I have touched his stomach, I

425
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,240
remember that you guys were married. I don't remember it. We worked at his

426
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,120
general store. Oh he was our boss. He was our, that's what it was. It was like a

427
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,960
work, it was a work relationship. What no he would, you remember and that he would

428
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,080
boss you around because he was your wife? No, I think because it...

429
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, I'm remembering the wedding perfectly now. Oh my god.

430
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,600
We went to the ladies thing and then he got... we all woke up and he was

431
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,640
married and there was a... and they were... the ring that they had, they

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,240
each... Oh, you guys are remembering that prank we played that didn't...

433
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,720
was a there was a ceremony in frog culture you got the ring I remember that do you

434
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,760
remember it perfectly or do you guys remember that we were playing a prank on

435
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,880
you to make you think we're getting married because we would never do

436
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,440
something like that I don't think either of you are there wasn't that no I start

437
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,920
I start rubbing my belly really hard it was not a prank

438
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,760
remember it not be a practice you were never you never know I mean we planned it

439
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,640
actually I remember roll wisdom saving throw I remember feeling emotional at

440
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,280
your wedding because it was so you're so in love you fell for the prank that's

441
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,840
pretty pathetic you felt emotional cuz I felt absolutely nothing you married it

442
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:43,200
till a night tears rolling down my cheek I got a 21 okay cool you're yeah you're

443
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,480
safe you're safe anytime you try to remember this it's gonna hurt you cuz

444
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,720
you ate it but you will remember it like perfectly every time he says

445
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,660
Um, well, there are legends of those who die outside our realm to not be...

446
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,540
Can I poop this out now?

447
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,580
It's gonna take some time, I'm afraid.

448
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Ah, crap.

449
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,980
They're not dead, in our sense.

450
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,020
If he truly died in the Terrifier Realm like your tummy told me...

451
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,460
Well think of it like this.

452
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,780
Sullivan died in the Terrifier Realm, so while it erased him from other realms, it was a cessation

453
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,900
of life outside of the realm he originated in, but not to the other realms. Does that

454
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
make sense?

455
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Say it, what?

456
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,340
He's dead here, but he technically exists beyond it, because he didn't die in the realm he

457
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,740
was properly established in.

458
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,660
All right. Okay.

459
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,940
Regardless, you'll need to sail. If you really-

460
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm rubbing my belly right now, and I'm remembering the night I watched my uncle fuck the white

461
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,420
lady of the water of the woods.

462
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,980
All right, you gotta roll again. You keep doing this to yourself.

463
00:23:47,980 --> 00:24:01,780
just have perfect memory. I'm going, "Oh yeah. Oh yeah." You're gonna get hurt. Nine. That's

464
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:10,980
like the fifth time you've checked what your wisdom is. Well, let me roll that. Uh-oh. You're

465
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,980
dead. Yeah, I'm dead. You're probably dead. I'm dead because I have... Wait, wait, wait.

466
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:25,340
'cause I started with 19 HP. You're dead. Yeah. But I was maxed out at 27. You were passed

467
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,940
out. You were passed out remembering your uncle fucking that woman. That's a good last

468
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:41,380
memory. Oh yeah! Does he need to hear this too? Nah, he's pretty much just there to fuck

469
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:46,220
shit up. We can tell. We'll have Grassius, me amigo, who's gonna try to stabilize you.

470
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
Okay, he's able to stabilize you.

471
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:55,220
We would have had to enter initiative and did death-saving throws, but gracias mi amigo is able to stabilize you.

472
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Either way, if the legend is true, you'll have to sail to realms deep.

473
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,220
You see, every realm has a gate, or so it's said, that connects us to other realms.

474
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
Or rather, could connect us to other realms.

475
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,700
This hasn't been done in anything except legend, until of course, those fools over at St. Anthony's

476
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
Parish.

477
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
I thought we were in legend.

478
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,980
Well, you're a legend.

479
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,260
Isn't that what fantasy is?

480
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,260
No, it's different.

481
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,260
Oh, okay.

482
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,260
That's fantasy different than legend.

483
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,180
St. Anthony's Parish contacted the Terrifier Realm, hence the situation we're in.

484
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,500
To go around the proper channels to call forth a vengeful god would have caused great unrest,

485
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,200
So it's good you stopped that, but it seems in your efforts to stop that, you've lost

486
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,200
a comrade who seems near and dear to you.

487
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
More like a commode!

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Now Realm's Gate cannot be reached by normal means.

489
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,420
Frankly, it's never been reached at all, except in legend.

490
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:02,420
The pirate king Virtuegood, whose port and this archipelago is his namesake, he's said

491
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,420
to have sailed with his fearsome crew to Realm's Deep, never to be seen again.

492
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,420
It was his final adventure.

493
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,420
And daring means to escape death.

494
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,420
Many believed he did, many believed he didn't.

495
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,420
They are like equally likely in my eye, but actually it's more likely he's dead.

496
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,420
But don't let that dissuade you.

497
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,420
If you really want to find your friend, you're going to have to sail west, deeper into the archipelago.

498
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,420
You must sail beyond the reach of the Terrafire's kingdom as well.

499
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,420
Now the governor and I can't sanction this, so we can turn a blind eye.

500
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,780
So you're gonna sanction it?

501
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
We're gonna turn a blind eye.

502
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
Okay, I do this.

503
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,780
I have a letter.

504
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,380
I do the two fingers into the eyes.

505
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,460
Either way, I did write this monologue, so I'll continue.

506
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,340
If you are found out, you will not be welcomed here.

507
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,180
You may be heroes, but journeying to realms deep, even if it seems to be mere legend or

508
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,140
fantasy will not please some who've joined the Council of Late.

509
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,620
So I'm alive right now?

510
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Yeah.

511
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:11,060
I can speak no no you're you're passed out you would have to get a health

512
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:17,860
potion I just wanted to ask if we can what if we do it by accident what if we

513
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,940
do it by accident well I mean there's gonna be no difference for the

514
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,900
pleasure men who are on the council now Oh God look God because of the recent

515
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,740
events in the kingdom the pleasure men are now on the council they likely don't

516
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:40,860
want anything at all to lessen the power of discharge their God who's raised in

517
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:47,420
standing since the King Nardwuar has now fallen out of favor. You'll have to head

518
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:58,220
to Cape Shit and sail until-- Oh I get it. Oh yeah, took me a second. Very well

519
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:07,800
written yes thank you not like Cape Cod no get it Cape shit shit what it's like

520
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:16,200
doo-doo but also like Cape Cape Cod chips oh actually I misread what I wrote here

521
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,920
Cape spit is what I meant because spit is a type of okay yeah that's why I did

522
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,580
that spit is a type of a land formation anyway you have to sail it to the port

523
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,780
City of Angelfire. I don't get it at all. It doesn't make any fucking sense. I thought it was poop.

524
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,260
That's why I need my glasses. My cool sunglasses. Because then I actually can't read what I wrote.

525
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,100
You'll have to sail into the port city of Angelfire. Angelfire is the last city in

526
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,940
the Terrafire's kingdom. Beyond that is unknown. We only have some knowledge as

527
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,740
to what goes beyond. Perhaps you'll gain a better sense of what lies beyond once

528
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:55,740
you reach Angel Fire. This is you're taking a picture of me with the sunglasses.

529
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,220
Fucking asshole. Patrick just took a creep shot.

530
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Yeah. He's wearing sunglasses.

531
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,340
He has a little, he has a skirt on. I don't have.

532
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,460
And he's sitting on a glass chair. No, I don't have my, my, my regular prescription

533
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,720
glasses broke. And so I only have my prescription sunglasses. And it's very hard for me to read

534
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,040
the text I wrote. I don't like zooming in because then I have to zoom out and then

535
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:27,480
I have other notes. Anyway, so he continues. He says to you all, "If you want to go on this

536
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,080
journey to realms deep and find your friend Sullivan at the end of this realm,

537
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,120
it's not going to be an easy one and you'll not receive much from anyone who

538
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,260
catches wind of it. I would be discreet about your journey, but..." You say catch

539
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,100
wind and my past out body just goes.

540
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,500
It's past wind I think right?

541
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Well you're going to catch it in a second.

542
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
No I just caught the wind.

543
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,860
Yeah I grabbed it in my hand.

544
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
I put it back into his mouth.

545
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,860
I put it into his mouth.

546
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
I crack up the fart in my hands.

547
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
Can that work as a smelling salt?

548
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,860
In what way?

549
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:08,860
I just don't want him to lose any of his life essence and die.

550
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,220
It brings you your conscious.

551
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,660
Look, if you all wish to go on this journey,

552
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,580
we can give you ample supplies and enough gold

553
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,980
to be able to go to the correct port towns.

554
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,820
If, of course--

555
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,820
- Ample, you say?

556
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,820
- The governor wishes to sanction this.

557
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,180
These three have been amazing, wonderful privateers.

558
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,420
I would happily do this for them.

559
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,260
- Gracias.

560
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,500
- Gracias. - Mi amigo.

561
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,540
- Gracias, mi amigo.

562
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,960
- They are all my friends.

563
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,540
(laughing)

564
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,700
- Thank you, my friend.

565
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,180
- Thank you, my friends.

566
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,540
Thank you my friend.

567
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,340
Thank you my friend.

568
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,820
Your name is Thank You My Friend now.

569
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,420
Oh no! We're pretty much the name changers.

570
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,460
One of us is a notary.

571
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,500
Yeah.

572
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,100
You guys gonna do this? You guys gonna go to

573
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,620
realms deep? No. No. That would be fine. You guys could just fuck around and be pirates.

574
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,820
Damn.

575
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,280
What do you guys want to do?

576
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,900
Should we go on an amazing quest to save

577
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,720
Sullivan the frog or should we hang out?

578
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:23,500
From my from my my inventory I pull out a scroll that's a map to babe island

579
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,000
So we'll make our way there

580
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,920
Yeah, we have a map to realms deep right here and it's an island

581
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,480
It's like an aisle that looks like two boobs. So I have okay. I'll add that so I have a map

582
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,280
I'm not I haven't finalized it yet

583
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,880
But I do have a map of the archipelago that I'm working on and I will I will add Bay by Lynn to it

584
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,960
But don't don't look don't look I have to finish it you guys will sell West

585
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,560
During this session so you shouldn't barring anything

586
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,480
Magical on my table of pirate events so wait which way is you should run?

587
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,880
You shouldn't run into the rest of my map. Hopefully. Yes, well, which way is Rome steep the east it's West

588
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,480
Okay, East is back towards the Terrifier Kingdom

589
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,720
what's north and what's south I mean north there's some scant islands south

590
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,400
similarly there's no game like there's generally clan islands this is generally

591
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,600
clan island there's nothing of note I mean like it's okay so our the options

592
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,360
you're giving us or you go back to the first you could just say I could go west

593
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,480
you could keep going north I guess and like there will you said there's nothing

594
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,680
there's no islands. There's no settlements that at least that here's

595
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,580
the what's a that I know of as a so can we even if we're on there could be

596
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,680
other nations. If you guys choose to go north, I can I can try to I can like

597
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,080
figure out a little bit more of the geography. I'm being very transparent

598
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,600
about my what if we do I feel I think we did this exact same thing last time

599
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,400
when you gave us a place that we clearly had to go. What if we go like

600
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,920
northwest or southwest, just me look at where you are on the map and we can

601
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,700
goof off more. Let me see what's north west of you guys, because I do I mean

602
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,420
the maps not

603
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,320
whichever has a cool, whichever direction as a cool thing. That's not

604
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:15,080
the main quest. Can you just tell us where to go and we'll go there, but you

605
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,500
want to go. It needs to be a little bit annoying to you. So if you go, you want

606
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,040
to go not want us to go right now. This is how I think we need to head south

607
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:30,040
south to Mexico. South is there is an island. There's a few things there that

608
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,580
Wait.

609
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,080
Very much not a part of the bank.

610
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,580
Where is Gracias...

611
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,580
I'll invite this to me.

612
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,080
Wait, where is Gracias mi amigo from?

613
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Gracias mi amigo?

614
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Uh, I mean he's from Port Virtue Good.

615
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
He was born and raised there.

616
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,580
Port Virtue Good's been established for a long time.

617
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,580
Like, like relatively.

618
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,080
Like, like, like a hundred, hundred fifty years.

619
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,080
So he, he was governor based on sort of like, like,

620
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
"Oh, I've been here for a while, yadda yadda yadda."

621
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,580
So he's really old?

622
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,080
Mm-mm.

623
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Let's, hmm.

624
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,580
I think we gotta head south.

625
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,580
We can head south.

626
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:03,300
You head south, it will... it's not gonna... I won't like it, so if you want to do something I don't like, you can do that.

627
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,500
Will it make it a shitty...

628
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,000
No.

629
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,740
No, I've got stuff ready for it, it's just then I'm...

630
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,900
I am going to treat the map I made seriously, which means I'll have to deal with the fact that you go south.

631
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,020
So I've got stuff prepared for this session.

632
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,460
Wait, will you not move your head at all?

633
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,980
Are you trying to look at the map?

634
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,260
You trying to look at the map?

635
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Guys, I don't think we should go south.

636
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,500
He's looking at the McDonald's logo now.

637
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,460
There's seriously a bunch of pictures of hamburgers south.

638
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,100
is there doesn't that mean we should go south let's go south okay cool

639
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,100
yes you guys want to leave you guys wait I gotta get a health potion or some shit

640
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:44,220
first you can long rest again I mean you can just you can yeah I mean you guys

641
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,980
can go to the tavern and long rest in the you thought there's gonna be a way you

642
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,820
could do it that wasn't in the app

643
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,380
- You haven't used any of your hit die

644
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,140
or any of your resources that would,

645
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,860
I mean hit die, I don't think you have any spells.

646
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,700
So hit die, you probably have--

647
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,140
- I used a long rest.

648
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,700
- Yeah, so if you just do long rest, you're good there.

649
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,900
Yeah, you guys sleep in the tavern.

650
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,300
- I'm long resting too.

651
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,540
- Or the inn rather.

652
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,640
It's called Inn Thank You Very Much.

653
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,820
- What's up?

654
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,020
- It's called Inn Thank You Very Much.

655
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,460
- Not this again.

656
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,380
- So what, I made it before I knew you guys

657
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,940
were going to the innkeeper.

658
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,500
So what's the name of this inn?

659
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500

Gracias mi amigo.

661
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,620
No, that's the governor.

662
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,020
I'm thank you very much.

663
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,460
De nada.

664
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Of course.

665
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Wait, who's that?

666
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Why did I say that?

667
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,140

694
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,220
actually sail instead yeah I think we should I think we can do okay all right

695
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:23,500
we will sail okay East or West I think we just do West let's just give let's

696
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:30,460
just give this guy's there an island or magical item where no where I mean it's

697
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,660
further out you're not gonna probably find it this this session I'm gonna be

698
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:41,660
you

699
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:50,100
okay you can go back okay just go back to terrifying okay what are you going on in

700
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,160
the terrifying kingdom I have I want to pay I want to go west coast in West okay

701
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,540
what are you voting for I don't even know anymore just pick a direction what

702
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,140
are you voting for I'm gonna let's go north okay I pick south so we need a

703
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,620
tiebreaker what if we just say what about the 30 guys on the ship that are

704
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:22,420
all controlled by badges no I mean you can ask them yeah we just asked them yes

705
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:28,500
the rubbers yeah oh we'll we'll we will you told us you would make us your

706
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,940
slaves at the amusement park so you guys could bring them to the amusement park

707
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,340
you know what actually that's a pretty good idea yeah we can't bring them but

708
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:43,780
we were gonna open a SeaWorld types like spit separate locations

709
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,740
so the amusement park so Gal Gadot is a part of the eastern part of the kingdom

710
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:58,140
okay so you'd have to go like you have to go through is is Islam I think we

711
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,500
have to go no I think we go what I think we should go west is a little bit we

712
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,660
know that's a new brave lion's need to be on the coast yeah yeah yeah we don't

713
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,660
want to put it in the same place I think wait you could do that - how rich are we

714
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,300
really um really rich are you really I mean like could we do we have enough

715
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,420
capital to just start this thing by ourselves or do we need to go back to

716
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,380
Shark Tank start which thing the SeaWorld thing yeah yeah second part well

717
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,340
Well so to get the, I mean you could do like, promissory notes, and you could get, you could

718
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:35,460
pull, you'd have to talk with, you'd have to talk with Ola, she, who is your, sort of

719
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
your patron for everything.

720
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Yeah, yeah, I remember her.

721
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,980
You'd have to talk with her about like, getting additional capital.

722
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Ola?

723
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,300
Or what if we just go around her and give like, you know.

724
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
We could just get a treasure chest.

725
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,860
Do like, futures, contracts kind of thing, and like, then just beg her after the fact,

726
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
too.

727
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,260
We could also treasure chest it would probably be enough money. We probably have a treasure chest.

728
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,880
No, we could get we could also just get one probably. Remember earlier when I said we should get that treasure chest?

729
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,220
No. The game before? That was a good point. Yeah, you're right. What treasure? I don't know what you're talking about.

730
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,580
This is tight. On Weird Beard's ship, I said we should get his treasure chest. I said there was probably not.

731
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,580
There was treasure there! There was treasure there!

732
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,580
No, there was treasure there!

733
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,220
No, you were asking about a magic sword. Mm-hmm. I remember I edited that this morning.

734
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,500
Here's the thing, I kind of like this. I think this is breaking new ground in the actual play

735
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:29,300
world. We can really like, I think your shared hatred of Sullivan is creating new kinds of

736
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,100
play where we can right now, if you guys don't want to go on like the critical path because

737
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,900
Sullivan's annoying and you guys want to play around.

738
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,900
I don't even know that yet. I just think, I mean, I don't want to hang out with a toilet

739
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,820
all that bad. What if we just roll a d4 and that's the direction we go?

740
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,180
good idea so it's yeah one is one is no or him come up with which okay yeah

741
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,620
which is which I'll roll it um let's do like one is north that's what I said

742
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,420
copying we're gonna do you want to do clockwise no copy to two is easier to

743
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:11,540
is east three is is is South Forge West Forest West do it okay ready yep that's

744
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:24,500
what was that East all right this is so fun roll again no no let's do it let's do

745
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,260
it no I've got I have the one that I don't it has so here's the thing I mean

746
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,660
like next session you can change direction we could do it like that

747
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:39,620
spending 15 minutes on where to go let's just hit the yeah okay we're going east

748
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,620
back to where we were before. We all just decided to go east for no reason. Let's go.

749
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,500
All right, cool. Let me roll. I have to roll. Where's my d10? There it is. Okay.

750
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:56,660
Sorry, I have some stuff. Thank you for apologizing.

751
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,580
Pat is stacking dice. Yeah. Okay. I can't look. He physically can't stop making dice towers.

752
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,220
Okay, cool. That's fun. Okay. I have no idea where it went. So it's a

753
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:24,980
it's pretty good weather for sailing. Um, you guys are able to head east. I shoot a gun at the bow.

754
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:34,100
What? At the forward mast. You don't have a gun? The bow. There's no such thing as a gun yet.

755
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:40,100
I shoot a bazooka at the sails. You had to get a derailment in so fast.

756
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:46,100
You said, "I shoot a gun at the bow." I shoot a bazooka at the sails.

757
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,100
You just had a primal urge, "I need to interrupt you right now."

758
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:57,100
I need to interrupt you right now. I shoot a gun at the bow.

759
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Alright. So he shoots a gun at the bow, and then what happens?

760
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:08,540
shoots his um yeah i guess he shoots uh just a cross boy pirates have guns

761
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,580
yep not wait a second we haven't we didn't see

762
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,460
do we have is there guns there are cannons there was a can there are

763
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,980
flintlock pistols in this world yo you haven't have way okay before we

764
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,180
still can we all just go to the store and each buy a flintlock pistol please

765
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,860
can we all do that yeah i buy a flintlock bazooka can we all only use

766
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,260
guns this game i'm down there are all the all the yes

767
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:34,860
My crossbow turns into a musket. My dagger turns... no that stays.

768
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,360
And then...

769
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
No, it's a cutlass.

770
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,360
My cutlass...

771
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,360
You're gonna change your rapier into a cutlass.

772
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I think that's probably pretty good.

773
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
And then my dagger is a pistol.

774
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,360
This is fun. We didn't do really a session zero.

775
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,360
This is kind of like a session zero. Impromptu session zero.

776
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,360
This is like a negative one.

777
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
[Laughter]

778
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm very down for you guys to go to like a general store and like...

779
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,960
So, okay, we don't have to go that I'll just I'll just do a Patrick it

780
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,080
I know I said it was a war or I'm changing it to a war gun and I just hit people with it doesn't

781
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,700
I I think what we can do then is try and think of like I would rather you guys have

782
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,380
Let me make a note of that for next time and I can make you guys like some of my own

783
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,920
Becomes an arm strike

784
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,880
There are some pretty good

785
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,240
There's some interesting gun mechanics out there and I would want to like make sure I do a little bit more research

786
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,660
- Can I just change my crossbow to a gun?

787
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,080
- Of course you can.

788
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,920
- Sick.

789
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,620
- You have an Uzi?

790
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,460
- I'd say right now.

791
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,620
- He's just like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

792
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,000
- Next session, next session, we can do,

793
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,480
I can update your whole outfit.

794
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,600
We can make you guys pirates way more.

795
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,500
But yeah, sailing--

796
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,340
- With the hat.

797
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,180
- With the hat.

798
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,140
- With the hat, and you know I gotta have the hat.

799
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:50,980
- Yes.

800
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,100
- So you guys, very funny,

801
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,040
you guys all have this sudden urge,

802
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,920
you remember to think about Sullivan you remember him how important he was to you

803
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,560
and you immediately sail in the complete opposite direction. Well no we realized

804
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,400
how much we fucking hated it. Yeah and so you sail in the opposite direction and

805
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,720
we're trying to prove that the world is round we're gonna end up in the same place.

806
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,680
So your guys like I don't know if I described you guys your ship that much so

807
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:25,400
there's like four levels to your galleon the Caribbean Royale or the Royal

808
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,360
Caribbean there's the main deck right there's a quarter deck the quarter deck

809
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,960
is on top of the main deck it's sort of like the main deck is like the middle of

810
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,120
it I'm making sure you guys a picture or two that I have that's very useful that's

811
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,640
you so like the quarter deck is on top of the big ass that's like the raised

812
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,400
front and back part. Yes, exactly. Yeah. So where the helm is right and and the the foremast and

813
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,800
the uh I wish I used to have the I think I have this written yeah yeah the mizzenmast and foremaster

814
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,400
in the back and the front of this respectively. You have the lower deck uh the lower deck has

815
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,160
basically where the crew sleeps um you guys sleep in the main in the in the captain's quarters.

816
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,960
Sick. Which is towards the hull uh towards the back the uh the stern um the crew sleeps towards

817
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,280
the bow in the main deck there's a lower deck and then there's a bow yeah the bow

822
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:42,040
where the grog at the grog is in the lower deck I go to the lower day do and

823
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,600
in the hold is that where Davey Jones well the grog I should say the grog that

824
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:53,200
is accessible for the weak supplies is in the lower deck the the hold has like the

825
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,160
majority of your like food stuffs like our guys what's our what's our figure

826
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:11,700
head what was it what was on galax Q pack cuz it was this ship belonged to what's

827
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,560
her name what's his name French ball mm-hmm what was his figurehead his

828
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:33,400
figurehead was a picture of me and what are you doing in the picture it's my

829
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,400
presidential portrait okay he wanted his favorite nephew to be his ship that's

830
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:47,240
adorable that's so he couldn't get you so he just gave the sculptor a picture

831
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:58,240
made a picture frame. I'm not paying anymore. It has like a fold in the back. Patridge I tried to do my best here I think I think this is

832
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,840
pretty good though right it's it's sort of a kind of a postmodern take on is

833
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:07,240
this trunchable before he became before he died before he yeah yeah before he

834
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,680
- You came too old to speak before he died.

835
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,360
'Cause he had a brief moment of lucidity

836
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,240
right before his death where he slow danced with you

837
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,580
and you went through puberty.

838
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,420
- Oh yeah.

839
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,480
- Yeah.

840
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,100
Look, I tried my best here.

841
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,200
I kinda think it ended up being

842
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,000
a more of a post-modern sort of thing.

843
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,560
- So how old, this is a flashback.

844
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,080
- Yeah, you're like a teenager or like a--

845
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,840
- Yeah, that is, that is, that is, that looks pretty good.

846
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,440
- One day this ship will be yours, kid, I'm telling you.

847
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,540
- Oh, I can't wait.

848
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,040
Oh yeah, you're my-

Hold on.

852
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,540
What's that? The call of adventure.

853
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,040
You see, I'm a very famous hero.

854
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,540

You're gonna have sorta issues because I abandon you all the time for adventure.

858
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,540
But you're gonna live up to those issues.

859
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,540
Yeah, you're my favorite uncle since my mom and dad died.

860
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,540

future episodes are going to be have more direction. I promise yeah East

905
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,580
East and East and East is forever. Yeah, that's that's our thing. Now we're

906
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,100
trying to prove the world's round. That's a we're going to have to go all

907
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,980
the way around from the other side at the at this time. Do people believe that

908
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,320
earth is round no okay yeah we're gonna prove it yeah that's what we're gonna go

909
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,520
fucking that's the you guys didn't go Magellan on this yeah that's the campaign

910
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,360
yeah we go all the way we prove the earth is round well it's actually a

911
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,800
plan a bomb yes we are planet ebon yeah we've we've way is plenty we're trying

912
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,800
to get as far away as you're a man from Sullivan we accidentally prove that the

913
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Yeah, we think we're going...

914
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,800
We're getting this far away from Sullivan.

915
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
[Laughter]

916
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,800
And we accidentally become the greatest

917
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,800
explorers ever. We found the angle.

918
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Wait, that is so funny.

919
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,800
Yeah, that's perfect.

920
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
You guys are listening

921
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,800
live to

922
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,800
us figuring out maybe the greatest D&D

923
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
campaign of all time. You guys realize

924
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,800
that Sullivan is west

925
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,800
and you decide we need to

926
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,800
go as far away as possible

927
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:53,080
East and you end up going around yeah okay I like that adventure here's a

928
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,520
thing okay I guess I gotta figure that out because I have in my mind your map

929
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,400
the geography yeah well the geography of the planet is it's a planet so the length

930
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,720
of time it would take you to go all the way around what would that 180 days it's

931
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,440
- It's not around the planet in 180 days?

932
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,520
- A year and a half?

933
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,480
Sailing?

934
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,480
How big is planet E-bomb in comparison to Earth?

935
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,120
- How long did Greta Thunberg do it?

936
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,960
- How big is planet E-bomb?

937
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,800
- Planet E-bomb?

938
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,120
I mean, it's not as big as Earth.

939
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,080
It's sort of--

940
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,400
- So it's smaller.

941
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,240
- That's correct.

942
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,320
- Maybe the size of Mercury?

943
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,160
- It's closer to--

944
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,600
- Or the moon?

945
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,560
- The moon is actually--

946
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,400
- So a sixth of the size.

947
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,220
- So it's pretty small, yes.

948
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,800
- Would it take the amount of time

949
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,700
for Mercury to go around the sun?

950
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,940
we're gonna do science right now and i can't have a longer i think i love

951
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,320
science

952
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,540
would also have around the place a little around the world it takes three years

953
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,200
okay so a sixth of that is half a year yeah so it's six months

954
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,780
no shit so bad

955
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,380
six months yeah we need six six months eighty eight days

956
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,720
uh... here we go with the everybody listening to the other ninety days

957
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,160
whenever everybody listening

958
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,160
A little behind the scenes thing here.

959
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
It is 180 days.

960
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,160
Around Ebaums world in 180 days.

961
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,560
Yeah, that's what I knew it.

962
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:14,640
The guys are about to go on tour and so we wanted to make sure that we got a couple episodes

963
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,240
in because we were excited about that.

964
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,240
If that's okay, is that okay?

965
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,920
Oh no, I just almost fell out of my chair.

966
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,600
He does that every single day.

967
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Everyone needs to know.

968
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,840
No, no, so what I want, what I like about this is this is going to, so for everyone

969
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:34,080
at home, this is going to give me enough time to sort of rework this campaign around the

970
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,080
idea of you guys going around the world the other way. I'm going to figure out

971
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:44,400
the map of E-bomb, the pre-gun city map of E-bomb. I'll figure out, to

972
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,000
the best of my ability, I'll leave some blanks, strategic blanks as a DM. I

973
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,960
really, I think this is extremely fun. Okay, I like this. 180 days.

974
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:00,040
180 days, so it'll be a six-month journey. 180 sessions. 180 sessions. 180 episodes.

975
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,040
God willing, right?

976
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,040
But, okay.

977
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,040
Meanwhile,

978
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,040

979
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,040

You guys hear a song.

981
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,040

Thank you. Damn it. I opened up the wrong. Hold on

991
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,860
Actually, you have excellent charisma too because you're your pal 17 Dogen. I rolled a 17

992
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,460
Okay

995
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,400
You guys hear the most beautiful song you've ever heard. Oh

996
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,420
Something in a thing I'm hearing how to sing it by the same Pablo sing it I'm gonna sing it yeah, okay?

997
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,300
Whatever we're hearing or else. I can't find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

998
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,900
oh

999
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,440
My god, uh do you hear that bullshit? Yeah?

1000
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:21,940
I'm going crazy. Oh my god. The same sound is him just for a different reason you're passing the

1001
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:25,380
the shard from another realm through your ass right now.

1002
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,620
(laughing)

1003
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,460
- Oh.

1004
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,420
(laughing)

1005
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,940
Oh, oh my God.

1006
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,500
- You see, your, your, your, your,

1007
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,660
sorry, my words are failing me here.

1008
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,260
Your quartermaster, Wayne, the half-orc,

1009
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,180
he says, he's, oh shit, actually I need him to roll.

1010
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:44,700
- Quartermaster, half-orc.

1011
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,420
- Uh-oh.

1012
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,060
He's like, we're gonna have to sail towards that sound.

1013
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,340
We need to figure out what it is.

1014
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,340
No, it's a, it's a, uh, don't do that.

1015
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,340
You're in the bathroom.

1016
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,340
It's a, I, don't do that.

1017
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,340
It's a siren of some sort.

1018
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,340
Weeeeee, that kind of siren?

1019
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,340
What do you mean?

1020
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,340
It's, I, well, I mean, I got like a 17, right?

1021
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
Yeah, you know what it is.

1022
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
You guys have been sailing for a while.

1023
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,340
Yeah, I know it's a siren.

1024
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,340
And then we're going to roll one more charisma saving throw.

1025
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,340
All of us?

1026
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,340
No, no, I'm rolling.

1027
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Just me.

1028
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
Okay.

1029
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,340
Good, because I got a three.

1030
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,540
So it is sirens singing on the rocks.

1031
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,620
There's also a ship in a bikini that is singing, and your ship hears that and it fails and

1032
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,620
it screws the sailing throat.

1033
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:38,020
And it is sailing towards these rocks, and you see these sirens there.

1034
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,220
You two are completely enamored.

1035
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,900
You are the only one who is not enamored, Patrick.

1036
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,820
Can I move the ship?

1037
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:50,420
You can try to grab the helm from Wayne right now.

1038
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,420
I'm going to try and do that.

1039
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,420
What are you doing?

1040
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,460
Get away from here!

1041
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,460
I'm being random.

1042
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,140
What do you want to do to do it?

1043
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,740
Do you want to just like wrestle him forward?

1044
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,740
Do you have like a...

1045
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,580
Because you've got more tools than a toolkit.

1046
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,060
I do Cosby Show intro face.

1047
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,060
I do the...

1048
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,340
I put my hands over my face and I go like...

1049
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:17,340
I don't know what that does.

1050
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,340
It just made me laugh.

1051
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,340
Does that make Wayne laugh?

1052
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
Yes.

1053
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,340
Roll performance check.

1054
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,340
Did you get a crit 20?

1055
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,340
A nat 20?

1056
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,340
He goes like...

1057
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:38,340
And he's supposed to be a doctor?

1058
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,840
(laughter)

1059
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,180
- He's so silly.

1060
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:46,220
- Okay, yeah, you can take control of the wheel.

1061
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,020
- I guess I just steer it away from wherever the siren is.

1062
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,860
- Okay, the siren--

1063
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,340
- Why don't you wanna hear this song?

1064
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:57,340
- 'Cause I don't wanna have sex with these women.

1065
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,940
It's not gonna, they're gonna lead us into rocks

1066
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,300
and they're gonna break the ship.

1067
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,140
- Okay. - Huh?

1068
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,500
- Huh? - Huh?

1069
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,420
- Huh? - My hand keeps--

1070
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,220
- She's not my girl. - I keep like--

1071
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,820
you've ever seen before. I keep involuntarily putting my hook hand down my pants and going

1072
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:18,260
OW! OW! It's over and over. And in my pants too. Yeah. And in his pants too. The way that

1073
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,700
body moving. You hear all this, this is rolling off your shoulders though. You've heard this,

1074
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,860
you know, you got Acon's number. I know, yeah. You got this man. Can I call Acon on my pirate

1075
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:36,860
phone? No, but that's a pretty good lie. They did have phones in pirate times. I've actually

1076
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:44,300
wait wait wait can I call can I call a con on my soul stone why do you think a

1077
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,900
comet have a soul stone he definitely soul stones in Wind Waker he definitely

1078
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,740
got a pirate a cons of a con is definitely a pirate my bad yes sorry

1079
00:58:54,740 --> 00:59:00,020
I'm the DIC a pirate captain a con sounds sick that does sound cool sounds cool

1080
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:04,220
yeah I think a con as a person doesn't make any sense but as a pirate sounds

1081
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:08,020
pretty cool. I like your hat actually. Yeah, I could be wrong though. I'm gonna

1082
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,220
roll to see if Akon's a pirate. I got a 12, he's a pirate.

1083
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:21,620
It's a genius DM move. Yeah, the genius DM move is just do what you want.

1084
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:27,700
I'll roll for it, fine. Okay, so you can try to steer the ship out of this

1085
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:34,100
situation, Patrick. So for that I'm gonna have you, I mean this, this you

1086
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,700
I'm trying to think of what the,

1087
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,060
this should really be a strength check

1088
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,540
because the ship itself has a will,

1089
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,580
but it's moving towards.

1090
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,880
You don't have to contend with Wayne anymore,

1091
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,260
but you do have to contend with the ship's own will

1092
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,020
as it is very attracted to the ship with the bikini

1093
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,420
that is on the rocks.

1094
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,260
- Okay.

1095
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,940
- So roll a strength check,

1096
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,100
and you can try other things too.

1097
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,580
You can try to fuck with the sails,

1098
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,940
if with throwing knives,

1099
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,820
or you know, be playful with this.

1100
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,540
- I look down, I stomp on the ship,

1101
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:12,380
I say, "Hey, check this out." And I do Gangnam Style. You're going to try to out-charisma

1102
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:20,140
the sirens? Yeah. Oh, I don't think it's going to work, man. You don't know that. Do a performance

1103
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:25,560
check. If you get higher than 18. Wait, I wouldn't roll a charisma saving throw? No,

1104
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,220
this is a performance check to try to charm the ship. It's really a persuasion check.

1105
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,380
If you get higher than a natural 18, I'll let it go.

1106
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,420
'Cause these are sign-wise.

1107
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,960
- Higher than a natural 18?

1108
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,760
- Yeah. - At or above an 18?

1109
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,840
- Yes, at or above.

1110
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,620
- Okay. - 'Cause these are sign.

1111
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,820
- And it's a persuasion check?

1112
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:45,980
- Disroll the die. - Performance.

1113
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:49,660
- Yes, but it's nothing to do with your own natural charisma.

1114
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,420
It's just the roll itself.

1115
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,740
20! - Oh my God!

1116
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,900
- No way! - Oh!

1117
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,040
(laughing)

1118
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,380
Holy shit, dude.

1119
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,540
- Wait, two Nat 20s in like four rolls?

1120
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,380
- No, I hope you guys have a good tour.

1121
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,220
- In a row.

1122
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,040
- I hope you guys have a good...

1123
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,740
(laughing)

1124
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,580
- We're done, we're done.

1125
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,780
I hope you guys have a good tour.

1126
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,140
(laughing)

1127
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,580
You ship a voice of siren.

1128
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,820
(laughing)

1129
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,740

- I just started enjoying the song, man.

1133
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,740

1134
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,660
- I'm sirening to "Gangnam Style."

1135
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:24,300

1136
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,140
- Gravitating to "Gangnam Style."
