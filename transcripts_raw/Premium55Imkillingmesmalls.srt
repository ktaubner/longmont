[Explosion]

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
Welcome to cum.

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,300
[Groans]

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,500
Oh, God.

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,000
How do-

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,300
[Groans]

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,200
Oh, God.

12
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,900
How do Hawaiian people just fucking do that every morning?

13
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,800
What, eat- I don't think Hawaiian people eat what you made every morning.

14
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,900
Yeah, I don't think Hawaiian people are real, Caleb.

15
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,000
[Laughter]

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Every day they eat four King's Hawaiian rolls, four eggs, and four pieces of spam.

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,680
Yeah.

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:32,920
Every day.

19
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,600
Did you give us each four eggs?

20
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,080
Yeah, I did.

21
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,360
That's probably why I shit so much.

22
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,920
Yeah, we've been just taking turns raw dogging my toilet.

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,160
Everybody in this apartment just shit one after another.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:45,480
Yeah.

25
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,800
Yeah.

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,800
Oh yeah, dude, you know what sucks is I took the longest because for some reason

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,480
I was about to get up and then immediately felt it in my stomach that I needed to sit back down.

28
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,440
You had a crap attack.

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,760
I did. I did. Thankfully I have a whole thing of Pepto with me if you guys...

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,960
Now you're doing a cap attack.

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,760
If you want to check.

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,320
True.

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm not lying.

34
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,440
True.

35
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
Why do you cap someone?

36
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,800
You cap dude.

37
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
Are you the capper? Are you kidding me?

38
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,200
I... Are you kidding me?

39
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,080
He was capping this... You saw him. You heard him this morning. He was capping.

40
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,960
I was not capping.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,560
You guys both cap all day.

42
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,440
No, no.

43
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,360
No, you know what? You're the capper.

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,920
No, I'm not.

45
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,120
You're the capper of the group.

46
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,160
What have I capped about? Everything. You capped about- See? You're capping dude. You capped about fucking loving me earlier. Yeah, that's true. I was not capping.

47
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
Oh wow. Real shit?

48
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
*laughter*

49
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,960
Real shit.

50
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,800
I think Cam is like- the thing about Cam is he sat in my doorway,

51
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,240
and he was such a like menacing large figure that I accidentally fell in love.

52
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,020
So now that's something you have to deal with dude. You have to fucking deal with that dude. What? Yeah.

53
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
I was just telling him I caught feelings for him.

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,540
He caught feelings for me. I caught feelings. I'm just trying to fall in love before this world ends you feel me yeah, I

I fell in love with my breakfast this morning before I the rules of a gracious God

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,440
And he tells me to fucking love camera with all my heart. Yeah, that's what I've been doing

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,360
Yeah, this is why I don't eat breakfast this breakfast did damage dude that yeah, okay, but that's not like a normal breakfast

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,100
That's a normal breakfast. No you shouldn't be eating that regular like a month's worth of fucking chicken eggs

60
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,140
Yeah, yeah bunch of green onion and

61
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:32,020

62
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,900
And you made that it would have yeah, we had to ramp it up. Yeah, you know, yeah

00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,260

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,420
No, yeah, you're gonna get like one of those like golden corral salads

66
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,780
It's all croutons and bacon bits. Doesn't matter. Blue cheese on it. It's still healthy. You're right. It's so healthy. If it says salad

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,780
It means it's healthy. Yeah

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,000
That's not macaroni salad. Those are all healthy. You're right salad. Yeah, mayonnaise and Polish salad

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,060
What's that a steak?

70
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,460
Yeah paper clips and twigs from the ground

71
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,740
Broken glass. Yeah, and you can't find it also. Yeah

72
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,140
You serve it on you serve it by a bowl upside down they serve it in a colander

73
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,580
And then they pour dressing all over a Polish soup bowl

74
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,980
Stupid fucking poles. Oh

75
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,580
I can't believe what they do those Polak pieces of shit Cameron and sex chair the only two Polish people I know I think

76
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,040
Yeah, pretty rare. Yeah, not that rare not rare enough if he asked me

77
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,160
They keep getting lost on their way.

78
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Exactly.

79
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
To the states.

80
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Yeah.

81
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Not a lot of Polish people in America.

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,880
There's a lot of us.

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
There's not a lot of you.

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
There's a ton.

85
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
No.

86
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
More than anyone else.

87
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't think so.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,760
I think it's Cameron the Capper again.

89
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,500
Yeah, guess who's capping?

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Look who's capping now.

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Yeah, look who's capping now.

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Yeah.

93
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Look who's capping too.

94
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Yeah, look who's--

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,800
Look who's capping the first one.

96
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yeah.

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
You're capping, obviously.

98
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah.

99
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Come on, man.

100
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Come on, man. I got feelings too, man.

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Look who's talking now was the one with the dogs, right?

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Yeah.

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Yeah, because the kids could talk.

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Yeah, it's like, okay, the kids talk, the dogs talk, now the food talks.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
First the baby talks.

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
That was a hot dog party with Seth Rogen.

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah, sausage party.

108
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Hot dog. Hot dog bash.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Did you guys see that movie?

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
No.

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:39,800
It was fucking terrible, dude.

112
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I know that the animators were abused.

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Really?

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I think most animators are abused.

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
It's true.

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Animators, because they're not like famous actors.

117
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah, they're allowed to get abused.

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Nobody cares.

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
They'll work an 80 hour week.

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
There is an animators union,

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
but all the things in the animators union

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
are just things that let you get abused.

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
We get to have candy for breakfast.

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
The animators union is like

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
you cannot make me draw Spongebob as a circle.

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,800
That's it. That's all you get as an animator. And let me say, animators, it's a tough job.

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
The real American heroes.

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Do you think it's easy?

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, it's tough if you do it as a job, but if you do it as a hobby, it's the easiest thing in the world.

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
That's not true.

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
You okay?

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Thank you.

133
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800

(laughing)

147
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,940
Hate to see you cry, but I love when you lose your mind.

148
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,420
- Hair ties, sweatpants on, chilling with no makeup on.

00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,660

177
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,100
- God damn, you sound like Lou Ferrigno right now.

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,940
- You got those hooky hands.

179
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,760
- You sound just like him.

180
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,600
- You got them hands, too.

181
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,660
- Oh my God.

182
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,840
- Mama, real shit, you green as hell.

183
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,680
- You green?

184
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,880
- God damn, if it ain't sexy.

185
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,680
- You got them purple shorts on.

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
You got the-- man, you ripped out of your clothes!

187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
You ripped out your damn shirt, bitch!

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
You ripped out your damn shirt thinking about me.

189
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Fuck, you look bad.

190
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,680
You know what's crazy is, uh, they have the She-Hulk.

191
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,680
So they have Hulk, but then they have his cousin, Jessica Banner, I think her name is.

192
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Why do they have to be cousins? Wasn't he an experiment?

193
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,680
I think she got a blood transfusion from him.

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Real fucking smart idea, Bruce.

195
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Yeah, great move, dude.

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
He was the only person who could do it or whatever.

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,760
but so she gets a blood transfusion she becomes she Hulk the only thing that

198
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,140
changes about her is that she just becomes like a beautiful green

199
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,640
Amazonian woman no Hulk stuff no what do you mean no Hulk's she's

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,200

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,160

208
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'd love for her to fucking snap my dong off in her snatch.

209
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
See, no, she just looks...

210
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Yeah, exactly.

211
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
She just looks like normal.

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Yeah, dude, she's got a fucking thick ass.

213
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Right.

214
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
She's got a fucking horse ass on her.

215
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,920
Yeah, the whole point of the Hulk is that he's a Hulk.

216
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
Can you search She-Hulk ass?

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
No.

218
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
What the hell, man?

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Can you look up She-Hulk cosplay ass?

220
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,920
Yeah.

221
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
She-Hulk Cosby.

222
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
Yeah, no, that's different.

223
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
See look how big she is.

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's for the cover.

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's like big.

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
She's literally fucking 12 feet tall.

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,880
No, she doesn't get that tall in the rest of it.

228
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
That's just because of the cover.

229
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,400
She Hulk is like at least like...

230
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Hey Patrick.

231
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Because she's a woman they make her like 6 feet tall.

232
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Hey Patrick.

233
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Hold on.

234
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Hold on.

235
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
You have something to say.

236
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Hey Patrick.

237
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
What?

238
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
You capping?

239
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
No!

240
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
No!

241
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Yep, capping again dude.

242
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm on the She Hulk Wikipedia page.

243
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,200
I'm going to command F muscles.

244
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay?

245
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,560
she has a crush on hercules

246
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,260
because they're the same size. Yeah, she's herculean. Yeah, she probably

247
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,860
look her.

248
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,160
That's right.

249
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,860
Damn.

250
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
Look up there.

251
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
It's like the hercules.

252
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,060
She's like her.

253
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm him.

254
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,660
Julie's dude.

255
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,960
Now she's fucking big and green big.

256
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
Turning green is enough already.

257
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,260
Yeah, that wouldn't yeah.

258
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,660
I wouldn't say I wouldn't see someone who turns green when they're angry and

259
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,580
like that guy's nothing like the Hulk. You're almost nothing like the Hulk.

260
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,500
She just becomes six foot seven. That's the only thing. She just becomes a WNBA

261
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,640
player. That I will say, that's not as tall as she should be. Right. Yeah. She should be at

262
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,420
least seven feet and way bigger. How tall is she? The Hulk is only 5'9".

263
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,320
That's not true. That's what it says. Not when he's Hulked out. Okay, this is as Bruce Banner. I

264
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,060
searched Hulk height and it says approximately 5'9". He's got to be alright.

265
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,500
Oh seven and eight between seven and eight feet tall. That's not that tall though. Eight feet tall

266
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,460
Well, no between seven and eight feet if he's seven feet tall. He's like shorter than Yao Ming

267
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,660
Yeah, Yao Ming's a fucking Chinese. Okay, but she Hulk goes from five one to six seven. Yeah

268
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,380
Well, that's just do and then when she she Hulk she weighs 650 pounds

269
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,660
That's a big bitch. No, that's what it says right here. Okay. Well, maybe that's fucking a baby

270
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah, that's a hundo doesn't look like she weighs 600 pounds. You want to be fat?

271
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, muscle weighs more than fat brother. I want I want a hulk she has a fucking 18 pack

272
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,920
And I want to step on my balls. Yeah

273
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,500
When I crush my balls like a fucking car. Mm-hmm. Yeah, bitch

274
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,900
She Hulk I want you to fucking I want you to tear me

275
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,460
Listening to this you split me in half. Yeah, I want you to shoot me in the head with a rifle

276
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,740
I would start committing crimes to see if she could stop me. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no

277
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,220
difference from the Hulk unlike Bruce Jennifer Walters retains control over

278
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,940
her Hulk form and emotional intelligence making she Hulk stories even more

279
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,620
captivating

280
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:03,280
intelligent storyline people are so she's like a lawyer she Hulk and then

281
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,840
she'll do like all she's hulk yeah really

282
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:23,160
yeah I think we have to throw this case out she's intimidating the jury I think

283
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm falling in love with this green lawyer bitch mm-hmm yeah damn I think

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,960
she my new wife yeah I wish it they were still trying to just turn every every

285
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,280
a superhero into a girl version. When I hear She-Hulk, I'm just... They still are. What

286
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,240
are you talking about? They're not adding new ones are they? What do you mean adding

287
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,480
new ones? There's not like a girl version of Shazam. I think there probably was in the

288
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,280
70s. There is, yeah. Shazam? Aw, shit! Captain Marvel is a girl version of Captain Marvel.

289
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,040
I think Captain Marvel likes girls. They just made a girl Thor. They made a girl Thor. They're

290
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,840
doing that more than ever dude. They changed Thor into a girl in the comics. Yeah, well

291
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,040
that's a while ago. My bad. But I mean still recently. I'm gonna get ahead, I'm gonna get

292
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,600
in front of this I was capping so that's well yeah they're getting the 70s they

293
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,840
would just be like I guess literally just them sitting around like oh what if

294
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,880
Thor was a girl those broads are up to 20 cents on the dollar we got a start

295
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,320
appealing to them no but the thing the complaint I have about she Hulk is it

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:28,240
would be way cooler if it was just Hulk in like a girl wig what when you hear

297
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,520
She-Hulk that's what you think right like not like not really I mean I don't I

298
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,600
think about the She-Hulk that I know a girl a girl who turns green and muscular

299
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,520
and big you want to you want her to be like wide you want to be like lunch lady

300
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,320
you want her to just wear shorts it should be it should be like an ugly

301
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,200
woman who turns into the Hulk is like a big ugly woman with like a giant mole

302
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:57,960
mm-hmm right and the mole turns purple into a second face look I'm just trying

303
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,960
spread body positivity yeah yeah I know that's like your project yeah yeah yeah

304
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,160

No water, please

315
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:15,720
Only I get the water I'll make water into you. Oh you thirsty, huh?

316
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,920
Oh no, we're going to get in so much trouble with the army.

317
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
Oh no, not again.

318
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,600
Caleb's going to get in trouble with the army again.

319
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,280
Whatever, I'll fight for the army.

320
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm saying it right now.

321
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,160
I waive all of my rights to deny service.

322
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,240
It would be funny if I joined the army.

323
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,800
Would you think that would be funny?

324
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
What would be funny about that?

325
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,080
It would be funny if I got jacked.

326
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,280
That would be really funny.

327
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,140
If you had to get jacked for your job, you should go completely Kumail.

328
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,020
You should get an acting gig where you have to play a fucking, I don't know.

329
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,460
You should be She-Hulk, dude.

330
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,080
Oh my God.

331
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
That'd be huge.

332
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
That'd be amazing.

333
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
You'd be huge.

334
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
In green.

335
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Yeah.

336
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Yeah.

337
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm thinking about it.

338
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,840
You could finally play the character the way you want to see it.

339
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:13,160
Or you could get hired to do a Wario biopic movie.

340
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,880
And then you have to get ripped for the young Wario scenes.

341
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,120
Before he eats all the garlic.

342
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,640
Before he somehow got fat off garlic, which as far as I know has zero calories.

343
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
But he ate so much of it.

344
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,760
You know why he is fat, right?

345
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Does he have a thyroid issue?

346
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Oh, that's so sad.

347
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah, that's why he's called Wario.

348
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Why?

349
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
I don't fucking know.

350
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:41,120
I had a teacher in elementary school, she was a very big lady, I think she did have

351
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,480
a thyroid problem named Mrs. Wario. But she had a U in her name. Maybe she lived in a food

352
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,360
dessert. Food dessert? Don't mind if I fucking do. Sounds delicious, dude. What's that, flan?

353
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,040
So we're mad about giving poor people food desserts? No way. So we're mad that people

354
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:07,680
are getting birthday cake and fucking crunchy candies? You know, I'll say it. You cap it.

355
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,440
I would love to live in a food desert.

356
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Me too.

357
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,960
I'd love to live in Gourmet Race.

358
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
From Gertie.

359
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,800
I would live in a castle made out of Jell-O that never got destroyed.

360
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
Kim, do you still have those tums?

361
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Jell-O.

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,120
It would look beautiful.

363
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,080
I mean just think about- A Jell-O castle.

364
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,160
I don't think it would be very convenient to live-

365
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
It would be like a Jell-O castle.

366
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,520
To walk around inside Jell-O, but imagine how it would look.

367
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Like a- That's a good point.

368
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
It would just look cool.

369
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,680
And also, if you're going to live in a food house, you want it to be something that you

370
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
can really eat.

371
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,880
Like, fuck a gingerbread house.

372
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm gonna live in a beef jerky apartment.

373
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
The beef jerky with no studio.

374
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Yeah.

375
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
The beef jerky is just a square.

376
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
There's no...

377
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
All the furniture is normal.

378
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
It's just that the walls, floors and ceiling.

379
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't need a kitchen. Guess what I'm fucking eating? Beef jerky.

380
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
Yeah.

381
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Off my wall.

382
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Yeah, it regenerates.

383
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Man, I'm gonna live in the soup yurt.

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Yeah, that's right.

385
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
It's not convenient at all.

386
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Isn't it so fucked up that Jell-O's made out of like...

387
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Horses?

388
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah, horses and bones.

389
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Bones and furs.

390
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Not really.

391
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,120
Would you rather them just throw the bones in the ocean?

392
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,480
No, it's just like...

393
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,120
You cap it.

394
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,880
It's weird that like jello is like fruit flavored.

395
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,720
Whenever in the store, me and Jana will walk by like the meat section and there's like

396
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,880
chicken hearts in like a big bucket, she'll be like, "Oh, it's so sad."

397
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
And it's like, "What else? You want them to fucking... They're either going in you or your

398
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,960
dog." Like that's the rule with all the weird parts of a chicken.

399
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,920
I'll eat any part of a chicken. I don't care. Yeah. Yeah, I've been thinking I've never had liver. Would you eat brain?

400
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,520
If somebody put it in front of me, maybe I think I would I feel like it's too tender

401
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I feel like it had to be like I

402
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,280
Worried that I would acquire a taste for it and I could only brain the rest. Yeah, you get Kuru because you eat tongue

403
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah

404
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,280
Do you've eaten tongue? Yeah, I've been looking at a lot of beef tongue like it's fucking good

405
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,960
Like yeah, you've been looking in the mirror. Yeah, your beef tongue shredded be like a like a beef tongue

406
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,200
sandwich is really good. Yeah I've been looking at like those like you know

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,180
those chefs that wear like the black gloves like the pitmasters and shit on

408
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,440
Instagram and they've been cooking I've seen a guy cook beef tongue and I was

409
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,220
like like as a kid I you know what it was it was the Goonies that scared me

410
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,640
away from tongue. That scene where Mama Fratelli's like oh you got new food

411
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,200
and she goes like oh yeah we've got tongue and she pulls out the knife and

412
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,200
puts up the Corey Feldman's tongue. So I thought tongue every anytime you saw

413
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,280
tongue. You thought it was Corey Feldman's tongue. I thought it was Corey Feldman's tongue.

414
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,880
I don't want which is I don't want to eat anything

415
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Yeah

416
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
right

417
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:47,900
What a sad story though, yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel so bad for that guy. Yeah, he lost his tongue just for being in a movie

418
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,800
They take off your tongue if you're too good of a child actor mm-hmm

419
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:02,040
What's the weirdest meat you've ever eaten come on man Michael J. Let the dead fucking rest in peace fucking yeah

420
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,960
Let them fucking fuck kids in hell.

421
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Just fucking leave them alone.

422
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Come on, dude.

423
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,360
Weirdest meat I've ever eaten is probably, I mean, it's probably gator.

424
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah, gator's good though.

425
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
Gator is good.

426
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
It's like chicken.

427
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah.

428
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
It's like basically exactly like chicken.

429
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
Fried gator is so good.

430
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
I think I had fried gator too.

431
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,880
We've talked about it before, but every like weird meat just tastes like chicken.

432
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah.

433
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
I've never had any sort of gamey meat.

434
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
I've never had like elk or anything.

435
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
You've never had venison?

436
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,520
You've never had wild boar?

437
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
No.

438
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Have you?

439
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Yeah.

440
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,360
- Big pig, right?

441
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,200
- My cousin--

442
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
- Yeah, it's like, I don't know if it was just

443
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,800
the preparation of it, but it was very salty.

444
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,640
Very like--

445
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
- There's like a ranch in California

446
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,320
that my cousin went to to hunt wild boar,

447
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,560
and they caught like one of the biggest ones

448
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,520
they'd ever had, and it was worth like all this

449
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,640
fucking money, and they could have like sold it

450
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,620
to the place and made a bunch of money,

451
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,000
but instead they were like, no, we want all this meat.

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,840
And so for like four years, he's had frozen,

453
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,280
it's like an entire frozen boar in his fucking freezer.

454
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,640
- Dude, that's fucking sick.

455
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,380
And he doesn't even really like it. He was just like, "Yeah, dude, it's just if somebody

456
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,540
comes over, I tell him the story about killing the boar and then we eat him for lunch."

457
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Yeah.

458
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
I mean, that's not that bad.

459
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,420
No, there's nothing bad about it. It's not a bad story.

460
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,900
It's like keeping your wedding cake.

461
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,660
I would turn the tusk into a pencil.

462
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,660
Oh, okay.

463
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
That's a good idea.

464
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,100
You wouldn't turn it into a shofar?

465
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,220
I would turn it into a shofar, convert to Judaism. And I'd be like--

466
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
That was my question for him.

467
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,220
And he'd be like, "Here's your--"

468
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,220
It's good that you've answered it.

469
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,620
They'd be like, "Here's your shofar," and I'd be like, "Hey, buddy, brought my own."

470
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,620
What's a shofar?

471
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Sorry.

472
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,620
A shofar is a thing that-- it's a horn.

473
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:39,420
I think it's a ram's horn that they blow in the middle of the fucking service.

474
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,140
So you're saying that Jews have horns?

475
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
In a way.

476
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
In a way, they do.

477
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Yeah.

478
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Shofars, yeah.

479
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,100
It's not on their head, yeah.

480
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
That thing's sick, though.

481
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,700
But in the middle of the service, like, the rabbi will be, like, speaking some fucking

482
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,500
gibberish and then you'll just hear like "BRAAAA" like the loudest thing you've ever

483
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,460
fucking heard and you'll look back.

484
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,660
That's the interrupting cow.

485
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,540
And it's yeah.

486
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Exactly.

487
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,060
The interrupting antisemitism cow.

488
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
Yeah.

489
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
Come on man.

490
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
What?

491
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
What about that?

492
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,060
What?

493
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,700
So it's the antisemitism cow from Twitter.

494
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
What's Twitter?

495
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
It's the interrupting cow.

496
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,260
I don't give a fuck about that guy.

497
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Yeah.

498
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Yeah.

499
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
We should start one of those accounts.

500
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Yeah.

Why would we say that?

522
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,220
If it was to my cousin.

523
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,740

- Well, we never had President Breasts

564
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,860
because of 2016 Russian interference.

- Yeah, I think we'll have a woman president soon,

569
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,220
but I think it's either because Joe Biden dies of old age

570
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,940
or we'll have like a Nazi woman for president.

571
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,180

from the oh yeah they didn't have coronitas back then but could you

639
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,600
imagine Andre the Giant holding a coronita drink with his pinky yeah it's a

640
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,320
thimble for him yeah yeah you need the bottle he would he could eat that glass

641
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,680
he would think it was a wax bottle candy yeah that's right I would have loved to

642
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,840
be a humongous guy I yeah it's funny that there was like that was a time you

643
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,320
have to shit in the bathtub. I just remembered that. Andre the Giant used to have to shit

644
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
in his bathtub.

645
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
I think, okay, so the thing is, Andre the Giant--

646
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
The toilets were too small.

647
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,840
I think he was only like 6'8" or 6'9", but that was back when there was no like, he didn't

648
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,760
have a verified height and--

649
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,480
He was seven feet tall.

650
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,080
No, I don't think he was seven feet tall. But they said that he was seven foot eight

651
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,480
and people just believed him. But he was, I think he was closer to like 6'10", 6'11".

652
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
He was just very wide.

653
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,440
because people didn't know how big somebody was. He was just 6'3". Yeah. Yeah, he was 6 foot even.

654
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,040
Yeah. Yeah, I think, no, because they have to have his height as in his autopsy.

655
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,680
It says he was 7'4". Yeah. It's fake. No. Okay. I mean, there's a documentary on him that's really

656
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,920
good. Why wouldn't they just put that in all this information? Yeah, they're not going to not

657
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,680
measure. Now this one says 6'11". Yeah, I don't think he had a... See, I fucking told you. I

658
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
I don't think he had a verified height.

659
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
No, this one says 7 foot 0.

660
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Yeah.

661
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,680
That guy dead is the only time you can measure him.

662
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Yeah.

663
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,440
Because he's too big, first of all.

664
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,240
Well, but the thing is 6'11" is like not, I mean that's tall, of course, but it's not

665
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,440

yeah I'm you go they have a wax figurine of him yeah and you get to imagine his

680
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,800
penis Joe Rogan was the second tallest guy John Rogan oh okay there's a bit

681
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,400
pretty pretty big the Rogans really run the spectrum there yeah as far as height

682
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,720
how tall is Joe Rogan he's like five five five six you know what he's four feet one

683
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,680
yeah yeah he could be shorter he has no confirmed height actually yeah he's much

684
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:56,040
like the Andre yeah he knows what fucking size yeah I thought that the okay so the

685
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,320
tallest woman is 8 4 that's the tallest woman that's a big bitch dude current

686
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,760
tallest woman no she's dead oh the current tallest woman is dead or her

687
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,880
height is disputed but that so that the undisputed tallest woman is Zeng Jin

688
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,760
Lian from China. Really? Is that where she's from? You don't say. She could have been from she

689
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,480
could have had that name and been from San Francisco or like. Why San Francisco?

690
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,080
I said San Francisco or Oregon. Why San Francisco or Oregon? West Coast I don't know why I

691
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:37,280
pick those two. But, uh, say the height. She's eight foot one and three-fourths. Not that

692
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,840
tall. That's a man. That's not that tall. That's a huge, that's a man. Once you're over

693
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:51,400
six feet, you're a boy. No. Yeah. Anna Hanning Bates, niece one from Canada is the second

694
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,400
tallest woman. Whoa. She was 7'11". That's a funny height. She was 7'11"? I am 7'11".

695
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,160
They named all the stores after her because the guy who made 7'11" was in love with her

696
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,800
and he had a giant-ish fetish. I would love to have just like a humongous girlfriend.

697
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool, right? No, like two or three feet taller. Yeah. You know,

698
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,600
pick you up, put you on her back. Yeah. Carry you around like Yoda in a backpack. Yeah.

699
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I think I want to be a baby.

700
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Yeah.

701
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
Yeah.

702
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
You're almost there.

703
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
What do you mean almost there?

704
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
The head down.

705
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
You guys have the brains of babies.

706
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
You need a bonnet and a rattle.

707
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yeah.

708
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Should I dress up like a baby?

709
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Yeah.

710
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,160
Is that my next move?

711
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,080
Get a diaper and a rattle and a giant safety pin?

712
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,080
A crop top shirt.

713
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,080
A crop top shirt.

714
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Do I get a onesie?

715
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
No.

716
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
A baby.

717
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
You should get a pacifier.

718
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
No, because you have to look.

719
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,080
It's funny if you look like a Victorian baby, but if you're like an adult and you're dressing

720
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,040
up like a 90s baby, that's a problem. What do you mean a 90s baby? Like wearing like a Rugrats

721
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,440
onesie as an adult and you're and you got a binky too. Is this? That's weird but a Victorian baby,

722
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,800
always funny to look like. I was saying I'm gonna dress up like the New Year baby. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

723
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,240
And I'll also have, I'll have implanted into my head one extremely thick hair. Yeah one curly.

724
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,800
See that's funny. You think so? But if you're like wearing like little Pokemon footie pajamas

725
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,280
When did I say Pokemon? I feel like this is just something that's in your head.

726
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,480
I'm thinking of a specific guy. I'm thinking of Pamperchew. I don't know him.

727
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,520
Pamperchew was one of the most famous adult babies.

728
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,840
I mean the fans are gonna know. Fans are gonna go wild for this reference.

729
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,000
The kind of information that you have in your brain is just, it's amazing.

730
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,560
Yeah, I have no math knowledge but I know about an adult baby from 2008.

731
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,640
Yeah, I mean really. He would microwave his diapers. That's why. He was famous.

732
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,520
better. Well I think he had pee in the diapers. Probably smell better. Yeah.

733
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,640
Yeah. Probably sit there huff that fucking... I see the one, what's that video where they like

734
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:01,360
microwave the... there's like little... there's like gel inside a diaper. No that was Kipke.

735
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,680
That was a hack video. What was that one again? Oh was that to make snow? No, oh that was... that's

736
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,400
part of the video but it was a... it was Kipke's diaper pranks. Oh yeah and he melts like chocolate.

737
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,320
- He melts a baby Ruth into it and eats it on the camera.

738
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,160
- Yeah.

739
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
- That's normal.

740
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
I mean, he's eating candy.

741
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,080
- Exactly.

742
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,900
- It looks like a baby poop.

743
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,640
- It doesn't matter what you use for a plate.

744
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,280
- Also, it's not what baby poop looks like, dude.

745
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,960
Baby poop looks like fucking mustard.

746
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,800
- Green.

747
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,620
- Yeah.

748
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
It's horrible.

749
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,280
What are these kids eating?

750
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,120
- Yeah.

751
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,320
- That's why I think I'm gonna adopt.

752
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,720
I wanna skip the first couple years.

753
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,680
- You're gonna adopt?

754
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,520
- Yeah.

755
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
- Just solo?

756
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,880
You walking into an adoption agency?

757
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,720
- Yeah.

758
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,520
- I wanna get a baby.

759
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,480
- I'm so bored.

760
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,320
I need a kid.

761
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,960

765
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,080

Well, okay.

767
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Diane, they'll throw the candy to you.

768
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
I love you, my daughter, Diane.

769
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah, I might adopt, but I don't want one of those, like,

770
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,080
one of those kids who, like, you fucking, you get the kid,

771
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,080
you raise it until it's like five, and then you realize

772
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,080
that his dad was, like, Osama Bin Laden or something.

773
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,080
Yeah, his dad was Darth Vader.

774
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Well, that would kind of be a cash cow.

775
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
No.

776
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Okay.

777
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,200
That's not because when Darth Vader comes back looking for his droids, you're either

778
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,920
getting set on fire.

779
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,160
I won't care.

780
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Yeah?

781
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,400
I'll just kind of sit there and smile Riley.

782
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Yeah?

783
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
And just be like.

784
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Smile at Riley?

785
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Uncle Owen.

786
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,400
I don't care.

787
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru got their shit cooked.

788
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
Aunt Peru?

789
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
Aunt Beru.

790
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Oh.

791
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Yeah.

792
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,160
I just don't want something like that to happen so I think I'm going to make my wife shoot

793
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,440
a baby out of her thingy.

794
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Yeah?

795
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Yeah.

796
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Yeah.

797
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,080
Adoption, we'll just say it. It's kind of lame.

798
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,440
I don't think it's lame.

799
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
I think it's bad.

800
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,200
I think it's cooler that you get to choose.

801
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,680
Hey, you know what I think should be adopted?

802
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,280
Better environmental policies by the US government.

803
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,600
I say just put the kids in jail.

804
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,880
Yeah, the adopted.

805
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,840
In the orphanage.

806
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,340
Yeah.

807
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,440
Like, instead of adopting them.

808
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,400
Orphanage is a jail.

809
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,880
Just put them straight to jail. That's where they're headed anyway.

810
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,320
[laughter]

811
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,240
Just fucking, just throw them in there.

812
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,800
You know?

813
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,300
Okay.

814
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,160
Alright.

815
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,660
Yeah.

816
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,920
(laughing)

817
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,760
- Right?

818
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,580
- Yeah.

819
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,900
- You're saving a lot of heartbreak here

820
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,860
by just throwing those kids in jail.

821
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,700
You know?

822
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,660
It's like the fucking, they don't fuck, you know,

823
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,100
when they're hatching chicken eggs,

824
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,380
they throw the male ones at a fucking grinder.

825
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,200
- They do?

826
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
- Yeah.

827
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,880
- Oh, I didn't know that.

828
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,700
- They grind them up into dust.

829
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,980
- Yeah, 'cause they'll fight.

830
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,820
- That's true.

831
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,540
- We can make the kids fight.

832
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,380
- Okay.

833
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,460
- You guys ever see those Brahman chicken?

834
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,300
- No.

835
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,120
- Nope.

836
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,700
- The chicken that are like five feet tall?

837
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,540
- Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

838
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,360
- Oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

839
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Three ass legs.

840
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,200
- Yeah. - Yeah, they don't look

841
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,280
as big as they look, or they aren't as big

842
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,340
as they look in those videos.

843
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,180
- Yeah, they are pretty big. - But they are pretty big.

844
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,140
- Those things. - They're like two feet tall,

845
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,060
which is huge for a chicken.

846
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,820
- Right, that's still fucking terrifying.

847
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,180
- Yeah. - Yeah.

848
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,660
- You would hate turkeys.

849
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,540
Actually, you would hate ostriches.

850
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,740
- No. - Now that's a big bird.

851
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,580
- You know what you would hate--

852
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,660
- When I was younger, I did. - Is a 1,000 foot tall bird.

853
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,420
- Yeah. - That honestly was

854
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,740
my biggest fear when I was younger.

855
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,460
Thousand foot tall bird. I was scared of birds because of Wind Waker when I was a young kid.

856
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:36,600
Did you ever see the birds Alfred Hitchcock? No, no. I saw that when I was older and I was like this is pretty lame.

857
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,280
Yeah, he's he's they're afraid of birds. What the hell? Most of those Hitchcock movies are pretty shitty.

858
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,860
Yeah, I'm not a big fan. Yeah, I like Hitchcock.

859
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,020
You would.

860
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,260
You're capping. Yeah, if it's one of those things that you're supposed to like it like it's one of it's like I understand it

861
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,340
I understand the merits of it, but I'm not gonna like like I'm not gonna fucking sit down and watch Citizen Kane

862
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Yeah, I'm not gonna sit here and watch

863
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,540
Citizen Kane isn't

864
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:09,180
Hitchcock I know that it's not Hitchcock it is I'm just saying like like you don't need to see you can see you can see

865
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:16,220
Citizen Kane one time and I mean the truth is you don't have to watch any movies. Yeah, true. Yes. I don't it's not yeah

866
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,300
Yeah, I I definitely

867
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,540
There's so many class you do not yet. I've seen and I'll just never see yeah, I don't trust anybody

868
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,860
is like oh you haven't seen this bro this is you have this is the best movie ever

869
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,700
you have to watch this is not true the best movie ever is the movie that you

870
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,540
watch and you go that was cool yeah and then you watch it again a year later

871
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,860
i'm trying to think what movie i've probably seen more than any movie

872
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,740
wet hot american summer for me it could be that for me too i've probably seen that movie 10 times

873
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,180
i've seen that movie 15 more actually i think i've seen cars like over 100 times i've seen

874
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,860
reddit too yeah shit ton of times because i took french in high school and they would always be

875
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,180
like, "Well, we don't know what to do in class today. We're going to put on Ratatouille for

876
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,780
you guys." My younger brother, when he was like four, the only movie he would watch was Cars.

877
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,100
Yeah. So he'd watch it every single day. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Oh, dude, that's the fucking

878
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:13,260
worst thing in the world about kids. Babysitting. That's why I should adopt at like 16. Adopt a kid

879
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,780
at age 16. Yeah, because at least they'll have taste. Yeah, they have taste. They have their

880
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,660
own shit that they like, you know. But like a five-year-old, like a four-year-old or a

881
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,820
five-year-old, they're watching the same movie over and over.

882
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,320
Yeah, don't you get bored?

883
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:35,380
I think streaming has definitely solved that, but I remember my cousin's niece going over

884
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,900
to their house. We had to go over for like Christmas or something. It was like one of

885
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,660
their birthdays and my cousin was having like their party at their house, and they watched

886
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,140
chip-wrecked six times in a row.

887
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,220
Like, left them--

888
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,060
- Yeah, yeah.

889
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,140
- Fucking left it running.

890
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:48,980
They weren't in the room.

891
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:49,800
- Yeah, it was because--

892
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,200
- Shut it off, they freak out.

893
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,820
- It's because, yeah, you would just have

894
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,060
only so many DVDs.

895
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,900
- Right.

896
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,720
- Yeah.

897
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,780
- Yeah, there was a time in, like,

898
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,900
elementary school-- - They had more DVDs.

899
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,220
- I would just come home and I'd just watch

900
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,580
Holy Grail every day.

901
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,420
- Yeah. - Yeah.

902
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,260
- Yeah, I just loved it.

903
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,420
Couldn't get enough of it.

904
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,740
- Yeah, I think the movie I've seen the most times,

905
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,060
if it's not Ratatouille, it might be

906
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,140
Between Two Ferns, the movie.

907
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:20,460
Oh yeah. That's a bummer. Yeah, no dude, against my will. I've not watched that movie once.

908
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,580
Watching a movie against your will is like the worst feeling. Yeah, that's bad. I'm sure

909
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,940
there's more bad feelings than that. No, that's the worst one. Yeah, that's the worst one

910
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:32,780
in the whole world. Yeah, when it comes to things against your will, that's definitely

911
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,220
the worst one. That's number one, absolutely, uncontested. Just like watching like, having

912
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:47,220
watch like Clerks or something. Fuck that movie dude. Yeah. Why do people like that shit? I liked it like it's a good movie for like a

913
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,860
14 year old.

914
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,880
I've never seen it. If a 14 year old had made it, it would be a good movie. Yeah, no it's made by a mental 14 year old.

915
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,060
Yeah. For 14 year olds. Yeah. But I think I had a friend who uh

916
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,340
in high school when he was like 16

917
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,180
He like forced a bunch of people to watch clerks at a party and everyone got mad at him

918
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,580
That's the worst kind of guys like yeah. Hey, we should watch this when I in

919
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:18,060
College I was hanging out a friend's house and this this kid came home

920
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,480
It was one of their one of my friends roommates and they were like, hey

921
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,500
I just finished the like final cut of my my like thesis film. Let's put it on and my friends just like no

922
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:36,060
We're not gonna do that. Yeah. Yeah, why the fuck you just saved us so much fucking

923
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,740
I would never watch somebody's thesis film or you can I mean I mean fuck terrible

924
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,740
I would it would be fun to

925
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,440
Go to watch something mean to it. Yeah. Yeah, well the person in the room. No while they're in the room

926
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,460
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah, maybe on who it is. Yeah, this this person would have killed themselves. Yeah

927
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,580
Almost did just being denied the the right to show it against our will so yeah, yeah

928
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,220
Yeah, cuz it sucks. I guess it must it must

929
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,960
Yeah

930
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,820
nobody wants to watch a thesis it must suck to like spend all your time in college and like make end up making like a

931
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,940
45-minute film about mental illness coming to life and not a single person in the world wants to watch it

932
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:22,900
Yeah, it's like your parents. Yeah, sir watches 20 minutes of it and yeah, you did a great job. Yeah, and like I'm

933
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,300
Brother I'm rewatching succession for the third time. I don't have fucking time to watch this bullshit. Yeah, you know

934
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,900
Oh, the worst is uh, I don't know you guys probably didn't take film class

935
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,460
but like like the actual like like film the bolexes and shit I took that and I

936
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,540
why had like an idea for a project and then I couldn't do it because

937
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,460
Of like timing and like I couldn't get people to be in it

938
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,100
So then I was like, I guess I have to just shoot this over a weekend.

939
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,540
And it was just like a video.

940
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,260
It's it was a video of just like this skeleton that I had in my apartment.

941
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,380
And I just kind of like threw it in different places.

942
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,140
And I was like, yeah, this looks weird.

943
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,620
And then I like cut it together with like found footage.

944
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,060
You did a scary thing?

945
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,420
No, no.

946
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,340
And then I it wasn't even scary.

947
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,780
It was very, it was very stupid.

948
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,180
It was just like me, like figuring out how to use the camera.

949
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,820
So that was my final project.

950
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:27,300
I got an A for dude nice or I got like an A or a B or something and I just remember just being like that

951
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,940
Didn't deserve that like that phony shit in and getting a grade. You don't deserve. It's like the best feeling

952
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,220
Straight up. I'm sure I've said it before but in high school

953
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,500
I was such a bad student that like I would make my just teachers feel sorry for me and it got to the point where

954
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,100
One of my classes I didn't turn in my final project like at all and my teacher just gave me an a-plus

955
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,660
Yeah, my fucking--

956
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:52,000
Just like so I could graduate.

957
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,420
My film class, I got like-- that whole thing is like you can barely see anything because

958
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,080
I shot it indoors and I had no lighting and it's on film and I don't know how to expose

959
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
film.

960
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,080
Yeah.

961
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
I do not know how to use a camera at all.

962
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
Me neither.

963
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
It's all-- all of it was set to a swinging--

964
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
You just press record.

965
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
--record by--

966
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Oh, that's what that button's for?

967
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Yeah.

968
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,080
Yeah.

969
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
Oh, never mind.

970
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
I know how to use one perfectly.

971
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,080
Yeah.

972
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I'm amazing at it.

973
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,080
Yeah.

974
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
Yeah, I can do it all day.

975
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,560
films. That was always the worst thing. Watching it in a classroom.

976
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,640
Yeah. And also having that thought of like, I know how I feel when I

977
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,800
have to watch your bullshit. Right. And like me being in this class and showing

978
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,440
you fucking whatever I made and knowing that it sucks dog dick. Yeah, because I did

979
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,680
it for a grade. Yeah, because like also I always felt like I had that excuse of

980
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,760
like, well I don't actually want to do this so I don't really care. Yeah. You

981
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,360
know but it was bad I put some pretty bad shit out in college oh yeah me too yeah

982
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,120
yeah every like group project everybody like I I was always the person who

983
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,560
didn't do any of the work that's the best feeling in the world yeah getting

984
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,720
an a on a project that you did nothing on yeah when I I took it I took a game

985
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,640
design class like a board game design class in college and what a fucking

986
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,600
stupid such a stupid school but that my my group project I I mean I literally

987
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,040
really did nothing yeah and we I think that those guys are like trying to make

988
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,600
that a real board game now and like a cell and I just did absolutely nothing

989
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,840
and they're like my favorite so if they so I could sue them yeah I think I

990
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,840
probably will yeah I mean why my favorite group project shit to do is if

991
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,760
there was one person who wasn't doing anything just like make a slide with

992
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,200
nothing but like bullet points with no like with no like tag and just be like

993
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,840
all right you take this slide it's like it's just a bullet point that says like

994
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:48,200
like the effects of the effects of yeah cuz I'm also like all right go ahead

995
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,320
read the slide I'm doing nothing in the project I'm also just completely tuning

996
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:56,960
out yeah yeah every no it's so funny to just yeah to like till if I know what

997
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm talking about I'm always gonna do that to someone who doesn't because it's

998
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,480
funny the worst worst class I had that happen in was that sex and comedy

999
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,920
seminar thing I took where we had to do sexy comedies yeah we do a project on a

1000
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:17,680
movie that is only available on a DVD that the teacher has. I looked up the

1001
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,940
movie because I was like, "Ah, maybe I could like stream this so I can miss the

1002
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:28,400
class that day." It's like a $35 DVD on Amazon that like a Goodwill in

1003
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,640
like Fresno has. Sometimes you got to bite the bullet, dude. I almost bought it, dude.

1004
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,700
I almost bought it, but I knew it wouldn't have come in time. So I like watched the

1005
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,900
movie in class, had to go that day, didn't take any notes, and then had to do like

1006
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,040
a presentation on it with this kid named Wade and he fucking carried that project.

1007
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,320
Wait, Wade Wilson? Yeah, Wade Wilson. Deadpool? Yes. Dude, he put the team on his

1008
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,460
back for that one. Deadpool put the team on his back. I did fucking nothing and then

1009
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,040
the whole time I was like, "Hey man, I had a pretty weird weekend. I've been working

1010
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,680
so much." Which I was working at the time. Yeah, you don't understand how bad I've been

1011
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,640
eating. You don't understand. I had to do a bunch of... I had to do a bunch of shit.

1012
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,760
Sorry dude, I'm experiencing like a bunch of weird brain fog recently.

1013
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,800
So, I just can't do anything right now.

1014
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,800
My bad.

1015
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,600
I saw a DVD online that was too much money.

1016
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,680
I've been spiraling.

1017
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,640
The idea of a movie being that much was too much on my brain.

1018
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,120
It actually put me in a really, really dark mental spot and place.

1019
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
You know what it was though?

1020
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
I also had to do...

1021
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
I have a migraine because it's raining.

1022
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,120
I had to do the readings for that class and all the readings.

1023
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,920
I think I posted one of the things before.

1024
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,560
is probably taken down now, but it was like a thing about like the normal and the abnormal,

1025
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,800
and it's just the sentence is just repeating the words like normal and abnormal, abnormality.

1026
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,800
It's just academia is the stupidest fucking thing.

1027
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:54,520
My, there are, there are, I think, 12 professors at that school who think that I had a grandma die

1028
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,560
during their class.

1029
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1030
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,600
Because I was like, sorry, either I had to leave class earlier or didn't come to class

1031
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,440
because my grandma just died. Yeah. And actually I'm not gonna be there next

1032
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,280
week either because that's when the funeral is. Yeah. Oh and I won't be there

1033
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,400
the week after that because... Because I'll be crying. Because then I'm gonna be

1034
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,800
crying so hard, seriously. Yeah. Oh and then I have to take over her ranch. Yeah.

1035
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,640
That's gonna be the next week. Oh and then after that they're doing a TV show

1036
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,400
about me running the ranch by myself. It's gonna be on A&E, tune in. And then

1037
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,320
I'm gonna be at the Golden Globes after that. Yeah. Which I know the Golden

1038
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,820
Globes aren't that weak, but they pre tape it. Don't tell anyone. I might write a

1039
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:37,100

00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,580
long as it's this could make your career. This could make your career. You could no

1043
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:56,580

1047
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,420
like yes I did have a kid at school me too let's move on now what I told you

1048
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,300
guys about that I like one kid showed a film that he made and randomly Matt

1049
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,060
Damon was in it and then at the end it was like executive producer Chris Damon

1050
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,980
and it was like his nephew or something and he was like hey uncle Matt come be in

1051
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:38,980
my right in my vidi yeah so stupid yeah that's so crazy dude it's like you're

1052
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,500
you're hacking right you're like no clipping through college I put Matt

1053
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:48,020
Damon and all your projects yeah cuz if I'm a professor I'm gonna be like

1054
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,900
beast mode I feel like if I was a professor I would be like I would be

1055
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,780
like I would create it worse. Yeah. If I saw that Matt Damon's nephew was

1056
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,560
putting Matt Damon in his projects I'd be like all right you're failing.

1057
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,820
Zero. I hate Matt Damon. Yeah I hate him after what he did to me. That's right. And

1058
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,980
then don't elaborate even though he did nothing to me. Yeah. So you're gonna have a hard time in this

1059
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,180
class. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just want to let you know if any of you guys know Matt Damon

1060
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,180
you're gonna want to drop the class. Finding out that he's his nephew pretty

1061
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,580
early on and then just like just shitting on Good Will Hunting for the rest of the

1062
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,860
semester. And Matt Damon, and now let's talk about some of the worst actors in

1063
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:31,540
history for example Matt Damon. You know what else about Matt Damon? All his

1064
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,740
family members are ugly. I mean what a fucking what an untalented fucking family

1065
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,020
Jesus Christ. It makes sense I mean go to school in Boston. How many fucking lemons can you fit in one name?

1066
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:45,300
Going to Boston and being related. Why are you talking so quiet today?

1067
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:52,280
makes sense that he was at that school in Boston and met Damon's nephew that is so

1068
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,100
true I feel like you just like reversed the order of that sentence yes I did

1069
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:02,660
yeah I feel like in I'm feeling like you there I'm like that Damon's nephew right

1070
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,260
now I feel like Matt Damon right and I'm feeling like Matt damn damn I got born

1079
00:52:53,340 --> 00:53:00,100
regular guy. Until one day he got fat. He got really fat. And people came to rub

eating his curds and whey and then a spider came. Spider came and scared the crap out of him.

1082
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,020
He must have been rich dude. It's pretty hard to get fat back then. Yeah. Rich of mind and spirit.

1083
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:26,660
He was pregnant with knowledge. Oh my god. He was pregnant with the truth. He was pregnant with

What's he gonna do?

1101
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,620
He's gonna go to jail too.

1102
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,620
What's Randy Rainbow gonna do now?

1103
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,620
What about that other bitch who lives in...

1104
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620

00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Yeah, what are they gonna do? They're screwed.

1106
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,620
See, Donald Trump again taking away jobs from people of color and queers.

1107
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,620
Yeah, queers.

1108
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,620
(laughter)

1109
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:54,120
Whoa!

1110
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,620
What?

1111
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,620
People of color and queers!

1112
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:02,620
(laughter)

1113
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:07,620
I forgot the word for LQBT, I forgot the whole phrase.

1114
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,620
(laughter)

1115
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,620
Queers!

1116
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,620
(laughter)

1117
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,620
You can't say that.

1118
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,620
Why?

1119
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:18,620
Taking away jobs from BIPOC, fucking queers!

1120
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,820
I realize now that's what it sounded like. That's not what it sounded like, it's what you said. That's not how I meant it.

1121
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:31,700
That's funny. I meant the LGBTQ community. So you think there are a bunch of queers?

1122
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:40,020
No. Okay, I think the last letter is. Is it queer? The Q is queer.

1123
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,380
What did you think it stood for?

1124
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:41,880
Quasi.

1125
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,380
Questlove.

1126
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:42,880
Questlove!

1127
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,880
[laughter]

1128
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,380
Yeah, he's got something going on.

1129
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:48,880
Yeah.

1130
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,380
Yeah.

1131
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,380
Questlove has a sandwich at that restaurant near Canal Street.

1132
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,880
Oh!

1133
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,380
What the fuck are you talking about?

1134
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,880
He has Questlove--

1135
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
That restaurant near Canal Street?

1136
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,380
You didn't-- it was when we first came-- or the first time I was ever in New York,

1137
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,380
I saw Questlove had a sandwich at some place.

1138
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:05,880
I don't remember that.

1139
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,880
It was a Questlove steak and cheese.

1140
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Okay.

1141
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,380
Let me look up the questions.

1142
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,380
You don't have to.

1143
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,380
We don't have to do this, Pat.

1144
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,380
Well, now I want to go eat it.

1145
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,380
No.

1146
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,380
What are we going to do for our last meal in New York City?

1147
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,380
I can't eat another meal.

1148
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
Yeah, dude, I can't.

1149
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,380
We're going to go to Harvey's in Boston.

1150
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,380
We're going to go to what we're fucking talking about.

1151
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,380
Yes.

1152
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
Yeah.

1153
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,380
Are you guys going to miss the Big Apple?

1154
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:29,780
Yeah, I want to come back soon.

You will be back soon.

1156
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:35,380
Questlove launches cheesesteak sandwich made with plant-based impossible meat.

1157
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,380
That ain't fucking steak.

1158
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,380

Patrick Stein. Patrick Stein? This is what we're going with? Israel versus

1169
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,060
Patrick Stein. This is how we're capping off the episode? Patrick Stein? Yep. Okay.

Free Patrick Stein. No, no, no, let's keep it going. Yeah. Okay, Patrick Stein.

1171
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:48,900
Where's that? It's in Israel. It's in? Okay, so that's interesting. Kind of

1172
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,940
making a weird insinuation there about where Palestine is. I know where

1173
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:58,820
Palestine is. Yeah like you just said you think it's in Israel? No. Yeah. Again I

1174
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,580
forgot a word. Inside of Israel. No I think Israel's inside of Palestine and they

1175
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:09,920
they should they should be fair about it. Okay. I think maybe if we went over there

1176
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,020
and showed them Barney's sharing song. Showed them a couple fucking. That's right. If we

1177
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:19,260
played the sharing song from Barney over there in Israel and Palestine I think

1178
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,900
shit would have got solved in five minutes.

1179
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,500
- Yeah, knock it off guys.

1180
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,900

1181
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,060

Mohammed Al Dura video every fucking like every story that comes out of like

1206
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:52,500
That's a notification I got from my mom. Not from your mom, from your amazon echo.

1207
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,860
My mom's amazon echo. It's crazy that you have one of those in your house dude. My mom

1208
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,860
does. That's psycho. I would put tape over it like a webcam. Yeah, just tape over the

1209
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,540
microphone. Tape over the entire thing. The guy in the amazon surveillance office just

1210
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:25,780
was like my mouth is on the Alexa play Kesha playing guess up there's a hole in

1211
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:32,860
the wall it's a dirty free-for-all I wish it I wish Alexa sung the songs then

1212
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:38,300
I think I might buy one. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of like a gag. You can make Alexa sing things.

1213
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,140
I can make her do whatever I want. I'm gonna make her sing like a canary. You know she can tell you

1214
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:47,500
a joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew that. Isn't that awesome? It's so good. You know what, I guess I

1215
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,620
will buy one. She can tell you a joke. She can help me work on my stand-up. She can work on my

1216
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:58,940
material with me. She'll love it, dude. I think that joke has problems in the third act structure.

1217
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,940
You don't put an act in a joke.

1218
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,940
The third act structure?

1219
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:04,940
That movie is a movie.

1220
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,940
I'm gonna kill myself.

1221
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,940
What happens if you say that to Alexa?

1222
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,940
Does she say no?

1223
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,940
They give you the suicide hotline.

1224
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,940
They play that song by Logic.

1225
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,940
Here is the number for the suicide hotline.

1226
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,940
I've been on the road.

1227
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,940
I just wanna die today.

1228
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:22,940
I just wanna die today.

1229
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,940
Imagine that song saving your fucking life.

1230
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,940
Who can relate, dude?

1231
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:34,140
that's it really it saved a few people's lives I think yeah no no yeah it had to

1232
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,700
have right yeah I didn't like fucking a couple people who were like I'm not

1233
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:42,580
gonna do it yeah and then probably like high schoolers or middle schoolers yeah

1234
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,460
probably like some seven-year-old we should just every song every song should

1235
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,940
be about not killing yourself yep we how many lives could we save then oh my god

1236
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,740
I think we found the next angle for the thanks to sensitive gangster album I

1237
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:03,240
think we're making a suicide is a joke suicide makes you go to hell yeah that'll

1243
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:36,760

1249
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:04,180
