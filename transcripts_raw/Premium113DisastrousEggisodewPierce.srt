00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Caleb's sick again.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Still.

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Still faking it.

18
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He's on a ventilator.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But he's still sick.

20
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He's still sick.

21
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He's still sick.

22
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's still sick.

23
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He's still sick.

24
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He's still sick.

25
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He's still sick.

26
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,760
but he's yeah yeah he's faking he he found out that there are paintings of

27
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,360
cartoon characters in the the children's ward at the hospital and he pretended to

28
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:49,000
be a seven-year-old with kovat yeah he had fond memories of watching his

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,600
watching the VHS tape with a nebulizer as a child and he's trying to return to

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,720
tradition. So he's so he got put on a ventilator.

31
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,960
What's that like purple disc of asthma medicine?

32
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,840
Adver, you guys are. Oh, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah. It's giving you the CD roms.

34
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,120
Yeah, my kid can't breathe too good, but he's well, 10,000 hours.

35
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
They're giving you Pokemon TMS.

36
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,560
Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
I remember just huffing toys like if ever there was like a nozzle in a toy,

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,400
like even just like a Lego piece.

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,980
If there's like a hollow hole in it,

40
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,340
I would just suck it in and just get a

41
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,280
little tiny note of the factory.

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,720
Yeah, yeah, smelling toys.

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,520
Great smelling stuff in general.

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,960
Awesome Caleb lost that experience.

45
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,920
Oh yeah, he can't smell shit right now.

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
You can't smell or taste smell.

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,360
We get to smell.

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,960
Even smell actual shit.

49
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,460
Yeah, I texted him.

50
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm this.

51
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,900
What is that?

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
I can smell this right now.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,400
Diddycon coin from a wonder ball.

54
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,520
Mm. Oh, I found this at my

55
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
friend's house.

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,000
I never had a wonder ball of toys.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,440
And what's a wonder ball with like sweets in it?

58
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
Yeah, you get it.

59
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Your dad is probably in like the side.

60
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,080
Yeah, it's probably the side of the box.

61
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,000
It's like a knockoff Kinder Egg.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,720
Yeah. Yeah, it's what it's what we're allowed to have.

63
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
Pop Wonder Balls.

64
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Now I have two crazy coins.

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,160
See, this is so sick.

66
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
This was a crazy coin.

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,800
It's a really good.

68
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,560
Yeah. Why?

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
Mike Pence in front of Trump.

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,520
This is the Pence commemorative coin.

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,440
Oh I see.

72
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,000
And then on the back it's got Indiana.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
The place where he fucked his wife.

74
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah the place.

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,880
That's what it's commemorating.

76
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,920
We should get challenge coins made.

77
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,520
That would actually be so sick to have his merch fucking challenge coins.

78
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
What's challenge coins?

79
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,280
I was just agreeing because I want some coins. I want some more coins.

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Yeah, any type of coin.

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Those like special coins that they make.

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
All coins are special.

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,880
I don't know why they're called challenge coins, but it's like the like, you know, if you like.

84
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
It's a challenge not to eat them.

85
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,040
But no, you know, like they'll make them for the police and it'll have like a.

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
Oh yeah.

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
Punisher skull on it or something.

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Yeah.

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
Oh, you leave them on dead bodies.

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Yeah.

91
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,400
on their eyes. You put the challenge coins over a dog's eyes.

92
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,560
Yeah. Yes. The only challenge coin, the only time I've ever... There's that video of Korn

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,360
performing at a USO show or whatever for a bunch of military people. And then at the end, this guy

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
shakes the hand and is like, "Now, I don't do this for a lot of people, but I'm going to give you my

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,800
coin." And like, "Here's a special coin for performing." And I want to be able to do that.

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,360
I want to have a bag of coins that I carry around. And if someone like, if someone treats me well,

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,000
like a, like a fairy tale, genie, like if someone I'm asking for help to cross the street. And if

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,480
someone helps me, I give them my coin, give them a coin. And if they don't frogs and snakes will

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,160
spill forth from their mouth, whenever they open it again for the rest of their life,

100
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,160
their mouth. Oh, okay.

101
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
No, it's when they open anything.

102
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:24,800
That'd be a cool superpower if you open anything frogs and snakes come out.

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,080
Yeah, I guess you need some definitional criteria about what you can sell.

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,480
No, if you open a web page it's always frogsandsnakes.com.

105
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,200
A digital... I was gonna say a digital frog hops across the screen,

106
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
You can't get rid of it.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah. Frogs and snakes dot com.

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
You're a lot better.

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,280
No matter what you type into the URL bar, you'll go to frogs and snakes.

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Yeah, you can't open your hand, I guess, to grasp anything.

111
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,160
There's no frog. Yeah.

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,640
Frog pops out of the middle of your hand.

113
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,360
Do you ever

114
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,560
you ever see this movie called The Electric Grandmother?

115
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,760
No, it's based off of icing the body electric,

116
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,620
which I think is like red Bradbury's like.

117
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,560
I think it's a Twilight Zone episode, too, but there's like a grandmother

118
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,620
that comes from space.

119
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,180
She's like a robot.

120
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,000
And the kids love her because she's the best grandmother ever.

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,860
And the reason she's the best grandmother ever is because she can shoot

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,640
orange juice out of one finger and milk out of the other.

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,240
And the kids go fucking bananas.

124
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,340
They love her super grandma.

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,640
That was it.

126
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,140
Was it like she was it was it like a situation where they had a

127
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,240
normal grandmother and she like replaced.

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Yes, grandmother.

129
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
They're like, oh, you're so much better by a car and then the

130
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,140
new grandmother came from outer space.

131
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,940
That's that that's that.

132
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,740
No, no, I think it was like what came from outer space was like

133
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,840
a jigsaw puzzle.

134
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,240
That's like a steel heart and then when they put the pieces

135
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,540
together, it's like an invitation to go to like this Willy

136
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:10,060
Wonka Factory and they assemble their grandmother, like they walk around and they get to make their

137
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,540
grandmother from different parts. That's that beautiful biting social commentary that Ray

138
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:29,980
Bradbury is known for. What if a grandma? Yeah. Is crazy. And such, yeah. Yeah. Before I sit down

139
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,860
and write every book I think to myself. Basically grandmas are beverage slaves.

140
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,700
Those aren't even, come on, it's a grandmother, they should be shooting hot cocoa out of one.

141
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,180
Yeah, I agree. They should be shooting it. And you know what else? They poop lasagna.

142
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,900
That's really good, yeah. They poop a whole lasagna for you.

143
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,740
Yeah, and when it's their time of the month, a gingerbread slides out of a slot.

144
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,140
A little gingerbread man. A whole gingerbread house.

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Once a woman hits menopause, a uterine lining is replaced with a little ginger snap cookie for the grandkids.

146
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah.

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,500
They don't need any eggs anymore, so it's just like, well, how else am I going to provide?

148
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
It's just actual eggs. It's just little hard-boiled eggs.

149
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
[laughter]

150
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,500
that uh I think it was at yes Cumberland Farms I saw they have buffalo eggs which

151
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,660
was a like you know like you know when they like make like a soy egg or

152
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,900
whatever or like raw egg hmm you heard of a boy egg virgin no egg we can talk

153
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,300
about that after yeah we'll get into that later but it was a like they make

154
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,700
like a soy egg just like yeah they like they marinate the the hard-boiled egg in

155
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,380
soy sauce and it just like sucks up the soy sauce but they did it with buffalo sauce.

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,980
So it's just this like bright orange egg in a bag.

157
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,940
Cheeto egg.

158
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,180
Yeah.

159
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
Yeah.

160
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,980
That's good when you put like a...

161
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,700
You soak an egg in like maple syrup or something? What is it?

162
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,100
Or like not maple syrup. What is the substance that you soak an egg in and it like grows really big?

163
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,300
We did an experiment in my science class.

164
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,260
I think it's vinegar.

165
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,020
It might be vinegar.

166
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,020
Vinegar make egg big. Google images.

167
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Yep.

168
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
Yep.

169
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
This is the first.

170
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
This is the first picture.

171
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
I googled vinegar make egg big

172
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
and then this is the first result.

173
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
[Laughter]

174
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Oh, have you seen that video?

175
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
No, what is this?

176
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,020
It's just a picture of two eggs and one is bigger.

177
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
It's like one of those.

178
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,020
Remember those like, it was on

179
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,260
like Facebook videos that like the I think this is like blossom or whatever

180
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,740
one of those fucking like like life hack companies this is presented as like a

181
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,940
life hack to make your egg bigger

182
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,940
we should be doing this in my science class

183
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
this will solve world hunger pretty quick

184
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,180
why you should put vinegar in eggs the times of India and then they have a

185
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,780
picture of like they have a picture of an egg but the focus and the pixelation

186
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,900
makes it look like it's just a cloud in a bowl. The Times of India has a lot of

187
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,580
really good articles. Times of India is a great website. Look at this picture of this egg. Like it literally looks like a miasma.

188
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah, it focused on the wrong part of the egg. I think it focused on the bowl rather than the egg.

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,340
Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's like it's focusing on one little reflection on the

190
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,180
surface of the egg and then everything else looks like someone washed it in

191
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,660
Photoshop. In the article the caption of this photo is "make naked eggs"

192
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,300
okay but anyway. There's something else you can soak an egg in that like

193
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,500
peels away or like makes the skin or the shell like you can just take the shell

194
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,020
off and then the egg is like it's not cooked but it's just like there's a very

195
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,620
very thin jelly surface underneath the shell.

196
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,140
Hydrochloric acid.

197
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,500
It might be, it might be shell remover.

198
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Shell be gone.

199
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,540
You ever put that hard chocolate shell on your ice creams?

200
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,540
Oh yeah!

201
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,060
Oh that shit was so good, they had the Reese's, the Reese's flavor one.

202
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Peanut butter chip shell.

203
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,300
That one was so good.

204
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,180
It's actually not that, I think it is just a clever little science experiment, but I don't

205
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,580
I don't think it makes ice cream taste any better.

206
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,180
No, but like cracking into it and then eating the ice cream out of it.

207
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,420
If you're right, you crack is so cool.

208
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,620
Yeah, we've we've literally we're so autistic now

209
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,940
that like every other tick tock video is just cracking something open.

210
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,380
But the thing you're cracking open is just something that you've made

211
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,740
to be cracked open.

212
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,180
Yeah, I would love to get to a point in society where, yeah, those like little

213
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,380
hammers that they have on like dessert cooking shows, you know,

214
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,740
like that that's just like a normal place setting like it's like fork knife spoon hammer

215
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:07,460
that should just be part of it the little like crab shards yeah the crab uh if you have nothing

216
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,700
to crack if you have nothing to crack open in your dinner you can use it on your plate

217
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:17,300
when you're done crack a plate when you're still hungry yeah you crack your teeth yeah

218
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,820
but i want to go back to virgin boy egg because have you not heard of a virgin boy egg pat

219
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,700
No, I haven't.

220
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,500
You're gonna really like this dish.

221
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,560
Yeah?

222
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,760
You're gonna make a lot of money with your piss once you find out about virgin-

223
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,860
I'm reading- I'll read from Wikipedia for you for virgin boy egg.

224
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,060
"Virgin boy eggs are a traditional dish of Dongyang, Zhejiang, China,

225
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,840
in which the eggs are boiled in the urine of young boys who are presumably peasants,

226
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,380
preferably under the age of ten."

227
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,280
What?

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,300
"The dish translates literally to 'boy egg' and is a springtime tradition of the city

229
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,020
where the urine is collected from prepubescent peasant boys."

230
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,720
Why did they do that?

231
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
It protects you. It protects you and it cures you.

232
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Oh, well, you didn't tell me it protects me.

233
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,720
It's like medicine.

234
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,320
Well, you know, I had some qualms, but now that it offers protection, I mean,

235
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:11,220
I'm... Virgin boy piss is like such a hot little commodity pretty much everywhere.

236
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,620
Yeah. I just the fact that there is a food that's actually called a virgin boy egg is...

237
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,920
Yeah, that's messed up. It's incredible.

238
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,320
I love it. Yeah, I mean, the fact that virgin isn't in the actual

239
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,720
child, like just you, you know, it's a virgin boy.

240
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,420
Any boy egg.

241
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Any boy egg, huh?

242
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,620
This says even a boy who fucks you can you could battle true.

243
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,320
Listen to this.

244
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,920
Listen to this virgin boy eggs are widely accepted as a time-honored

245
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,520
tradition of the city rather than considered taboo as they are

246
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,720
most other cultures boy egg vendors go to elementary schools

247
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,620
in the city where they collect urine from young boys, preferably

248
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,220
under the age of 10. The children, having been raised in the city and its culture, are used

249
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,540
to the practice. As young boys would in schools from many other cultures, they excuse themselves

250
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,820
from class when they feel the urge to urinate. However, instead of going to the restroom,

251
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,340
they relieve themselves in the basin that the vendors place in the hallways. Some vendors

252
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,100
go as far as to wait with containers in parks or public restrooms for a parent who is willing

253
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,740
to let their child offer urine.

254
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,100
Can you piss directly into the cloaca of a hen to make a boy egg instead of pissing into

255
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,260
a basin and then yeah, ferment it in the reproductive system.

256
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,860
Go, yeah, go right to the source. Yeah, that could be an efficient way. We can maybe make

257
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,540
a factory like sexual. Maybe that's like a penetration. Yeah, that does make it sexual.

258
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,500
Yeah, there I if I'm if I'm eating an egg, I don't want to think about sex.

259
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,300
No, no, never. Well, that's another thing that you can try it too,

260
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,500
is like a fertilized chicken egg, like an egg with a little

261
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,700
with the baby in it embryo in it. Yeah.

262
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,900
Yeah.

263
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,600
Yes.

264
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,000
And I know they don't come on.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,700
Yeah, they're cool.

266
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, yeah, it's just been around for forever.

267
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,400
They preserve it in like clay and it turns like green and brown

268
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,900
and looks like a gemstone.

269
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,600
Yuck. Yeah, I'm century eggs and gross when the boys go to collect their urine in the basin.

270
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Does that mean that like boy eggs are like, it's like a hundred different boys piss, like in one sort of ground beef mix.

271
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
Like you don't know which animal.

272
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
It's like the Fiesta mix.

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,400
I don't know which is more perverse is like having a boy egg that came from one boy.

274
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,100
Yeah, or from like a thousand.

275
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:40,020
I think I think the thousand boys is worse unless you want the the single one because of who the boy is.

276
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:46,660
Yeah, you know him if you know the one boy, if you know, that's like a million times worse.

277
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,620
I think it's also I think it's less perverse if the if you're related to the boy,

278
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,740
if it's one boy, because then it's like it's a family favor.

279
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,620
Right. But if it's like if it is someone in your neighborhood who you like see on his bike every

280
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:10,660
day. I don't think you can pick at all. I think you're not allowed to pick. You're definitely

281
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:17,540
not allowed to pick. I think the best case scenario for the virgin boy egg is it's like

282
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:25,300
a raffle and you get a random boy. What if you get a really awful boy? What if you get a stinky

283
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,140
nasty boy? What if you get a little troublemaker? A Dennis the Menace type. If you're going to eat

284
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,060
a virgin boy egg and you find out who the boy is and you're like I don't want this anymore

285
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,300
that also is really bad you can't be doing that they'll make you eat it if you say true

286
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,100
because that means that you're thinking more about the boy than the egg

287
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:51,140
yeah yeah what if you do get some like little Dennis the menace little fucking rascal type

288
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:58,260
and he's like uh he replaces his pee with like dr pepper yeah like yeah what if what if you get like

289
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,740
a drug addict kid. Yeah, and then you can't get enough of his boy eggs. You want to keep

290
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:10,400
going back to the source. You're like, sorry, we don't do repeats. You lucky enough to win

291
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,020
the raffle twice in a row. And then they should also make an at home test kit. Like if there's

292
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,820
no boys in your area, you should end like, let's say you don't want to eat a boy egg

293
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,500
right now, but you do want one in a week.

294
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,660
You should be able to buy a little vat of piss to do it. That's what everyone in China,

295
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,060
in China gets that for Christmas instead of an air fryer.

296
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,340
[Laughter]

297
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,060
They get a boy egger.

298
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,100
And if they've been naughty, they get a century egg.

299
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,260
Yeah.

300
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,700
They get a shit egg.

301
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,100
That's the other part of the raffle.

302
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,980
First you draw a boy's name and then you draw out a piece of paper and it's either yellow or brown.

303
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,500
Uh, no, I got brown this year.

304
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,000
Fuck.

305
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
Yeah.

306
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,300
And then if you've been really good, you get a girl egg.

307
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Like really good.

308
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Yeah, like, like only the emperor gets that.

309
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,700
I would eat a girl egg.

310
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,060
Would you?

311
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,580
Boy egg sounds kind of nasty, but.

312
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,860
Boy egg?

313
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,740
That sounds sus.

314
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,080
Yeah.

315
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,580
I feel like boy egg should just be an urban dictionary term for poop.

316
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

317
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,980
I think that that's what boys lay.

318
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,480
Yeah.

319
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,940
Boys lay poop as eggs.

320
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,900
Boys lay poop as eggs.

321
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,220
Boys lay poop as eggs.

322
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,860
Boys lay poop as eggs.

323
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,660
Yeah.

324
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,140
Oh man.

325
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,580
Yuck.

326
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,140
Now I'm thinking about poop instead of...

327
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
Instead of delicious eggs.

328
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,700
We don't do that on this show.

329
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,100
We don't talk about eating poop or poop in general.

330
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,620
Yeah. No, no way.

331
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,700
I feel like we know.

332
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,580
So maybe just let me know if we have talked to us before.

333
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,860
If you got COVID and you couldn't taste you, you got to eat

334
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,460
a piece of poop, right?

335
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,780
So I was talking to this guy.

336
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,180
Ask Caleb.

337
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,260
I guess you guys know Matthew.

338
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,820
I was talking to him about New Year's and he was like, yeah, me and my friends were all

339
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,100
sitting around and watching this woman who eats her own shit.

340
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,300
And she like has this whole she's like a mother.

341
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,500
YouTube or I don't think it's on YouTube.

342
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,740
It must be on her own fucking website or something.

343
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,260
Yeah, she eats her own shit.

344
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,060
She like takes herself around shit and she like talks about her philosophy of shit eating

345
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,000
that it's like it's the only product that you can really create.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
And then he was like, yeah.

347
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,420
And then we looked at the clock and it was 10 minutes past midnight.

348
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,460
Like we completely missed.

349
00:18:49,460 --> 00:19:00,820
That's I don't think I could do that.

350
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,660
I don't I really don't think I could watch somebody their own shit, even on video without vomiting.

351
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,180
And he was like, yeah, like a video guy.

352
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,860
I feel like maybe you would be able to.

353
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,300
I was like, no, I don't.

354
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,900
Video.

355
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,420
Yeah, I don't think you I think it would probably make me sick.

356
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,260
I don't be able to watch.

357
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,180
I think that would be pretty gross to me.

358
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,140
What it what if you if you if you watch the video like he wanted to do it

359
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,860
He was saying like someone was trying to talk him into doing it like as like the first post-ironic

360
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,700
Shit eating performance are like doing it, you know sort of

361
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,380
cringe way

362
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,220
Then he was like, yeah, I was like doing research about how to like ice your taste buds that you don't taste it

363
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm just like I will break up with you. I can't believe you would choose eating your own shit over being with me

364
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,740
and you're like, "well, I don't know."

365
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,740
I'm an artist, so...

366
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Damn.

367
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
That's fucking crazy.

368
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,740
I would never eat a poop.

369
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
Let me go on record.

370
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
I think there's a timeline someday in my life

371
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,740
where I try it.

372
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,740
Like a, like a, like a, like a

373
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
Terminator type timeline, though.

374
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,740
Like a very bad one.

375
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,740
Yeah, like something has to go very wrong

376
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:33,660
on

377
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,540
honor when the robot war is over. Yeah, if I was if the only way I could defeat the robots

378
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:45,460
was by eating poo, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Or maybe if like maybe I could fight alongside

379
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,420
the robots, but they they make me eat my own poop before. Yeah. The only scenario is if

380
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,060
like I was like, like disguised as like a guy that everybody hates. And I did it on

381
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:01,180
live TV. That would be cool. Like you're you're in like a like a mission impossible. Which

382
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Which one is that?

383
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,180
Three?

384
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
Two?

385
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,180
You're in one of those masks that looks very realistic and you're like, "Hey guys!

386
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
It's me, Jimmy Stewart!

387
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
I'm back from the dead!

388
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
I'm here to eat poop!

389
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
I'm here to eat poop on TV!"

390
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:27,580
Imagine they finally get the Jurassic Park technology all fitted up for humans and shit

391
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,820
Yeah, like there are five a bunch of dead presidents, but there's some like there's some some

392
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,580
Glitch in the system and franklin becomes addicted to shit. Yeah, they all just crave they

393
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,620
They just crave eating poop constantly

394
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,500
It's wonderful you've put me on the 100 bill. Can I use this to buy poop to eat?

395
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:56,860
Like they're like how many turds can I buy with this 100 bill i'll sign it

396
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:05,500
they unveil like these intellectual giants from the past that they've resurrected like Einstein is there

397
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,940
and then they like yeah they're they're televised again they just all just walk into the bathroom

398
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:18,460
they're still mic'd up and he does here yeah this is amazing

399
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,460
This is delicious!

400
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,340
Like when Tom Cruise runs out of the Oprah studio to talk to Katie Holmes, but they're

401
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,740
just running to get food for their speech.

402
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,660
And it's not even a situation where it's like some like animalistic like dog desire got

403
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
created in their brain.

404
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Like they just think it's awesome.

405
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
Yeah!

406
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
That's what the future is!

407
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,780
For some reason they're like, "Oh, thank God!

408
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,660
We always dreamed about the future where everyone could eat poop all the time without getting

409
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:56,340
worried about getting sick. Yeah. So sick. So nasty. So nasty. I've been thinking, I

410
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,140
mean, I kind of lost my sense of smell, but I think that, uh, I hate it. I think it's

411
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,540
so disgusting when people talk about like a fart or a shit and they talk about what

412
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,660
food. It smells like that specific smell. That to me is so, I want a fart or a shit

413
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,020
to like, I want people to talk about what person it came out of. Like your farts and your shits

414
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,580
always smell like this, even though that's not true. But to me, it's so nasty to think about

415
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:30,220
what diet led to the specific smell. Why? It's simply an equation.

416
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:38,940
Why? Do you fear mathematics? Yeah. Gordita plus my dad equals...

417
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, yeah, I think I, you know, I might ruffle a few feathers here, but I'm going to go. I think that

418
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:57,420
farts and poops are nasty, no matter what they come from. And I'm not afraid to say it.

419
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,620
I think they're funny as soon as you bring up the food that creates.

420
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,260
Yeah.

421
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,820
I think they're funny and playful. But as soon as you say like, yeah, noodles, I want to,

422
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,020
I want to fucking vomit.

423
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,780
Okay. So if you saw, if you saw a video.

424
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,460
I think it's funny to blame the food.

425
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,340
I can't explain it, but I think it's grotesque.

426
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,860
Yes, if you saw a video of someone eating poop, okay, and you vomited from seeing the video,

427
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,780
and then you found out immediately after you vomited that it was completely fake,

428
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,420
would you feel cheated?

429
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,380
I just eat the puke.

430
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,020
Would you feel, would it like shatter your worldview?

431
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,820
I'd eat the puke.

432
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:45,420
I don't think so. I think I get sick from like, or I get queasy from watching Peter Griffin and

433
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,500
his family vomit. That sort of makes me feel a little bit ill.

434
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,980
Yeah, specifically them.

435
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,940
Yeah. And I also get a boner when I see like Jessica Rabbit. I don't feel cheated.

436
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:03,340
I don't feel cheated after I come in my pants spontaneously after seeing a picture of

437
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,340
Scooby-Doo's girlfriend from the alien

438
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,420
God oh my oh, oh wow

439
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,380
Christ

440
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah

441
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,900
Yeah to me that's real

442
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,300
Even as soon as as soon as my body has a response to something it is it is it is a sacrament. It's real

443
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,420
That's very true like I salivate when I see you know

444
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,420
Yeah, Patrick get off the computer. I

445
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,060
I'm done waiting 20 minutes to bring it up. I'm gonna start bringing up first five minutes from now on

446
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,580
Yeah, you have to read out loud what is on your screen right now

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,160

449
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,060

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,660
Now do you have a guy who needs that fucking curse I do I I need to get back on adderall or something

451
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:11,020
It's like we've been recording on zoom and it has been so hard for me not to just like look at shit while we're recording

452
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:19,240
That seems like that seems like you should do some work on yourself. Yeah, you should get what you need is you need like horse blinders

453
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,040
Yeah, maybe cuz my monitors right here. So don't look at the what's that?

454
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Oh

455
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,140
What my meeting will end in 10 minutes

456
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,640
Dangling keys in front of me did they turn off my oh, they definitely did dude

457
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,400
They turned off my zoom premium down now today. Oh, it makes it cuz it's the new year. Oh fuck

458
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,060
No, but it still says I'm licensed. What the fuck? Oh

459
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,500
All right, ah

460
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Wow, well

462
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,020
10 more minutes of every group

463
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,700
Okay, what the fuck this is gonna are we gonna have to buy our own zoom? That's all right

464
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:10,740
You guys gotta pay us that you guys have to pay us way. I'm not paying for zoom zoom sucks. Yeah

465
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:18,260
Period in this episode where each of us is in our own separate void before we reconvene. Yeah

466
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:30,060
We'll call it out when it's about to happen. Yeah, so don't stop your recording or anything. We'll just count it down like New Year's

467
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,420
Yeah, cuz it shows

468
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:44,140
Is that so much pressure to this episode that I could see a countdown to the top my screen where everything's gonna fall apart

469
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:51,020
Patrick just started looking at pictures of fucking shoes again

470
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:58,020
What do you think? You think I didn't just shift monitors?

471
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Yes.

472
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,620
I'm putting it on the other monitor now.

473
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:11,260
That's your mission impossible is moving one fucking brush window to the other monitor.

474
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
One chrome tab.

475
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,020
And it takes him two movies to finish the art.

476
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:29,300
Oh man. Oh man. This is scary now. Oh, this is the scariest shit of all time. Let's think

477
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,660
of an eight minute thing to do. All right. Let's think of a seven, seven and a half second

478
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:39,700
thing to do. I've got an idea. What's your idea? Doo-wop song. Doo-wop song? Go ahead.

479
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Okay, do you know any

480
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,020
No, yes

481
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,500
I haven't had an idea. It doesn't mean I had a song

482
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,220
Well, you're the one who said song

483
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,380
Okay

484
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
Bought a bottle by a baby

485
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,060
blue

486
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,220
You guys didn't fucking what the fuck it's you it's we have eight minutes to kill you they were gonna jump in

487
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:14,220
*Badly singing the Blue Moon theme*

488
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
I don't know what to do.

489
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
One of you has to do the

490
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,220
*Badly singing the Blue Moon theme*

491
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
You guys don't know?

492
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
God damn it dude. This sucks.

493
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,220
We've been trying to start a doo-wop band out of the podcast for years.

494
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,700
And now we finally get the opportunity and we don't even fucking take it

495
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm looking at we could use of virgin boy eggs. Yeah, did you know that seems better than a do-up song?

496
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:53,020
They're supposed to prevent heatstroke. That's one of the really health benefits. Yeah, how does it prevent heatstroke? That's like

497
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,580
That's because of the boy pee

498
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,780
All right. Well, you didn't say that's the effect of the boy pee duh. Mm-hmm

499
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,300
There is I searched with quotes yummy boy egg, and it says no results

500
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:11,900
I

501
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Guess they don't taste good

502
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:20,900
Boy egg, there's no I there's no universe where a boy egg is good. You know

503
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,500
At least this is so fucked

504
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:29,820
It's the end of a school day in the eastern Chinese city of Dongyang and eager parents collect their children after a hectic day of

505
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,220
primary school. But that's just the start of busy times for

506
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,820
dozens of egg vendors across the city deep in coastal Zhejiang

507
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,860
province who ready themselves to cook up a unique springtime

508
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,460
snack favor by local residents basins and buckets of boys

509
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,060
urine are collected from primary school toilets. That sentence

510
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,220
should get you shouldn't be able to have a website if you

511
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,620
read that sentence. Didn't you didn't you just read that? Well,

512
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,900
no, that was like not basins and buckets basins and buckets

513
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,040
are and also collected from the

514
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,880
toilets is this one.

515
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,340
Buckets of boys.

516
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:01,840
Brown.

517
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,280
Yeah, it's also also part of the most.

518
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,020
I think one of the most fucked up

519
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,420
parts of this this food is that

520
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,660
it's a street food.

521
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,700
Yeah, yeah.

522
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,880
You don't go to a restaurant

523
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,100
and order hot dogs.

524
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,460
There's just a guy outside

525
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,540
who's selling you it.

526
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,180
Yeah, it's like getting a special

527
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,660
or religious about it.

528
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,820
It's like getting a pretzel

529
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,380
in Central Park.

530
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,220
Yeah, it's like getting a quick snack on the way to work.

531
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,820
Yeah, and they charge like you can dunk it in your coffee.

532
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Probably could.

533
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,380
Yeah. Yeah.

534
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:40,020
That's like that's what that's that's Chinese coffee instead of Irish coffee.

535
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,180
A splash of boys urine.

536
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,100
There's really not any interesting reviews of boy eggs, unfortunately.

537
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,460
You'd think there would be.

538
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,740
I thought there would be.

539
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Wait, Kinder Eggs in Korea...

540
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:05,340
Yeah, Boy Eggs were... that was originally a knockoff of a Kinder Egg.

541
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,340
It was a Kindergarten Egg.

542
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,740
And if you would crack it open, there would be a little pouch of Kindergarten Boy Urine.

543
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,740
Damn, that's not true.

544
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,240
I don't know what a... I guess in Korea there are Boy Eggs and Girl Eggs, but those refer to different kinds of Kinder Eggs.

545
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,400
This is a lot of egg talk this episode. This is the egg-isode.

546
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,760
Oh, have I ever told you guys about Flottie? The website Flottie?

547
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,600
No. What's that?

548
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
What the fuck, dude? Okay, hold up. Wait, wait. Before we do this,

549
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm on a Paleo blog, this post about virgin boy eggs, and this woman is, she has pictures

550
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:52,080
of her sons holding up beakers of urine. Are they smiling or are they crying?

551
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,760
not really smiling but they're not unhappy. Listen to this. First we had to collect enough

552
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,520
of the double O's wee wee to cover six pastured eggs in a medium saucepan. For a couple of

553
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,560
days we had them piddle outside into a Tupperware container that we kept sealed in the fridge.

554
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,620
We did our best to collect the urine first thing in the morning so that it would be super

555
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,320
concentrated with nutrients. When we collected enough bubbly piss, we poured it in a medium

556
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,080
saucepan and gently dunked in a half dozen eggs. What the hell?

557
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,040
Here's what you do.

558
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,320
Bring the eggs to a roiling boil before removing them

559
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,580
from the steaming hot piss with a strainer.

560
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,420
Roiling boil.

561
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,220
All right, you guys got to go to flotty.com.

562
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,760
OK, how do you spell that?

563
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,640
It's e-e-posted. No, I just posted it in the link.

564
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,300
Flotty.

565
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,940
What is flotty?

566
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,220
They're just egg products that are in a bag.

567
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:52,320
There's Floddy Baby. Floddy Baby are the first eggs of young, alive hens that have just begun to lay eggs.

568
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,400
Although they are smaller than other eggs, their taste and quality is very special.

569
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,040
Consume Floddy Baby that we put up for sale in 4-egg and 8-egg packs with real pleasure.

570
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,160
Floddy Sports?

571
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,400
Yeah, Floddy Sports. They're sports eggs.

572
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
Sports eggs!

573
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,720
The sport of an active life requires vitamins and minerals more than normal.

574
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,040
The egg is one of the foods that you can get the required nutrients in the purest and most

575
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
natural form.

576
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,400
Consume Flauti Sports with great pleasure for an organic life.

577
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Sports eggs.

578
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
God damn, dude.

579
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,120
And then you can satisfy your curiosity on the FAQ.

580
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,200
What is the difference of Flauti Sports from other eggs?

581
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Sports eggs, dude.

582
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm not going to get over that.

583
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,240
Sports eggs is really, really good.

584
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,120
They have an Instagram account.

585
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,360
Let's see what's going on here.

586
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,800
Nothing interesting, just a bunch of pictures of eggs.

587
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,040
This is a... what is this company?

588
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,880
They're an egg company.

589
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,040
Yeah, but like what's the...

590
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I guess they're Turkish.

591
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Yeah, they're Turkish.

592
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:03,560
All right, less than a minute before the bomb goes off.

593
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,400
Oh, it says 1/24 for me.

594
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
What does yours say?

595
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Mine just says less than a minute.

596
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Mine says 119.

597
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
Okay. Dude, this is so stressful.

598
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Yeah.

599
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Alright, well.

600
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
I'm gonna quickly try to read.

601
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Why are your packages in paper bag shape?

602
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
By doing so, we use less papers and ink, different from other types of packaging,

603
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
in order not to harm the nature.

604
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
You can also use our packages as a real paper bag.

605
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
You can make a major contribution to recycling in nature

606
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
with flotty packages.

607
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Oh, that's good.

608
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
By putting your little accessories in it.

609
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
It would be stylish.

610
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Okay, now it says less than one minute on mine.

611
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
It's just gonna end randomly.

612
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Yeah, we don't even have a countdown now.

613
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Oh my god, this is true.

614
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,400
This is the worst egg-isode ever.

615
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Yeah, ruining the egg-isode.

616
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Yeah, I guess we just we do.

617
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
We do have to just keep talking when it ends.

618
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
I don't know.

619
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,120
Do we all just have individual monologues that overlap and ruin the episode?

620
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,620
Yeah.

621
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,500
Okay.

622
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,600
Well, I think it's going to end 2, 1, and I think it ends now.

623
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,080
Oh, no, it didn't end.

624
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
It got to 45 minutes, but it didn't end.

625
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,840
Is it just not going to end?

626
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,040
Mine still says less than a minute, but it's been saying that for a minute.

627
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,880
Is it now it's going to live in fear that it's going to end the whole time?

628
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,380
God!

629
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm just, don't stop recording your audacity.

630
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,760
I'll sync it up.

631
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,600
It's going to suck to edit and it's going to be horrible to listen to.

632
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
This egg-isode.

633
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,160
This egg-isode is horrible.

634
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,440
What were you guys talking about in the dark?

635
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm about to buy these shoes.

636
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,160
I was apologizing and I was, I Googled "Buy Boy Egg Shift from China"

637
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,440
and I found a bag of realistic chicken eggs, toy food playset.

638
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,480
What did you talk about, Pierce?

639
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,880
I just talked about how stressed out and sweaty I was.

640
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,920
I really thought that I gave out the zoom

641
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,760
room code and the

642
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:15,040
In the password, that's fine. I found I just found a big something great that we could buy for only $10 on eBay

643
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,220

Ox boxes.

662
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What's an ox box?

663
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000

Wow! Do you guys want to buy ox boxes?

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It could be.

668
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000

669
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh dude, ox boxes are so cool.

671
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That's when my co-waker is in flames.

672
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Red Ring of Death on an ox box.

673
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
What the fuck is it? What is an ox box?

674
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't know. I think it's an item.

675
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
It's an item.

676
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,920
Oh, it's still in the video game.

677
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
I get it.

678
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Yeah.

679
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,920
I really wish it wasn't.

680
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Oxbox.

681
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,560
Oxbox is a really good phrase, though.

682
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,920
Do you guys ever played Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg on GameCube?

683
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,200
I never played it, but my friend brought it in for show and tell in the first grade.

684
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,800
Dude, it is such an autistic kid totem to have that game.

685
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
Just like, come over and, you know, you get bored of playing Melee, and now you gotta

686
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,280
watch your friend play Billy Hatcher.

687
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Hmm.

688
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Just that was around an egg.

689
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
My

690
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
game for Gamecube was

691
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,280
a

692
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I played a

693
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2

694
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Good game.

695
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
I never had a Gamecube.

696
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
I went over to my friend's house who had a Gamecube

697
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
and I played one of the Crash Bandicoot games.

698
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,280
I thought it was so cool.

699
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Was that on Gamecube or was that a different system?

700
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
I think you're lying.

701
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,280
I truly, I mean I never, I have no idea.

702
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Yeah, that's true.

703
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
I forgot you were a no video games kid.

704
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,280
I wasn't a no video games kid, I was a no consoles kid.

705
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,280
I had like a Gameboy.

706
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Oh, okay.

707
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
But I didn't have any.

708
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Did you play the Godzilla games on Gameboy Color?

709
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Did I play what?

710
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
The Godzilla, like the animated series, Godzilla games.

711
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
I played Godzilla Domination.

712
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,280
For Gameboy.

713
00:39:49,280 --> 00:40:18,280
a

714
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:26,120
19. Damn. Yeah. That's insane that they **** it was the worst

715
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,560
game ever dude. Yeah. Dude, it's cool. It's cool how much

716
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,080
shovelware was on the DS. Yeah, the DS is the **** best

717
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,200
platform for all of just the most insane DS and the Wii.

718
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah. For some reason, they like Nintendo is just like,

719
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,440
alright, **** it. Throw whatever you can at it but I

720
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,640
guess that's a good way to like test like cuz I think that

721
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,520
that was probably like the first time, like the Wii, was like the first time they had

722
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
that technology.

723
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,880
So I think that's a good way to test it, but they had some fucked up...

724
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Darts Championship 2008?

725
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,320
There was Godzilla on the Wii too, and you had to like shake the Wiimote to do any fucking

726
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
attack.

727
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Damn.

728
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,000
PDC World Championship Darts for 2008 for Wii.

729
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,900
I remember I bought some like my uh...

730
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I just bought this for cam.

731
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,400
What?

732
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,000
P-P-P-D-C.

733
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,600
I don't have a- I don't have a Wii.

734
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,200
I didn't actually buy it for you man, I'm just playing around.

735
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
I uh...

736
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,500
I- my- my dad likes like uh...

737
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,200
Like old planes.

738
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
What are you- can you-

739
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,700
Can you shut the fuck up dude?

740
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,100
You're in a fucking online shop.

741
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,800
Piece of shit dude.

742
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I'm buying something for you.

743
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,120
My dad, my dad was really into like, uh, like old planes, like

744
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,320
old, like fighter planes.

745
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,760
And so I found this, like, I forget what store is that, but

746
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,460
I found like a game for like a dollar for the, we like a used

747
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,700
game.

748
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,880
That was like a dog fighting game with a bunch of old planes.

749
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,720
And I was like, Oh, my dad will think this is cool.

750
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,320
And like, I bought it, loved those fucking games.

751
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,640
And I, Oh, I bought it.

752
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,400
And it would be like, it was like, it's so similar.

753
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,560
Like it, the render distance was so tiny that it was just like

754
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,280
fog.

755
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,400
You couldn't see any other planes. It was dude. It was and you had to like hold it like it was it was the worst

756
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,260
My dad would play any piece of shit flying game. It was so awesome to watch him play

757
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,160
Yeah, any fucking like a game where you have to land on a fucking

758
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,880
Aircraft carrier four times in a row just we you just did whatever the fucking game told him to do

759
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,120
He was like, well, I don't care if the game is bad. I have to do what it's telling me. Yeah, that's the thing

760
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Yeah, they're good at following instructions

761
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,720
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to get really into flight simulators

762
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,300
That would be cool like you know those

763
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:53,580
If you like dreams and you were doing impossible maneuvers, that's the thing those those none of them are cool like this never

764
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,940
The missions are never like do a loop-de-loop through it like

765
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,960
No, yeah, it's just like yeah wait for six hours

766
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,600
That's this mission. Did Star Wars squadrons I could get like a full fucking I get the VR headset

767
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,920
I could get all the like the peripheral like flight stuff and then I do it all in a TIE fighter

768
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,600
Yeah, I remember playing battlefront 2 at

769
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,920
There was this place called the nerve center where I grew up and it was like a LAN party. Oh, yeah, those were sick

770
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,000
Maybe I've talked about this was it even Gillian themes?

771
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,060
No, but it was spelled like nerf in a Vangelion

772
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,860
But I would do my birthday parties there and there was also like a room where you could like play

773
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,600
Xbox or ps3 like guitar hero rooms

774
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,960
But like the main thing was like a room with like 40 different computers and you can have a LAN party

775
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,880
So we would always play battlefront 2 you guys ever do the space battles and battlefront 2

776
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,160
Yeah, take the carrier and like put your it may be so nauseous. Yeah. Yeah

777
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,600
But I would always be the one who drives the the gunship and anytime someone else would do it

778
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,240
I'll be like you're fuck you can't do it. You're so bad. It turns out. It's the easiest thing in that game to do

779
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,720
Oh, yeah, it's so easy

780
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,220
Dude

781
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,080
the best the best move is taking the taking the gunship into the other like base and then like parking it there and it's kind of

782
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,240
Like having a couple people guard it and then because then you can spawn into their fucking ship

783
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,680
That's what I would do. I played so much battlefront 2 in high school

784
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,620
I think I let me let me look at how many hours I have played cuz it I definitely have like 800 hours

785
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:38,320
Yeah, there it was like my parents had this like shitty like Dell like

786
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,120
You know, there's like PCs that like it's like the Dell all-in-one

787
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,360
So it's just like the monitor and then like the back of it is like the whole computer

788
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,800
Yeah, it could only run like games up until

789
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,420
2008

790
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,300
Because it it had six gigs of RAM which is like

791
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:05,140
There's the craziest about like you can't get anything done with that. No. Yeah, you can you can run battle

792
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,860
Yeah, yeah

793
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:11,300
So much fucking sport. I'd never have been like three times in my

794
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:16,220
childhood and adolescence where I like made my parents buy me a PC and

795
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:21,180
There they knew that the only reason I wanted to buy a PC was to play one video game at a time

796
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,940
I made them buy me a PC just so I could play Spore.

797
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,980
I played so much Spore.

798
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,940
That was one of my best childhood gifts ever, is my grandpa.

799
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,060
Because I wouldn't stop just talking about Spore.

800
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,060
About everybody.

801
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,100
Because I would just watch the videos of them and be like, "On Spore you can create a creature!"

802
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:50,140
And he got me the Galactic Edition of Spore, which has the box and an art book and shit.

803
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,620
I was so fucking obsessed. I brought the art book to school and I was showing my friends.

804
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,860
Dude, I remember bringing like the the instruction manual for war of the monsters into the bath with

805
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:07,180
me all the time. Into the bath? Yeah, just look at pictures of the monsters in the tub. Yeah,

806
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,940
no, that I would print out the Wikipedia page for sound wave from transformers and just read

807
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,740
it in the bath. I was so obsessed with just holding... holding...

808
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:25,980
The bath specifically? Well that's where I got to be alone and just

809
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,780
sort of be a cool... I definitely, I also printed out Wikipedia

810
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:34,140
pages but I did not read them in the bath like a freak. I would print out a Wikipedia

811
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,340
page of something I thought was really cool and read it one time and then just put it in

812
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,820
my backpack and it would just stay in there until it like rotted because I also left applesauce

813
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,100
in there by accident or something. I'd only print like pictures out. I thought like I'd make stuff

814
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,220
in like Photoshop and then like print it out. I remember using PowerPoint all the time on

815
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,820
the family computer. Oh yeah. Just to write the word Godzilla in WordArt.

816
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:03,740
Just find the one that looks like, yeah, the Godzilla 2000 font and just make that over.

817
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,340
I was like, I'm going to make a slideshow about Godzilla, but I would just work on the title page

818
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,180
for like three hours. Dude, PowerPoint was the fucking best. I would go on PowerPoint in the

819
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,500
school library after school for like hours at a time to make like video games where it would just

820
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,300
be like you click on, you either click on like the circle or the X and it like takes you to

821
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:29,900
different like slides based on that. Awesome. Dude, it is so sick. Yeah, you could do all the

822
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,460
animations and stuff. Man. Yeah. I'm gonna get back into PowerPoint. I'm gonna do a lot of pivot

823
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:44,140
stick figure animator to oh dude pivot was so sick pivot was tight yeah i was 100 129.6 hours in

824
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:50,940
battlefront 2 that's not very much time that's not no i have like i definitely have a video game not

826
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,100
fucking time in TF2 I would just play engineer in 2fort like what the fuck

827
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:11,260

who like knew what TF2 was and just like yeah just get killed like a hundred

831
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,580
times in a row and just yell at each other.

832
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,780
Yeah I remember there were like so many times where I would like not be in the

833
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,100
Skype voice chat just talking to no one camping in the Intel room as an engineer.

834
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:46,380
It's a miracle that I'm not fucking schizophrenic. I remember my parents got

835
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,420
us laptops for Christmas one year when I was like when I was like 13. My parents

836
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,380
got his laptops and I was like, telling like my friends online

837
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,460
like, like, oh, I finally like got my own like PC. And they're

838
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,620
like, Oh, yeah, what's like, what's up with it? And I like

839
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,620
told them it was like, dude, it was a fucking it was like a

840
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:15,780
compact laptop from 2001. That had this like, card that like

841
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,980
you did like the only way it could connect to the internet was

842
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,780
this wifi card that you had to put into the side and I told them it ran Windows XP and

843
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,380
they fucking died laughing at me.

844
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:31,220
They were like, "How the fuck, like, tell me like the specs of it right now!"

845
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:41,220
They had like, fucking, they had like one gig of RAM and like, it was like, I thought it

846
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,580
was so sick that I had a laptop.

847
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,580
Look how it's still making you laugh.

848
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Yeah, I know, I don't understand this story at all.

849
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,540
Yeah, what's funny is just this shitty computer

850
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,540
that makes people die laughing.

851
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,540
It's making you die laughing.

852
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,540
It's a poorly made computer.

853
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,540
It's just so old.

854
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,540
Dude, it was so bad.

855
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,540
It like didn't even turn on.

856
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,540
No, the first day I got it,

857
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,540
it was like this refurbished computer.

858
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,540
So the first day I got it,

859
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,540
I accidentally, I tried to hook it up

860
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,540
to an external monitor

861
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,540
so I could like do shit with it.

862
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,540
No.

863
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,040
No!

864
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,540
...do shit with it.

865
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,540
Hold on, this actually gets funny.

866
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,540
It actually gets funny.

867
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,540
Let me continue.

868
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,540
*laughing*

869
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
Okay.

870
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,540
So, it, like, I hooked shit up to this monitor and then forgot that I, like, I got a bod-

871
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:40,540
Like, my mom gave me mouthwash in my stocking, and I hooked it up to the monitor, and then, like, tried to move it.

872
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,540
You hooked the mouthwash up to the monitor?

873
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:49,100
No, no, no the monitor I hooked the computer up to the monitor and then the mouthwash was behind the computer and it

874
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:54,060
Broke onto the laptop and all the mouthwash spilled into the keyboard

875
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,220
Wait, this is the only part of the story just happened

876
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,220
It broke onto the computer?

877
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,220
Yes

878
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,020
The mouthwash cap broke and the mouthwash spilled

879
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,020
How? Spontaneously?

880
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,020
The monitor toppled onto it

881
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
Okay, how did that happen?

882
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:21,140
I don't remember how, but the monitor fell onto the mouthwash and it broke into the keyboard

883
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,660
and it spilled all over the keyboard.

884
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,220
And it like, I had to...

885
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,220
And then what?

886
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,220
My dad had to go get it.

887
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,300
My dad had to go back to the Showtime computers in Nashua and go get it fixed.

888
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,980
And they were like, "All right, well, it runs, so it must just be the keyboard that doesn't

889
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
work."

890
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,880
So they were like, all right, so what's like the what's like the password my dad had to call my mom am I?

891
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,180
Hold on hold on

892
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,520
The passwords the password was very bum liquor

893
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:00,220
Because it was really long and no one would guess it. I think I I think I saw it somewhere

894
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,540
I think I saw that phrase somewhere else too. So I

895
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:08,320
Check this out. Hold on. Hold on. Check. So no way no way. Hold on

896
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:16,480
My dad had to sit there. Patrick, listen to me right now. One time my computer broke and

897
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,320
my mom had to tell the computer fixer guys the password was "Fairybumlicker".

898
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:27,040
Okay, hold on. So he's standing there. No, no, no. You think.

899
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,720
Because it was really long and no one can guess it.

900
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,120
That's a good password.

901
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,640
It is a good password.

902
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,080
But so is every other password.

903
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,440
Not true.

904
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,080
Password 123 is not a good password.

905
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,400
Yeah.

906
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,160
It's a bad password.

907
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,920
So my dad and the computer guy went back and forth for like 10 minutes

908
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,440
because he kept like typing it in and it's like, "Oh, that's not the right password."

909
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,720
And then my dad had to call my mom back and be like, "What the fuck is the password?

910
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,220
He's not...

911
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,660
It's not...

912
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,700
That.

913
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,600
I just had to fuckin' say "fairy" or "hairy bum liquor" to the guy.

914
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,480
He thought it was "hairy bum liquor".

915
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,640
But it was "fairy bum liquor".

916
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,320
And my dad had to say "hairy bum liquor" to the computer guy.

917
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,340
Look, I thought that-

918
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,520
You really- You really- You-

919
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,320
My mom tells the story better.

920
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,200
That was all in the-

921
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,920
*laughter*

922
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,000
We did that whole thing in the middle!

923
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,280
*laughter*

924
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,040
And you're sorry-

925
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,440
It's more difficult for you to tell a story that someone else has already told

926
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
than to tell a story from scratch.

927
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,440
I can't...

928
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,840
I had a Mac in middle school

929
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,840
and I didn't have a PC

930
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,840
and I really wanted a PC because

931
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,440
you can do more stuff on a PC than a Mac.

932
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,440
And I remember my grandma died

933
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,440
and I got her old PC

934
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,440
and I was so happy because I could finally make custom Magic the Gathering cards

935
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:02,680
without using the wine converter thing. And that was very big for me.

936
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,600
I remember going on Google Video before YouTube was a thing. I probably talked about this too,

937
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:13,560
but I would just Google "aliens or predator" pretty much every day. And there was this one

938
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:19,960
home movie that was an AVP parody, and I would just watch it three times a day. Stupid eight

939
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,360
8 minute video of just friends playing around in the woods.

940
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,920
The Predator was just a kid in an airsoft helmet.

941
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,880
I feel like you've shown me the video before or something.

942
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
I can't find it.

943
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:30,880
Maybe tell me about it.

944
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,640
Dude, Google Video was so sick.

945
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,400
I found so much crazy shit on there.

946
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,640
They should bring back Google Plus.

947
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,520
That would be huge.

948
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,800
That could get the zoomers back into that style of social media.

949
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:54,420
There could be a Google Plus. I don't think anyone has fond memories of Google Plus like

950
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,920
they do MySpace.

951
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,800
Yeah, Google Plus is so funny. It showed up, it didn't do anything. Nobody cared about

952
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
it at all.

953
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,800
Yeah.

954
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
And it went away.

955
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,800
I really wanted one. I really was looking forward to getting the invite.

956
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Yeah.

957
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
I had one.

958
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,280
I think I had one. Do you remember Google Buzz?

959
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,280
No.

960
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,200
That was Google's fake Twitter thing. That was Google for weeks.

961
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,560
It was like... It was Google. It was like... That's the one that nobody remembers, dude.

962
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,320
But that was fucking... That was like you would just post and people would comment on your post.

963
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:34,160
That's all it was. And it was tied into... It was sick, dude. Me and my friends used it so much,

964
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,400
and I was so mad when it went away. It was literally... It was just...

965
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,280
Look at... Oh, and I'm looking at pictures of it on Google Images. This is bringing back

966
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:50,080
such memories dude. You never used Google Buzz? No. Dude it was so awesome.

967
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:56,800
Did I ever tell you? Yeah I talked about it. Sparktop.org. What's that? No, I don't know what that is.

968
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:02,080
That was the forum I found in a Sports Illustrated for Kids magazine. That was for kids with ADHD.

969
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:09,760
It's called Sparktop? Sparktop.org and I would go on there and I would talk to other kids.

970
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,400
That should be like a slur for kids with ADHD.

971
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,280
Yeah, spark talk. I think it was. I think it was for kids with like ADHD and kids on like the autism

972
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,720
spectrum and that's where I would go and talk to other kids. I was like looking around on it at

973
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,320
first and I was like, "Oh, this is kind of lame." And then I looked up CKY.

974
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,800
To get kids with autism, ADHD all in the same room with no supervision.

975
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,400
Right. A forum. That's where I learned about like insane clown posse.

976
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,800
Tight. Yeah.

977
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:42,960
Because I looked up like CKY and stuff like that and I looked up like skateboarding and then like

978
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,520
found like kids like in their bios like had like favorite bands like Tool, Insane Clown Posse,

979
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:56,160
Linkin Park. I remember my Myspace page just had a personality quiz about how well you know me.

980
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,320
That was the only thing on it. The background image was like a xenomorph and the questions

981
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:06,880
were like, "Who is my favorite character in Smash Brothers?" And the answer was all of the above.

982
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,400
It's funny that this website was sold to you as something for kids with ADHD,

983
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:19,120
because I looked it up, and it's a forum dedicated to helping kids with learning disabilities.

984
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:19,360
Yeah.

985
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,120
Yeah, it's learning disabilities specifically.

986
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,880
They sold it. It's different now.

987
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,600
Well, it doesn't exist anymore. Here's the top...

988
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,640
I'm on common sense media looking at it. So, you know, they have like parents and kids reviews.

989
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,720
There's only this. So this is the only parent review for Sparked Up from April 9th, 2008,

990
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:50,560
written by netbug009. Five stars, five stars. What a great idea. This is a great site for

991
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:56,240
the mentally challenged, but you don't have to be to enjoy yourself. Check it out. Oh, God.

992
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,600
You gotta get back on there, bro.

993
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,080
Yeah, dude.

994
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,720
This is a great site for the mentally challenged, but you don't have to be to enjoy yourself.

995
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,960
Dude, I mean, it taught me what ICP was.

996
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,800
Yeah. No, any site that teaches you what ICP was is a good, a good site.

997
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:22,080
Dude, I just remember, I remember the other day, my mom let me have MySpace when I was nine,

998
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:28,400
but like I could only add like people that like she knew. So like, I had like all of her friends

999
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:35,440
from her restaurant, like all of her coworkers and like my neighbors. And my mom got pissed

1000
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,360
off at me because like in my bio I said I was 13 when I was really 10. And she was like,

1001
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:47,440
"You're not 13. Stop trying to pretend to be 13." But I was like, "If I say that I'm not 13,

1002
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,440
I'm going to get kicked off of there." Yeah.

1003
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:55,680
Because I thought that they would like kick me. I thought they would ban me immediately for not...

1004
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,440
They should have. I've often done the exact same thing. I think 13 is the age to be on MySpace.

1005
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,800
Yeah, same with Facebook. That was what it was like when people were getting Facebooks.

1006
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,680
Do you remember they had the, you could, like, there was something that you could like put like

1007
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,720
your own play, like, you would get like the one song on MySpace, but then there was also like

1008
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:23,440
some embedded like player you could add. I did that once, but like the laptop, my dad's laptop,

1009
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:31,920
like the sound driver just like didn't work or something like the audio wasn't working and I put a bunch of songs on it but couldn't hear them

1010
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:41,920
until I used the other like computer in the house and then like realized that like all of the songs were the wrong songs or they were that fucking like that

1011
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,920
LimeWire like Bill Clinton thing if you remember that?

1012
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,920
No, what's that?

1013
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,840
The LimeWire Bill Clinton thing was so funny, you would download a song and be like, "Oh

1014
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,760
shit, that took really quick."

1015
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,000
And then it was like a 15 second MP3 of a guy doing a Bill Clinton impression where he's

1016
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,920
like, "I didn't have sexual relations with that woman, but I did go to ifreeclub.com.

1017
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,360
iPods, MP3 players, and laptops absolutely free."

1018
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,320
We need that back in our society.

1019
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,640
That's like an ARG.

1020
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,640
I've heard it so I've heard the iFreeClub thing so many times in my life.

1021
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,560
That's one of my favorite ARGs is the free RayBans ARG.

1022
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,040
Oh yeah.

1023
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,760
It's such a crazy web adventure.

1024
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,640
RayBans20percentIndia.ru

1025
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,040
Yeah, one of my favorite ARGs I found recently is actually this great ARG where basically it's

1026
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:45,840
where you can win three free stethoscopes if you follow this Indian doctor on Instagram.

1027
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,200
Have you guys played the like it's the lore is insane and it like starts out

1028
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:56,400
with this really cryptic video where it says you will not last 10 seconds.

1029
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,320
You basically go down this insane rabbit hole. My favorite my favorite ARG has been on this

1030
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:14,840
website pirates.com. Oh my god there's this ARG called the Badger song.

1031
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:22,520
crazy. Yeah. All right. Pierce, plug your thingy. You guys want to see my thingy?

1032
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:31,400
Just plug your thingy in. If you live in LA on the 23rd, I'm doing a anthology thing at

1033
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:39,320
the Elysian Theater and Matthew Golden's gonna be on it. And I don't know. Yeah,

1034
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,800
It might not be so funny, but it will be kind of cool.

1035
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,720
Yeah, you're gonna go if you live there.

1036
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,580
Yeah.

1037
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,300
Yeah.

1038
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:52,440
Yeah, I don't know. I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit.

1039
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,440
Okay, you're not gonna go.

1040
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,840
Yeah, there you go.

1041
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,340
Yeah.

1042
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,600
Pierce isn't gonna be there.

1043
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,100
All right.

1044
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:04,280
Yeah, I might get cold feet because of this COVID, this pandemic.

1045
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,040
It might be a no-show situation.

1046
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,260
So.

1047
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:09,760
Yeah.

1048
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,520
Don't buy tickets. But it's a great opportunity to meet people and to network.

1049
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,040
Definitely. If you're COVID positive, go to this event.

1050
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:21,320
It's a networking event for people who have COVID.

1051
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:29,800
Yeah. Give Matthew and Pierce COVID. And basically just spit everywhere. You can spit everywhere

1052
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:33,480
like it's a Texas roadhouse. You can eat peanuts. You can spit everywhere.

1053
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,760
Is it Texas Roadhouse that does peanuts? Bye, everybody.

1054
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,720
Bye. Sorry.

1055
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,920
Bye, guys.

1056
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,920
Sorry!
