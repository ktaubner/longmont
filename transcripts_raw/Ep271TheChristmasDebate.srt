1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,960
Go ahead, say some woke shit right now. I'll blow your fucking head off. I

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,220
what is this a sex toy

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:23,660
for me? It is yeah for me. It is I point this in the mirror and I jack off

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,440
no. I pointed a mirror. I think nobody should have access to guns, even

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,900
soldiers. I don't think anyone okay, that's interesting, that's

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,780
interesting. So

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,140
go ahead and tell me how you think we should fight a war.

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,460
How are we supposed to kill millions of people without a gun using? I feel

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,100
statements

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,020
so give me an example. You take my territory

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,100
or when you ethnically cleanse my country or terror or area, ethnically

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,060
clans. It makes me feel unheard on the world stage.

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,700
so maybe we can work towards a solution where I can validate you for you,

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,180
wanting my brace to

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,180
no longer walk the earth. Okay, and I can validate you and say and then I walk

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,220
into the meeting

17
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,520
and I see every single person kill. I see both sides of this. I see completely

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,780
both sides of this guys are back to debating. If you can tell we're doing

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,220
the debate on Christmas to a cross. We just ate six enchiladas between the

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,980
three of us and about four pounds of beans, so to each six until I will see

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,880
you'll see how this goes. What the debate because there's a lot of inch a

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
lot of me, you tell me you don't even have a position. Yeah, you ask what your

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,900
nothing is you say. I don't even want one yeah. Exactly true. You always

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,480
complete centrist. Anytime we do these debates, which anytime meaning one time

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,680
and now yeah you we did a different debate, but it wasn't between us. We had

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,040
hot dog and hamburger, but that's more of a boxing. That was a battle. That was

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
a battle. I thought we were going to do a battle.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,080
battle, but it's a different thing. It's a word battle, a debate, a battle, but

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,240
basically I am I mean this is last time we did a debate. We did all sorts of

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,400
topics right. We did every topic under the sun. Go ahead and do the voice or

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,640
Pat, whoever you are. What voice? The voice of the intro. Oh, we did stuff

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,680
looks like. I don't remember it. Well, just say stuff man. It's improvise

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,880
Christmas. Well, we didn't do that. Well, we actually didn't talk about

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Christmas, but this time this time it's only Christmas. It's only Christmas and

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,720
it's the it's a we're having a debate on the role of wokeness in the holiday

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,960
season and whether or not it should be allowed or dis this obviously it should

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,560
be disallowed, whether it should be obviously allowed and we're all I don't

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,280
even remember what the second option was and we're all elves because we ordered

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,480
these elf costumes and forgot to use them in any time. It would make sense.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
We did the girl God show. I

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,680
fell in love with the elf. We had we had a

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
love with them. I asked for him afterwards. They said no yeah, which

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,320
first of all, I also I'll take a listen. I'll take credit. I masterminded this. I

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,760
sent Caleb. I said Caleb, you have to go agent. You have to go be like the face

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
character for our party, like in Baldur's Gate. You have to go and finesse these

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,560
elf costumes. Charisma is to steal them from girl. God charisma was way too low.

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,300
You rolled at one. I rolled a critical failure yeah, and then I said I said,

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,560
let me buy them off you and she was like, oh well, you know you don't need

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,040
it. Yeah, I'll send you the Amazon. Yeah, I'll send you Amazon like I was

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,460
like, well, just give them to me then and she said no yeah. I came back to

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:36,000
you hat elf hat in hand and I said we have to buy them ourselves. Elves are

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
stronger together. Elves are today. We're divided

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,180
funny noise. I guess like tomatoes.

54
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,780
I do not look like tomatoes to talk today. Are you kidding me? So how's

55
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,340
your day today? But I would see what you look like. Turn your camera on Buster.

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,480
You mother Buster. He can't turn his camera on a gun. You bastard say

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,960
something, say something, defend yourself. You sound like a tomato bitch.

58
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,920
Say something other than tomatoes. Fucking Christ, you're tomato brothers.

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm not

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,540
we're not the mother fucker. We look like one were elves to today. We're not

61
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,800
brothers at all. We're brothers and arms on opposite sides. We're sisters

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,120
because sisters are always arguing sisters fight. They say you fight like

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,040
an old married couple of sisters. Yeah, old married

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,840
sisters do fight all the time. What's that about? Brothers? I talked to my

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,800
brothers once a year. If I had brothers,

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,400
then this

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,800
then you wouldn't be like how you are. No, I wouldn't be so damn woke of

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,380
your brothers. I grew up with brothers. I grew up in a household of women and

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,060
men. I grew up with two brothers and a sister.

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,120
I grew up, I grew up with a I grew up with

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,880
purple furry monster. You're kidding. Yeah, that's a flat, a bald faced lie.

72
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Maybe let me guess in my lived experience, because you're from where

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
arrest. You're from woke Disneyland, where they have gay night. Yeah, I'm

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,800
from walk stir you from walk stir walk stir mass

75
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,700
I really need Worcester to become a center of of a liberality and what

76
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,580
yes of people's can call it already. Walks that would be isn't it already

77
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,940
now

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,840
okay, so now you're kind of coming over to my center of Massachusetts. I would

79
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,840
say that Boston bridge, bro lame bridge, a lens of fruits and nuts, summer

80
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,720
summer fill up your welfare bag, summerville is there. You're trying to

81
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,880
day shut up yeah. I'm not really good at I don't even talk shit about

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,160
some of

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,840
because you're from there. Don't even don't you even dare talk shit about

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,080
some of

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,520
you look like a tomato for real. I don't look like you dress. He's dressed up

86
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,640
like a tomato. You are dressed up like a tomato. I'm an elf bitch. You look at

87
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,960
the glow. Yeah, I bet he's from red pronoun, Vidence, Rhode Island

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,380
so that's literally what it is there bang him main. Oh yeah, that's more scary

89
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,840
Stephen King territory. Oh well man's chest, New Hampshire, just her her

90
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,600
New Hampshire, a man with a chest, who's a herd, New Hampshire, damn that woke

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:21,080
Konya, New Hampshire, Well Konya, let's see Wilmington, Drillington Kilmington.

92
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
That's what it really is

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,960
Earlford, New Hampshire, that's good like Guilford, yeah,

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,040
Milford Mills. I like that would be the

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,160
what's up yeah, what's up? I'm a hot over there or instead of a man,

96
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,980
instead of acting, it could be like action

97
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:44,320
like an action movie, but that would be anti woke. Well, you got to put I'm

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,360
just thinking of some action. Okay, so now you got to put some woke cities

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
and some un woke cities action. Glax, burrow, I want you to know this today.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,820
Cameron P town, you are now that you are my gym brother. Yeah, my brother in

101
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,480
arms, chest, legs and feet back or back. We don't do a feet day. Why don't we do

102
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,360
it? Why we do kind of there's that motorcycle one where you do this, but I

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,960
guess it's a cab phrase, but you use your feet for toes. Use your feet to

104
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,600
walk to the toes. You have to be a dancer if you want to work out your

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,680
toes, but because point because we know all about ballet because I did it my

106
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,560
my whole life, because I'm woke. That's I do that. Instead of having a job, you do

107
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,840
ballet yeah, that's how I got blue ass hair. You eight hours a day.

108
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Clock in nine to five ballet and I guess what I teach children ballet and

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,400
drag. Oh my God, all that is drag. If you ask me what the crap are you doing

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,000
guys like you think ballet is a drag, but I see it for what it is an art form.

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,400
My wife asked me to go to a ballet recently. She's a a belly like to watch

112
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,240
to watch one watch one yeah and I said it's better to watch a video of it

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,640
where they have perfected it. You have to go see a random time. It's like if

114
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,560
why do they I don't ask her to come to the Korean Gaming Cafe. This is why

115
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,000
okay, here's the thing. This is I guess outside of the debate, but this is why

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,760
I don't like plays man. Okay, it's like going you go. Would you like to go see a

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,400
movie, but they're just trying it? They're trying to do it. You want to see

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,280
all the actors try to do the movie, a one take movie. Would you rather see the

119
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,760
movie that they worked for two years on yeah right. That has effects that they

120
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,600
finish. They did the best try. That's exactly on the screen man. They can be

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,940
like a giant dinosaur in it. You can't have a giant dinosaur in a play unless

122
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,080
you do that. I would actually I would actually watch that. Do you want to see

123
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,520
a do you want to go see a movie that could be completely different every

124
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,120
single time, every time you want to see a movie where somebody might just

125
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,200
forget their lines? Yeah, exactly that they just they tried it. It's an do you

126
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,520
want to see an attempt at a movie? I don't like plays man. No, it's not for

127
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,720
really know. I don't like plays, but I also don't like bellies because of my,

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,860
but I think theater fosters important community in high school.

129
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,960
It shows boobs to as a guy's I've heard

130
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,460
says who did my friend live it. He was in a friend's name is Levitt. Well, his

131
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,960
real name is Jesse, but his middle name was Levitt. He went by Levitt. He told

132
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,700
me that he saw boobs when he was working when he was in theater. When we were

133
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,100
twelve years old, he saw boobs. I did never see boobs. I didn't see boobs

134
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
theater. Well, he wants to go. He said he was seeing him like every day. I

135
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,640
wasn't in theater. Was he doing like was he in a burlesque show?

136
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,400
He's in a burlap. He was in a child burlesque show, which is something you

137
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,680
probably want. You sicko bang bang. I don't want it because I already have it.

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
I have all I need.

139
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:40,840
I'm woke man. Oh God, so tell me what your plans for Christmas would be okay.

140
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,260
we'll do it. I guess we want to introduce our position. Let's introduce our

141
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,880
you mean X. We'll start we'll start. Let's start with Caleb. I guess we'll

142
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,600
show Caleb's me position on the debate.

143
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,960
We'll start at that end of the table.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,640
So

145
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,220
all right, read out your your your list card. I am a Christmas traditionalist.

146
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,000
Obviously, I think that Christmas season starts on December one and no earlier.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,760
I'm sick. I am sick of the day after Thanksgiving waking up and there's

148
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,540
garland everywhere, garlic, garlic, no that's Halloween garland everywhere,

149
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,900
disgusting green parts of Christmas trees. Leave that out of my shit man

150
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,740
remember the reason for the season

151
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,840
hmm. Look at that presence now on no long wrong wrong wrong wrong Christ

152
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,280
commercialism. It's about Christ birthday. It is not about commercialism.

153
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,200
That's the complete opposite. Actually, okay, it is not about unless you're

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,440
buying black right. I company anti capital, my discount code. No, none of

155
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,740
that. And then Mrs Claus is white.

156
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,920
I'm sick and tired of all these different races of Mrs Claus.

157
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,760
It's just not... I mean, listen, I'm fine with people being from all sorts of

158
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,720
worst countries than the one that we're in, but I'm not fine with rewriting

159
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
history. And it says in ancient texts going back to Mesopotamia, in the

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,880
hanging gardens of Babylon, there was tablets that read, "Mrs Claus, white as

161
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,140
the snow on which she walks right. It's just the truth. You know she was

162
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,420
Egyptian right so it's African. What is this clause was not fucking Egyptian?

163
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,340
I didn't know that bullshit. It's true. That's but that is we had out history,

164
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,540
but that is not true or bulls. It's not true. Don't listen to don't be swayed

165
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,340
Mr. Middle. I don't know who to believe in. Well, that's what I mean. Let's see

166
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,860
let's see Mr. Middle position. All right, let's see what I believe,

167
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,060
which is

168
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:44,200
I am a Christmas fan. I'm a supporter of Santa Claus, but also commercialism.

169
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,800
I like the presents and the stockings and I don't care who brings the gifts

170
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
as long as they

171
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
are

172
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
fun.

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,700
I just like Christmas. I just like Christmas. I couldn't see that TV is

174
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,500
too far away. You simply just are a fan of everything Christmas. Oh, yeah.

175
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I don't care what happens with I just like the music in the pageantry. Do

176
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,800
you like keep the politics out of it on either side? You know what if you

177
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
want to put politics into Christmas and

178
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
if you want to put if you want to change anything that Santa has willed into

179
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
existence. F you I'll say that much. Well that's

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800
both of us. So we're going to push you. We're going to push you so into the middle that you'll become

181
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
nothing. You'll be you'll disappear. We're going to compress you. Yeah. Well if that

182
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,360
that's it and so be it and here's my position for the debate. I am of course

183
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,560
woke and I am a I'm a woke iconoclast, so I want to destroy the icons of

184
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,360
Christmas. I believe Jesus Christ belongs in jail. Well, not in Christmas,

185
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,600
you shut your fucking mouth. He's only a baby. Oh man, he literally manipulated a

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,960
group of twelve people to do his bidding. He was a cult leader to hang out with

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm what are you manipulating me and can't mean Patrick. I think that on

188
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,580
Cameron, why am I saying your camera know so many times a sorry continue. I

189
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,100
believe on Christmas Eve, we should be leaving out gluten free cookies and

190
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,460
oat milk. Shut your trap, you bastard, and if my kid asks for Harry Potter

191
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,140
books for Christmas, I'm hitting them. Did you just say them? I said that I'm

192
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,820
going to shoot you to death with my fucking gun and then punch the hole.

193
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,980
Okay, we have one more position to look at to that. I don't know if there's we

194
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,660
I have one more member of the debate. If someone wants to read this, it says

195
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,540
Jubio, he's a white Mexican, which I've been dreaming of. It says I'm a lot

196
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,020
now. He died. I'm a me Papa. I'm a me Mama. I'm a Papa Noel. So he likes

197
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,660
Christmas. He likes his mom. He loves Christmas. He loves loves Christmas,

198
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,820
loves his dad, loves his mom, loves Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Santa

199
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,620
Claus. Yeah, that's cute. That is nice. That's actually very sweet. I'm curious

200
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,400
to see where he ends up by the end of the debate. I'm guessing that he will have a

201
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,560
strong stance on my end, probably no, we'll see bro. He's from Mexico. I'm

202
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,840
going to say walk is fucked up there. No, they're not. It's literally an entire

203
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,720
country full of Latinx people, Latinx, but they also have they have the cartel,

204
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,500
which I think is kind of cool. They should have the cartoons instead. Well,

205
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,180
that's a rude point. Rudolph, which is here without a Santa Claus, a crazy

206
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,380
nights, Santa's beginning. Wait, no, not a crazy nights. I hate that movie.

207
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,780
Well, yeah.

208
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,860
Oh my God. So what's our first topic here? I guess I'll put forth that I

209
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,060
think that

210
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,820
Christmas is a time to basically promote anti racism.

211
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,620
And how do you suppose we do that? Well, through gifts, I hope. Yeah, through

212
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,580
gifts, I'll be giving my white uncles,

213
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll be giving them gifts on like what I am. I can't deal with this. This God

214
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,720
did look at the world and and and activity books work books with anti

215
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,800
racist word searches and because they've done studies, they do studies and and

216
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,520
this is what besides therapy. This is one of the best ways to learn and where

217
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:19,280
intelligence is word searches and match the difference or find match box cars

218
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,040
is what I'd rather. What are your sources on these studies and was it in

219
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,140
Berkeley. This was a study that was done by me with my feelings.

220
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,100
You're okay and jokes, no logic yeah that doesn't involve logic at all.

221
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,340
That's just as I suspected. I don't know if you know this you're committing what

222
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:44,220
we call a fallacy. I'm the lying, you're committing what we call a felony,

223
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,340
which felony wielding that gun without a permit. I have tons of permits yeah,

224
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,740
yeah right here and right here. My two

225
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:59,080
permits are my hand and my gun doesn't food called chicken participation sound

226
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,620
so good.

227
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,460
That does sound really good at a restaurant. Did you say earlier chicken

228
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,020
salutation chicken salutations? I would order that was another one to I can't

229
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,880
remember, but also we talked about this very briefly because I did want to say,

230
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,340
but no chicken on Christmas meat, any Christmas meat out day. Oh well, that's

231
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,360
really good. That's actually that's great news for you. I think a Christmas. We

232
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,460
should get take our meat out. That's great because chicken isn't meat man.

233
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,780
No meat man. We should take our meat out. We're not eating steak. We're not

234
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,760
eating chicken. We're not even eating eggs, which I think is meat because it

235
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,320
comes with different colors. You're making me want to throw up chicken is

236
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,160
not meat. Eggs are not meat chicken is not meat. It is a chicken is a person

237
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,820
you're making me want to throw up. Shut the fuck up to right now that it walks

238
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,960
it's a person. A chicken has two genders that it has style. A human has two hundred

239
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,600
and fifty two genders in every strand of DNA. You walk fucking piece of dog crap.

240
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,760
I will blow your head off all over the Christmas man. It could get a different

241
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,400
gender every year. Oh, yeah, for Christmas. That's a terrible gift. And that's a great

242
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,240
gift. It changes your outlook on that's a terrible gift. There's no commercialism in that.

243
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,900
I'd like to there's no there's no physical object that you spend money on

244
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,140
that

245
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,160
it gives back to the world wrapping paper. You're putting

246
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,180
like rocking rolling paper. I bet you instead of having I bet you don't even

247
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,720
know how to start a damn fire and I bet you pull up the crunchy roll fire

248
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,320
simulator and you put that on the TV at Christmas. You fucking bastard. I don't

249
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,440
and I bet you that's so I do not pull. I do not actually use crunchy roll at all.

250
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,380
now that's cultural appropriation. I have my Japanese friend. He pulls up crunchy

251
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,380
roll at his house in Japan. I have him call me in the middle of the night when

252
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,680
he's awake and he tells me what's happening in the animes. Oh, so I only

253
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,880
watch on emas where the characters have different colored hair. I think I'm

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,720
completely going to throw up and I think I need to go. You're going to throw up

255
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,580
yeah. I don't feel good right now from my I'm worried that I caught Noah's

256
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,480
sickness right now. He doesn't throw up. That's not a throwing up sickness. I'm

257
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,100
that I caught whatever Noah has. Well you can throw up if you need to. I think I

258
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,180
might have to go. I think I just left in the middle of the fucking episode to go puke. We were

259
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,860
having a really heated debate I guess. We were really getting into it. Maybe we need

260
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,500
to slow it down. Let's get it slow and sensual like sex between two men.

261
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:34,180
I think sex between a man and woman should be over quick. I think I actually

262
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,980
I actually agree with that to even though I'm I'm conservatively. It should be

263
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,140
right way fast and jerky yeah because you don't good.

264
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,760
So we're agreeing on something here. Yeah, is that time is money time is

265
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,680
money and this what I'm supposed to pay this bitch ten dollars of time.

266
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,340
There's a finite amount of sex to be had in the world. Anyone given moment

267
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,380
that is true and it's better for a black guy to have it with a white guy.

268
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,340
you're kidding

269
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:07,780
and I and I suppose you think that white guys can get black guys pregnant and

270
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,520
vice. Okay, let's get let's get right into it. Let's dive into the issue of

271
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,540
black guys versus

272
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,400
in the bedroom who who would get pregnant and who would be the

273
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
inseminator. I am

274
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,200
wish I could get pregnant. I bet you fucking do. I bet you probably walk

275
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,580
around with one of those period cramps out of all of our friends. Who do you

276
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,200
think is the man most likely to get pregnant through a freak incident, Joe

277
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,440
joke could definitely be already has and he's hidden the baby. He could

278
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,040
definitely

279
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
he's had an abortion.

280
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,900
I think he could definitely get pregnant. I think men should have

281
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,980
abortions. I think men should go have monthly abortion, so they know what it's

282
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,920
like for women to get abortions and what they take out their their nutsack. I

283
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,060
think they should get a board. I think if a man eats too much, he should go

284
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,640
I was taken out of his stomach. You're kidding me and it's I think I should pay

285
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,160
for as a I think that and I also support those M pick. I do not support as epic.

286
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,920
If you are going to get skinny, you have to go work for that. Yeah, you have to

287
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,160
go to the gym every single day and you have to run for four minutes and then

288
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,240
you have to get so winded that you have to leave and think you're having a part

289
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,760
of part attack, a heart attack, a stroke, yeah, a part attack, a part of your

290
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,120
body, your body, your body is attacking. It is or it's being attacked.

291
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,560
I think that we should. I don't think that anybody should have a gym membership

292
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,420
and instead I think they should have a public pool membership.

293
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,520
Oh, and I think that everyone should wear their shirts in the pool

294
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,020
to hide their shameful bodies. You think that's okay in case to normalize it in

295
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,560
case there are people who are ashamed, but I don't think anybody should be

296
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,820
ashamed of their body, even if they're like two hundred pounds, two hundred

297
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,860
pounds, even if they're a fat guy is like two hundred pounds, two hundred

298
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,740
six. That's disgustingly fat. I don't even want to imagine this person.

299
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,940
Okay,

300
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,100
you won't be the shit. I think that Mel mentioned where the shirts in the pool.

301
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,120
So if a woman who's 120 pounds wants to wear a shirt in their pool to hide her

302
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,860
body, she can't her big fat body. Yeah, yeah, no, I just disagree with you. I

303
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,400
think that women should be wearing bikinis and men should be wearing suits

304
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,720
at the pool other way around.

305
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,680
You think that women should wear pants? I think that man, how are they gonna

306
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,820
give access to their bush easily, which is shaved

307
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,480
or should be. Are you serious? I don't think anybody should shave

308
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,020
any part,

309
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,080
but you think that photos of Marilyn Monroe, where her dress is being blown

310
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,480
up by a guy with a straw or whatever you think that there should be hairy

311
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,080
black pubes crawling like spider legs out of the side of a like. I don't like

312
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,400
photos of Marilyn Monroe. I like photos of Marilyn Manson.

313
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,640
you he's my sex icon. You think that's a he yeah what the hell is wrong with I

314
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,820
bet you look I bet you jack off the photos of Lena Dunham eating food.

315
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:04,340
You fucking woke piece of dog crap. We're getting a little away from

316
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,480
Christmas. I think it's mostly just

317
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,080
talking about fat

318
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,520
all right back to Chris. I think the girls should be by Lena Dunham should

319
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,720
have been called boys and girls, so it's all inclusive. So you agree that boys

320
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,740
your girls includes everybody yeah. If you keep if you have an ampersand in

321
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,720
there, a weird squiggly symbol, you bastard okay, here's what I want to

322
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,960
know yeah walk me through what you think

323
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,100
the Christmas story is the original don't be going. Oh, I shot my eye out

324
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
with a red writer BB gun. I'm right, which is amazing an amazing movie. I'm

325
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,700
talking about okay, the one that happened two thousand years ago. Okay,

326
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,460
let me let me through that what you think happened in that manger.

327
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,820
So

328
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,540
basically a straight

329
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:56,540
middle eastern male was born through in vitro fertilization, which should be the

330
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,180
norm. No, as well as surrogacy. I hate surrogacy or maybe if I'm woke, I'm

331
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,620
supposed to not like surrogacy.

332
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,260
It's kind of one of those things where to me it seems evil in real life

333
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,980
surrogacy. Yeah, I think I agree. I think that I think it gives me a kind of

334
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,580
existential horrification, not a baby, but I do support horror for the

335
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:22,980
the horrification of America anyway. A young baby is born okay. First of all,

336
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,660
it's that well that's probably the last part of the story scientific freak

337
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,260
accident. No, that's where it all begins. So you don't think it was you think

338
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,620
that they had a thousand two thousand and twenty three years later.

339
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:42,040
Basically, capitalism has taken this mystical occultic story. That's a

340
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,700
perverse

341
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:51,320
and it's they've perverted it. You think and I think that commercialism has taken

342
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,620
over, which is good, but I or well, I like when so it's good if people if you

343
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,680
spend money on pink presents,

344
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,640
where the hell even by pay you let me guess you do your Christmas shopping at

345
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,540
target yeah and the croc store and you do it a month. I do I do it. I do it

346
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,840
three months in advance and I do it and target in the electronics aisle. Oh God,

347
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,760
phone. I get my I get my I get my nephew. I get him cooking mama. Shut the fuck

348
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,760
for the don't you dare switch that man to switch the best console ever. At least

349
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,200
no, I don't tell me you got the Oled version. No, I don't have the Oled

350
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,520
version because we don't have a TV. We read books instead. So when my nephew

351
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,340
places switch, he uses the built in stand that comes on the back of the

352
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,380
switch. Do you know the one that no one's ever used? Yes, he uses that he

353
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,880
puts it on the on the kitchen counter because we have no chairs in our house.

354
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,500
it goes and he sits on the floor of the other into the kitchen and he holds the

355
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,200
joy cons. Why don't you have chair? Oh,

356
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,680
I believe in standing desks. You're kidding me. I had a beat your fucking

357
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,180
fruity ass for that and he has a he has the pink model of the switch dude. No,

358
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,780
here's what Christmas is about okay, okay, Robert Earl keen, okay, Christmas

359
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,400
sounds like a presidential assassin to me. Happy Chris, Merry Christmas from

360
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,320

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,380
golf balls. I want a twelve pack of golf balls. I want a brown wallet. Yeah,

365
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,440
and I want some kind of gift card right anything more than that anything less.

366
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,620
it's going to be a no for me. I'm going to cancel Christmas next year. Let me

367
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,260
let me walk you through what I'm getting for me and maybe this is my Ridge

368
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,620
wallet. I would like a special edition Blu Ray of Black Panther to Wakanda

369
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,700
forever. The one where they fight underwater Mexico.

370
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,460
Don't tell me you have Blu Ray in your house. Okay, first of all,

371
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,900
I have a Blu Ray optical drive that I plug into my Mac book.

372
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,500
Whatever happened and we don't we watch it and the screen is smudged to shit

373
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,020
because I think it's a touch screen and when I go on Etsy, I try and

374
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,460
grab all the heart shaped necklaces out of it. I like heart shaped necklaces,

375
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,520
then I wear jewelry.

376
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,140
I think all jury and I like Etsy for buying jewelry for myself. I think all

377
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,020
jewelry should be edible and what else do I get, but I get and then I get a

378
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,060
master class. No yeah, I get a

379
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,840
master class. I get I get I always ask every year, ask for the errands work in

380
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,960
master class. I ask for a cooking master class and how to make macaroni and

381
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,420
cheese

382
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,420
and I okay, so you eat cheese that's good. Well, don't tell me it's die.

383
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:47,160
Cashew, oh God, cashew cheese, you fucker and I ask for a master class on

384
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,140
how to correctly address the homeless population.

385
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:54,860
I got a good thing to do you fucking turn them into a hamburger, no

386
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,500
address, unlike whether you're supposed to say, sir or ma'am, oh not the

387
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,240
problem of homeless people who are camping. You mean the blessing it's

388
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,760
it's no blessing man, the blessing of diversity and income brackets,

389
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,480
thousand,

390
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,240
thousand, listen people every day are murdered by fentanyl crazed hobos

391
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,040
walking around to know who think that I think that you should get fentanyl. If

392
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,760
you have a headache

393
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,120
and there was something else I was going to ask for for Christmas that I can't

394
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,360
I'm having trouble remembering

395
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,560
probably. Oh, I remember what it was, and this is the most important one. I

396
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,640
I want this is my favorite gift. I want this every year, a hand drawn gift

397
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,240
certificate for one free hug.

398
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:46,140
That is a bullshit nonsense Lala gift from a fucking dumb ass kid, and I want

399
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,440
one that says one free item from the grocery store. Well, that's just a

400
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,260
normal gift card, and I don't think I think you'd be hard pressed to find a

401
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,020
normal gift card that says one free item from the crush. Well, how much is the

402
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,640
most expensive, not a bad idea for a good well. Some grocery store, self

403
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,620
grills and like well yeah, whatever the most expensive thing you need to buy the

404
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,580
gift certificate. That's such a good idea for a well yeah. I guess it kind of or

405
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,380
it's there we go again capitalism ruining Christmas. We can't have a free

406
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,420
item because everyone's going to abuse it and get the George Foreman grill. I'm

407
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:23,460
fine with capital. I like George Foreman because he he did what God said to do. He

408
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,380
went forth and multiplied. He has eleven children. I like big families as well,

409
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,200
and I think so, like molest each other yeah. What

410
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,300
I even woke

411
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
it's woke to

412
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,800
well, no, it's not guess. It's not well. It's not woke at all. You're just saying

413
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,500
yes to things yes, and I believe in improv you fucker piece of shit. Let me

414
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,560
guess you're happy that second city and you see beer coming back to New York

415
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,660
city, not you see be why not because I'm against sex slavery.

416
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,720
Well, I guess I'm pro you see be then

417
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,160
I guess I'm completely pro I'm super woke. I'm against sex slavery. I don't

418
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,560
believe in sexual assault. Here's what I don't believe it should be done to

419
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,340
okay. All right, that was tricky for a second there. I here's what I would get

420
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,600
you for Christmas. Okay,

421
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,140
let me get you want a

422
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,440
well, a helmet probably because you probably ride your bike with a helmet.

423
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,460
Oh, a bike, you mean a stationary bike.

424
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,780
That's how I get it right. You don't tell me you put on a helmet and ride the

425
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,360
peloton

426
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,860
and

427
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:32,440
pellets on and I play and I go on my phone and I open up Google Maps and I

428
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,520
and I do little craps. I use ways I actually use ways also well, then I use

429
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,280
ways is across the aisle. I use Yahoo. I still I still print out the map quest

430
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,400
directions every single day to get to work. Never memorized it. I go on

431
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,880
street view and I and I right I go on a new type of street with it goes inside

432
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,260
of buildings and I ride the peloton with my helmet on and I ride around the

433
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,320
library. I think that you and me right now, we would do an amazing round of

434
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,920
Geo guesser together yeah, you'd be guessing everything in San Francisco. I

435
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,040
don't

436
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,360
Mexico. This has to be Compton. I think yeah.

437
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:16,200
I think I saw somebody of his Hispanic Latin next descent. I think this is

438
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,040
probably shy rack. They call it.

439
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,520
What do you think about the North Pole?

440
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:28,020
I think it exists yeah, because I think it's a settler colonial state.

441
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,160
What could you think the elves aren't happy? They get to make toys all day.

442
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,680
The elves are the colonizers men who was there before in you at people, I

443
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,560
maybe

444
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,360
I guess I didn't really think it through the I just think that I was a

445
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,880
call those elves for being up there where they work hard for you every day

446
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,020
let's build your your bad dragon triple XL size dildos that you're fitting in

447
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,360
your mouth all day. Sure, sure, you realize that they're alienated from

448
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,200
their labor right.

449
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,180
Do they get do elves get paid? I don't care, but do they get paid? I guess

450
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,520
they're bored room and board. Is that enough to be making billions of toys

451
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,800
every year? Our elves

452
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,720
are they native to the North Pole or are they from some kind of dimension of

453
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,340
light. I think it probably is wonka status where they were in the jungle.

454
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,460
They were from the jungle and Santa went in and he was like he was slashing all

455
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,380
the lines of the machete and then he slashed one big group of vines and he

456
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,260
looked out and there was just a bunch of a bunch of a looked up at him and ran

457
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,940
away in a river basin. Yeah, they let him to like it was like and it's like a

458
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,060
waterfall and they have like kind of like a city built vertically into the

459
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,660
side. Yeah, I think it was probably that kind of thing. He met with the chieftain

460
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,760
of the elf tribe and the elf said we will come for you. We will come to your

461
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,160
north pole, your age, your great pole. Thank you, you saved us,

462
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,880
you saved us from being in this. You saved us from yeah. I don't know what

463
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,340
well we have an elf natural predator in the jungle. So let's just me jaguars

464
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,940
yeah

465
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:11,460
jaguars, panthers, anacondas eating elves all day in the Amazon. We need a

466
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,820
place where nothing can live.

467
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,940
that's what they said. You probably want you and let me guess

468
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,060
you probably think that Elon Musk is some kind of dumb a beat bastard.

469
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:28,720
Yeah, are you kidding? The only reason the greatest genius, the only reason

470
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,280
he's famous is because he's handsome.

471
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:36,520
Okay, you think he's handsome? Yeah, we don't live in a meritocracy at all. I

472
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,300
think he's an ugly piece of crap. He was ugly. He'd never be on he'd never be

473
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,720
buying twitter doing all this stuff, which by the way, my social media

474
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,100
network of choices, Pinterest,

475
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,660
what so you can look at pictures of flowers and all sorts of dumb gay yeah

476
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,400
here my here. I'll list off my Pinterest boards. I go ahead. You bet flowers

477
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,220
okay

478
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,100
birth stones.

479
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,520
Okay, I don't even know what mine is

480
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,660
live birth footage

481
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,360
miracle the because I think it's a miracle. Okay, we can so the miracle it

482
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,500
was a miracle when Jesus was born immaculate conception. It was a maculate

483
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,280
understand anti Christian

484
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,460
rhetoric.

485
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,180
They have a rhetoric, a rhetoric section where people post rhetoric. You can

486
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,940
find basically anything on Pinterest. Can you find pornography? There's some

487
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,100
pornography, but you know what pornography is to me, probably you

488
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,200
erotic literature.

489
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,260
So you're saying that every piece of media you call you think it's called

490
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,260
text yeah, and this is an erotic literature. So you think that let's say

491
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,680
Lana Rodes getting double. I prefer Lana Del Rey you

492
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,520
back to fat. She's big and fat. Now

493
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:51,840
I think she looks good. Let me guess you your favorite porn stars are probably

494
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,000
Buck Angel and

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
what's the other guy?

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,120
Oh yeah, Steve, I wish I knew some names of male porn stars right now to drop

497
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,000
that big funny fuck. There's a list of twenty of

498
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,740
God, I watch straight porn, but I look it up by the man's name. He's like how he

499
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,140
does it

500
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,260
yeah

501
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,360
okay, expect that Christmas

502
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,120
yeah bitch yeah. What's what's Christmas dinner Christmas dinner? Let me guess.

503
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,300
Well, I don't know additional a roast beast. Yeah, we've had rose. I mean I

504
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:33,500
don't know my wife and my daughters and their friends all make it. Okay, we have

505
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,120
every woman in the town come over all the guys. I have a forty person

506
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,940
love seat that we sit on and

507
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,420
traditional love seat and we sit there and we watch football game after football

508
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,620
game after. Well, let me tell you what I'm having for Christmas dinner as a

509
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:55,220
woke iconic. Let me can I guess take a you actually nailed mine a tofurkey roast.

510
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,540
Did I get that we don't we don't do roasts? First of all, we only have an

511
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,500
the fryer. We have no oven, a tofurkey roast. You probably have chow mein. No,

512
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,020
I got I have a roast. I have a Christmas. Can I tell you right now what I eat for

513
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,740
Christmas dinner? Wait, okay, the middle guy's back. Sorry, continue you a

514
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,680
Grinch, motherfucker

515
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,160
boy

516
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,100
breakfast for dinner,

517
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,700
scrambled eggs. That's a good thing to come back. Nickel toast. That's a good

518
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,000
come back and I do that yeah. Pumpernickel breakfast is a breakfast is

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,580
purely a breakfast. Breakfast belongs at night. I don't even do breakfast and I

520
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,980
I do dinner for breakfast. I do one meal a day man. I do. I believe that people

521
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,900
should eat ten to fifteen meals a day. No, you think they should do tiny meals

522
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,540
throughout the day. No, no, I even eat don't. That's a pizza. No one should eat

523
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,660
at all. That's your opinion. That's your take is no one should. No one should eat

524
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,100
at all, and I don't know what this debate has been about yeah, because

525
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,900
you've been gone. I had a sickness attack. Did you ralph throw? I didn't

526
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,340
throw up. Did you, but I had to I had to come down. You had to

527
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:04,700
I did let my I did let my I think maybe eating a bunch of enchiladas before we

528
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,500
recorded was not a good idea. I'm fine. I feel great. I feel better than I felt

529
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:09,740
in

530
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,960
two hours yeah

531
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,280
my body's full of carbs. My brain is firing at a rate. I my body's full of

532
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,380
cars, because I think that people should be transformers and should transform

533
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,880
their gender and their book also become machines, bro and I'm a transhumanist as

534
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,460
as a transgenderist. I don't even know what the God damn hell are you on about

535
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,420
with men shouldn't become women shouldn't even know what a car is. First

536
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,900
of all, okay, men shouldn't drive or shouldn't be cars. They should drive

537
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,580
cars. No, no, no, no, we need to get rid of roads. No, don't tell me you like

538
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,320
public transportation. You like bastard public transportation and I like

539
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,820
swimming. Bring back the public pool. Let's talk about the public pool again.

540
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,980
You think we should? I think it should be summer weather in Christmas time.

541
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,820
where has this debate gone? Wokeness versus Caleb and this is just this is

542
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,580
it's nothing to do with Christmas anymore. We're trying. You know what

543
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,940
trying? You know what you could you moderate it, man. You have lost the

544
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,380
plot completely. Okay, then you moderate. You have you two have completely lost

545
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,940
the plot. He thinks he should swim to work talking about the pool. You don't

546
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,900
get a pool for Christmas. You don't even get actually you don't get a man.

547
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,740
Someone's never had Christmas in L. A. The great city on earth. Oh my God,

548
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,380
the greatest city on Earth. You're making me go on to his side. Sorry, second

549
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,260
greatest Portland. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Even

550
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,820
the greatest Portland, Maine. Shut up right now. Shut the hell up. Portland,

551
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,060
Oregon, Portland, Maine, Los Angeles. You shut the F up. The greatest city in

552
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,380
the world. You, San Antonio, Texas.

553
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,620
The greatest city. What is that? Oh, now you're mocking me, 'cause that's what

554
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,020
I look like. My tongue's out all the time.

555
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,340
Fucking idiot. I'm about... That just made me sick again. Moderate, man. That

556
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,420
he just made me bring us to Christmas, some Christmas questions. Okay, well

557
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,340
what okay, if I have to give the topics, maybe that's what we should have been

558
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,300
doing from the beginning.

559
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,820
What do you think about the role of

560
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:13,980
the of movies? I hate rolls and I like rolls Royce, but keep going. What do you

561
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,780
think of the role of Christmas movies in society? Are they promoting?

562
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,360
are they promoting woke enough or have they become too woke or are they not

563
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,560
being woke enough? Of course, they are. They are. They not only is die hard a

564
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,860
Christmas movie, shut up,

565
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:37,820
but so is John Wick four. No, how so you're making me hate violence in it.

566
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,420
You're making me hate and despise.

567
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,580
And I bet you like these sacrilegious movies, such as violent night with David

568
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,740
Harbor. Is that camera all blurried up? Which one? The one that oh, it's gone.

569
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,760
Caleb's just went away. No mine. Well, I accidentally knocked into Caleb's camera

570
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,120
when I was coming back. Well, now I look sharp as a tack. Well, let me guess what

571
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,860
your favorite Christmas movie is. Go ahead,

572
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,500
probably

573
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,660
Rudolph.

574
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,860
You got it

575
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,700
yeah, you nailed it. Yeah, I like Rudolph. I think every reindeer should have

576
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,080
gotten a red nose to be equal. No, no, no, no, no, no. There's something called

577
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:20,020
hierarchy of I don't believe in individual. Peterson talks about this

578
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,860
the hierarchy of needs hierarchy. No, not hierarchy of needs hierarchy. I

579
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,520
think the hierarchy of needs is starts off a diverse community. Now,

580
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,720
second of all starts off Christmas gift. Second of all, second of all,

581
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,080
missile cognitive behavioral therapy at the top. It's a love third of all

582
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,880
being a girl. No. And then after that, it's shelter food and all the rest

583
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,000
to the stuff. No, you fucking it's Christmas gifts, mistletoe, Santa's love.

584
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,360
Let's talk mistletoe. What do you think about mistletoe? I think upper thumbs up

585
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,880
thumb does down. I think thumb up. Yeah, thumb up or fucking pussy. If she

586
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,880
catches me under that mistletoe. Oh my God, we're getting down and dirty. Okay,

587
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,000
fuck under the mistletoe. Yeah, you don't have sex under the mistletoe. You give

588
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,160
a kiss. No, I'm actually, if I this is something that we my wife under the

589
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
mistletoe. I thought you were the traditionalist. Yeah, and that's

590
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,340
traditional that's that's why there's nothing more traditional and sex with

591
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,800
your wife. Yeah, but I there's nothing traditional about sex with your wife. I

592
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,800
believe sex should be in front of everybody. Jesus, my God, I think you

593
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,300
get under the mistletoe with a somebody you don't know, a stranger at a holiday

594
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,320
office party. You think that's you think that's what should hook up at EDM

595
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,760
festivals. I like sluts. I like hipsters and I like

596
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,400
pirates.

597
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,940
I don't know what pirates fit into that. I like pirates are cool. I like pirates

598
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,440
because they

599
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,220
seize control of ships. I just like presents. I don't like any of this

600
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,800
stuff. I like presents and I like Christmas. We know you're the Christmas

601
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,020
fan. Okay, give us Santa could be Chinese. No, he couldn't. He could know

602
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,540
he couldn't. We actually don't we actually don't know evidence pointing.

603
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,860
We actually don't again. There is right and if even if we had gotten some DNA

604
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,120
from Santa like his beard hair when tested it, the results we would still

605
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,200
not be able to know whether he was Chinese or not, because that is not

606
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,620
biologically in your DNA. It's a mindset

607
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,040
what

608
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,280
that you're so anybody that Chinese is a mindset. You can think all races, just a

609
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,660
mind race is a mind mind told mental construct. I think wokeness is a mind

610
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,920
virus that you seem to be verily infected. Okay, that's fine. I like

611
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,660
viruses. I like Cove in one thousand and nineteen. I hope it stays around forever

612
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,720
because I like wearing masks because I can put my favorite Steven Universe

613
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,580
characters on them.

614
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,800
it's a new fashion accessory for me. It's basically jewelry. I have a

615
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,300
bedazzled coven mask as much as I hate that I've worn since twenty seven. I

616
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,120
have one that says my wife makes me wear this shit as much as I hate that. I

617
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,800
do think that if somebody were to get you that as a gift, you would enjoy it a

618
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,900
lot, so I'm conflicted now right. Give us another topic, then

619
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,300
gifts

620
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,800
have gifts become woke in the past year?

621
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,060
Yeah, and that's good. Since the COVID-19 pandemic. Oh, we already talked about

622
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,500
gifts a little bit, but I would say that gifts, since COVID-19, what do you get

623
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,420
now? A PCR test for Christmas now? Yes. Because of it's people are trying to...

624
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,540
Well, I get that every day of the year. You get a PCR test every day? Yeah.

625
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,180
I've never had one. I think that that shit stands for

626
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:29,140
prison. Photograph, catch, release. Exactly. Exactly. Thank you very much. My

627
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,900
entire camera roll on my phone. There's one picture of me and my gender

628
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,620
neutral partner and every other picture is a picture of my of a negative

629
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,460
covid test that I took that day that I sent to my boss at work.

630
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:46,420
You scroll through it. It's for and time. I read it yeah. I read it still

631
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,860
clean the paper I'm holding in front of my face,

632
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,220
still wearing lipstick in the pick. Oh, what the hell and I wait was it a gift

633
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,060
what the lipstick? No, I bought it myself using my unemployment check.

634
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,320
You're on fucking unemployment, even though you're employed. That's a gift

635
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,640
from the government. That's a gift from the government. I accept that. That's a

636
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,060
good thing. If there was a if there was a Christmas election to decide on who

637
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,020
was Santa, how many times would you vote? I would vote as many times as I could.

638
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:18,500
I don't even vote once. Okay, that's how traditional I am. I guess actually,

639
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,060
maybe I wouldn't vote either, but I would I would give my no. You know,

640
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
here's what I would do. I would give my

641
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,000
my ID card to someone like Julio

642
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,120
Mexican person who's white enough to pass for me in the picture, and I'd let

643
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,860
him vote for me. You know what I would do if there was a Christmas election?

644
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,480
What I would

645
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,460
vote for myself, because I'm running for Christmas comptroller really. What is

646
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,660
it? I think I don't believe that we should have comptrollers anymore. I think

647
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,980
they're fascist. Oh my God, you don't think that I think boards of select men

648
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,540
are inherently

649
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:01,900
right wing. You are a fuck ass, so you want a if you think that I can't be

650
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,560
Christmas, and I think our government should be a paramilitary woke death

651
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,300
squad who kills white chuds

652
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:13,520
on Christmas on Christmas, Merry Christmas, white every year. We should

653
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,140
have a chud purge now, and that would be the greatest gift I could ever get

654
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,360
would be if all these fat fucks

655
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:30,460
that's not that's not body. We're alive and body posi. They have blue lives

656
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,260
matter shirts on okay, buddy, they got blue lives matter shirts on their

657
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,280
walking around. I'm like is that flag waving in the wind? You okay, you're

658
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,280
getting sidetracked right now from what the the original thing was supposed to

659
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,500
be about, but you were talking about gifts actually, but let's transition

660
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,500
making gifts into stocking stuffers okay stocking. I think that stockings should

661
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,940
be normal socks for people that are fat. You probably

662
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,980
like you bring it up fat people all the time. I'm woke he's woke. He's obsessed

663
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,880
with the number one thing that woke people think about. You probably think

664
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,500
that stockings are something that that you wear whenever your boyfriend gets

665
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,400
it's what I wear when I get fucked. Oh

666
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,520
yeah sure I in my house. We hang we hang those those same stockings that I wore

667
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,900
up by the chimney. Yeah, we also hang up my mesh basketball shorts that I wear

668
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,160
when I

669
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,780
you are mesh basketball. Yeah, they slide down easier on the stockings.

670
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,300
Well, that makes some sense and my and my and my fish and my vision at tuxedo

671
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,120
shirt. Do you hang all that up on the fire so that the smell emanates around

672
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,580
the house to dry them off? They're soaking wet. If you were at my house, I

673
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,560
smell like chicken.

674
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:49,680
If you were at my house, I'd hang the stockings up, but I'd also hang you up

675
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,100
by your nipple piercing right on the man that would get me off. I meant to

676
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,000
come and I stuff your mouth with

677
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,440
is

678
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,400
he probably likes that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

679
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,720
let me guess you don't even make jizz anymore. Yeah, I'd probably just give

680
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,880
you a candy cane or gingerbread man. I have I got a special. I got a special

681
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,620
type of a sect to me where they snipped my my tubes and they connected them into

682
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,140
my esophagus. So I constantly am tasting my own j

683
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:24,440
wait. Do you even have to climb out inside my entire body so constantly

684
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,460
there's this and they do the thing where like a so they're siphoning gasoline

685
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,760
where they go and they sucked it a little bit and they plugged it into my

686
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,300
into my throat. So if I constantly whatever my balls generate a new sperm,

687
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,660
immediately get sucked up and you get my and you feel it back your throat and I

688
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,580
go and I lick my lips like this. A new sperm, you generate them one at a time.

689
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,020
Do you have what you're gonna need you generate? Yeah, what are you talking

690
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,860
about? I thought it was like you have a million sperms. Yeah, but you still make

691
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,980
a you. Do you think you start with all your sperms? Yes, no man. That's women.

692
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,620
You're a girl.

693
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,420
No, girls. Stop trying to trick him like that. True girls start with all their

694
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,860
eggs. No, I don't know how big is an egg. It's about the size of a grain of sand.

695
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,620
I think there's no way they start with all of them, but the egg is huge

696
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,620
compared to the sperm.

697
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:14,220
How many and I think that should be the relationship of size between women and

698
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:18,380
men. You think women should be big women should be big and strong and men should

699
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,820
be a size of a pin. No, no, no, no, look

700
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,460
every single time that we bring up something

701
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:32,040
you say some crazy as shit and it has nothing to do with Christmas.

702
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,400
least it's your job yeah. That's what I'm doing right now. I'm doing I got

703
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,600
man you're not you're you're you're you're you're complaining. You're not

704
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,880
even bringing a question. You say I don't want to talk about sperms and eggs.

705
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,400
That's all I want to talk about at any given moment. What you should be talking

706
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,240
about day in day out. How big is an egg compared to a spur? How many eggs does a

707
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,400
woman have? How many sperms do I make at a time? How many sperms can I fit my

708
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,800
mouth? What's a new surgery I can do it myself to access more sperms? You should

709
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,940
be talking about shirts and or bikes with pegs instead of we talked about

710
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,580
guns and eggs. You're talking about bikes already? How much did I miss?

711
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,680
When was that? About 20 minutes? He said he wears a helmet to ride a

712
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,280
Peloton.

713
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:18,080
He missed that completely. You would have loved that. I would have loved

714
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:24,180
that. I just had a sick attack out of nowhere. Okay, mall Santa. Mall Santa.

715
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,180
Okay, mall Santa. Winter Wonderland. It should be, I think that every single

716
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,680
store should have a mall Santa. Yes. I think every single store should have a

717
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,680
you to be walking into you probably like game stop and not even the xbox parts of

718
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,640
game stop. I don't like malls. Why first of all, because they're like a is

719
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,600
basically a modern day coliseum, a roman coliseum. What we watch amazing people

720
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,060
spend the fruits of their labor. Okay, you realize you're referring to a blood

721
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,720
sport right now. What's a blood sport? It's a sport where blood is spilled. I

722
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,960
do not like hockey, the roman football, which I also do not support. You don't

723
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,320
support football? No, because I think the ball is not circular. You are if you

724
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,340
don't support like a long shape of the ball. No, I want everything to be the

725
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,900
same. I want every ball and every sport to be the same. If you don't support

726
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:18,280
if you don't support football, then you are supporting taking away a specific

727
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,420
gift from a specific child. That's true, that's true, but

728
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:27,360
again, I think that football and baseball and sports like golf are

729
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,240
inherently violent, and so we shouldn't be giving these golf. I wish off is

730
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,880
finally literally it's a club. It's fine. When I play, I aim for the birds,

731
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,800
bro yeah, you join a call and trap. So what do you think we call it a trap?

732
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,360
It's because it sucks your life away. You probably like the trap.

733
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,000
I actually live in the trap.

734
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,360
Well, yeah, which trap

735
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:55,920
I don't know. I've never been outside

736
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,460
you haven't even seen the sign a second house in the hood. Wow, oh my God, you

737
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,660
like living in the hood. I bet you like I bet you are opening a muffin store

738
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,000
there and do type of muffin store that's going to be out of business. I know

739
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,500
what you're talking well. No, I don't know what you're talking about. You

740
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,440
muffin store is that is this a reference to something or just like an

741
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,020
example of an example of a woke type of business. Okay, so I did get what

742
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,180
you're saying. Your second with the second part of what you said. I thought

743
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,820
you might there might be some movie about a muffin store that opens in the

744
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:25,660
would know, but that'd be no, but

745
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,320
put that past that being a movie that both of you guys have seen and I've

746
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,560
never

747
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,880
that's fair

748
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,800
but mall Santa.

749
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,800
He I think that anybody should be allowed to dress up as Santa. I'm with

750
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,100
him on that. I think that I think that Santa is the perfect representation of

751
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,180
Christmas. You probably think that the kids shouldn't sit on the Santa's lap. I

752
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,980
think that they should sit on like well. I'm not going to say what I was going to

753
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,320
say

754
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:01,620
okay, that's good. Yeah, we can yeah all right next time anyway. Okay, next

755
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,500
topic is

756
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:09,460
the fruit cake wait. No, I'm one I'm teeing you on no that can't that's not

757
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,540
can a good face fruit cake. I can't in good face. I working dessert ever. It

758
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,780
has fruit in it, which is my favorite food. We have cheesecake or actually I

759
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,460
should say my favorite food is fruit flavor.

760
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:26,580
I like Laffy Taffy. I Laffy Taffy and salad and soylent salad and soylent. I

761
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,340
have soylent salad instead of salad dressing

762
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,660
I dress up like a salad yeah.

763
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,740
Why was the ketchup red? Why saw the salad dressing?

764
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:43,260
Okay, that I like I like that. That's a good joke. I'm going to remember that

765
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,580
forever.

766
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,020
I've never heard I was maybe the tomato supposed to be the one that why did the

767
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,620
tomato. I don't think ketchup would be in this. Why did the way turn red or why

768
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,440
was this tomato red? Why was the

769
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,580
ketchup?

770
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,860
That's not it.

771
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:05,000
That's not the catch. I catch up. That's the calming sound. I bet I bet out of

772
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,740
the bottom. I bet for I like when ketchup makes the fart noise when it

773
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,780
comes out of the bottle. You nasty, I respect to the body and all its

774
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,860
functions. You nasty as hell. I don't think farts are funny. I think they

775
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,700
should be revered. What let me guess, I think that the only time of fart should

776
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,240
be heard as if it's in a gag gift. I think it should be heard, smelled and

777
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,460
seen. You want green flow, gas and tasted.

778
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,460
I had a dream last night that somebody had a green fart cloud.

779
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:38,260
Who was it was you? It's probably me. You prophesized my sickness. Did I oh

780
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,900
yeah, because you had a green stinky fart.

781
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,620
that's not like prop prophecy. I think that's a prophet doesn't make you. You

782
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:50,300
probably don't even believe in prophecy. You probably don't know. I bet you think

783
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,300
that you know a prophecy. I believe and I bet you don't even believe in profits.

784
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:01,800
See Christmas is about commercialism boy. I don't I like buying stuff from small

785
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:09,060
businesses from local artisans and from farmers. Wait a minute, not a market. I

786
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:13,040
actually like them. You like gifts, so here's the examples of gifts that I

787
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,420
bought this year for my family. Okay, now I'm now I need to okay gifts you

788
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,080
to list all of your gifts that you bought. Okay, so for we'll go we're

789
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,140
gonna go gift for gift. We're gonna go back and forth or say a family member

790
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,120
and we'll say what we got on wild turkey one oh one seven fifty mil. I got

791
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,560
my aunt a new dress because I think she'd look really, really, really pretty

792
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,560
and and it's low cut. Shut up uncle

793
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:42,040
video of me playing the no Russian mission on DVD, got my uncle perfume,

794
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:48,680
not cologne, but perfume, nephew, nephew. I got him some stilt so that he could be

795
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,300
the same height as all of his family members. I got him a barbie video game

796
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:59,800
shut up nice nice. I got her a football or no. I got her a barbie ball.

797
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,280
it's a part. It's a pink ball, a pink football, got your knees, a barbie ball.

798
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,480
I got my knees a barbell to start working out and become buff and

799
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:17,280
brother. I got my brother some flowers for his grave. He passed away.

800
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,640
He passed away. He passed away. He didn't have a seat belt on. I got my

801
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,160
brother a witchcraft one on one candle kit. Okay, come wicked

802
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,660
no

803
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:35,920
you run your other brother, my other brother, older brother, my older brother.

804
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,040
I got him a letter from Thomas Jefferson authenticated. I got my older

805
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,620
brother estrogen shots. What Thomas estrogen?

806
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:48,240
I think that's a letter from

807
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,340
well, that's all the older sister doesn't have to. Why are you doing

808
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,240
siblings. There's so many possible members of the family, cousin, second

809
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,880
cousin, great dad and your best cousin. Here's what I got my dad. I got my dad.

810
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,980
I wrote him a note that says you are no longer the man of the family. I don't

811
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,900
because I don't believe in patriarchy and I think you have no claim over this

812
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,540
family leave now every single fucking holiday. Me and all my brothers and

813
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,580
cousins and dads. We I mean dad only have one. We have wrestle on the front

814
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,940
lawn to see who's going to be the man of the family. I do that with all the

815
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,420
women members of my family to see who's going to be the woman or the man to see

816
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,820
who I'm going to wrestle.

817
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,220
You just wrestle women, you're sounding a lot less like a woky and a lot more

818
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,320
like a pervert who yeah

819
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:41,420
what's the difference. Thank you, thank you, thank you. At least you're a

820
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,280
little bit self a facing. I like that

821
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,980
he's a super agent for your side. Anybody ever gone too far in the woke

822
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,780
direction for you?

823
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,440
know. I don't think I've ever met anybody who's been more woke than me,

824
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,640
because every time I do,

825
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,000
I either

826
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,200
kind of shatter their mind with an argument tactic, okay, and make it so

827
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,080
that they don't ever are enabled to hold a conversation anymore,

828
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,480
or I just get more woke.

829
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,740
Just get more woke. That's disgusting and you're on mastodon. Yeah, I'm on

830
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,420
mastodon and blue sky. I played half of the new Spider Man to game. Oh my God, I

831
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,260
don't think you can guess which half I played like only the miles Morales

832
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:29,060
missions. Is there more than miles Morales? Yeah, they also white Spider

833
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,500
Man, which is what I think his name is

834
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,740
there. Spider Man and white Spider Man. Yeah, okay, let's get down to

835
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,980
one more Christmas thing. What do you Spider Man? No, no, you can think of one

836
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,820
Christmas topic. Yeah, you were making such a big stink carols. Oh, that's a

837
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:51,780
good one here. I am burner rock me like a hurricane. I think I think it doesn't

838
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,420
matter man. It's fucking here's my hot take or should I say cold take when it

839
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,740
comes to Christmas or hot when it comes to the Christmas fireplace on Christmas

840
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:06,660
carols. I think that Carol of the Bells should be banned because it's too scary

841
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,900
for people with sensory overload. I

842
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:17,360
you can't cater the entire world. It's too many notes. If I want to blast that

843
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,900
out of my Ford Maverick with the subwoofers, I should have every fucking

844
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,940
right. That's on my side. That song came on Pandora, which is the music streaming

845
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:28,660
service that I use. You don't even have a choice on Pandora. There's no freedom

846
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,000
of market. It's radio. My little brother, who is four years old and we just

847
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,160
diagnosed him with autism because he likes playing with blocks, died.

848
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,300
the my God killed him. Well, he might have actually had something wrong with

849
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:45,620
him. If he can die from a song yeah, the and the autopsy, they lied on the

850
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:49,540
autopsy. No, they said it was because he did not have enough nutrients in his

851
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,380
diet. What were you feeding him? We were feeding him paper.

852
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,180
We were

853
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:03,880
tofu wrapped in paper, the paper that the tofu comes in yeah comes in paper.

854
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,140
I think I'm supposed to be. We weren't pressing the tofu either. I think I'm

855
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:12,020
supposed to be the worst guy on this and somehow you have killed a child and you

856
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:15,660
I killed it was my little brother since what oh so now you think the eldest

857
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,980
sibling is responsible for raising the younger sibling. Yes, because the mom

858
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:23,020
should be on quaaludes and the dad should be at work. No, no, no, no, do

859
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,900
you know what to take a to raise a child? It takes a village fuck a village. It

860
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:32,500
takes a village in any country, a village, fuck a city, fuck all that. I

861
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,320
demand we get back to talking about Christmas carols. What do you want me to

862
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,840
today man. I already told you my we talked about the Carols. What okay?

863
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,260
I

864
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:44,480
okay. I think our parents are good. Our Carol's becoming woke.

865
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,500
You just have this the same question for every yes or no question. I

866
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:54,260
come. I shouldn't be here. So stop shoehorning all this fucking. I just

867
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,860
need to I need to speak about Christmas because I love Christmas so much.

868
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:03,260
I think I'm trying to stay here. Carol is a beautiful name for a baby boy

869
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,540
born in twenty twenty three

870
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,140
that you're for real, like carol spinny, who played dead, which is how I say for

871
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,920
real. What the hell is dead? Your ass is about to be dead. If you keep talking

872
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,180
about all this bullshit to me, the female ass is dead as a as a

873
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,380
erogenous zone. I don't go anywhere near it. You're not you're not. That is a

874
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,960
it's a no man's land, no man's sky. I think that game is bull that the woman's

875
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,880
at the woman's ass is a no man's land because it is for women only. No women

876
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,820
should not be anywhere near another girl's ass. Women should be called on

877
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,820
watching each other's at except in different videos, except for videos

878
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,100
on line videos on line. Women should be touching each other's. I guess I like

879
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,380
videos. I guess we could find some common ground there. Why what are you

880
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:51,500
doing building a silencer? That's my gift to you. Of course, you would have a

881
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,100
silencer silencing the voices of everybody around the world. All these all

882
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,700
these minorities that live in other countries over the sea.

883
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:02,540
Yeah, I guess I would like to silence them. All these minorities that live in,

884
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,380
for example, Asia, the other minorities, the only silencing I do honestly,

885
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:13,480
because I like my guns loud and my t shirts proud. The only silencing I do is

886
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,600
silencing the night when I play the song really, really loudly

887
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:25,540
oh silent night, holy night and pay attention. These lyrics all is calm. All

888
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:30,820
is right yeah. I likes the song silent night to the cover by the dickies, but

889
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:34,560
what the hell? Yeah, you like the vaginies, punk music that had that has

890
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,860
irreverent references to sexual anatomy. Listen, I like rock and roll all day.

891
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:45,860
I like Elvis Costello. I like I like the red hot chili peppers, but as soon

892
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:51,020
as you bleed over into this punk BS, dude, I like punk music man. I'm a fan

893
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:56,060
of Phoebe Bridgers. I'm a fan. The hell is that the other her sister,

894
01:00:56,060 --> 01:01:00,020
Phoebe Bridger, in her boy band? Is this an animal crossing character? I like

895
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,840
Brockhampton. What the hell's Brockhampton? It's basically a hundred

896
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,880
guys who are in a what we call a polycule. You're kidding. What the

897
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,720
fuck's a polycule? That better be a bug. I like bugs. You like bugs. Their

898
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,280
skeletons are on the wrong sides.

899
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,920
It's on the outside. It's on the outside. Okay, one more Christmas. I

900
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,880
need you to come up with one. Let's go to Christmas Banger one Christmas

901
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,840
thing, because we are getting off topic talking about Brockhampton and bugs.

902
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,280
What should be on the top of the tree?

903
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,840
That's a good question.

904
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,960
That's a very good question.

905
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,600
Not an angel.

906
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,120
A MAGA hat.

907
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:45,640
A big red MAGA hat that says, "Make this tree green again."

908
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,120
Because you probably want a white Christmas tree, because I've seen those.

909
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:55,000
I want a green Christmas tree that has lights around it that are every color of the rainbow.

910
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,780
I think on top of the Christmas tree, I think that it should be a high achieving female who's

911
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:06,360
worked hard this year and is on display for everyone to see and appreciate. You want them

912
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,600
to put Sydney Sweeney on top of the Christmas tree? Sydney Sweeney would be a good choice.

913
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,240
She worked hard this year. I bet you want -- I bet she did. She got all her fucking

914
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,360
rolls because of her boobs. That's what I think. And I bet you want the top of the Christmas

915
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,640
tree -- I didn't even notice she had boobs. I bet you want the top of the Christmas tree

916
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,400
going to be that demonic statue they put up in the financial district of all the

917
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,800
all the tentacles coming out of the woman's head.

918
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,000
What the bowl and in the financial district, you're talking about the

919
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,240
fearless girl, are you talking about Starbucks? You're thinking of hair? No,

920
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,400
I bet he would want the Starbucks logo on top of his train somewhere. I saw

921
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,360
there's a golden thing and I got so mad at it that I shot everybody in my house.

922
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,720
I

923
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,560
it's a golden statue and I bet you like the little girl more than the bull. Yeah,

924
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,960
course. Yeah, it's a defiant piece of art work. All right. Well, it doesn't seem like we've

925
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,120
come to any sort of resolution. Well, we have to ask the undecided. We have to ask. I mean,

926
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,600
Julio, who convinced you who won this debate? Are you pro woke, anti woke, or do you just

927
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,600
like Christmas?

928
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,840
I'm pro woke.

929
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Pro woke.

930
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:17,400
Oh, my God. Of course, you would be. Oh, my God. Well, I mean, you got to think this is

931
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,760
the guy all is fair in

932
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,540
oh, so far

933
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:27,080
that is not as a Christmas horn.

934
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,480
That is a Christmas horn.

935
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,320
I think this belongs to Christmas. No,

936
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,680
keep that out of all right. Well, I guess that that is the debate. I'm

937
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:44,080
sorry that I became completely ill in the middle of it and it won't happen

938
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:44,440
again.

939
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,760
Alright, Merry Christmas everybody. Bye! Join us next year.

940
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,760
PODCAST ABOUT LIST

941

942
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,300
I am just finna say it, Avatar pussy probably tastes so good.

943
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:04,500
DOOOOODAY!

944
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,160
You can't start the episode like that!

945
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:06,900
Ha ha ha!

946
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,040
What's up y'all, welcome back to Potabout List.

947
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,680
We're here recording in the library at our college.

948
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,320
Yup, our college located at 120 Boyles.

949
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
I'm just kidding.

950
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,520
I'm not gonna dox us.

951
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,920
Dude, do you know what I saw today?

952
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,360
I saw the fattest guy riding a skateboard around campus.

953
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,720
He was like, and I'm not even kidding,

954
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,320
he had to be like 200,000,000,000,000 pounds,

955
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,720
but he was taller than me,

956
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,400
and he had a Mario mustache.

957
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:28,960
Ha ha ha!

958
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,860
Oh, yeah, I saw him too. Honestly, dude. I wish that I was him. He looked so awesome. I hope I see that guy again

959
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:40,440
I want to make him jiggle like a jello bowl. He was really good at skateboarding though, especially given his height and weight

960
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:44,740
God, it made me so jealous. You have no idea how jealous I am of that guy

961
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,900
I want to sniff his stinky shoes after he skates. I want to turn him into a bubble and make him squirt bubbles God

962
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:54,800
I'm feeling so sexual. I wish the bubble was my boyfriend. I would take the bubble out to dinner and drink wine with him

963
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,200
Oh, I love wine. I love red wine and white wine.

964
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,700
Yeah, and I wish I had to make the bubble squirt every day as my job.

965
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,100
Oh, and the bubble looks like Mario.

966
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,700
Dude, me too.

967
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,200
I wish I could make love to a bubble and achieve mutual orgasm.

968
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,400
I wish the bubble I am imagining was the third host of this podcast.

969
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,700
I hope one day he becomes the third host of the podcast.

970
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:16,600
I bet he would be the funniest podcast host of all time.

971
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,200
Aight, motherfuckers, this honky finna sing.

972
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,400
I'm in love with your suit.

973
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,500
I'm gonna sing too.

974
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,400
In a few years, I will bring a Mexican on as our producer.

975
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,960
You would not believe your eyes

976
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,500
Ten million fireflies

977
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,200
lit up the world as I fell asleep

978
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,660
'Cause they fill the open air

979
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,660
and leave keyer drops everywhere

980
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,900
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

981
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:49,300
I'd like to make myself believe

982
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:54,800
That planet Earth turns slowly

983
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,600
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

984
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,300
'Cause everything is never as it seems

985
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:09,300
