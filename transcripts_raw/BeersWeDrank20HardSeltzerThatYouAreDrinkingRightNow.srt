- Yo. - Cheers.

- Yo.

00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,640
- Jesus Christ, man.

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,960
- Whoa, you have a bottle.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
You start.

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,560
- I'm gonna start.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,920
So this here is, this is actually a really fancy bottle,

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,560
now that I see it up close.

23
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,240
So this is, I was telling Rex,

24
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,760
this is a completely surprise mystery beer to me

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,480
because I didn't buy it this time around.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,580
I asked my girlfriend to buy it for me.

27
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
And it looks like she got me a,

28
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,260
ooh, it's called Charro.

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,340
Wow.

00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,500
Naked women in the bottle.

31
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,700
That looks like the top of a car

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,540
that somebody painted.

33
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,380
I will be drinking this and I'm gonna be saving the bottle

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,380
for enjoyment later on.

35
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,820

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,100
What are you gonna do with the bottle?

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,300
All right, what are you going next, Caleb?

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,660
We'll take a sip and give us a rating review.

39
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
It tastes like beer.

40
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,660
I don't hate it.

41
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,660
It just tastes like beer.

42
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,660
You're so shit at reviewing the beers.

43
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,660
Well, I have a Victory Sour Monkey,

44
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,660
which I think I had a different version of this one time.

45
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,660
But I never had this one.

46
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,660
So I'm going to take a sip here.

47
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,660
It's the Sour Triple 19.2 fluid ounces, 9.5% alcohol.

48
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,660
He kind of looks like a Victor monkey tonight.

00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,540
Oh, it's so sour!

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,500
It really is quite sour.

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,800
But I'm going to give it, you know,

53
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,620
you got to grade every beer

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,460
next to beers of the same family.

55
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,920
As far as sours go, this is like a 5.7.

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,260
Oh my God, wait.

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,460

Except for on the basketball scale.

59
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,960
On the basketball player scale, it's probably a 6'4".

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,760
Oh, shit.

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,560
It's pretty good.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,060
No, I can't see.

63
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,060
It says World Beer.

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,760

So it's completely bronze.

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,360
You're my bronze, Mexico.

68
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,460

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,460
All right, Rex, how about you go?

71
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,160
So I don't really have a beer this time.

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
Oh, but what I do have.

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Wow.

76
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,360
OK, this is interesting because I almost buy one of these every single episode.

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,340
I get very, very close to doing it, but then I can't do it.

78
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,700
It looks too disgusting to me.

79
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
It's been years for me.

80
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,200
Yeah, this is what I drank on my 21st birthday.

81
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,540
Take a sip.

82
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,780
Yep, that's what I remember.

83
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,340
Is it made by Bud Light?

84
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,480
It is indeed.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,220
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,960
Is it strawberry flavored?

87
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,460
Yeah, it is. It tastes like a strawberry margarita.

88
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,260
It tastes very sweet.

89
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,960
It's 8% alcohol.

90
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,760
Give it a height rating.

91
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,560
8%?

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
This is probably like a solid six foot five.

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,560
Maybe even six foot six.

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Shooting guard.

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah. Shooting guard.

96
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,960
OK. And a good one at that.

97
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,220
It's got hops. Yeah.

98
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,460
OK. All right.

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,820
Yes. All right. I like it.

101
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,260
Well, I've had a major life change this week.

102
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,520
Which is?

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,880
I want you to guess.

104
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
I want you to guess what it is.

105
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,920
You're growing your hair out.

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,820
Wait, no.

107
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,320
Wait, no, look behind me.

108
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,220
Look behind me.

109
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,820
Oh, you got it.

110
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,920
Oh, you got an air on my chair.

111
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Did you get that from Mr.

112
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,520
B?

113
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
Yes, Mr.

114
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,220
Bean.

115
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,820
Yes, we went to my friends.

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,280
A mutual friend of ours, he is leaving his company and the company is shutting down.

117
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,440
He wants to be on the show, so he'll be on the show at some point.

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, he also stole so much stuff, I don't want to say his name.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,760
Oh, never mind, never mind.

120
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:35,120
So we went to the day before the company moved and they didn't want a lot of the stuff there,

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,800
but some of the stuff they wanted. So we took probably $4,000 worth of Herman Miller chairs.

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Oh my God.

123
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,440
Put them into a car.

124
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,440
I think we took seven. I think we took seven chairs.

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
That is more than $4,000.

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
Really? Oh my God.

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
That's a $1,500 chair, dude.

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
Really? It's not that.

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
That is crazy.

130
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
If you try to buy that brand new, that's like a $1,400 chair.

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,600
I mean, it's definitely a huge upgrade from the chair that I had previously.

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
But honestly, I don't care about office chairs that much.

133
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,040
It's funny that you say that. Oh, yeah, it's an upgrade.

134
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,540
when you were just sitting on like a kitchen chair.

135
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,440
I had a broken Ikea chair.

136
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,280
It was an Ikea chair,

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,240
one of the $39 ones that are just like school chairs basically.

138
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,240
The back of it had fallen off and so I could not recline in it.

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
Your back will thank you.

140
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,960
Yeah, I'm pretty excited. I've been chilling way more today.

141
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Yeah. The leaning back,

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,360
like the weightlessness of the leaning back in the air on is so nice.

143
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,020
This is an amazing chair, guys.

144
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah.

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
And I also got a Billy

146
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
Billy Big Mouth Bass from the office.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
So Billy Big Mouth Bass in the office.

148
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,500
Yeah. A little miniature USB one.

149
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,560
So I'm pretty excited about that.

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,800
That's come up.

151
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,760
What else did I steal or get gifted to me?

152
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,200
That's that's really the big ones that I commit.

153
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,260
That was the big ones.

154
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,460
Yeah. No other real crimes that day.

155
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,900
But those are my big my big moments of grand larceny.

156
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:16,440
You've been a leader of industry for the past, what, five years and you were still just sitting

157
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,360
on a complete wooden chair and you were gaming in a little box.

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,680
You're still kind of in a little box.

159
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm still in a little box.

160
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
I still need to get a desk.

161
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm having a curveball thrown my way this week.

162
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,160
My cousin texted me yesterday and said, "Hey, are we still good for me to come to New York

163
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,560
in two days?"

164
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,640
And I was like, "What?"

165
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,580
And I looked back and four months ago, I guess I had said that it was okay for him to come

166
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,940
to New York and visit me for one week.

167
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,940
But I completely forgot.

168
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,940
To stay with you?

169
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Is he staying with you?

170
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Yeah, he's staying with me.

171
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Oh my God.

172
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Yeah.

173
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,940
So the wife is not happy, guys.

174
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,140
She is just straight up not happy.

175
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,100
You should really like take like a blueprint of your apartment and show that to people

176
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,860
before they make plans to come and stay at your place.

177
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,960
I don't think you say but oh yeah virtual tours that yeah, it's like two steps

178
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,860
You're like we know I don't know what you said

179
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:18,500
You had to share a couch with Noah. That's why you hated it. Yeah, well, I didn't hate it

180
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,140
I thought you I thought it was very nice. I was very thankful for what you did for me

181
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm still very thankful for what you did for me. I would probably never do that again

182
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,220
I would rather go to anyone else's apartment before yours because of how small it is and how tiny it is

183
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,220
I'm the only guy that my cousin knows in all of New York City, okay? I called him today. I

184
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,880
said, "What do you want to do while you're in New York City?" He said he wants to see the Statue

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,760
of Liberty. So I'm going to make his dream come completely true, okay? And he's going to stay…

186
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,280
A whole week to do that?

187
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,240
And he is going to do a lot of work for me for free, and also he is going to watch my dog a

188
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,720
lot. That's the plan, and I'm pretty excited for it, honestly.

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
That's nice.

190
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Do you guys like when people come visit you?

191
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
No.

192
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
I do actually.

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Yeah, I do.

194
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Yeah.

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,480
But I hate feeling responsible for another person's entertainment.

196
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
For their fun.

197
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,760
True.

198
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,080
Yes.

199
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,240
I hate that responsibility.

201
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,360
I've been thinking about this a lot recently because I was talking to my girlfriend.

202
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,120
I was like, you know, we already had a guest here, stay here like in February I think.

203
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
And it went like decently nice.

204
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
We had a lot of fun.

205
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,820
We showed her around the city and she like enjoyed it.

206
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,620
Yeah, it was my girlfriend's friend.

207
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:47,120
And I was like thinking recently like what would I show someone who comes from outside the city?

208
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,020
And like answer the country.

209
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
I'm like, I don't I wouldn't really know.

210
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,220
It's like it's really hard question to just like pose yourself.

211
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,520
Like I think you have to like just face it when they're there.

212
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:06,740
I want to see ruins if i come to mexico i want to see giant ruins i want to see those big heads i want to see all those stones stacked on top of each other.

213
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,620
For ruins you're gonna be a little bit out of luck if you come to my city.

214
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:21,620
If i come to your city and there's not ruins i'm making making yeah i'm making ruins you okay your house will be obliterated lee in a demolished way.

215
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Are you, okay.

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I will be knocking it and then when I'm done I'm going to spray paint it brown so it looks very old.

217
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,000
And I'm going to string your skeleton up and put it in my study.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yep.

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I would have a very old looking apartment.

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You know what, honestly we could probably, if we did something crazy at Julio's house when we visit him,

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
we could get maybe some kind of like historical plaque in like 20 years.

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can you guys not visit me at the same time?

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Can you guys stagger your visits?

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Why?

225
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you want us to stagger our visits?

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Maybe if you only see this when a share the the sofa bed.

227
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,560
I like sharing okay also how much is it i'll get an airbnb i'm a new airbnb in mexico.

228
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:09,160
Probably not much cheap as a as a dog shit i will we can't put like a air mattress in the empty space behind you.

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think we completely can.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's a rug right here.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can sleep on the rug.

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'd sleep on the rug.

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I've slept on worse floors.

236
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When we were on tour, when we stayed in Texas, I slept just on a foam roller.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That was the only thing I had.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Didn't have a blanket, just had a foam roller at this guy's house.

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's fucked.

240
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And it was one of the worst nights of sleep I've ever gotten in my entire life.

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And the guy that we were staying with was loudly having sex.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Nice.

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
With a man.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know.

246
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know.

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know.

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know.

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know.

252
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know.

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,120
life and the guy that we were staying with was loudly having sex with a man.

254
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
Yeah, who knows?

255
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,300
I mean, I'm not I wasn't I didn't watch.

256
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,060
Yeah, it was you.

257
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,360
You didn't see who came in out of the door in and out.

258
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,160
It could have been a man.

259
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,100
I could have, but I think it was probably his girlfriend,

260
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,400
if I had to guess.

261
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,700
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's a good guess.

262
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,660
And she loves him.

263
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,500
Probably a safe assumption.

264
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Dude, the word, I think the worst.

265
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It would be so funny to have a girlfriend

266
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,140
and then ruin her life by having gay sex and have her find out.

267
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,400
What are you talking about?

268
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,340
She cheated.

269
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,440
Cheating on your girlfriend is funny, let alone.

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,500
No, no, no, no.

271
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Cheating on your girlfriend.

272
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,840
That's horrible.

273
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,100
Yeah, your girlfriend with a man.

274
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,700
Why is that better?

275
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,440
It's funnier.

276
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I didn't say it's better.

277
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,100
It's just funnier.

278
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,400
She'd be having more distraught

279
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,940
because, you know, when you cheat on someone, that's like, oh, you can't.

280
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,240
I can't give that to you.

281
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,900
You know, whatever. Yeah.

282
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,260
But you know, a woman can well, you know, don't even say it.

283
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm going to forgo it.

284
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,600
You're about to say a woman can give you a blow job with a beard.

285
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,700
But no, we don't want to say that.

286
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,500
That's disgusting.

287
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,300
I've been having an emotional affair with the guy who runs

288
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,600
the deli down the street, I think, for a couple of years.

289
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,260
Does he like kind of touch your hand when you like to tap?

290
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,340
Does he love you?

291
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,400
He says, How's the dog?

292
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Every day for a full year now he says how's the dog and i'm gonna say good he says getting big.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,040
Yeah he's wondering when you're gonna bring it in to turn it into meat.

294
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,780
No he would not eat him.

295
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,240
I would not eat him i would not eat phil no i have no interest in.

296
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,940
Phil or sam.

297
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,140
Do you think Phil knows your name?

298
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Do you think Phil knows your name?

299
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,640
Phil definitely knows my name, yeah, no doubt.

300
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,840
Sam, Sam, you know what man?

301
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,340
It's honestly one of the, it's probably the longest running

302
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,540
stranger to stranger relationship I've ever had.

303
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,640
I've lived in the same place for like over three years

304
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,840
and I've always gone to this one deli

305
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,140
if I need like a sandwich or like a grocery.

306
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,640
And it's honestly, it's the worst deli in the entire neighborhood.

307
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,840
But it's just the first one I went to, so I just keep going to it.

308
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Yeah.

309
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,600
And no, I would say he doesn't know me, doesn't know my name at all, but he knows that I have

310
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
a wife and he always says, "How's the dog?

311
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
The dog's getting big.

312
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
How's the wife?

313
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
What is she doing?"

314
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
The wife's getting big.

315
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
The wife's getting big.

316
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Like a bitch?

317
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Nah, come on.

318
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
The wife's getting pretty big, man.

319
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I go, "Yeah, actually now that you say it, yeah, I guess she is getting pretty big."

320
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Time to get a new one.

321
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
And it's his fault, dude.

322
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
He's making me gobblers.

323
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
That's my favorite sandwich there.

324
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
The gobbler.

325
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
What's a gobbler?

326
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,520
And it's his fault, dude. He's making me gobblers.

327
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,120
That's my favorite sandwich there.

328
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,520
What's a gobbler?

329
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,640
The gobbler. It's a turkey. Okay.

330
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,800
It is a turkey sandwich with Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, Russian dressing.

331
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
It's delicious.

332
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,960
And it makes sense why it's called the gobbler.

333
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,400
Because it's turkey.

334
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,280
It's turkey.

335
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,360
And you gobble it.

336
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
Yeah.

337
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,400
It's a delicious sandwich.

338
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,680
Do you ever have an aneurysm when you talk to someone

339
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,380
and you just say like, yeah, can I get the yummy sandwich?

340
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,280
I can't say that that's happened to me, man.

341
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,680
I really can't.

342
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,540
It happened to me yesterday.

343
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,080
I asked, what do you do?

344
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,580
Someone was making brownies at the July 4th celebration.

345
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,180
I was at. I was like, can you add some yummy, nummy sauce to it?

346
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,080
This is being cute.

347
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,040
That's not having an aneurysm.

348
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,280
Wait, what the fuck is yummy, nummy sauce?

349
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I think it's just caramelsauce in my head.

350
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
It's something yummy.

351
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Yummy nummy sauce.

352
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
I hate you.

353
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Yummy nummy sauce.

354
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Did you say it really?

355
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
It was like the entire party silent

356
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
in that one moment.

357
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Yeah, yeah, of course.

358
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Can I have some yummy nummy sauce?

359
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Can you put some yummy nummy sauce on it?

360
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Did you know these people very well?

361
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,140
You if if somebody if I was doing a Fourth of July thing

363
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,320
and some guy brought this guy over

364
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,820
and he gets it, he just starts.

365
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,360
My wife is kind enough to make him brownies

366
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,320
and then she serves him one and he says,

367
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,520
sorry, you forgot the yummy, yummy sauce.

368
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,300
Can I have a beer from you?

369
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,860
I would duct tape him to a firework.

370
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,640
Send him into the stratosphere.

371
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,300
I did. I did drink a Sapporo Reserve.

372
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,680
Those are great.

373
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,760
I did not enjoy it.

374
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,040
In fact, I would liken it to a form of torture.

375
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,800
The Sapporo reserve.

376
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,840
What is the poor reserve go?

378
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,800
Uh, quite frankly, the worst beer I've ever had.

379
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,160
Really?

380
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
Could have just been because it was warm.

381
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,160
It's it sounds like it was serious.

382
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to push back on that.

383
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,800
That's an amazing, amazing beer.

384
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,600
If you ever go to Gyukaku, the Japanese barbecue place, that's the

385
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
best beer you can get there, man.

386
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
I think they have it on draft too, and they do not ID.

387
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Maybe on draft would be much better.

388
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,300
Everything I disagree that everything's better on draft.

389
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,900
Yesterday. OK, yesterday.

390
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,100
All right. What's the what's the trip report on all beers you had yesterday?

391
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,640
I drank a lot of like mixed drinks, which were great, like like tequila drinks.

392
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,160
Oh, amazing tequila.

393
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,600
Some some lavender lemonade and then some

394
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,000
a like margarita mix.

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
And I just drink just the mix with.

396
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,540
Right. But there is tequila that I would.

397
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,940
Oh, that was the some some Espolon.

398
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,660
There was an Espolon bottle to decent tequila.

399
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,940
I drank a lemonade, 40 beers yesterday.

400
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,860
And half of them were.

401
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,840
They were they were from Sonic.

402
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,160
They were like, you know, Sonic, like the drive in.

403
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,200
It was Sonic Hard Seltzers, Cherry Limed, and it was amazing.

404
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
That sounds amazing.

405
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,920
It was so amazing.

406
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,880
Oh my God.

407
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,000
Sonic's entered the hard seltzer game?

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
They've entered the hard seltzer.

409
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,440
We need to make a hard seltzer.

410
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,480
Everybody has a hard seltzer now except for us.

411
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,360
We're like on our own.

412
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
That's true.

413
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Every--

414
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,800

What do they have?

419
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,840
They have White Claw, Truly, Happy Dad.

420
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,040
- I don't even know if I've seen Happy Dad.

421
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,520
- That's the Nelkaboys, that's their seltzer.

422
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,320
We need a Happy Dad style thing.

- Something, hmm.

426
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,880
- I mean, we should just have a line called, "You drank."

427
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,560
- Oh yeah, we were talking about, yeah, beer you drank.

428
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,040
The seltzer you drank.

429
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,600
Seltzer you're drinking is good.

430
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,000
The hard sense where you are drinking right now.

431
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's an amazing.

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
We could do a yummy nummy sauce flavor even.

433
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
Wine you glugged.

434
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Wine you glugged is good.

435
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,400
Wine you're glugging.

436
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Tip up that wine you glugged.

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
I hate glugging wine though.

438
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I hate wine.

439
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,920
I'm putting a stop to this right now.

440
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,520
I went to a girl event.

441
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,200
I went to a festival for lavender blooming about 2 1/2 hours outside the city.

442
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,560
And.

443
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,640
I stood in line in the drink line for like 40 minutes and just started

444
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
buying as many drinks as possible so I wouldn't have to stand back in that line.

445
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,920
Smart ended up buying just like a bottle of wine.

446
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,800
From it, just started drinking from the bottle.

447
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,400
I'd be like, oh, this is horrible.

448
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,700
Yeah, wine is not that good.

449
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,240
Yeah, I, I don't understand good wine.

450
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,940
That's that's honestly the big thing for me.

451
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,780
Like, I feel like with beer, I can tell if a beer is like a nice high end beer

452
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,540
with wine, I really can't tell at all.

453
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,440
It's complete BS. It's complete bullshit.

454
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,340
It just tastes the same, which is not that great

455
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,380
because you're supposed to sip it.

456
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,040
And when I drink alcohol, I want to grab it like this

457
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,240
and then bring it to my lips like this.

458
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,240
And then you want to can.

459
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,620
Wait, did you just demonstrate how to drink a beer?

460
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,700
Yeah, or a cup for that.

461
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,000
I want to do this. Yeah.

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,460
Yeah, and I think I want to do this.

463
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,760
Wait, you didn't even succeed at drinking.

464
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,300
You spit it out.

465
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,100
I don't really love the flavor of this.

466
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,920
I like the art.

467
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,100
Wine, you have to sip slowly.

468
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,980
Yeah.

469
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,480
You got to be a real alcoholic to glug wine.

470
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,560
We're drinking a beer, drinking a mixed drink.

471
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,400
You can just I think I think I talked about this a lot,

472
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,120
but did you know that in like tequila where they make tequila?

473
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,920
Yeah. If you go to like with the distillery there, they take you to like the tour.

474
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,160
And at the end, there's like a like a like a tequila tasting session.

475
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,160
And they like make you taste the tequila like it like a Seville's wine.

476
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,600
Yeah. Well, that works, too.

477
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,260
I mean, actual liquor you can drink like.

478
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,860
Yeah, you're not supposed to really shoot good liquor.

479
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,800
Yeah.

480
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,300
Yeah.

481
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,000
Good, good anything.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Good whiskey, good tequila.

483
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,300
You're supposed to sip it.

484
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Yeah.

485
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,800
And sipping a good tequila, like a Don Julio.

486
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,500
Yeah.

487
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,000
What's up?

488
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,300
It's too spicy.

489
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,500
Tequila is too spicy to just sip, man.

490
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,100
Yeah.

491
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not going to be doing that.

492
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's not spicy.

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,100
It's too, too spicy for me.

494
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,800
I want to eat a, you know what we could do with a hard seltzer

495
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,600
that you drank, that you're drinking right now, is we could

496
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,800
do like, we could put like a mezcal worm in every single one.

497
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,520
And it's a gummy worm.

498
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,120
You know, no, it's a worm.

499
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
It's a gummy worm.

500
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
It's a gummy worm.

501
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,560
Or why are we limiting ourselves to worms?

502
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,000
Put any animal in it.

503
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,360
Put a spider, put a fly, just a single fly.

504
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,440
It's a cockroach.

505
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,640
The yummy, yummy flavor of the seltzer you're drinking right now, it's hard to

506
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
tell you you're drinking right now, it should be a gummy worm.

507
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,940
That I think goes without saying.

508
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,740
Yeah.

509
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,740
Hard seltzers should be like elf bars.

510
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,540
They should have,

511
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,740
they should be like mango,

512
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,440
banana,

513
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,140
peach.

514
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,340
Yes.

515
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,540
Hard seltzer.

516
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,340
Mint salt.

517
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,740
It should make you feel horrible.

518
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,440
Yeah.

519
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:11,740
It should,

520
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,340
you should feel like your insides are being churned.

521
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,640
Yeah.

522
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,340
You should be able to smoke it as well.

523
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:16,940
Yeah.

524
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,540
I agree.

525
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:17,940
You should be,

526
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,140
I mean,

527
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,540
I've been saying for years,

528
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,240
you should be able to smoke beer.

529
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
All beer should be smokable.

530
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,740
There's no reason.

531
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,180
We have gotten so far ahead in technology.

532
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,220
A.I. could get involved with this.

533
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,260
Let's start smoking beer.

534
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,020
Wasn't there like a.

535
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,120
Oh, no.

536
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,300
I was thinking about like inhalable alcohol, but I think someone made

537
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,460
like a powdered alcohol that you could snort.

538
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,940
That is for your ass, I think.

539
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,960
Yes.

540
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,100
And that's what you're going to put alcohol in your ass.

541
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,880
Now, I can't say I have my ass is pretty untouched.

542
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,980
It's pretty.

543
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,360
My ass is pretty.

544
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
My ass is pretty.

545
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
I have...

546
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm trying to think of what things I've put in my ass like medicine was.

547
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,400
I remember when I was a kid, I had strep throat and my mom had to put a pill in my ass.

548
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
And I was way too old.

549
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,300
I was like, like eight years old.

550
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,600
Like I can do that myself.

551
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
That's not that old.

552
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,800
It's too old for your mom to finger your butt.

553
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I thought you were going to be like 14.

554
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
I was 14.

555
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,400
You were about to say you were 16.

556
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,660
Yeah, you're the same age as Cartman at eight.

557
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,540
Like you can't get it all the time.

558
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,340
Yeah. Yeah, that is true.

559
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,380
But yeah, I don't think I think since then I've been really put off

560
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,500
of putting pills and alcohol in my ass.

561
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,100
What do you have to put a thing in your ass?

562
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,380
Badly, you need hemorrhoid cream.

563
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,280
You have hemorrhoids.

564
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,100
I do. My hole is.

565
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,180
Is that because that's because you sit while you pee?

566
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,960
- Okay. - No, it's 'cause I sit while I poop

567
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,720
and then continue sitting for 20 minutes.

568
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,560
- It's 'cause you sit while you pee, man.

569
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,920
You sit on the toilet too long. - And then I turn the bidet

570
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,160
on full blast. - Caleb, did you pee,

571
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,440
did you pee sitting down this week?

572
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,520
- Twice, count 'em. - Really?

573
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,640
- Two times. - I could be standing up

574
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,320
all week. - And both times,

575
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
both times, guys, I was peeing, sitting down,

576
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,560
and my wife walked in, mom, you were peeing, sitting down.

577
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,320
- And she's like, "Oh my God, I married a girl."

578
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,520
Literally both times she was like,

579
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,360
"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were taking a shit."

580
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,440
And I had to be like, "No, I'm only peeing

581
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,920
"and sitting down because my friends told me to do it."

582
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,560
It was not very, it was not attractive, I don't think.

583
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,720
- Okay, I think if every time someone

584
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,540
thought you were taking a shit, you were peeing,

585
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,780
I think that'd be a good thing, wouldn't it?

586
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,400
- But I think I should have told her I was taking a shit

587
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,120
and just forgot to lock the door.

588
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,960
But instead, she knew that I was sitting down and peeing.

589
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,880
- I mean, do you not lock the door when you pee?

590
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,540
Not when my wife is the only person in the house.

591
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,600
Who cares? - What's the difference?

592
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,440
What's the difference?

593
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,260
What's the word?

594
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,360
She smells your poop?

595
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,520
- Yes. - She smells your poop

596
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,360
constantly.

597
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,760
- She has never ever seen me poop

598
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,280
and I've never seen her poop.

599
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,200
It's a hard line in our relationship.

600
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,780
It will never be crossed.

601
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,760
This is lifelong. - Okay.

602
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,600
Okay.

603
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
- I do not like poop.

604
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
I don't like to think about my wife's poop

605
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
and the poop that she makes.

606
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,480
and while she's pooping, I don't think about it?

607
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,320
- You're thinking.

608
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,440
(laughs)

609
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,040
It sounds like you're thinking about it a lot.

610
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,000
- This sounds like an I think you should leave joke.

611
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,920
- Yeah. - I don't think,

612
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,040
I don't want to think, I see it's scrambling me.

613
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,680
The idea of her pooping makes me want to divorce her

614
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,760
so fucking badly.

615
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,600
(laughs)

616
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,420
- Yeah.

617
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,260
- I won't do it.

618
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,600
- I think it would be cool to serve your wife a divorce

619
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,700
while she was pooping.

620
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,840
- Yeah, where are you gonna go?

621
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
You have been served. - Exactly.

622
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,600
Yeah, you got served.

623
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,440
- Okay. - For some reason,

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,640
- Your wife is taking a shit.

625
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,760
Hey baby, really quick, what's your name?

626
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,840
(laughing)

627
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,680
- How old are you?

628
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,500
- You have been served.

629
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,360
- You just pull your pen out.

630
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,060
Hey, can you sign this real quick?

631
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,320
- Okay, well regardless of all social norms

632
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,320
that you were afraid to break, how did it feel?

633
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,120
- It felt wrong, dude.

634
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,960
- How did it feel wrong?

635
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,640
You're just chilling, you're sitting down,

636
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
you're peeing, it's fine.

637
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,920
- I didn't like it, I did not like it.

638
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,760
- Really?

639
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,080
of the times my piss, my piss like came between the toilet seat and the toilet

640
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,600
and it dribbled down the front of the toilet? That happens to me too. I did not

641
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,000
like that dude. Why would you do that to yourself? Well I you know I didn't think

642
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,640
your shit was as small as mine. Mine's microscopic. I talked last week about pissing on my own like balls in my pants.

643
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
We did talk about that. I mean come on. You do have to take like an index finger and

644
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
just kind of point it down.

645
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,120
Yeah, see, I don't want to be sitting there.

646
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,280
My wife walks in and I'm talking to try to fucking piss.

647
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,120
That is like the worst possible situation I could put myself in.

648
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
Why is she walking in while you're in the bathroom?

649
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,560
She's trying to get moisturizer.

650
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,120
Well, maybe she moisturize your dick.

651
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,320
It would get hard when you saw her.

652
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, that's a pretty good point.

653
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,760
Found it right now.

654
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,960
That's pretty funny.

655
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,660
Maybe if she rubbed my dick with moisturizer, it might get hard.

656
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,660
Yeah.

657
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,860
While I'm peeing, sitting down.

658
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,660
I can see that.

659
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,160
While I'm peeing, yeah.

660
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,660
I don't like pee.

661
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:23,160
I heard a story this week from a friend of mine who said that he was having sex with a girl

662
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:28,660
and she squirted, which I told him never tell me anything like this again.

663
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,660
This is disgusting.

664
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,160
He said that she squirted and then she just peed in his bed.

665
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
She wanted to keep it going.

666
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:45,520
She squirted and then and then just like he said that there was a gap and then it went from an explosion to a literal stream of yellow pee directly on his bed.

667
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,880
I will be mad he was pretty mad he said i would say get out of his.

668
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Get out he did not like it and i can't blame him do that does not sound all that fun.

669
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,640
That sounds horrible i would be very offended.

670
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,040
I do not like all that's an insult to your intelligence.

671
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,540
Yeah.

672
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Which is what i believe what was it with.

673
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:21,740
Oh yeah i think she's getting one by you by squirting and then p.m. she just has to pee and she's like well here we go i'm gonna get him with this yeah.

674
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,940
I don't think it was thinking at all.

675
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,540
I think i mean this guy has to be so good at sex to make a girl squirt and then p though.

676
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:43,360
That's what i said i was like you that's it you should take that as a compliment cuz so a lot of guys can make a girl squirt but the squirt and then she also he's all over the place.

677
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,340
Is true if you can get a girl to get a woman to squirt piss and shit.

678
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,480
At the same time you might be one of the best people at sex ever.

679
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:04,100
Are you here to ship i hate shit i hate p2 i do not like how much pornography has has a weird moments of peeing in it what.

680
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,480
What are you talking about sometimes sometimes you watch porn and then at the end there p.

681
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:19,080
That's true that's true.

682
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:27,780
Just random crap. What are you searching? I don't search anything. I just click on the first video that pops up.

683
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,900
I've never searched on porn. Have you ever seen a peeing compilation?

684
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,780
No, I don't watch a peeing compilation. But sometimes there is one at the end of the video for some reason.

685
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:45,780
I'm just trying to watch the part where the logo comes up and then all of a sudden there's people pissing in each other's mouths.

686
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,040
I don't know what's going on.

687
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm trying to watch the do do do do do do do

688
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,740
and the Pornhub logo comes up.

689
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,220
That's what I do.

690
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,580
OK, and then all of a sudden people are pissing on each other

691
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,080
and eating shit.

692
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,360
OK, what sound is that?

693
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,920
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

694
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,020
How does it go?

695
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,920
I don't know.

696
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,220
I said, is that a sound?

697
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,160
The Pornhub sound?

698
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,660
You don't know?

699
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,060
I don't know.

700
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,560
He's a very cool version.

701
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,340
Yeah. Well, I'm not pretending here.

702
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,340
I genuinely do not know what you're talking about.

703
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,180
- He's like boom, ba-da-da-da-da, boom.

704
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,500
- That's not what it sounds like.

705
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,340
- Or something.

706
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,260
- Does it do that?

707
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,460
- You're doing the Seinfeld thing.

708
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,300
- What?

709
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
- You're doing the Seinfeld theme song.

710
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
- No I'm not.

711
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,140
- Yes you are.

712
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
- No, the Pornhub comes up and it goes,

713
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,140
burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it.

714
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,660
That's a true story.

715
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,380
- No, I think you're completely making all this up.

716
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,300
- All the good porn sites have basically

717
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
been taken off the internet, if you ask me.

718
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Which ones?

719
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,540
All the ones where you could steal

720
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,140
expensive ass porn.

721
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,780
Like what's expensive porn?

722
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,220
Like luxury ass fucking

723
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,740
VIP exclusive porn.

724
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,300
Is there like Rolex porn?

725
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,420
Is there Rolex porn?

726
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,060
I mean, I'm trying to understand.

727
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,260
Yes, there's there's

728
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,820
a lot of amazing porns

729
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,300
that you just can't watch anymore

730
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,220
unless you pay for them.

731
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,420
But back in the day,

732
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,700
you used to watch them for free.

733
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,900
Caliber, you were a gooner

734
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,780
when you were 17.

735
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,780
You know, I've always been so afraid of masturbating more than once a week

736
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,780
because I thought it would make me go to hell.

737
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,780
So, and probably no time other than, no time more than when I was 17.

738
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,780
So, no, I would not say I was a gooner.

739
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Okay.

740
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Yeah.

741
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,780
And also I was really, really scared of getting caught

742
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,780
because I got caught with porn when I was like 11

743
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,780
and I think it ruined my life probably.

744
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,260
- Ruined your life in what way?

745
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,180
Do you want to elaborate on that?

746
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,960
- Well, I broke the computer.

747
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,520
I've talked about this before.

748
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,580
I broke my computer 'cause I looked up nakedladies.com

749
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,440
and then I took the VGA cable in the back

750
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,420
and I didn't just rip it, I ripped it

751
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,980
and then I spread all the pins with a butter knife

752
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,380
and then when I, I don't know.

753
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,580
- Why did you do that?

754
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,420
- I don't know.

755
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,900
- I don't think that's to do with the porn.

756
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,740
I think you were insane.

757
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,040
The internet, the search history, I didn't know how to clear it.

758
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,240
So I ripped out the VGA cable, spread all the pins with a butter knife,

759
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
and then I was like, "Oh, fuck, I broke the computer."

760
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,740
So I started spraying super glue onto the back

761
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
because I thought that would fix it.

762
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,740
And so I glued the cable to where all the pins were spread down,

763
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
and there was no connection at all.

764
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740
And then my dad got home from work, and he was trying to play Solitaire.

765
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,740
And I just heard him say, "What the fuck happened to the computer?"

766
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,740
And then they went and they got the computer fixed, and they brought it home.

767
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,240
And my mom was like, "Oh my God, the computer's home.

768
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,040
Let's all sit as a family and go to a website."

769
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,340
And she typed W and it auto-filled nakedladies.com.

770
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
Yeah.

771
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,340
And I got in big, big, big trouble.

772
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,040
Yeah, I can imagine.

773
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,340
Wait, so I just want to understand.

774
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,340
What...

775
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
So you go on the website.

776
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,840
I just want to know the timeline.

777
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,640
You go on the website and then something freaks you out.

778
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,340
You saw a naked lady and it freaked you out.

779
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,340
No, no, no.

780
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
I loved it.

781
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Oh my God.

782
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,340
I was...

783
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I love it at first sight.

784
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,180
seen all that before.

785
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,760
Yeah, it was a complete boob and pussy heaven.

786
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,600
Yeah.

787
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,420
Well, not pussy.

788
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,360
I always would turn it off before they showed their pussies.

789
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,200
Okay, why?

790
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,600
'Cause they're disgusting.

791
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,240
And I still think they're a little bit disgusting,

792
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,160
but I used to really hate them when I was a kid.

793
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Found it.

794
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,480
Yeah, straight up, I'll say it.

795
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,140
When I was a kid, I hated pussy,

796
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,680
but now I'm basically addicted.

797
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
But yeah. Now it's okay.

798
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,320
Now it's fine.

799
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,160
Yeah, it's okay.

800
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,980
It's like a six out of 10.

801
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,820
Right.

802
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,660
But yeah.

803
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,180
It's like a five foot eight out of basketball scale.

804
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,500
Yeah, it's kind of Isaiah Thomas kind of hype.

805
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,060
Mm-hmm.

806
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,180
But yeah, I don't know.

807
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,980
Something about that, dude, that will make you not like porn

808
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,980
all that much, I think.

809
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,700
Hmm.

810
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah.

811
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,060
OK.

812
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,620
I had two years of goonery.

813
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
You gooned a lot?

814
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,340
When I was a freshman in college,

815
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,940
I had a gigabit ethernet connection.

816
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,440
Damn.

817
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,040
I just downloaded so much pornography.

818
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,240
And I would just delete it.

819
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,840
I just I would watch it once and delete it.

820
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,480
I would like terabytes, terabytes.

821
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,080
I would download.

822
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,880
I was oh my God, hard drive and deleting it.

823
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,120
Just as I was doing that on a private torrent site

824
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,720
and my ratio got so good from it that I've just never had to worry.

825
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,780
Whoa, nice.

826
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Is it IPD?

827
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Yeah, I have like terabytes of upload credit.

828
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
What's your ratio?

829
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I think it's getting to about one now, but it's like my up and down is like three terabytes each.

830
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Damn!

831
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
Oh my god.

832
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
That's crazy.

833
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Yeah, and then I started taking Adderall and that was when it kicked up a notch.

834
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,780
You just beaten it on Adderall?

835
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
Oh yeah.

836
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,320
Just oh no railing it taking hours, hours long.

837
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,740
What's even the point of that, man?

838
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,220
Feels great.

839
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,420
It's long.

840
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,680
I don't think it feels very good.

841
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,980
That can't feel very good.

842
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,980
No, you know, it doesn't feel good on that role coming.

843
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,920
So it just keeps going.

844
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,520
It doesn't.

845
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
It feels like nothing.

846
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,120
It's worse.

847
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,780
Mm. What?

848
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,180
Yeah.

849
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,480
I've never done that.

850
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,440
Well, I think it's kind of making me scared to think of that, though.

851
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,220
Yeah, you can come as many times as you want and never feel the immense pain

852
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:35,960
that comes along with it.

853
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,820
This sounds amazing.

854
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
I want to try this.

855
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
Mm-hmm.

856
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,120
Hey, you should give it a shot.

857
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,220
They need to make a drug.

858
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,860
They need to make a drug that makes your penis hole

859
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,260
literally like four inches wide.

860
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,260
I think they'll make this.

861
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,000
No, I don't think they do yet.

862
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,660
Yeah, they make it.

863
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,760
That's just a kidney stone.

864
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,360
No, kidney stones are very small.

865
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
little rods you put in there.

866
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,300
Mm, the sounding rods.

867
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,900
I see. I don't want to touch the inside.

868
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,400
That grosses me out.

869
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,600
Yeah, because I'm uncomfortable in a story about it.

870
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,660
I want to look inside of it, though.

871
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,360
We're going to hide some stuff.

872
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,100
Yeah, like a telescope. Yeah, exactly.

873
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,000
Wait, what we had in there.

874
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
What I hide in there.

875
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,700
Yeah.

876
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,260
More and more drugs probably to get through TSA.

877
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,460
Yeah, probably hide a big, disgusting.

878
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,020
- Your giant gaping hole of a penis.

879
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,060
- Big nugget of brown weed stuck in my dick hole.

880
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
- I don't think you can get it through TSA.

881
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,220
- Oh God, dude, just like a brush being just dragged

882
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,660
out of the inside of your penis.

883
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,180
- I think they have a machine that specifically

884
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,380
that looks at you naked and they could completely see

885
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,980
that your penis has a thing inside of it.

886
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,100
- Have you guys ever seen your naked body

887
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,380
on that TSA scanner?

888
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,260
'Cause sometimes they have the screen turned the other way.

889
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,100
You can literally see both your balls hanging like perfectly like at equals three.

890
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,020
Kind of like, you see the balls.

891
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,340
It looks like Squidward's eyes and nose.

892
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,000
Yeah.

893
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,760
Yeah.

894
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,900
It's not, it is not discreet at all.

895
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,940
They, and also it's pointed.

896
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,220
Do you ever think they see a really tiny penis and laugh at it?

897
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,760
Oh yeah.

898
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,480
For sure.

899
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,100
That probably happens literally every day.

900
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,960
Yeah.

901
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,660
Do you think they see a really big one and the woman TSA agent kind of turns

902
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,100
around and gives them the eye.

903
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,860
No, this is the probably not.

904
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,700
This is the gooning Rex coming to life.

905
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,540
Yeah, you're imagining some sexual situation.

906
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,780
Women hate big dicks, dude.

907
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,100
That is true.

908
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,500
They think they're gross.

909
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Yeah, that's what they always tell me.

910
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,980
Yeah, they don't like them.

911
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,860
They hurt, apparently.

912
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,220
So, yeah, I might want to think it's actually really good.

913
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,420
I don't have one.

914
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,780
It is good to all the hate to have one.

915
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,260
Have a 14 inch penis, dude.

916
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,940
I would hate that so much.

917
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,640
You know what I hear?

918
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,680
I hear that guys with big dicks feel less.

919
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,640
Really?

920
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,040
Yeah.

921
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,980
And they're not as smart.

922
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,040
I heard this.

923
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,480
And they die first, I was just thinking.

924
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,100
Yes, yes.

925
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,040
They die way earlier.

926
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,780
And I also heard that they honestly don't get that many girls.

927
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,540
Mm hmm.

928
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,240
And because, like I said, girls don't like and they definitely have

929
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,480
an increased risk of penile cancer.

930
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,640
Yeah.

931
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,440
Yeah.

932
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,380
And they got to chop it in half.

933
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,420
- That'd be funny if somebody was making some point

934
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,380
about guys with big dicks and he was like,

935
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,540
and having a big dick increases your risk

936
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,160
of contracting a STD.

937
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,400
- That's true.

938
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,460
- 'Cause they just fuck all night long waiting for it.

939
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,700
(laughing)

940
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,380
- More surface area.

941
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,220
Yeah.

942
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,500
I don't think any of that is true, by the way.

943
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,580
- I think I would rather have giant balls.

944
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,260
Did you ever see the video when you were a kid?

945
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,860
Do you ever see the video when you were a kid of the, um, the,

946
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:02,500
the guy with elephant Titus of his nutsack and he's jumping around on it like a

947
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,180
yoga ball. What? Yeah.

948
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,820
He lives in some kind of village or something and he's jumping around on his

949
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,460
balls. He lives in a village in Colorado.

950
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,260
Yeah. And he jumps around on his balls and the doctor,

951
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,300
I guess cursed him with that.

952
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,320
I don't know, I've never seen this.

953
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,140
- It might not exist, it might be some kind of ghost memory

954
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,000
I have from being a child with my brother.

955
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,980
I make stuff up from when I was a kid,

956
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,780
like things that I know that I saw so hard.

957
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,700
One of them was, I thought for a long time

958
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,180
that there was a Linkin Park music video

959
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,180
that takes place entirely in like a bathroom sink,

960
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,460
where everyone's really small.

961
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,220
But apparently that's not true.

962
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,300
- That feels like a thing that would be real.

963
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,980
- I'm a hundred percent sure to this day,

964
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,300
even though I've had a lot of people tell me

965
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,380
it does not take place in a sink,

966
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,700
that there is a Linkin Park music video

967
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,660
that takes place in a ceramic white sink.

968
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,360
- Okay, how does the song go?

969
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:10,180
- Wash those hands, wash those hands.

970
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,420
I don't know.

971
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,140
I think it might be "Numb."

972
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,020
I think "Numb" is the one I'm thinking of.

973
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
Mmm.

974
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,020
Yummy num num.

975
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
No.

976
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Nummy nummy num song.

977
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
What was it? Yummy nummy sauce?

978
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Yummy nummy nummy song.

979
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
Can you play the nummy song?

980
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
[Laughter]

981
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
[Laughter]

982
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
I think when you move to New York

983
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,020
we might have to set you up with a couple of DJ gigs.

984
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Yeah.

985
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,020
That'd be fun.

986
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
You could play slot music.

987
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
Yeah.

988
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
You play No Limit City slot music.

989
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,020
Yeah, just No Limit City, SoundCloud, top to bottom.

990
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
I feel like that's a good idea.

991
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,020
I've been thinking a lot about how it probably like

992
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,020
really is to become a DJ. You just have to like

993
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,020
learn one thing.

994
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,020
That's true about every skill.

995
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,020
You have to learn one thing to be good at any one thing.

996
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
Yeah.

997
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,020
No, but it's like especially you see it

998
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,020
with DJing. You just have to buy a thing.

999
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,020
I think it's an incredibly common skill.

1000
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,020
But I think, you know,

1001
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:20,020
Yeah, I don't think it's easy by any means. I don't think you have to be you have to have

1002
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,800
a borderline genius IQ to be able to find out which two songs are going to go good back

1003
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:33,140
to back. Yeah, I do not have that control the floor and get people moving and shaking. Yeah,

1004
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm not good at that shit. Yeah, I'm doing back to back three cascade to evacuate the

1005
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,680
dance floor and then fucking Johnny Cash hurt and it's just people don't like

1006
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
that kind of thing. To your list, who do you think would be the best DJ out of

1007
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,920
the three of us and who would be the worst? Well I look like the best DJ

1008
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,880
but I think I'd probably be the worst. I think you'd be the best Julio. I think probably

1009
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,840
Julio would because he has probably the most and I won't even say the best I

1010
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,880
think you have the most taste in music. I think you have the highest emotional

1011
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:14,480
quotient an EQ if you will which is whoa the DJ with the high EQ oh my god yeah

1012
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:23,480
yeah I would probably do playbook cardi into my night trust because I would

1013
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,840
break I would like to break generous generous this beer just fucked me up

1014
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,920
He's drunk. He's so fucked up. No, I'm not drunk. First time seeing him drunk. Very,

1015
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,320
very excited about it. I will never be drunk. This sour is pretty tough to get through, man.

1016
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:47,920
Yeah. This is not my favorite. You know, but I've had, I had a beer yesterday that I thought I

1017
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,560
really liked. I had the Grimm Brewing Company Hefeweizen. Mm-hmm. And I had one, and I had

1018
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,200
one of them before and I really enjoyed it. And this time I had one and I thought it was good.

1019
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,560
But then I had a second one and the second one was so disgusting to me.

1020
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,040
Was it the one that we missed out on when we were in New York?

1021
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,720
I think a lot of – there are just some beers in this world that you're only meant to

1022
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,040
have one of.

1023
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,240
Anything more and it's violating the terms of service for this beer and you should not

1024
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
be –

1025
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,720
This is why the only S-tier beers are light beers because you can just drink a billion

1026
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,600
of them.

1027
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I kind of agree, man.

1028
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,280
Yeah, I don't disagree with that.

1029
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,400
Seltzer, same deal.

1030
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah, same deal.

1031
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,600
Well, the normal ones.

1032
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
I remember when I went to Rex's house,

1033
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
I went to Target,

1034
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,020
and I think it was either him or his roommate,

1035
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,120
they bought those white cloths that were supercharged.

1036
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
I forget what they're called.

1037
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,620
Yeah, those ones.

1038
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,800
Why are they making that?

1039
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Not good.

1040
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,800
That shit was ass.

1041
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Yeah.

1042
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,120
[Burps]

1043
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,620
Do you think I never got a chance to have the bang energy?

1044
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,720
Why clause?

1045
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,960
They make white saucers.

1046
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,860
Yeah.

1047
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,300
That are like a bang flavored.

1048
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,760
I would guess they're terrible because bang has got to be the worst

1049
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,160
tasting energy drink on the market.

1050
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,000
I would disagree with that, but I think it is so disgusting.

1051
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,460
Did you know?

1052
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,360
I used to love

1053
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,060
the root beer bang.

1054
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
No.

1055
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
It was amazing.

1056
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,240
And then they stopped making it,

1057
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,940
presumably because I was the only person on earth to drink it.

1058
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,980
Do they still make Bang?

1059
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,780
Or isn't Bang in big trouble?

1060
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,340
I feel like I haven't seen it in a while.

1061
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,640
Uh, no, they still make it, but it's definitely not as popular

1062
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,080
popular as it used to be.

1063
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,620
It had a moment. It really did.

1064
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,020
Yeah, well, they got ripped off by everyone.

1065
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,480
And now everyone's ripping off Celsius in the same way.

1066
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,320
Oh, so Celsius is disgusting.

1067
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,120
Like Bang had like the formula that was like the 300 milligrams caffeine,

1068
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,820
the BCAAs, the fucking creatine and shit.

1069
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,720
And then like Monster made rain.

1070
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,100
Mm hmm.

1071
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,260
Oh, rain is made by Monster? Yes.

1072
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Oh, I didn't know that.

1073
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,800
And then they they got like sued by Bang.

1074
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,040
And then like there's there's like a rock star version of it.

1075
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,940
There's like a couple other versions.

1076
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,800
There's like a bunch of ones that had like 300 milligrams caffeine,

1077
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,000
all the BCAAs, so like that formula.

1078
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So bang kind of fell off and then Celsius comes in like a 12 ounce cans,

1079
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,180
got 200 milligrams of caffeine. It's got the thermogenic shit in it.

1080
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,820
And then there's like a bunch of them that have that now like a Lonnie knew

1081
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,160
shit. Right. That's my,

1082
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,540
you really are a, a library of information about these energy drinks.

1083
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,260
I kind of can't believe it. Yeah. Well I drink one probably every day.

1084
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,260
What's your last batch? What's your most recent batch ordered?

1085
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,420
I mean, I'm kind of out.

1086
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,020
I have I've been drinking just monsters

1087
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,820
right in front of him.

1088
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,420
Here's two more different ones.

1089
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,260
This is the same one.

1090
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,560
He's lying.

1091
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,220
You just picked up the same two cans in three different ways.

1092
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:09,060
And now you're just oh, oh, my God, it wasn't a trick of the eyes.

1093
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,900
It was not slight of hand.

1094
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,960
I have a question for you.

1095
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,860
Why store them in your desk on your desk?

1096
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,660
Store them?

1097
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,620
No, these are ones that I've opened and drank and then either finished or didn't finish.

1098
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,060
But are.

1099
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,220
Yes.

1100
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,100
So why are you storing them on your desk?

1101
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,820
Listen, you drink one every day.

1102
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,660
You get to walk all the way to the trash.

1103
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:35,660
I'm with you.

1104
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,760
I'm not going to walk to the trash every day of my goddamn life.

1105
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,260
OK, why not do it?

1106
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm not. I'm not.

1107
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,560
I'm not monk. OK, I'm not.

1108
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,920
So I'm not such a clean freak that I can't have 40 or 50 cans covered in spit and

1109
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,880
maybe a couple of boogers that I put in there after I was done drinking them

1110
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,680
sitting on my desk.

1111
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,240
Okay.

1112
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,560
I have a follow up question.

1113
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,800
Have you ever seen a trash can in your life?

1114
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,560
Sure.

1115
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:07,840
Yeah.

1116
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
What kind of question is that?

1117
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,040
Okay.

1118
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,360
So he keep, no, wait, just stick with me here.

1119
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,800
Why not?

1120
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,240
Just maybe like one of those little dandy useful trash cans

1121
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,580
and keep it near near this or you throw your damn trash.

1122
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:27,480
This is actually a very good point, but I will say one thing.

1123
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,880
It would overflow and you would not take the trash out.

1124
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,680
This one has liquid still in it, for example.

1125
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,580
Well, that's where you put a bag in it.

1126
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,480
You can put a bag in it.

1127
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,720
No, I need to take that to the sink and dump it out.

1128
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,780
OK, like a good boy and then throw it into the recyclables.

1129
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,180
They can they can recycle with monster energy still in the can.

1130
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,040
They can do drink it.

1131
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,940
Though, thank you.

1132
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,580
The guys like that. Yeah.

1133
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,640
I'm actually anti trash guys right now.

1134
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,580
Why is that?

1135
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,820
Because I hired a guy.

1136
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,840
I hired a company to pick up the trash at the office one month ago,

1137
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,780
and I hired him to pick it up twice a week.

1138
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,580
And he has missed every single time.

1139
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,740
And then I call him every Monday and every Thursday.

1140
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,500
I say, "Hey, the trash isn't picked up."

1141
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,100
And he says, "Give me just one more chance.

1142
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,300
Give me just one more chance.

1143
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,860
I promise it'll get picked up."

1144
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,700
That's funny.

1145
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,700
Are you serious?

1146
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,140
Yeah, if I don't do it, if the guys don't do it this week,

1147
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,260
you could write us off.

1148
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,500
Well, I'll never bother you again.

1149
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,180
And then he just misses every single time.

1150
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,580
What the fuck?

1151
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,300
Wait, have we ever talked about the trash pile

1152
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,500
in the office before?

1153
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,420
Which one?

1154
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,380
Okay, so when I went to New York

1155
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,700
and I went to the office for the first time, I was-

1156
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,980
The old one or the new one?

1157
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,820
The new one.

1158
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,260
I was quite taken aback about how beautiful

1159
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,060
and large the space was.

1160
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,420
But as soon as you enter and you turn to your right,

1161
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,380
there's a big pile of just garbage just sitting there.

1162
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,700
Well, guess what, Julio?

1163
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,900
That is gone.

1164
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,740
Okay, so I felt really--

1165
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,260
But not because this guy picked it up.

1166
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,260
It's because I put it all in my car

1167
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,860
and dumped it on a random street in Queens.

1168
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,700
Oh, great.

1169
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,260
Yeah, which I can get a ticket for,

1170
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,540
but I didn't do it.

1171
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,580
Yeah, someone else did it.

1172
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Brian did it.

1173
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,180
Yes, it was Brian.

1174
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,180
And he stole all the chairs.

1175
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,180
What?

1176
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,180
I can't believe he did all that by himself.

1177
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:25,180
I'd like to imagine all of you wearing ski masks to go slowly wheel out.

1178
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:34,180
There was a guy, one of his friends who also works at the company was there when we were there.

1179
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,180
And I told him, I was like, man, straight up, if you were not here, I want you to know that I would be stealing

1180
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,560
I'd be stealing MacBooks and monitors.

1181
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,600
I'd be stealing so much shit.

1182
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,180
And he was like, I know dude, that's why I'm here.

1183
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,460
His boss brought it, his boss put him there

1184
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,380
'cause they knew that me and Brian were coming.

1185
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,080
(laughing)

1186
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,240
- Oh, that's really funny.

1187
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,080
So what are they gonna do?

1188
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,800
They're just gonna sell that shit?

1189
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,120
Or open a new company with it?

1190
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,280
- They were saying, well, the company's moving.

1191
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,080
And so I guess that it was more expensive

1192
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,240
to move this entire office

1193
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,800
than to just like basically let employees take most of whatever they wanted.

1194
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,120
But, uh, they, there was certain things you weren't allowed to take.

1195
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,240
I did want to take, there was like, I wanted to, I picked up like four Apple

1196
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,680
TVs and then the guy was like, you cannot take Apple TVs.

1197
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,840
I was like, come on, fuck you.

1198
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,800
Just one.

1199
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,880
I was complaining so much about getting all this free shit.

1200
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,120
That's so funny.

1201
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:30,560
What the fuck would you take?

1202
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,960
Do you, what would you take four Apple TVs?

1203
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,560
You don't even have, you have, you barely have one TV.

1204
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,760
Oh man, I don't know.

1205
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,200
To sell them?

1206
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,840
Yeah, I hear you.

1207
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,080
For $50 each on Facebook Marketplace?

1208
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,580
You're not a hustler.

1209
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,380
Oh, I'm a hustler.

1210
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,120
No.

1211
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,540
I've sold stuff before.

1212
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,420
Yeah?

1213
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,220
Yeah.

1214
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,680
Anytime I get a new laptop, I sell my old laptop for $300,

1215
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,100
even if it's worth way more.

1216
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,920
That's really smart.

1217
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,680
I need to do that.

1218
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,340
I'm kind of in the process of doing that.

1219
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,140
I don't know if you remember, there

1220
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,760
used to be a little mini fridge right here.

1221
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,180
But I once had a thing in there that I never used it,

1222
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,020
and it got a mold in it.

1223
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,020
It's gone.

1224
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,020
It's sold.

1225
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,580
I hustled.

1226
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,980
You hustled the fridge?

1227
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,100
Someone's uncle.

1228
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,380
Yep. I hustled the fridge.

1229
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,780
Wow.

1230
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,300
Everyone is someone's uncle.

1231
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,460
With that money.

1232
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,100
Damn.

1233
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,020
I got this big ass stream

1234
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,020
deck.

1235
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,980
That's an iPad.

1236
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,260
That's my iPad actually.

1237
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,380
I just lied.

1238
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,500
Fucking idiot.

1239
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:32,380
That's not a stream deck at all.

1240
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,380
You already had that iPad.

1241
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,620
No, I just bought that.

1242
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,620
I can see the Apple pencil.

1243
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,220
I just bought that. I bought both of those yesterday.

1244
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,420
You're like that girl that peed after squirting.

1245
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
Yep.

1246
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,420
A liar.

1247
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,420
I also just bought this as well.

1248
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,420
You did not buy that just now.

1249
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,420
I just bought this.

1250
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,420
No.

1251
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,420
I wish I could pick you up and say that I just bought you.

1252
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,420
You wish you could do that.

1253
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,420
I would do anything to buy your freedom.

1254
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,420
Yeah.

1255
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:11,100
I think I want to give you an h1b visa. Yeah, I think if I moved to the US I would be so incredibly

1256
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,820
stressed every single day of my life. Oh yeah, that's what it's all about. That's because you

1257
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:24,420
live in the land of siestas. You know we do here? We work. Why? Sometimes two and maybe three hours

1258
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:32,420
some days. I think life would be way more expensive than my current life. Yeah, but

1259
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,620
- And that would stress me out. - He would make more money.

1260
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,220
No, he wouldn't make-- no, no, don't tell him that.

1261
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,220
He would not make-- he would not make any more money.

1262
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:42,420
- I mean... - I pay him the maximum amount that I can

1263
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,020
and I'm still able to live.

1264
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,520
- I-- he would not make any more money. - Well, you-- he would get another job.

1265
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,020
I would.

1266
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,820
You would definitely have to.

1267
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,420
What do you do now?

1268
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,120
You didn't even edit the last pod-- you didn't even listen

1269
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,420
to the last podcast enough to see that it was de-sync.

1270
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,540
Here's how much I love Julio.

1271
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,340
He is routinely, at least once a month,

1272
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,940
terrible at his job.

1273
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,580
So, so bad.

1274
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,940
Like next level bad.

1275
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,500
Fucks something up so catastrophically.

1276
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,100
People don't listen to an episode.

1277
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,500
The episode gets 20% of the normal downloads

1278
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,020
because the audio is unlistenable

1279
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,780
or the video is fucked up, something like that.

1280
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,300
That's never happened before.

1281
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,220
But I don't care.

1282
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,580
I don't care at all.

1283
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,620
He's my buddy.

1284
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:35,160
he has a he plays video games with me what am I gonna fire him and do the easiest

1285
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,480
job ever by myself no no there's sometimes there's issues I will admit

1286
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,620
sometimes said tank answer would just have an issue and we'll meet only there

1287
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:52,860
is some way to maybe like audit the audio

1288
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,860
So, well, okay, here's my defense.

1289
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,960
We record way too late on Thursdays.

1290
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,860
Sometimes.

1291
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,260
Oh, I was just so busy.

1292
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh, I was playing Valorant with my friends.

1293
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,560
You couldn't have it on in the background while you're playing?

1294
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
No, I have one monitor, man.

1295
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,760
What do you think I'm going to do?

1296
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,260
He doesn't have one monitor.

1297
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,460
That's a lie.

1298
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,660
That is also a lie.

1299
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,860
And you have an iPad.

1300
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,360
What does the iPad have to do with anything?

1301
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,060
Use it as another monitor.

1302
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah, you have a laptop, an iPad, and a desktop computer and you can't listen to a fucking podcast?

1303
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,400
I also I don't have a desk or a chair and I live in a box

1304
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,400
You're in the chair right now!

1305
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:40,080
I see the chair your video is on I know that you have a chair. I don't know about the desk

1306
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,200
I can't see the desk. And you have headphones

1307
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,920
You have multiple pairs of headphones

1308
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,520
I will just say if I want you to know if anybody if you work for anybody except your close friend

1309
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,740
You would have been fired so fast

1310
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:10,200
We have people messages every single day every single day they message us and they say hey, I'm a student

1311
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:17,320
Can I work for you guys for free as an intern and every single time I say no because I decided to hire

1312
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,880
Some fucking Mexican guy to do the worst job ever

1313
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,680
No, I got, I completely got what it takes.

1314
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,040
I think I could make it the big leagues. I think I could edit the daily.

1315
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,760
You could not edit the daily. I could edit the daily.

1316
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,960
You could not straight up. You could not edit the daily.

1317
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,600
It's so easy.

1318
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,120
It's not easier than the podcast that you already edit.

1319
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,680
I got, I got the skills. I know how to do it.

1320
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,000
You have no skills.

1321
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,680
The detail is low.

1322
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,720
Yes, you have low conscientiousness.

1323
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,000
You score low on the perfectionist quartile.

1324
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,080
Yes, you do. I can tell.

1325
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,560
You know why? Because you love chilling.

1326
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,960
And that's why I like you.

1327
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Because you like chilling so much.

1328
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,960
And that's why we love you.

1329
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,960
I do love chilling.

1330
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,640
You probably do the same.

1331
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,440
You probably do as well as I would in your situation.

1332
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,000
And that's why I like you.

1333
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,080
I take, I thought, I was thinking, I've been thinking about my

1334
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,720
my sofa bed for this entire conversation.

1335
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,060
And I think you guys can both come together

1336
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,560
because it has like two compartments.

1337
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,440
You can sleep on top and the bottom.

1338
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,100
You can pull that out.

1339
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,980
He's changing the subject.

1340
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,100
He is changing the subject.

1341
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,640
We're talking about how bad he is at his job.

1342
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,480
And he says, check out my couch.

1343
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,440
Check out my couch that you can come sleep on.

1344
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,100
How is that?

1345
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,400
That's not a good deflection at all.

1346
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,440
We saw right through that.

1347
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
What's that?

1348
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm actually--

1349
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,520
(laughing)

1350
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,520
That's why he's hired.

1351
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,680
That's why he has the job.

1352
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,240
'Cause he's a slippery bastard.

1353
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,320
He really is.

1354
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,760
He's so slimy.

1355
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,360
Yeah, you are slimy.

1356
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,200
No.

1357
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,720
What do you think you'll be doing in 10 years?

1358
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,080
'Cause I know that you will not be working for me.

1359
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,880
I'll probably be dead.

1360
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,280
You think you'll die in 10 years?

1361
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,760
I think I'm gonna die in 10 years, yeah.

1362
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,600
Of what?

1363
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,760
I can see that.

1364
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,260
I got fired.

1365
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:19,700
I got fired and I died.

1366
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,960
Yeah, it is.

1367
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,060
It is funny that I could just ruin just an entire, probably an

1368
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,960
entire family if I fired you.

1369
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,560
No, no, you don't want to do that.

1370
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,860
No, I'm not going to do it.

1371
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:39,560
Not yet, but maybe one day I will fire you unceremoniously.

1372
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,980
You get like nine, 10 more chances.

1373
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,620
- I'll be like, oh man, we gotta let you go.

1374
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,460
I'm so sorry.

1375
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,820
And then I'll still make you work for six weeks

1376
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,420
and then you'll, and then you will officially be fired.

1377
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,260
But I'll make you work for six weeks

1378
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,380
and I'll give you a bunch of meetings where I'm like,

1379
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,540
I hate doing this.

1380
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,500
Oh my God, I really wish we could keep you.

1381
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:04,500
But we have to fire you so badly and you suck so much shit.

1382
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,820
It'd be so sad.

1383
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,940
- You know, I'm gonna be fired from my job.

1384
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,780
- Really?

1385
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,980
Someone I know just got fired and he was telling me that he had like a bunch of meetings, he

1386
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,980
just had to keep working for like six weeks and he had a bunch of meetings.

1387
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,980
Six weeks?

1388
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,980
Six weeks.

1389
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,980
Yeah.

1390
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,020
But I mean he was very checked out but he kept, he had to have like his meetings and

1391
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:31,660
stuff and his boss just kept getting on the meetings and just being like, "Dude, it's

1392
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,780
just not right what we're doing to you.

1393
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,460
It's just not, it's just wrong."

1394
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,460
Dude, six weeks is insane.

1395
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,460
Yeah.

1396
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,580
Yeah, it was really crazy.

1397
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,060
It's too much.

1398
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,820
Yeah, poor guy.

1399
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:45,540
Yeah, I think it is wrong to be fired.

1400
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,820
I don't think I've ever been fired.

1401
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,300
Oh, no, I've been fired from Jersey Mike's, but that was it.

1402
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:56,340
You were kind of caught and fired at one thing that you were like scamming a university

1403
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,900
where they're paying you to do COVID.

1404
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:08,020
Oh, I was not caught, but yeah, I worked for the museum at MIT, the art museum,

1405
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,380
And the lady, my manager, very, very sweet lady,

1406
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,540
she just kept paying me to do.

1407
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,380
She I had to do a basically a one once a week.

1408
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,320
I had to write a one page paper that was like,

1409
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,220
here's how museums are handling the like covid lockdowns and do.

1410
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,240
It was like a research position.

1411
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,380
And then her boss found out that she was paying me to do nothing

1412
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:34,880
and nobody ever read any of these things.

1413
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,020
And then I got fired.

1414
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,660
That's dope.

1415
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,380
It was, it was amazing.

1416
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,020
Cause she's an amazing lady.

1417
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,820
And then you got unemployment.

1418
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,300
Yes.

1419
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:50,180
And then I, the Massachusetts unemployment agency found out that I was making money

1420
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:55,580
from the podcast and I've owed Massachusetts like $3,000 for like four years now.

1421
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,380
You will never ever get this.

1422
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,980
And one day you will not get this.

1423
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,620
You will never get this.

1424
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,660
Yeah.

1425
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,060
funny like meme to send the IRS.

1426
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,260
You want to

1427
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,220
just like a printed picture of Borat

1428
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,700
put it in the mail?

1429
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,560
Yeah. With my tax return, says exactly how much I owe.

1430
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,460
You will never get this.

1431
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah. Yeah, it's like one of those novelty cards that have like

1432
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,900
it's a pop up.

1433
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,600
Yeah, it's it's well, it's the one that has like a speaker in it

1434
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,980
that you open it and it says it and they kind of unfurl your W two.

1435
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,460
And yeah, but it's not even it's not even recording off the movie.

1436
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,360
It's you saying, yeah, it's you saying

1437
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:45,360
you shifty Jew.

1438
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,060
I'm adding my own lines.

1439
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:50,900
I'm adding my own anti-Semitic lines.

1440
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,840
I've been saying you will never get this IRS.

1441
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,800
Yeah. Have you ever been fired?

1442
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,280
Yep. From where?

1443
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,240
The debt collector job.

1444
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,380
I got fired for forgiving too many people's debt.

1445
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,080
Oh, yeah. Oh, he was too.

1446
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
You were so much of an angel.

1447
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
You're too kind.

1448
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
I was, that's literally what it was.

1449
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
Wow.

1450
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,080
You got fired in three months.

1451
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,080
You were so much of a sweet angel.

1452
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,080
That's fucked up, man.

1453
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,400
They didn't even let me finish the probation period.

1454
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,080
They're like, "You are monumentally terrible at this job."

1455
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
Wow.

1456
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
That's funny.

1457
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,080
I hate those bastards.

1458
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Another reason I hate debt collectors.

1459
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,080
I didn't have it in me.

1460
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,080
To be evil?

1461
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,640
Yeah, because I lived with the guy that I worked with there, and he would just come home and

1462
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,000
watch cop shows and say racist stuff at the TV.

1463
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,240
He had what it took.

1464
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,240
He had it in him.

1465
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
He had that dog in him.

1466
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,240
He had the malice.

1467
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,240
He was born and bred for that.

1468
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,240
Yeah.

1469
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
Whereas me, I was so kind.

1470
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,240
I was like, "I totally understand.

1471
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Capitalism's so bad."

1472
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Yeah.

1473
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,240
You're talking about capitalism to these old ladies?

1474
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,240
No, not really.

1475
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,840
Were you doing pranks and the phone calls?

1476
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,560
No, but they were, you know.

1477
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,560
Were you doing prankses?

1478
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
Prankses.

1479
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,560
Yeah, I was doing prankses.

1480
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,560
Nice.

1481
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:01,760
It was a really dumb job.

1482
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,660
I definitely felt bad doing it every day.

1483
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,540
- It is funny how there's actually evil in the world.

1484
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,180
There's evil people.

1485
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,040
- Like rats. - Yeah, they're dope as fuck.

1486
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,580
- There's demons roaming around the world.

1487
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:16,060
- Yeah, Hunter Biden. - One attacked our friend.

1488
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,200
- Yeah.

1489
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,320
- But we're not allowed to talk about it apparently.

1490
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,440
- I think he lied about that.

1491
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,680
- He got attacked by an evil child.

1492
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,040
- He got attacked by a demon, but he won't talk about it.

1493
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,040
He was working at a school for kids.

1494
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,560
- Our friend, we told him to come on the podcast

1495
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,560
and tell the story.

1496
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,360
Apparently he signed an NDA,

1497
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,160
so he's not allowed to talk about it.

1498
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,160
I think he was joking about that.

1499
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,760
He got attacked by a child who claimed that he was evil.

1500
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,800
So you'll hear about it later.

1501
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,560
I won't tell the story.

1502
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:47,400
I won't tell the story.

1503
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,560
I'll just tell you guys what I told them.

1504
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,440
I told them what he told me this story.

1505
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,840
He first texted me.

1506
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,480
He's like, "I just got beat up at work or whatever."

1507
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,480
I'm like, "Oh my God, are you OK? What happened?"

1508
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,160
He's like, "Yeah, I'm all good."

1509
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,160
And he's just like, "I'll tell you later."

1510
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,820
And he just goes, "Fuck it! Hop on Discord right now and I'll tell you."

1511
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,320
I was like, "Okay, whatever, man."

1512
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,740
I hop on Discord and he tells me this huge story that we can't tell,

1513
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,740
but it's about a demon beating him up.

1514
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:16,700
And he tells me about the fact that the demon did tell him that he was evil,

1515
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,000
way, way, way before beating him up.

1516
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,580
And then what I told him at the end was he told me this really hard story

1517
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,500
about the demon and its surroundings.

1518
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,420
And then it's like yeah, I mean it's a it's a tough job or whatever. It's his job

1519
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:37,340
To deal with demons, and then I I just told them well

1520
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,740
You know what I think I think it's that you had it coming

1521
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:45,300
Because he told you he was evil and you still poked the bear. That's true. That's real shit

1522
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,300
Yep, if a child looks you in the eyes and says I'm evil

1523
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,500
You walk the other way man

1524
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:58,460
And you turn around yeah, yeah, just let him roam the world let him on YouTube and get the fuck out of

1525
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:02,400
of there, dude. I don't want I don't want anything to do with this this fucking

1526
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,140
evil kid, but our friend never learned that lesson I guess. Yeah, and he's dead now.

1527
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:14,220
That's because he's Vietnamese. And he died. Don't give details. And his name is Brian?

1528
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:18,100
And he stole all that shit? And he dumbed all that shit? Oh yeah, sure. It was Brian.

1529
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,780
Yeah, maybe if Brian gave that kid an Aaron, it wouldn't have been so evil. True. Good point.

1530
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,980
room. Okay, all right. I have to go. Okay. Bye. Bye.
