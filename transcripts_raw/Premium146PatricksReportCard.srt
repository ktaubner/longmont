I have this paper here that I wrote a few Mad Libs for you.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Let's hold on a second. We'll get to your Mad Lib in a minute.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,240
We have to start this report card here.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Help me think of some category.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Are we going to explain why we're doing a report card?

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,240
If you want to, I don't care. That's your decision.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,240
I took one Adderall before we recorded.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Honestly, this might be good for you to get a prescription,

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,240
because it's hard to get a prescription for...

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
you could show them your report card.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,240
You could bring this to your psychiatrist.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,240
We are doing you such a favor.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Help me think of some categories here.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Think about my little things.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Phone usage is number one.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Right?

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Which you've been good at recently.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
I would say A- average as of late.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Let's see.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Looking at noises outside.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Getting distracted like a dog.

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
That's one.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Did you hear that noise just now?

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
see where my eyes were.

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,200
See, like, there's, they were right on me.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
They were right on me.

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,680
Um, and then I would say maybe voice work, maybe if he's, if he's slipping in a couple

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
voices, a couple impressions.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Okay, voice work.

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Right?

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Alright.

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
A couple impressions.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I think he could go for that today.

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
I think this might be a good day.

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,600
I think, um, let the games begin.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
What other ones?

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600

Poop, poop, poop.

- Okay. - Right?

105

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,740
there you go okay a little parent teacher conference throughout history

108
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,980
inventors have been responsible for everyday things like computers cars and

109
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:15,940
cell phones. These are some of the most famous jobs in history. A person's famous

110
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,900
little job. Well it says occupations plural. Oh yeah that's what I was

111
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,540
supposed to fill in. And you put John. Oh okay. Benjamin Franklin was not only a

112
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,580
founding father of the United States, he also invented many things including

113
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,380
bifocal glasses which allow people to see things near and far. He also invented the

114
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,560
lightning rod which protects houses from electric bolts of lightning.

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,060
No.

116
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:58,360
Johanns Gutenberg was a German inventor. Bad Patrick! Bad Patrick! Come on. Just

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,280
fuck it. Who invented the printing press, a machine that could print words and

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,940
images to make books, newspapers, and Bibles.

119
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,940
Fuck you.

120
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
That's just too bad.

121
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Thomas Edison was an accomplished inventor.

122
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
(Laughter)

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
(Laughter)

124
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,940
No, dude. Do not show this to your parents.

125
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Yeah, my mom's gonna be pissed if she sees what I wrote.

126
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
I'll say it. I'll rate it up.

127
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,100
perhaps best known for making a light bulb that the average homeowner could

128
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:44,140
use he also invented the phonograph which was the first machine to be able to

129
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:51,020
record the human voice and then play it back Wow and those are just some of the

130
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,260
mad libs that I made yeah oh my god I think you're the fucking you have a mad mind

131
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:03,020

132
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,340
as sharp as a fucking axe today. I actually did one, yeah. When did you do one? I just

133
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,300
did one earlier. Oh really? Yeah, can I read it out to you guys? Yeah, I mean I don't have

134
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,980
a credit, a report card for you. Well it's just a mad lib, it's for fun. I mean, yeah.

135
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,900
Okay. Yeah, is that okay? I filled in some funny ass shit. Yeah. Okay. I just wanted

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,700
kind of see his kind of all right it's fine no I got one I mean I just filled in

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,220
what it's a pay attention see this was another test he's letting you do yeah

138
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,020
okay wow giving him an out I just yeah you know I did the mat I filled in what

139
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,900
was supposed to be on the line for all right I'm right to the mad lips I can

140
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,220
read it yeah this one's called the coat of the samurai okay so that's samurai's

141
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:47,480
coat or code code coat code like a samurai's coat every pretty sleek be

142
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,740
pretty funny right if it was called coat of the samurai, maybe not I mean I can

143
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,460
you let me do the funny stuff because it's yeah yeah it's a mad live all

144
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,160
right samurai were ancient adjective Japanese warriors who followed a

145
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,000
adjective code of virtue, which contained these a plural noun samurai

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,320
believe justice was the most adjective virtue. They always show courage in the

147
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,440
face of plural noun samurai may have had the power to verb, but they also needed

148
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
to show mercy to all plural noun. It was important to be polite and

149
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,160
considerate of other people's plural noun samurai. I also thought honesty was

150
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,380
best noun. Plural noun were not an option for the samurai who tried to verb with

151
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,900
honor. Samurai were loyal to their fellow plural noun and finally they had to show

152
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,540
character and that they knew the difference between right and noun. Okay I

153
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,340
would like to add one more category, giggle bear. I need you to add giggle

154
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,180
bear right now because he he did a great job on giggle bearing right there. That

155
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,420
was a right. He helped sell it. He giggle bared that. That was huge. Okay all right

156
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,260
so the giggle bear is out. All right so read the categories back real quick. Okay

157
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,860
so we got and then we can formally start okay yeah yeah we got phone usage yep

158
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,620
looking at noises outside

159
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:57,860

God he looked at me, but i'm inside, but he didn't look outside yeah, no or i'll

163
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,340

164
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,340

167
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,340
that. I'm a listen. I'm a bit. I'm a small business owner. Okay. We have to

168
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,340
sometimes you have to throw out eight ghillie suits. Yeah, it's just part of

169
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,840
being a business. We also did an audit of how I've been using the offices.

170
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:46,400
storage unit. Yeah, we did look through what all we found. Okay, so we thought I

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,100
thought that this closet was full of just crate like a huge pile of costumes. Well, okay, okay, let me

172
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,140
preface this by saying, hold on. Put prefacing on there. Prefacing, put a lot of...

173
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,120
So, before, so I used to keep a suitcase here of all the clothes that I

174
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,780
couldn't sell at Beacon's Closet. Makes perfect sense. Yeah, because I didn't want

175
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,980
to have a giant suitcase in my house. Yeah, and there's no other place for

176
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,140
clothes to go. Exactly. Yeah, no one needs those. Exactly. So I kept under in a

177
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,620
smaller closet that we have here that's under a staircase, I kept a suitcase full

178
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,580
of clothes that I couldn't sell. Yeah. And I thought no one would ever notice it.

179
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,900
And then... So you actively thought like... You were trying to put one over... You were

180
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,460
trying to pull the wool over my eyes a little bit. Yes, and I admit it. Oh wow. I mean I saw it every single day.

181
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,500
And then we needed a suitcase for the Pacific Northwest leg of the

182
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,760
the tour and so you don't know that was the biggest suitcase we had so I threw

183
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,380
all of the clothes into the into the costume closet. Okay, so that's why all

184
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,820
my clothes are in there. So yeah, we found I thought that it was all

185
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,220
costumes. The first five things I pulled out were just t shirts that were his

186
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,180
yeah. I would say it was way more. This is the bag of of your clothes. Well,

187
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,820
it's not just it's Joe stuff to Joe had maybe two shirts and Joe had a lot more

188
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,580
than now. He had he had two shirts and a completely white pair of jeans, which I

189
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,320
believe he bought in the first place. Well he had those for the birthday boy video.

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
I don't think so because I've seen him wear them before that.

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,360
Really? Yeah. He was he ruined them in the birthday. He claimed that those were good jeans.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah. Fully white. Well they were Levi's they were uh what are they like 514s? It's fine to

193
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
wear white pants in the day of summer but listen if you're gonna wear white pants. You gotta wear

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,400
a white shirt too. It can't be jeans. White jeans is weird. What are you Pitbull? Why are you walking

195
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,800
around with white jeans on? White jeans are cool. Not these ones dude. These look like shit. I like

196
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
I like the Dickies Painters Pants.

197
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,920
Those look cool.

198
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,480
- Yeah, but that's cool if you get a bunch

199
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,560
of your paint on 'em.

200
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
- Yeah, you get a bunch of paint on 'em,

201
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
or you go like a Heathcliff shirt thing.

202
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
- My personal paint got all on my Dickies.

203
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
Had to throw 'em away.

204
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
- Okay, see, if you had a report card right now,

205
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,040
that would be a fucking F for being crass.

206
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,880
- What, it's okay.

207
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,700
- Yeah, put crassness on there.

208
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,120
- I have not even said a single crass thing.

209
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,960
- Oh my God, I'm having a crass day.

210
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,160
- Yeah, cussing and crassness.

211
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,760
Like, 'cause that's a crutch, right?

212
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Everybody's guilty of that sometimes.

213
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
us to I feel like crassness covers the grass this includes cussing as well

214
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,400
crassness yeah so no I'm talking about I need don't talk about your used napkin

215
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,360
don't talk and what you used it for your squelching your skin welching sock leave

216
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,840

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,200
my food. I wish you was food, but it's your sweat. Don't I just don't Pat. I

219
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,400
don't want you to be it today. Don't say anything along the lines of when

220
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,120
scientists looked at my bathroom napkin through a microscope. It looked like a

221
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,520
Hieronymus Bosch painting. Don't say that is like Chris Bosch's brother.

222
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,600
I was the guy who drew all the sperms. He drew hell a bunch of his body did a

223
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,640
lot of the scary hell. Okay, you got another F for being too obscure. Yeah,

224
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,040
it's not obscure at all obscure being obscure. You guys are just uncultured.

225
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,000

244
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,060

255
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,020
Billy Bob Thornton Halle Berry there's a conspiracy theory yeah that Halle Berry

256
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,460
actually had Billy Bob Thornton's penis in her in them but that was when Billy Bob

257
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,660

261
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,340
want to get that I want it that's a video yeah what do you guys ever think

262
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,080
that actors and actresses when they're in those movies are actually fucking

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,120
having sex and not simulating. I think a lot of porno movies, I think it's

264
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,640
unsimulated. Really? You think so? And a lot of porno browsers. Yeah. I was thinking

265
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:59,440
about... I think sometimes it's simulated. I think sometimes it's simulated. I think it's unsimulated. I feel like you can tell when somebody is faking having sex.

266
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,400
Yeah. You know, because they look too normal. You know, they're not like... I mean

267
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,040
some of these actors and actresses though, they're so famous, they're having sex so

268
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,840
constantly that it's like to them it's like nothing. A chore. Yeah, it's like a chore to me.

269
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,480
It's like when I like have to eat my sandwich or something.

270
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Would you guys ever do a sex scene in a movie?

271
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Yeah.

272
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Whoa.

273
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
You answered that so fast.

274
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Whoa, all right.

275
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
My man.

276
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
No, I definitely wouldn't.

277
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
You definitely wouldn't?

278
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
No.

279
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
What if it was a part of the movie, though?

280
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Maybe if I got like rich.

281
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Why would I be in a movie, first of all?

282
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
What if I was an actor?

283
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
You're the lead actor, right?

284
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:38,360
Okay, if I was an actor and I lived in Hollywood, a completely different life, then yes.

285
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,200
No, you don't live, it doesn't matter where you live.

286
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm an actor. I'm an actor. No, you're in a movie. Okay, and it's a movie. Huh?

287
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,800
I don't live in Hollywood. It's a good question.

288
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
I see the hypothetical guys.

289
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Is he fucking a human or a beast?

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,300
He's in Beast Fucker.

291
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,500
Okay, it's like a if it's a but he's fucking a human and if it was a beast,

292
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I would say yes, because probably like a puppet or something.

293
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,900
Yeah, but they probably put a fleshlight at the bottom.

294
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,000
Olivia Olivia Munn is in the puppet suit, right?

295
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,800
And you're and also your girlfriend's there because she's the director.

296
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,680
damn yep and she's gonna want to direct the sex scene part she doesn't want to

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,080
direct the movie she's doing it to get out of a student loan debt damn yeah so

298
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,320
with this scenario in mind actually that should be the real I live in Hollywood

299
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:28,560
it doesn't matter where you live it does live and you live on Hollywood Boulevard

300
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,240
you live every single my famous actor yes you're the most furious oh I looked

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,520
it's bright out right now. He looked. That's a sound. I'm marking that down. That's a demerit.

302
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,040
He looked. Well, I was using... Okay, well, hold on, hold on. That was a full...

303
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,280
Bringing me back to my original story about the costume closet, I had to hand wash...

304
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,640
He's kind of saving it right now. I had to hand wash my Austin Powers costume.

305
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Yes. And I was like... Tell them why.

306
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,040
I put it... It was covered in sand. It wasn't sand. It was some kind of body

307
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,720
thing that he put on it, some kind of fungus. I think it was a fungus.

308
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,080
Yeah. No, there was a fungus on it. Yeah. Well, I had to hand wash it.

309
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,400
yep and then and then I was gonna hang it up from the curtain I was gonna hang up

310
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
the pants from the curtain but they were a little bit too wet so I put my

311
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,640
sucking wet I put them outside and I was like guys what if it rains and you you

312
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,200
told me who cares it's not gonna rain Austin Powers cost immediately started

313
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,800
raining well does it matter if you rather have dripping wet floor or a wet

314
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,800
costume that was already wet or you can clean up the floor yeah I'm looking now

315
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,320
because the Sun is out tomorrow. Okay I honestly thought you were gonna redeem

316
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,680
yourself for looking outside and you completely you just made me even more

317
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,200
mad. Really? Yeah so now in that category well we're not quite yeah we're not

318
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I've been taking some notes on here so just know that we you're gonna see we're

319
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,560
gonna need to see some improvement in that second half on that specific

320
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,400
category. Okay. All right I'm just telling you that. Well that's fine.

321
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,960
Anyway, would so you have you would you put the piece of don't they take a pill that like a hills their boner cuz it's like

322
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,960
They do that

323
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,200
Kills your boner and then they put like a string around your penis

324
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,280
Cuz if I'm if they put a string around your penis and they yank

325
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,800
Blaming I'm not blaming any actor for yank it to the back of your butt

326
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,400
They have a string and then as soon as it gets near any kind of vagina or you had a hole they they have a guy

327
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
That's what the best boy does. The best boy, if there's a sex scene, he holds a

328
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,820
string and he yanks it like he's pulling a tooth out.

329
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,200
I just saw Cameron taking notes, sorry. But the people who are...

330
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I don't know why you're saying that.

331
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
We need to do this every episode.

332
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
This is so good.

333
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I do not blame any actor or actress for...

334
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,560
if you're, oh you have to fuck Angelina Jolie

335
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,560
or Chris Evans or something,

336
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,280
and they're a MILF and you're a slut,

337
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,120
it's like, dude, I'm popping one.

338
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
- Exactly.

339
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
- And I'm sorry.

340
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,600
- But if there is a pill that you can take

341
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
that kills your boner--

342
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
- Why am I not taking it all the time?

343
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,240
- Yeah, why did I--

344
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,160
- Why have I ever popped boners?

345
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
They should be giving that out to school.

346
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,560
- There's so many people who sit on my lap on the bus.

347
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,400
- Yeah, if you take--

348
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,200
- So many old women with dementia think I'm a seat

349
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,320
on the bus and they sit down and I get heart.

350
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,760
If you ever take a bus, if you ever have to sit in a classroom, or especially like a classroom,

351
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,480
like a once a year classroom, like a driving class or some shit.

352
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,280
If you go to the DMV, you're definitely getting hard.

353
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,280
If you're opening up, you're 110% popping a boner at the DMV.

354
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,960
I haven't had a public boner in so long.

355
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,300
Because I never go out early in the morning anymore until we went on our multiple trips.

356
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,760
and I've had so many like this. It's so I've been sitting on so many planes and

357
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,100
buses and trains with a big boner. I had a really, really bad moment on the on

358
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,780
our flight back where I sat down. I was like fuck. I have to pee, but I was like

359
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,960
fuck. I have a boner. I wonder if I can kill it before I get up and you guys

360
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,040
hadn't sat down yet and I was like all right, I'm going to go get up to pee and

361
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,760
then I got up to pee. I have a boner, but I'm like you know what if I just walk

362
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,660
confidently and I don't bring attention to it, nobody's going to notice and I'll

363
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,840
be right in the bathroom and then I get to the bathroom. There's a five person

364
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,280
for the bathroom. So I just sat there behind a lady waiting for the plane

365
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
bathroom with a boner. I'm sure everyone noticed.

366
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
Which flight? The flight back.

367
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,640
Flight back, yeah. Flight back you sat in the way back of the plane. Oh no it must

368
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,280
have been the flight there. Yeah, because I sat with you. Yeah you would have had no

369
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,000
problem. You were sitting next to me. No, not a single boner dude. I texted

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,720
you to let you know, because I remember I got stuck in the back of the plane.

371
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,200
I had to go to the bathroom and I walked all the way to the back while the guy

372
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,240
had maybe he got stuck between the the he got stuck behind basically the the

373
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,880
concessions person yeah because he went and used the bathroom and then as he

374
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,680
popped out they had the car was already going uh-huh yeah and there's nothing

375
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,000
you can do yeah he just had to sit back there and I was sitting next to two

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,940
people who were... They had a big greasy bag of KFC. They like brought through

377
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,240
security bags of KFC and they were eating dried squid as well. Yeah, I texted him because I was like

378
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,120
dude the lady next to you has a bag of grease and dried squid. It was one of the worst

379
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,240
flights of my life. I told you I had... The Crusher? No, he's the Beater. The Beater.

380
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah, he said he was the Breaker. The Breaker, that's what it was.

381
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:38,840
To my right... The Crusher, the Beater, the Breaker. To my right... Those were two other guys that were on the plane.

382
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,240
To my right, there was a giant woman who had headphones in and was snoring and

383
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,920
then farting really loudly, like really stinky farts the entire time. To my left,

384
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,160
KFC and dried squid. To my, basically, catty corner to me, crying baby, right in

385
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,480
front of me, a kid, two kids and their mom, and the kid says, ten minutes into the

386
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,560
flight, "Mommy, I'm a new superhero. I'm the Breaker." And she goes, "Oh, that's funny."

387
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
And he just starts beating the shit out of the seat that's right in front of me.

388
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,440
So I'm hearing the knocking of the breaker, right? I'm hearing the screaming person,

389
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,160
the screaming kid. I'm smelling farts, hearing the farts, hearing snoring,

390
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Dried Squid KFC right next to me. And that son was a breaker to his own mom.

391
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,480
Yeah.

392
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,920
Yeah, because it was a mom's son and they're speaking, I don't know the language, but they

393
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,840
were fighting. The son started beating up his mom like every hour pretty much.

394
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,160
Wow.

395
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,000
He would just punch her in the arm a bunch of times.

396
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,720
That's crazy.

397
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,800
Yeah, it was not a... I really did not like that.

398
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,560
The screen in the back of the...

399
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,240
Yeah, our TV didn't work.

400
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,960
work. Well yours yours work. No I didn't I wasn't it was not that it didn't work.

401
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,560
It was not that it didn't work. It was mine was completely there. His was fine.

402
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,120
I do all I could do on it. He couldn't get to his channel. He like yeah that was

403
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,800
I wanted to watch my screen. My screen was completely broken and that it was it

404
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,120
would be black and they would flash white over and over so I would have my eyes

405
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,400
closed trying to go to sleep and I would just get white flashes in my eyes over

406
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,280
and over the entire night. It was so horrible. I feel like that would have

407
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
brought me right. I have such a terrible fear of a plane being struck by

408
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
lightning so it kind of looks like is that what you think lightning hitting a

409
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,960
plane would look like no but I find my sleep and I'm woken up by a bright flash

410
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,640
that's not a great thing to be woken up by if I'm scared of lightning we were

411
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,840
responsible for the emergency exit we'd were we did a great job the best possible

412
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,680
it was great it was even you know what it was it was it was literally yeah it

413
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,100
was it because usually because yeah usually when you get more legroom and on

414
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,960
all the plans when you have the most legroom and come on top of adding more

415
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,320
legroom I feel like on a lot of planes you get emergency row you can't put your

416
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,860
Personal item under the seat, but we could still do that. Yep. We had we had personal item access and extra leg room

417
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,520
That's why you should have fucking came with us when we got our seats. Yeah, you were being on

418
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,520
I was I don't want to I want to go to the bathroom

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
I had I was in the bathroom you guys

420
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,040
And then you said go up to had to do this with me. I know I don't want to I want to go to the bathroom

421
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,080
That's a good now you have to do an impression of me this is you an animal crossing I

422
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,140
I don't know what that is. Do a gay girl reference thing and give him an A+ for that.

423
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,800
A gay girl reference? Yeah, because he knows what I'm all about.

424
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm not going to do a gay girl reference. A lot of normal men play Animal Crossing.

425
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
You think gay guys aren't normal? No.

426
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,320
That's really, really interesting. Okay. They have a lot of...

427
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,680
Put a homophobia one. Homophobia category.

428
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,120
Gay guys have very good taste in dance music. I think honestly...

429
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,040
completely redeemed myself. Not homophobic. I do think goth people are, after

430
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,760
going, rivaling the LGBT community for nightlife. Well, usually I think there's a, I think those go

431
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,080
hand-in-hand. Really? But you can have one without the other. So I think, yeah. I think

432
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,600
that, but I think goth is either neck-and-neck or beating out the

433
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,160
LGBTQ community as far as having fun parties and bars. Somebody told me last

434
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,560
last night that that bar Talon has a goth night. I can't remember what I think I

435
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,400
think that I know where that one is I think that a goth night is not as good

436
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,520
as a goth bar. I think that's gonna be the bad version. Goth bar has to because

437
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,440
goth bar you not everyone at the goth bar is goth right it's just where the it's a

438
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
it's a home base. Goth night is also where I think goth night is where people

439
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
who aren't goth will pretend to be goth. Exactly and there's a difference between

440
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,800
a karaoke night in a karaoke bar, I'll tell you that much.

441
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't even get me started.

442
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,040
True. Just don't get me started. Don't. No, all right. All right, Pat.

443
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Don't even get me started. I was going to get him started. No, no, get him started.

444
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
I was going to get him started and he told me not to. No, Pat, listen.

445
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,320
I'm just following the rules. For your report card, next topic, what are we talking about? I brought up

446
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,440
the sex scene thing. I want to, I do want to do karaoke again. I love karaoke. I'm honestly,

447
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,280
I was like it used to be a thing where it's like trivia night where it's like I if it's there

448
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:58,240
I'll do it. But like now I'm like, I'll fucking I'll just go there. I was told of a guy who has a living room somewhere in

449
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:06,600
Brooklyn and it's like is like a big-ass living room and it's I think it's not like invite only but it's you you

450
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,640
You have to like know about it to some degree. They don't have like a website or anything, but you

451
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,600
It's a it's like the best karaoke system in

452
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,200
world I don't know about the world

453
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:33,240
just in this guy's house I guess him and his wife really love karaoke I guess I

454
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:39,960
want to know what does it mean the best one you guys maybe it's me what I don't

455
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,920
understand what what the tech what's the tech different machine that's also a

456
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,820
a gravity bong yes okay yeah you can put weed in the in the mic you put weed in

457
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,440
the mic and it smokes it out like it's hookah I saw one of the most evil

458
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,120
fucking disgusting fucking Democrat inventions I've ever seen in my life in

459
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,600
Seattle yeah it was a it was a coffee mug that said wake and bake and it had a

460
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,000
built-in way to smoke marijuana dude what the fuck what kind of person would

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,240
do that that's not right smoke marijuana and drink coffee what the fuck is wrong

462
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,880
That's like mixing - that's like a high and a low, that's an upper and a downer.

463
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,280
Exactly. You're putting your heart at risk.

464
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
You could die.

465
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,840
That is what Chris Farley died of.

466
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,640
Nice.

467
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,360
Weed and coffee.

468
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,480
That's why his nose was bleeding in the picture.

469
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,800
He drank too much weed and too much coffee.

470
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,200
He bought an eighth of weed.

471
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Chris Farley died from smoking weed.

472
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Actually, he pushed three cups of Café Busteau out of a French press too.

473
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,520
That's dangerous. That's high MGs.

474
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,040
you guys know why they call it an eighth of weed? Why? Because when you smoke it

475
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,240
you end up in the eighth circle of hell. Yeah that's right. The eighth and the

476
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,160
eighth. And there's only seven. Yeah yeah. I thought there's not. I thought there was nine.

477
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,000
It's a hundred. There's a hundred? Oh sorry have you guys been to hell? No.

478
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,320
Have you? Okay good. I've been to hell. But probably there's a hundred. You've been to hell?

479
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,760
Oh shit. Holy fucking shit. Oh my god. He's going for he's going for a plus. I always forgot.

480
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,880
That's above and beyond right there. I forgot that I technically did, I passed my driver's

481
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,800
test, the written part. Yeah. But I just can't get behind the wheel of a car without like

482
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,600
freaking out. Just close your eyes. Yeah, I guess I should do that. Will you teach me

483
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,360
to drive Caleb? I would love to teach both of you to drive. I'm a wonderful teacher.

484
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:33,080
I really would like to. I tried to, I took the driver's test and I accidentally, I went

485
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,560
into the wrong lane. You know what the worst part of the driver's test is? The only hard

486
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,960
hard part is when they are the at least the guy that I had he was like he does a

487
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,000
jump scare he's like okay so what you're gonna do is you're gonna come up here 15

488
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,840
miles an hour break he says well and he's like reaction testing you I feel

489
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,600
like that's not fair cuz when you have to break suddenly it's not someone else

490
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,320
break yeah yeah where'd you go the just for laughs driving school I went to

491
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,800
actually ranked yeah that's my bad yeah I shouldn't have done that but I was

492
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,680
already up there. Yeah, that's why you're driving a clown car. Yeah, where did you go to the

493
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,320
Korean web comic driving school where they jump scare you? Yeah. I forgot about that.

494
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,760
That one's scary. That is scary. Oh, 30 minutes. Okay, all right. All right. Quick check. Let's

495
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,800
go through here. All right. All right. Phone usage. I mean, that's A+. That's an A+. He

496
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,640
hasn't even looked at it. And it's not in the normal middle of the table spot where I

497
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,560
can easily do a monitor on it. It's off to the side, but I haven't even seen you reach

498
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,200
for it. But you have a better vantage point. No, he hasn't gone for it once. Looking at

499
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,560
noises outside or upstairs. I'm going to give you because of that one. I'm going

500
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,080
to give you a B plus. I think a B plus is fair, but that's pretty good. You know

501
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,080
that's above average. That is well above average for you. Yeah, voice work now we

502
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,000
have now what have you done all too much voice work, but you did me me me me me

503
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,800
so we'll just animal crossing. He also did he did a stoner voice when he was

504
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,680
talking about up. See he's he's on top of this stuff. He slid in yeah. He's going

505
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,840
for it. Okay, well I'll give you an a minus just because that neither of them

506
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,280
were really like full impressions. Well, I think there's a bias here for that a

507
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:33,800
minus. Why? I think it should at least be an A. Because one of them was making fun of you. I feel like I think I think it was an A. I think him being on top of it and throwing in the stoner voice because he knew that the me me me wasn't hitting. I think that's deserving of it. But were either of those voices on their own A's? I don't know. I'm not. I think Caleb the animal crossing. I'm going to give you the A minus with the expectation you're going to hit an A plus in the second half. Yeah. Because I can see you. I can see you getting there easily. I'm going to give you room for improvement. Also is this

508
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:39,680
is this a cumulative or these separate I think these are separate or we can call

509
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,120
a cumulative I guess all right that's probably better yeah that's fine because

510
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,880
then you can get to perfect here yeah and then we got stories with endings now

511
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,560
here I'm not so sure about this because you had a story about the suitcase right

512
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,240
and the ending was that you put your your costume outside and we also have a

513
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,280
story about your driver's test and the ending of your story about your driver's

514
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,860
first test is that you went into the wrong lane and I'm wondering here what

515
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,200
we think on the grading committee about these endings. That was not a story.

516
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,300
That was an anecdote. I think a story is going to be a story yeah. I don't think

517
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:18,180
we have shorts. It was the short short story and it did have an ending so the

518
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,580
ending, but what happened after you went like I failed the test, okay, but I

519
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,420
kind of want I just need to wrap up a little bit. Is there any other part of

520
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,560
that maybe we need to know. This is just right this is like right at the end of

521
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,780
the of the semester like hey can you just turn in like one little extra paper on

522
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,640
whatever you want. And then I tried to I had the same instructor. Oh so you went

523
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,240
back? I went back the next week, same instructor. Okay. And I did the same thing.

524
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,280
That's a good ending. Okay, alright we take that. That's an A+. I have more driving stories.

525
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,680
We'll give you an A+. See that's a story I might not be happy to read in a

526
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,480
book. Yeah. But it's certainly you know. I'd love to hear from my friends.

527
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,840
exactly face yeah that's a plus above and beyond. I had you I had you down for

528
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,280
two above and beyond points. I don't remember what the first one was for the

529
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,240
second one was for that that incisive comment about the DMV, which was good

530
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,240
that was inside that was fucking good yeah I liked that a lot. I mean this is

531
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,000
kind of an extra credit section, so I'm thinking maybe we do points instead of

532
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,920
a great view seven extra points. We'll give you seven points for the first and

533
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,440
that could possibly bring you up from like you know if that stays a B plus

534
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,180
then maybe if your distractions one stays a B+ we might be able to move that

535
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,300
credit kind of over give you a full A. Yeah yeah you know and then we'll

536
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,240
calculate your GPA at the end as well. Now we got we got we got Giggle Bear.

537
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,120
What are we thinking Giggle Bear? Honestly I think I've only heard you Giggle Bear out

538
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,600
once this entire half. That's not true. This first half. And you've been great at home.

539
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,660
You've laughed. You've laughed but I'm not sure you've Giggle Bear that much. We'll give you two

540
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,400
Giggle Bears. Yeah. Which counts. Which to me is also an extra credit. You think

541
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,040
the giggle bears and actually credit buddy you're the giggle bear the you are

542
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,080
giggle. We need you to giggle bear. I think maybe that's a c plus well yeah,

543
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,240
we'll give him a c plus we gotta be we gotta be fair here. Yeah, so I'm all I'm

544
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,800
saying is you better be smiling this and now unfortunately pet that brings us to

545
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,920
crassness and there was a regretful comment you made about a string being

546
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,480
tied around a penis and you also uttered the word vagina. Vagina is a medical

547
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,420
term. We'll give you vagina but putting a string around a fucking penis. Yeah that's rough.

548
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:29,140
I was talking about the process in Hollywood so I was actually explaining. I don't know

549
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,540
there was a tinge of irreverence to your penis comments. I don't know that you can go behind

550
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,180
the scenes with this one. I don't think that's a good excuse. Although I'm willing to add

551
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:43,540
behind the scenes knowledge as another thing. If you know any more behind the scenes facts.

552
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,500
I will give crass, so we're rating it obviously an a is the least crass

553
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,340
right yeah, okay, I'm going to say that's a going to be a B minus yeah,

554
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,140
all right, because that's not so

555
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:59,080
yeah, exactly one. I mean, I would say it's very crass, but it was only one

556
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,500
one, but he didn't say he also action. He didn't say and then the penis around

557
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,980
the day come in my mouth. Yeah, yeah, the penis has ejaculated into my face.

558
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,560
I'm jacking off the penis. I'm sucking okay, so what did you say that was I'm

559
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,080
say B-. B-. On crassness. Okay. Alright. And then as we go into the second half, I'm gonna

560
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,800
go get myself a glass of water. Okay, so a thing that I'm gonna expect here is that you

561
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,980
have something here, right, to fill this time. Yeah. It's just gonna be you two. Okay. Okay.

562
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,440
No brother. Alright. So I'll be right back. Have I told you about my driver's ed instructor

563
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,440
that I had? The one that I dropped out of driver's ed. I don't know. This is good cohesiveness.

564
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Okay, let's get some water now, Caleb. I think I've told you about him before. He, I definitely

565
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,800
have because I took three of his classes and then I couldn't like he the first

566
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,640
day of the I had just gotten two weeks prior I just got my friend got into a

567
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,440
car crash with me in the middle seat uh-huh and the airbag went off and like

568
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:02,440
broke her eye or some shit whoa it like her I she got out of the car and the

569
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,160
airbag like made her I like blood broke her I was a hanging out of her face it

570
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,760
looked it honestly could have been it that's crazy it wasn't it was just

571
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,800
covering I've never seen an eye covered in blood before remember when when how

572
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,000
about Joe Biden a red-eye yeah Brandon yeah Brandon's cuz he was getting

573
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,640
punched that's right by an airbag oh you think so yeah but so two weeks before

574
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,880
that I got into a car accident or I was in a car that got into an accident I

575
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,000
wasn't driving and then the day one of that class he showed us just nothing

576
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,480
put car crash footage to show us how ABS brakes work and it was just car crash

577
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,080
footage and he's like this like five foot like four Italian guy with giant

578
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,200
wingspan but very short guy. He looks like a Lego man and he's like telling me

579
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,760
like, "Okay well if you take my class you're not gonna get into an accident

580
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,800
like this. If you learn from me I'm here to prevent because driving is a

581
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,660
privilege it's not a right okay and so he said that he could prevent a kid a kid's

582
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,440
death he could have prevented a child's death okay someone who died at my school

583
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,880
real quick no wait someone died the kid got into a car accident and then day one

584
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,960
of my my ex-girlfriend's driver's ed class he made a comment about how he if

585
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,600
he took his class he could damn that's a story I'll say this that was a story

586
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,360
with a voice and I'm not gonna elaborate on on what other kind of story it was

587
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,720
but yeah yeah I some kid drove up a telephone pole at my school damn I knew

588
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,720
this I knew somebody I shouldn't that's too sad

589
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:50,000
basically just wiped out an entire you never happened in your hometown where

590
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:59,400
just an entire lunch table whole lunch table one accident damn

591
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,440
That was a huge bummer at the school and this little guy who smoked Paul Malls was just like,

592
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,120
"I could have stopped that. It would have been different if I was his teacher."

593
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,480
What if he had stood in front of the—he could have been the buffer between the two cars?

594
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,800
I think that's what he meant. He could have lifted the car up with his big arms.

595
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,040
Did you guys see that video of the guy? He's sitting at a drag racing thing and he walks

596
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,440
too close and he gets hit by the rear of the car. He flies out and he has an Uzi.

597
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,240
No, but have you seen—there's a video I saw recently.

598
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,800
he like gets fucking his spleen is exploding. It's these guys doing like uh like you know there's

599
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,280
like the burnout circles. Yeah that's what it was yeah. Oh oh I thought you were talking okay well

600
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,840
it's one of those videos and a guy gets hit by the car. Oh yeah. Under the car and the car pants him.

601
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,240
Whoa. Yeah. I saw another one there's a bunch of videos of people getting hit by those cars of

602
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,360
those. Oh yeah. One of them the guy gets hit knocked cold either dead or something a dude

603
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,680
walks up immediately and this is being filmed by like 50 people a guy walks up immediately

604
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,680
checks him for his wallet, takes a lot out and smacks him in the head.

605
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,680
I do remember that one.

606
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,680
I was like, "That was so good."

607
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,680
I saw two guys fighting over... two Middle Eastern guys in front of my apartment today.

608
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,680
And the reason I bring up why they're Middle Eastern is that they're fighting and they're talking to each other

609
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,680
saying like, "I've been American since the day I was born." You're not from... to each other.

610
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,480
they're fighting about who is American and then they got into the same car. I would have stopped them and said I'm

611
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,140
American. They were like fighting each other, they were like pushing each other ready to like actually like fistfight.

612
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,560
Maybe they're brothers. And then they stopped and then they got into the same

613
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,320
Mercedes Benz. They are the fighting brothers. Yeah, they sound like the fighting brothers to me.

614
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,760
But I was like, I don't, I had to leave but I was like, I really want to kind of go over and ask there

615
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,920
Yeah, what's going on? Maybe go John Wilson on it. I wish that I had an entire...

616
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,360
- Which one of you is actually more American?

617
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,040
- And one of them is a little bit more American

618
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,860
than the other.

619
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,120
- I wish that I had a documentary crew

620
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,880
to follow me around constantly, not to film me,

621
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,960
but just anybody I see who looks a little weird,

622
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,560
I would love to just do a full interview with them.

623
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,800
Just like a full, like, just an expose.

624
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,440
- Do you think it'd be funny to,

625
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,840
it's funny that that is a show where you could,

626
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,600
any guy with a camera could literally ruin the show

627
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,860
he just followed him around as much as possible like somehow found out just him

628
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,480
well if he found out it's three camera if you found out all the people and that's

629
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,160
behind the scenes stuff so what that was behind the scenes yeah but if we yeah we

630
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,540
get higher people just ruin a network television show to just walk like what

631
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,920
was his name and just jump in front of the camera Joey boots like yeah they

632
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,440
never know where Joey boots from Stern I think that was a name Joey it's either

633
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,840
it's not Joey Pants, I think it was Joey Boots, it was this guy who would run up to like

634
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,880
news reporters and he would just go "Bubba Bully, Bubba Bully, Howard Stern's

635
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,280
penis!" Yeah that's what I was gonna say, if you're gonna follow a

636
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,280
camera crew around, why go for John Wilson? Yeah. You could like do it to like a news broadcast.

637
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:14,120
Because he doesn't have like people with him, right? It's just one guy walking around filming

638
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:18,480
things, or three guys, and so you're walking around just... Two guys, one girl.

639
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,520
Okay, so two guys one girl, so you're walking around and you're maybe dressed funny

640
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,600
And then you're just you ruin all the footage because there's a guy fucking dress. I mean honestly you dress like Hitler if I'm gonna

641
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,600
I'm gonna be completely real

642
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
You could do completely

643
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:40,640
Or an Alibaba Hitler outfit you just ruin everything cuz every single shot he takes there's Hitler there

644
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah, you're not even running up to him. You're just you just have to walk

645
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,640
And now the next season of the show everything's filmed at 3 in the morning

646
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,460
Yes, the fucking avoid Hitler who's outside his house every day, and there's no there's nothing wrong

647
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,780
Like if you're in a public space you can just walk around get in front of cameras. It's it's a

648
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,300
You know because if somebody is dressed up like Hitler, and you were trying to

649
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:07,220
Record like something that's interesting the most interesting thing in that is like it's always Hitler

650
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,180
This guy is about to get his ass beat. I don't think

651
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,820
like Hitler

652
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,420
I'm an actor, I'm just an actor. Do you not see the camera?

653
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,140
The best part of that too is that ruins the footage in a way that ruins it only for John

654
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,660
Wilson because anybody who's, if he ends up having to put a bunch of Hitler footage in

655
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,220
his show then it's everyone else is like oh this is great there's a guy who dresses up

656
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,100
like Hitler in New York and John Wilson was following him around and he saw some crazy

657
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,820
stuff but John Wilson, no he wanted to get a video of a donut on the ground.

658
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,780
all of a sudden he has no control over his show. Yeah right we've completely

659
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,320
annihilated his yeah, because every single episode he's trying to talk about

660
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,520
and sometimes love is like a butterfly and then the butterflies landing on

661
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,820
Hitler's. It's landing on Hitler's finger like a like a perching parrot right is

662
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,920
actually so g that is that is like the most that's gang stalking yeah. You if

663
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,780
you want to get it honestly, if I don't listen John Wilson, I love your show. I

664
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,680
think you're I think it's a great show. I think you're a genius, but if you do

665
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,280
want to gang stalk somebody, he's a clear target. Yeah. If you want to be like,

666
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,080
yeah, ruin a guy's life, he's so easy to ruin his life. Yeah, yeah, because

667
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,400
you're not just ruining his life, you're ruining his livelihood. Exactly, yeah,

668
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,000
and then like all of a sudden he has to come up with a new idea for a show,

669
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,520
right? And or you...

670
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,600
Well, best case scenario...

671
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,960
I mean, all I'm gonna say is you guys will know what happened if you see an

672
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,080
announcement from John Wilson he's like the next season of my show will be

673
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:50,280
filmed in Antarctica. Well you do have you have to be a billionaire for this to

674
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,660
work because you have to be able to follow him around the globe wherever he goes.

675
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,520
There's a certain magic to it. You hire private investigators this is what to do

676
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,800
if you're a billionaire. If you win the lottery you should do something like

677
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,680
this. You hire private investigators, you follow him wherever he goes, you know his

678
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:09,240
schedule every single time and then you just dress up completely like Hitler. I

679
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,000
I would say it helps a little bit if you're not white because then you think

680
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,200
you do get a little bit more of a public pass for being Hitler right nobody's

681
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,040
gonna stop a black guy dressed like Hitler right they're gonna be like I

682
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,040
think a couple people might yeah I think I think you're gonna run into Israelites

683
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,480
who might not be that keen on black I think you're gonna run into problems

684
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,040
no matter what this is Hitler yeah I think I think if the black Israelites

685
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,760
saw black Hitler on the street there they're not there but again but again

686
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,680
you do you do you sit you it's the British accent it's a British accent

687
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,240
every single time

688
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,640
It's versus black Hitler's

689
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,480
deadliest warrior.

690
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,560
It's just like a full like fucking yeah. Westside story

691
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,840
snap off battle. Yeah, that's a

692
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:11,960
yeah, they see each other like like

693
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,080
perking up. Just like, "Oh, fuck. Oh no."

694
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:19,580
Yeah.

695
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,080
They're the black...

696
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,880
"Hey, this is the black...

697
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
[laughter]

698
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,880
Scram!

699
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,380
[laughter]

700
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,880
Get the fuck out of here!"

701
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
[laughter]

702
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Oh, no.

703
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Do they also have big signs that say Hitler was black, though?

704
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,380
Yes.

705
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:32,880
Yeah.

706
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
That's what the black Hitlerites are.

707
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,380
Yeah.

708
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,880
But their whole thing is they're, like, very friendly and chill.

709
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
[laughter]

710
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,880
Instead of, like, yelling at people, they're like, "Yeah, just come check it out.

711
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,000
We don't even know what we're advocating for, we just think that this is what happened.

712
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,480
We just know these colorized photos are doing...

713
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,120
Honestly, we're not... we don't even like them, we just are trying to spread the word.

714
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,120
We hate it.

715
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
We completely hate it.

716
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,960
We're not proud of it, but yeah, he was black.

717
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,520
It's just, you know, it's just evidence of whitewashing.

718
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,640
Yeah, that's what they're mad about.

719
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,840
We just don't like that, so we dress up like Hitler and we walk around.

720
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,480
I'm trying to think of if there's anyone else...

721
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,760
They have like a bake sale, the black Hitlerite bake sale.

722
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Is there anyone else but Hitler that you could dress up as?

723
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,560
I think actually, you know, now that I'm thinking about it, I think you could probably walk

724
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,160
around dressed like Hitler without any trouble if there are enough of you.

725
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,160
Yeah.

726
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,160
Because I'm thinking about those-

727
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,160
It's a Santa con.

728
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Because of those- Yes, exactly.

729
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Because of those Hitler vaccine protesters.

730
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Do you remember them?

731
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh my God.

732
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
They marched around dressed as Hitler.

733
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,160
We did see people dressed like Hitler.

734
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,880
I saw them two times and I never saw anybody a costume.

735
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,880
They were dressed as Nazis.

736
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
They did not have those mustaches.

737
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,840
They did not have- They didn't have- They wasn't a full costume, but I will say-

738
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
It was a no mustache.

739
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,880
dressed as a Nazi I think you'd normally run into some trouble. It was one of the most

740
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,080
multicultural events. It definitely was. They had people from all races dressed up like Nazis.

741
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,320
I don't even remember what was their thing? They thought vaccine mandates were

742
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:00,320
fascist. It was Hitler's stuff. Okay. That's Hitler's stuff. That's what it was. There was a sign that one of them was

743
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,520
holding that said "vaccine mandates are Hitler's stuff." There was another sign that said "we don't play that Hitler shit."

744
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,240
Yep, that's right. Yeah, they did. Do you remember the same day we saw a guy, there

745
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,760
was like some concert or something at Central Park right? There was like

746
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,760
summer series. Every day they have like Bon Jovi in the middle of the

747
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,440
concert and nobody even knows until, it's like all just tourists who walk up.

748
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,440
So yeah there was a guy, because there's that huge line for like people waiting

749
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,680
to go see it, and there was a guy in a diaper and a Joe Biden mask and with a

750
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,720
sign that just said "Where am I?" I got a photo of it. There was a while where people thought that he

751
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,560
was disappeared I remember yeah yeah it was probably around that time well he was

752
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,560
getting facelifts and I'll tell you what he's back he came back yeah I saw some

753
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,080
crazy videos of him just seeming normal he's popping fucking vive ants yeah I

754
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,640
swear to God yeah he's probably taking like he's taking like a they've been

755
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,040
trying to hop him up for a while I think they finally found the right it's got to

756
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,120
be the right cocktail it's got to be TRT they're putting him on I think he's

757
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,840
looking virile. They're putting him on trend. He's about to look like a liver king. He's

758
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,220
lifting weights. Yeah, no, he's got some high test right now. Yeah. Yeah, I'm really excited

759
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,500
to see what kind of fisticuffs he's throwing in this upcoming election. It's gonna be so

760
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:22,040
cool. It's gonna be so cool when he like just gets completely jacked because they're putting

761
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,660
like the Bane serum in him from Batman and Robin. Yeah, the venom. That green goo. The

762
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:33,340
thing is, if I was the president, it's a disappointment if you ever die. If you were ever the president

763
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,340
and you and they let you die.

764
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:35,840
Yeah,

765
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,140
even after office.

766
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,240
They're supposed to back you up in a computer like

767
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,740
me.

768
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,340
What's his name?

769
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,940
You should be getting the first Vegas the first of all the

770
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,540
crap,

771
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,040
right?

772
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,340
Yeah,

773
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,340
I'm getting the fucking you should be getting the Boston

774
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,840
Dynamics robot dog body and all that shit.

775
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:49,940
Yeah,

776
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,940
I think the president should be the first to try like the

777
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,340
like the new flatbread at Taco Bell.

778
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:55,940
You should be.

779
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,340
Yeah,

780
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,640
if you're the president,

781
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,040
yeah,

782
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,940
I think that's the only benefit.

783
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,240
Yeah,

784
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,840
you should be able you should get all of the you should be able

785
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,840
to buy a shamrock shake mid-December. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? Year-round shamrock

786
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,000
shake for the president. No, that would be huge. Yeah. What is it? There's like a

787
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
joke in that show, I watched it with my mom, that show Raising Hope where

788
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,400
someone is on death row and they try to get a McRib and a shamrock shake as

789
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,160
their last meal so they were kept on death row for a long time. That's funny. I thought

790
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,280
that was a good joke. Yeah. Don't people on death row usually get kept on death

791
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,520
row for about 50 years though and then just die? I mean here's my new,

792
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,880
I even better than that. I mean that's that's a good idea, but I mean say that

793
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,600
you say that and they announce it the next day right that is coming back or

794
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,400
something. I would say I want a new food that I invented that takes 3,000 years

795
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,320
to I want squim. Yeah, I want I want a bucket of rice. I want the type of rice

796
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,800
I made that gets cooked and also it needs to be cooked by me and it needs to

797
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,080
be cooked in a mansion cooked in a mansion for a century. I love whenever

798
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,080
when whenever like I'm serial killer gets like a crazy last meal as like a

799
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,240
way to who ate a who ate one one one B is one being one grain of rice all that

800
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,120
stuff and it's like I really got one over it's like you're about to be filled

801
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:09,560
with fucking poison but I think that they win they'll just give them a bean

802
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,480
off nice one dude that's yeah yeah we get it you're great it's it's not as

803
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,700
crazy as when you killed 30 do they have like a price limit on them can you like

804
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,660
just there I think it's like some states I was reading about this recently it's

805
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,240
like some states are like I think somebody tried to get like lobster or

806
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,900
something and they're like no you have like they can either give you like a

807
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,100
sheet and then you can like fill it in or like it's like some states give you

808
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,600
like up to $10 for your last meal.

809
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,800
Why can't I just use my money?

810
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,720
Yeah. What are you gonna do with that? Leave it to my children? I killed them.

811
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,120
No, yeah, exactly. I ate my kid.

812
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
That's why I'm here.

813
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
My other kid.

814
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,120
I've been trying to get him for a while.

815
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,120
I've been telling him to come visit.

816
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Will you come visit?

817
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,120
And will you sneak me in a bottle of barbecue sauce?

818
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,120
But the pat, they'll find you. You gotta cover yourself.

819
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,120
You gotta cover yourself in sweet baby

820
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,120
rage before you come in here.

821
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,120
Please. Dad, are you sure?

822
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah.

823
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,120
What big eyes you have, Dad!

824
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,120
See, he's dressed up like the

825
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,240
the big bad wolf even though he's already a serial killer yeah that'd be cool

826
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,360
above and beyond mm-hmm Big Bad Wolf reference Big Bad Wolf dude that'd be cool if you were

827
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,800
a serial killer and your nickname was the Big Bad Wolf that would be fucking sick

828
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,640
because you dress up like someone's grandma oh my fucking god holy shit I

829
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,400
think if I were a serial killer I would want to have if I got to choose my

830
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,600
serial killer name I would choose the murderer I would choose can you imagine

831
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,560
the power that that name would have I would choose Richard Ramirez that's

832
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,560
that's taken. I would what that's completely take it, then I would do like

833
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:50,200
Sam Berkowitz. That one's not taken. I do. Caleb is that no is that is that son

834
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,820
of Sam yeah, because I was like I think that might have been David Berkowitz.

835
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:02,420
Sam Berkowitz might be somebody I know yeah, I would be called Caleb the Ripper.

836
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,820
I think that's good. I would be called I mean John Wayne Gacy. You guys have to

837
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,520
but the murderers is sick. That is good because because they were the headlines.

838
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,900
The murderer was caught yeah. I was like who's the killer that dude my crime

839
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,660
would be that I followed when Williams around the killer is good to sane one.

840
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,960
The killer is that you're doing Google search. Google search results would be

841
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,640
will be yeah. I think I think you could you could do what if we spawn a serial

842
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,400
killer called the terrifier like a fan of our podcast is like you wanting to

843
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,060
kill. Do you think anybody listens podcast is a psychopath who wants to kill

844
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,220
and probably has blood thirst i have a feeling of the probably

845
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,820
yeah i mean statistically get out of what is it like one in every fifteen people

846
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,620
as a murderer there might be i might be able to play it

847
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,980
i think so

848
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,700
i bet i could if i search on you to be sound this sound that makes you a

849
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,260
murder i could play it over the mic

850
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,380
and see if playing on his phone

851
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:58,460
not playing i'm looking something up i don't think we want to hear that i don't

852
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,140
want to turn in the middle of this program is phone i want to see i guess

853
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,900
I was going to look something up for the podcast.

854
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:04,900
No videos.

855
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,900
We want to see Pat shine.

856
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,380
He's only got eight more, seven more minutes before we do our final report on him.

857
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,100
I will say I was doing something that I thought would be, that would help the podcast.

858
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,300
I wasn't playing and it does, it does make me a little, a little iffy on Pat here, kind

859
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,860
of trying to come at me for this, seeing as I'm the one grading.

860
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,460
I don't even have a report card.

861
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,660
I don't have a report card.

862
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,660
His report card?

863
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:27,620
See, Pat is trying to take the heat off himself for I'm not sure why.

864
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:31,700
Cam, perfect, but he did just two minutes ago, he did hiss like a snake and it really

865
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,540
scared me. I didn't know what that was. I thought there was a rattlesnake in the office.

866
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:41,780
I laughed. That's not a laugh. That's a type of laugh. I do laugh like that sometimes.

867
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:47,540
It is weird that there are types of laughs that are just like doing like. What? That

868
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,820
is not a good radio laugh. I do all different kinds of. No, I know. That's what my dad does.

869
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,700
Yeah, we got to get out of it. No hissing loud anymore. My dad does a crackle.

870
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,740
My dad laughs at something and he's like, "Oh, I shouldn't laugh at that." He goes like.

871
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:06,340
he goes like i can't does straight down straight i do it too and i definitely know that i've heard it

872
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:11,620
yeah you you do a crackle yeah you like ernie's laugh you have a giggle bear laugh and then you

873
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:17,460
also have a yeah he does have a hiss too though i know i just hiccup i also have the i laugh really

874
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,140
hard i have a full hic i just go like yeah i also have that sometimes i think i have all the you are

875
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:27,540
a snorter and then you have all the nose things yeah and you cover because you're so decent like

876
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,380
Princess Diana. That's what you remind me of. Princess fucking Diana.

877
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,700
See, I just did one that was like, "Lady D."

878
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,620
Lady Di.

879
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,100
Lady Di.

880
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,020
Lady Di.

881
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,260
D.

882
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,420
She died. That's why they call her Lady Di.

883
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,060
I don't think so.

884
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,420
They call her that because she died.

885
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,700
Do you think Trump fucked her?

886
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,180
No.

887
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,300
I think the timeline matches up.

888
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,260
Michael Jackson did.

889
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,300
No, John Travolta.

890
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,380
Easy to confuse.

891
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:49,780
Yeah.

892
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,180
Yeah.

893
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,140
They both say he he.

894
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,820
They do say he he.

895
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,380
Yeah.

896
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,620
So Michael Jackson, he didn't do that, right?

897
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,100
What save all those kids? Yeah. Yeah. And the Moonwalker game? Well, that was a video

898
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,300
game. He didn't actually do it. What was the movie he was in? Moonwalker. Thriller.

899
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:10,180
Where he was like this on the cover? Moonwalker. No. Oh, oh, this is it.

900
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,020
It's a fantasy movie, right? Wasn't he in a fantasy movie? He was in a fantasy movie?

901
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:19,780
I think I'd have sworn, man. Oh, it's time to stand. It's time to stand? According to this thing.

902
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:25,140
Yeah, according to my health app. Okay. Stand? I guess so. I just do what it says. Listen,

903
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:30,200
I'm trying to be healthy. I haven't been I haven't had a drip of alcohol since we

904
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,380
got back from the Pacific Northwest and I'm sleeping like three hours a night. I

905
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,740
thought it would do the opposite. I've been sleeping like three hours, waking up,

906
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,980
feeling incredible. I can't believe it dude. I think I've unlocked a new

907
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,580
ability. I think I have a no sleep ability.

908
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:50,120
I have been, my sleep schedule has been fucked up because I'll call my

909
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,520
my girlfriend before bed and she's not home. She's on the West Coast. Yeah,

910
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,220
yeah. Right now she's coming home. She's coming. I'm so tired because I got

911
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,020
haunted by a ghost, but it's not a big deal. Yeah, but I was up. I was like

912
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,820
yes, it doesn't matter. No, explain that. It doesn't matter. You can't just

913
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,020
say you got haunted. No, I don't want to talk about it. I would love to hear

914
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,820
something from you. It was a good- I had a- I had a- I had a- No, let's just hear

915
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,520
what Pat has to say. It doesn't matter too much what I had to say. It was a- I

916
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,760
on the phone with her last night at like my time like 2 in the morning. Ending.

917
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,800
I know, 2 in the morning I was on the phone with her and I was like doing

918
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,560
Trump voice but the whole thing was just Trump talking about being

919
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,120
neurodivergent. Mm-hmm. And then I thought it was really funny for Trump to go

920
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:41,880
"And then I got molested and then I completely got molested and it changed

921
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,880
my life." And then she said "You have to stop saying that I'm not wearing

922
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,960
headphones right now and I'm in the kitchen and all my roommates can hear you.

923
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,800
And she'd be, they'd be, they'd walk in and be like, "Oh my god, are you seriously

924
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,680
talking to that fascist Donald Trump right now?" Are you talking to Donald J. Trump?

925
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,840
Wait, he got molested and he's neurodivergent? Okay, I'm actually feeling a

926
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:03,880
little bit of sympathy for this guy. Right? And then all of a sudden you've created...

927
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,880
I got a 504 plan, they let me chew gum at school. Now you've created three new...

928
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,880
They let me chew gum before my test. I took occupational therapy. I took occupational

929
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,680
when I was a little kid, not that old.

930
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,980
- That's not okay 'cause you're humanizing him.

931
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

932
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,660
'Cause now-- - That's a good point.

933
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,400
- They taught me how to hold a pencil.

934
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,520
I couldn't hold a pencil before, now I'm the best.

935
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,840
- If he said that, he's creating--

936
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,680
- Now I'm the best at holding a pencil.

937
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,480
- Five million new Republicans, 'cause they're like,

938
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,200
well, now we know his story.

939
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,040
- Yeah. - Right, the whole thing

940
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,760
with a guy like Trump, I don't wanna know his story, bud.

941
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,920
I want his story to end with him

942
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,080
on death row for his crimes.

943
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,200
- Yeah. - Yeah.

944
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,200
- Him in the electric chair. - You know what he'd ask for.

945
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,560
I mean you know what he'd ask for as a last meal.

946
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,760
Him in the electric chair like Marv from Sin City.

947
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,920
He'd ask for a complete fucking hamburger.

948
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,960
He'd ask for over 100 hamburgers.

949
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
Oh my god.

950
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
He would totally do that.

951
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
Probably with a side of kofefe sauce.

952
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,960
Yeah, he'd basically get a kofefe hamburger and he'd say, "This complete hamburger with

953
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
kofefe sauce is...

954
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Oh my god, it's a fake news hamburger.

955
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
And I'd like 100 hamburgers.

956
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
And I'd like a side of Injustice.

957
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Yes, I'd like...

958
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
And then...

959
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,960
And then...

960
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,960
And then...

961
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,960
And then...

962
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,960
Oh, and you know what I'd like on a hamburger?

963
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,960
Collusion.

964
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,960
I'd like Russian dressing.

965
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,960
And then they'd do a wink to the...

966
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:18,680
my camera fucking guy and I want to get peed on I want to pee I want my p tape I

00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,320
piece of you say p-tape he's like no that's just how I say peace and I want

970
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,320
to create a car like abbreviating and I want to curse Jeff Diedrich for bringing

971
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,180

973
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:55,380
that's just how I say maple syrup we basically owned him that is that we got

974
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:01,620
Trump finally yeah we've had him for a little much on the forefront of tearing

975
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:06,820
Oh yeah, we really did some Judd Apatow tween style shit where we totally took him down.

976
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:11,940
Yeah, and yes, I know that what we're doing and doing a Trump voice is, it's about four

977
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,940
years too late.

978
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:13,940
No dude, we brought it back.

979
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:17,020
Even as a joke thing, it is back.

980
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,020
We 100% brought it back.

981
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:21,420
And we're not doing it because it sucks.

982
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,500
No, we're doing it because it's actually funny to do it.

983
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,260
I would say less than a month after we started doing it again, everyone else started doing

984
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,260
it again.

985
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,260
Really?

986
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,860
the beginning of tour. Yeah. And now this stuff now this stuff's going on. They got

987
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:38,460
Jamie Foxx doing that. Jamie Foxx video is unbelievable. It's crazy. Yeah. He's the

988
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,540
best one ever. He's the most talented man in the world. He I actually I've believed

989
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,820
that for a very long time. Yeah. Yeah. I remember seeing his like. He does a

990
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:50,020
really good Quentin Tarantino too. Have you seen that video? No. He has a great

991
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,780
impression. The Jamie Foxx video where he's on Howard Stern and he's

992
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:56,100
talking about Quentin Tarantino's like directing style and he says the first

993
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,660
the first day on set with Tarantino, Tarantino like took him into a room and

994
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,020
close the door and was like what the fuck are you doing out there your character

995
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:08,100
is a fucking slave you're a fucking slave. It was like to act more like a

996
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:14,140
good video and then and then how it turns like well would you work with him

997
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,860
again and Jamie's was like a thousand he loves him yeah he I mean how can you

998
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:21,300
know every interview he does he's like yeah Tarantino could say the in where

999
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,140
you can do whatever he wants now Jane. I want you to get on the sibian there you

1000
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,420
That was a little Alan Alda I would say.

1001
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,420
Yeah more Alan Alda than Stern.

1002
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,780
That's okay then, I had a voice.

1003
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,580
We crossed the line.

1004
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,580
Now Beetlejuice I want you to write this.

1005
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,580
Hey, enough, enough.

1006
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,580
Now it's the liberation.

1007
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,340
You're trying to get someone past the buzzer, it's not going to work.

1008
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,260
These shots, shot clock violation.

1009
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,260
Yeah.

1010
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,260
Alright, alright.

1011
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,940
Phone usage, that's another A+.

1012
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:47,940
Easy A+.

1013
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,940
A+ and I can't, I mean, like I said, you've been on an A+ kick with that, so that's good.

1014
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,940
Yeah.

1015
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,940
That was great.

1016
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,340
at noises outsider upstairs have to say could be another it could be it could be

1017
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,300
a think that's an I think it's an a let's give it an a-plus cuz he really turned

1018
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,100
it into he didn't do it all he turned it improved yeah yeah no it's about it's

1019
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:15,060
not about how you just look how you finish that's not it's pastime you can

1023
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,560
shower let's be real yeah we got that old lady we got voice work now and voice

1024
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,020
work he really he's really made a serious we have a driving instructor voice yeah

1025
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:40,680
that he had we had a we had a we had a John I've okay that story had a

1026
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:48,040
different ending no you can't get this in past I just want to he was raiding

1027
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,300
babies. What? Do you remember that? I don't think so. I found his Facebook account and

1028
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:59,120
he him and his wife were on this website called rate my baby and there was a bunch of pictures

1029
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:05,800
like he posted his baby but then he was posting other babies going ah so cute. Whoa okay alright

1030
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:09,640
that's crazy. Alright let's stories with endings are pumping all the way up and voice work

1031
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,840
I'm gonna give him an A+ he did like four different ones. We got driving instructor.

1032
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,440
Oh you have a list okay. We had John Wilson he did a serial killer voice. Yeah. I didn't

1033
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,240
notice that one, but he did he did Trump.

1034
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
A+ A+

1035
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,740
That's A+

1036
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,740
Yeah, that's an easy A+.

1037
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,740
This is a fucking, this was a great second half for you.

1038
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,340
Stories with endings.

1039
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,040
We had a driving instructor story.

1040
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,840
Now, I think maybe the way that we can rate these these stories

1041
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,640
as if we can remember the endings and what they were because

1042
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,340
I feel like I'm at the time.

1043
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,440
What stories did we have?

1044
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,640
We have driving instructor ended with him saying he could have

1045
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,640
saved a child.

1046
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,940
Okay, so we got driving instructor and then the other big

1047
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,240
story was Trump getting molested talking on the phone story.

1048
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:51,460
I'm going to say I basically gave you the ending for the Trump thing for us to get out of that

1049
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,260
story so I don't think that one had an ending.

1050
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,260
What are you talking about?

1051
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,260
What was the ending?

1052
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,740
Because I said her roommates come in and then and they think that it's a...

1053
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,340
Well I ended the story and then you picked it you picked it up with a riff.

1054
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,340
Fight fight fight.

1055
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,340
Just joking.

1056
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:07,700
You're right that's a good point but the story I don't think was all that I would have left

1057
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,780
it there if I thought that it was complete.

1058
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:13,780
I'm gonna say that's your only normal A no plus.

1059
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,780
Okay.

1060
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:34,500
to

1061
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,180
translate to a different number of yeah. So i just let me i think three

1062
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,300
thumbs up as a three no i let's let me listen here. Let's let me talk points

1063
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,820
is in a thumbs up. It doesn't matter right now, because what i'm telling you

1064
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,820
is a three thumbs up is not correlate to any points. It's just there were three

1065
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:49,860
good things that you did for above and beyond which i will read out. If you

1066
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,780
give me a freaking second here yeah the first one was that you carried you

1067
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,460
carried it. Well, caleb got water completely carried it that was perfect. I

1068
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:02,220
didn't even say a word nice. Then the second one was you had it bad behind the

1069
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,580
scenes information about John Wilson yeah, that was behind the production of

1070
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:11,900
how to he had a gender that was that was a how to and then he also we gave him a

1071
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,680
thumbs up for the big bad wolf,

1072
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:18,140
which is something you said to give him to wait. What wasn't there another one on

1073
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,360
there? What was the other one? I didn't take it down. If I wait, this is above

1074
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,300
and beyond this is above and beyond I I'm going to say that those are the

1075
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,340
three things that I marked down for above and beyond. I'll give you another

1076
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,360
seven. I would I mean last time he only had two I'm willing to go eight

1077
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:37,280
Okay, let's go eight. Yeah, let's go eight. Okay, that's an eight for above and

1078
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,520
beyond. Then we got Giggle Bear and I know you had a very impressive Giggle

1079
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,240
Bear this time about the Black Israelites versus Black Hitler. Oh yeah,

1080
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,160
you did Giggle Bear out of that. You really giggled. You sold that one. Yeah,

1081
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,160
because I was a little uneasy going Black Israelites versus Black Hitler.

1082
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,400

1095
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,760
was an Adderall prescription.

you will get an Adderall prescription,

1101
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,040

True.
