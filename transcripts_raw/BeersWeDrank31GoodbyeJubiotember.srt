1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
mm-hmm

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:15,000
you're listening to beers we drink my god

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up all my chuggers?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Trying to get that boop out there.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a journey into space.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Beers we drank motherfucker.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
With Jubio, Caleb and Rex.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Beer. Holy shit.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're back at it again. Hold on wait my fingers. Oh and I hit my monitor.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,100
Hope I'll be right a brand to look at how big this bottle is it's as big as my head even

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:02,620
So big it gets blurred you got to turn that blur off because we can't see what this can is man

13
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,320
You also have the way let me guess. Oh, never mind

14
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,160
That was what I was gonna guess

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,320
It isn't a 25 ounce

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,080
Bud Light Orange

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,120
Get the blur on

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,880
Go ahead and tell us about it

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,840
And get the camera on

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
Alright, you want me to turn the blur off? You're all gonna make fun of us

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
Why do you sound so fucked up also?

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,680
I sound fucked up?

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,720
Hold on, let me

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,440
There we go, use your microphone like a microphone

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,800
Yeah, talk into the mute button

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,160
How do I sound now?

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,120
Better

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,760
This is better?

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,040
Yeah, much much better

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
I have a single cable on the ground

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,640
Yo, what's up?

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,800
Got me fucked up

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
Pick up that cable right now

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,360
Alright, Rex, you already showed us your beer, you already showed your hand my friend.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,520
Go ahead and take a sip, give us a rating, and let's do this shit.

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,040
This is delicious.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
This is like an 8.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
An 8.0.

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
That's an amazing beer man.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Give me a basketball height.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,080
That's like 6'11 dude.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,480
That's a fucking star.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,240
I love that beer.

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,680
You can build a team for 15 years around this beer.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Yep.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,880
I hope that one day I get to taste a flavored Bud Light.

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,480
But that shit is... I will never see that in Mexico.

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,480
And this one doesn't hurt the cap table because this is fucking $3 for this big-ass beer.

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
That's true.

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
That's true.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,780
But the Bud Light Orange, the six packs, they're 10 bucks.

53
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,680
They come in these nice beautiful glass bottles.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,980
They're almost indescribably orange.

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,980
It's definitely has so much fucking coloring in it and shit.

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,180
it's such a fucked up thing to put in your body, but I love them.

57
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,980
And I've never gotten a six pack of Bud Light oranges and not finished it instantly.

58
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah, this is-

59
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,980
'Cause it tastes like soda!

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,980
It does- this literally does taste like- like Fanta.

61
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,980
Yeah.

62
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,980
This is amazing.

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,980
I love Fanta.

64
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,980
I might- I might even up this to an 8.5.

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,980
Whoa!

66
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,980
Wait, wait, ring the alarms!

67
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,980
That might be the highest rating ever done on this show.

68
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,980
And we go Portnoy, by the way, with the ratings.

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
This is a- it's a-

70
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,980
Nine Max.

71
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:20,940
and

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Save the Robots East Coast IPA

73
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:37,060
as well. It's an IPA, it is from Radiant Pig. Yep, thank you for that. This is, uh, the party

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,280
is just getting started for East Coast IPAs and we're keeping things moving with a fresh

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:50,440
take on this style. This hazy, unfiltered gym has juicy, inflicted beer. This afflicted

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,640
Red beer has juicy tropical and citrus flavors, but finishes surprisingly smooth for such

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,140
an aggressive amount of hops.

78
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,200
Guys, this is three hoppy and two juices.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
This is...

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
On the...

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
This.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,240
Some people only tell me this is reddit beer.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
This is a complete reddit beer.

84
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Yeah, it is, but they sell it at every corner store in New York now.

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
You guys know my wife.

86
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,580
She is about as reddit as they come.

87
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,260
This is for an IPA.

88
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,980
This is juicy, guys.

89
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,140
There's no doubt.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,700
I give this three juicy drops just like on the can.

91
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,060
Three juicy drops?

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,340
Are you trying to gamble later?

93
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,180
Three juicy drops.

94
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,820
Maybe.

95
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,460
Three juicy drops.

96
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,940
But as far as the scale, I'm going to give this a 6.7

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,580
and a 6 foot 4 on the basketball player scale.

98
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,460
Well, to counterbalance Caleb's readiness,

99
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,460
I went to the Walmart and I got just a big ass German beer.

100
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,060
- Oh my God.

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,660
- The Erdinger.

102
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,940
- Yeah.

103
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,940
- Erdinger, Weisbrau.

104
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,740
- The Erdinger, Weisbrau.

105
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,180
- The Erdinger.

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,740
- Yeah, I barely know her.

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,020
- It's a light beer.

108
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,660
It says Bavarian double maturity method,

109
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,220
which I don't know what that means.

110
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,620
I guess it's mature.

111
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,180
- Well, I think you're about to find out pretty shortly.

112
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
*takes a sip*

113
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,180
It tastes like a beer.

114
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,180
You suck- you suck at this so-

115
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,180
*laughs*

116
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,180
You suck- you suck man.

117
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
You are shit at this bro.

118
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
Tell me the notes.

119
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,180
Tell me the notes bro.

120
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,180
It's got hoppy notes, it's got um

121
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,180
Beer notes,

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,180
He's just gonna list all the ingredients. He's listing the ingredients.

123
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,180
You fucked up dude.

124
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,180
It's called- well they're in Spanish.

125
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,180
I can't believe you just listed them up.

126
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,180
what they're calling it.

127
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Because you can't read Spanish, we caught you.

128
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,580
We caught you, you don't speak that bullshit language.

129
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,180
Nobody does, they all just make it up.

130
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,180
It tastes like this.

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,140
It basically means beer, don't lie.

132
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,260
So screenshot this and turn it backwards, this is what it tastes like.

133
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,860
It's actually really good, it's really light and it's not disgusting me.

134
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,700
So it's a winner for me.

135
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,540
You do hate beer, I've realized.

136
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,180
I've switched to a, yeah, I'm a very critical beer drinker, so I've switched to a winner

137
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,180
and loser beer rating system.

138
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
them.

139
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,860
Well, you can OK that with us first, but whatever.

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,980
It's a personal decision, like a religion.

141
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,620
So this is a winner right here.

142
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,420
If you see it at the store in Mexico, go and get one.

143
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,900
I was at the Walmart in front of the beer thing, where they got all the beers, and I

144
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,100
saw this one and the dark version of it, and I was so scared of the dark.

145
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,420
I was like, I'm not going to look at it.

146
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,860
That is a vice-ass beer, the way it's reflecting light.

147
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,560
I was like, I'm not gonna like that.

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,060
It's glowing, it's literally glowing in my hand.

149
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,420
- Yeah, that's Vice AF.

150
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,780
- It's a moonbeer, essentially.

151
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,060
So yeah, I really like light beers

152
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,140
and this is a really light beer and I like it so much

153
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,780
and it is so hugely big.

154
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,460
And I like--

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,820
- Looks good, honestly, I wish I had that shit.

156
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,540
- It's a winner. - Yeah.

157
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,380
- All right, amazing.

158
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,120
- I've seen the robot beer at the,

159
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,580
they had that at the place I bought this Bud Light Orange

160
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,940
and I almost got that.

161
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
So I'm glad I can- I like it, okay, it's a thin can.

162
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
It is a thin can.

163
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
It's a quite thin can for a man to have.

164
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Um, okay, Brian?

165
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Virginia's here. Show us the beer.

166
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Well, um- I know you already took a sip,

167
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,940
which is against the rules, but it's your first time.

168
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Just don't let it happen again, please.

169
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
I, uh, didn't know that I was gonna be

170
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,940
doing beer as we drank. Also, I thought Noah was gonna

171
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,940
be in here, but now I feel trapped.

172
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Uh, so I pulled something out of my fridge that I've had

173
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,940
before, and it tastes like shit.

174
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Uh, it is berry salty.

175
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
*laughter*

176
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,340
-Oh, dear. -Fuckin' ass.

177
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,540
It's like a 3-3 guy who somehow managed to get on the court.

178
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,240
Oh, wow. So this is- so where are you going in terms of numerical scale? Where's this?

179
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Also probably 3-3.

180
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,940
-3-3 all around. -It's salty in a weird way that a beer shouldn't be.

181
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,140
-Mm-hmm. -Um...

182
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,940
And I mean, that's- that's really all you gotta say. It- it tastes weird. I don't like it.

183
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,340
-But... -Let's get the weak-ass plate guy.

184
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,440
...what I had.

185
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Yeah, where the fuck is he? Why didn't Noah join?

186
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,600
He's probably solo queuing a Valorant game and also his microphone doesn't work. He's-

187
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,160
That's right.

188
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
He's on his phone.

189
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah.

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,080
His telephone.

191
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
He's got such fucked up shit going on in his life.

192
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
We don't need to bother him with-

193
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
We don't need to burden him any further.

194
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320
Yeah.

195
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,480
Nah, I saw him walking around- he walked around the-

196
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,760
Me and Eric went to the gym today and he showed up and

197
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,600
he walked around everybody thought he was the janitor just because of the way he dresses.

198
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
[laughter]

199
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Like one of those Anatoly videos?

200
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
Yeah, it was not-

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
It's not good for him. He's having a bad day.

202
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,840
Anyway, all right, Brian, you and me gotta talk about something, man. I'm glad you're here.

203
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,900
What's that?

204
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,520
You and me have been trapped this weekend. I hope you know.

205
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah, I didn't know I was going until like about an hour ago.

206
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,600
Me and Brian, for those who don't know, our wives have worked together.

207
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:09,840
and me and Brian are being forced at vagina point to go to their boss's celebration of

208
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
their 10 year anniversary.

209
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
It's basically a labor camp.

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
My god.

211
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,280
And I was told this, she was like, "Oh, you want to go to this shit?"

212
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
And I said, "No."

213
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
And she said, "Well, you have to go."

214
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,120
And I'm thinking, "Well, if I have to go, whatever, man.

215
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
It's an anniversary party, it's gonna be two hours, right?

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
It's seven hours long.

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Get this, man!

218
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120

224
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
So I'm gonna be, it's not even like I get that two hour break in between.

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Where I'm like, oh, well I don't have to talk to people for this two hours,

226
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120

251
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,640
"When we were talking about you coming to this party."

252
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,640
"And I said, 'Oh yeah, Caleb has a really hard time talking to, like, normal people.'"

253
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640

That's the most fucked up situation I've ever heard.

267
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
How do we even get out of this?

268
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
You can't.

269
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I have to kill her.

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
That's the only option I have.

271
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
I have to kill her.

272
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
And then Spryan's lost.

273
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
You're literally fucked.

274
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,240
Well, I'm going to be mowing lawns, so I'll be alright for at least half of that.

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
She just walked in and she's looking at me.

276
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
*laughter*

277
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Yeah, I was about to say, I thought you were home alone.

278
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,240
By the way you were screaming about this, I was like

279
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
*laughter*

280
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
She's uh...

281
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
She's... I thought I was safe

282
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
because she's watching a show about

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
monkeys that she's addicted to

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
watching. She's watching this show

285
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
every night. I'm like, "Hey, you wanna watch a movie?"

286
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240

documentary about chimpanzees."

289
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,920
It's so nice when your girl has like a pacifier you can just hand her though.

290
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,160
Yeah, for a long time it was Super Mario Odyssey.

291
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,920
Yeah, dude, when a woman gets into like a video game.

292
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
Oh yeah, Harry Potter, that Harry Potter game.

293
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
It's the most amazing feeling in the world.

294
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,160
Dude, this is bad, she started playing Persona 5.

295
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,640
Yeah, I just got my girl on that too, and I'm so excited for 100 hours.

296
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,640
The thing is dude, when I play Persona 5, I'm like skipping all the cutscenes, trying to talk to the girls,

297
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,640
and she's sitting there, walking around, examining every barrel that's in every room,

298
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
and the thing comes up and says "It's just a normal barrel!"

299
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,640
And she goes "Hmm, I should probably check the next four barrels to see if it has a different text line."

300
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
She just doesn't know how to play fucking video games.

301
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
They don't have gamer brain, man.

302
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
They really don't.

303
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
They don't comprehend it.

304
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:28,640

312
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:24,020
That's gotta be the worst game ever made.

313
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,860
The same thing as like, like, any of those RPGs where you like talk to people and shit

314
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,140
and have to do random shit like Persona, but you don't even get, but they're all animals.

Yeah, it's the best, it's the best dude.

320
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,120
0% completion with the relationships with any man in the entire game. Yeah

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,820
Maxing out every single girl. Okay, so the fire

Raid a camp and she'll just like go to your house and just suck you off. That's

332
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,740
One day one one game day basically one day in game

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,740
Yes, yes you should because that's what I would fuck you.

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Yeah, yeah. Well that's actually, I think 2K16 literally starts like that.

341
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:43,740
Where you like didn't make it to the NBA, you finish college and you're playing in China.

342
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,740
You're playing somewhere overseas and then you get called up.

343
00:17:46,740 --> 00:18:00,420
the

344
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:14,300
the

345
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,600
some Starbreeze. I had, because there was a, oh, there was this discount store in North

346
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,340
Carolina. It was probably everywhere. But it had, it wasn't called Dave and Buster's, but

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,580
it had a name like that, where it was like two guys' names. Somebody might know it. But

348
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,040
I would go there, my dad would take me there for like school shopping, because you could

349
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:39,700
get everything you ever needed for like $15. And I would get full Starbreeze everything.

350
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,240
And then when I was a kid, because this is the only place I shopped, the only underwear

351
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,520
I had was money print boxers. Awesome. So I had like 15 pairs of money print boxers

352
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,040
because that was all they sold there. One really fucked up thing about Dave

353
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,440
and Buster's is the implication that someone's name is fucking Buster. That's

354
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,760
true. Someone's first name was Buster. Buster was like a you know that was a

355
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
the

356
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
the

357
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
the

358
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,760
the

359
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
the

360
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
the

361
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
the

362
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
the

363
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
the

364
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
the

365
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
the

366
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
the

367
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,760
the

368
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
the

369
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,600
It was a movie that came out on Netflix and the first 30 minutes was like

370
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,900
funny and

371
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,760
People you'd go over to people's houses to watch a movie you'd watch the first 30 minutes of Buster Scruggs

372
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,560
And then they go to the part where the guy has no arms and legs

373
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,400
Yeah

374
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,860
Yeah, that's the good part. Like you don't have to watch you the the the guy who's looking for gold that was boring

375
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,180
The guy who is just in the circus that one's boring whatever happens

376
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:15,820
Only the good one is the James Franco one where you like it's home. Yeah

377
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,560
The James Franco and the first song is the good. Oh the like water cover by Marty Robbins. Yeah, that's

378
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Like after that you don't have to watch that like you I'm there to have fun. I'm having fun

379
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,820
Why are you putting all this boring stuff in the movie? That's a good point

380
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,860
I mean, I guess it makes sense

381
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:40,220
Like they just made the first part basically like a slime video and then the rest of it is like a depressing movie

382
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,500
But just it's just so weird that I watch that shit so many times

383
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I would sit at I would sit at home and watch the first 30 minutes. I look you know

384
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
What's the first thing?

385
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,980
Like two weeks ago, I literally watched the first

386
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,140
30 minutes and when I got to the fucking odd position like this guy I was like ah shit

387
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
fuck this.

388
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,900
Yeah turn this get this off of my screen I don't I didn't this is not the way man.

389
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,900
Watch the first like 5 minutes of the prospector was like alright let's get to the good shit

390
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
let's get to the good shit.

391
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Yeah I don't I don't know.

392
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
Have they made a movie in a while?

393
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
The Coen Brothers?

394
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Um I don't think so I don't remember.

395
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
Is that like the last thing they did?

396
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Aren't they trans now?

397
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
No you're thinking of the Wachowskis.

398
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
I don't think so. I don't remember.

399
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,100
Is that like the last thing they did?

400
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,800
Aren't they trans now?

401
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
No, you're thinking of the Wachowskis.

402
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,300
Hmm.

403
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,500
I was about to ask if they made The Matrix, but that was also...

404
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,000
No, the Coen brothers did, uh...

405
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Are they black?

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,100
No Country for Old Men.

407
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,400
Probably. No Country for Old Men.

408
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,700
[laughter]

409
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
There's too many brothers, bro.

410
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,000
Yeah, get your damn brothers out of here.

411
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,520
The Coen brothers did No Country for Old Men.

412
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Okay.

413
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
And they did Fargo.

414
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Oh, they're just doing this like Fargo show.

415
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
And the big Lebowski.

416
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,240
Yeah, I haven't seen a single second of the Fargo show, but I do, I've been watching,

417
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,680
I've been re-watching Louie on your media server and the rip that you have is just straight

418
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,120
from like the FX, just somebody like recording there, it airing.

419
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,320
So it has ads on either side for like Fargo from 2014.

420
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,040
So I have to see that fucking guy from The Hobbit just like sitting there staring into

421
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
the screen.

422
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

423
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

424
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

425
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,660
I want to watch the Louie, which I guess is the price I pay for watching that show

426
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,120
Louie's funny. Did you ever watch lucky Louie?

427
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,320
No, I never watched lucky Louie. I didn't see a Horace and Pete either

428
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,840
Why would say the horse of Pete but lucky I my dad used to watch lucky Louie when I was like six years old

429
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,920
Howard the fuckle I was Louise first show he did he did a sitcom on I think HBO

430
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Yeah, and I guess it was fine, but it was they do an episode of Louie about it

431
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,780
Yeah, like where he's it's so stupid. It's like such a it's such a like

432
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:12,840
Yes, the whole episode is he's doing this show and he's like, it's just it's so fucked up

433
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,100
I'm had this fake wife and this fake friend and I'm living this fake life

434
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:25,180
Like he's describing acting and the solution for him was to his real-life solution was just make a show about his life

435
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,120
I guess but it's just such a funny like

436
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,020
Gripe to have with having a television show is like I have to act

437
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,340
Yeah

438
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:42,680
Yeah, I think it was the same fake wife and Louie and lucky Louie, right Pamela Adlon

439
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,420
Yeah, Pamela had lungs and like everything he makes yeah, I never watched that show that they did together

440
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:54,520
The show her like FX show. I heard it was really good though, but I can remember what it was called

441
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:02,080
I never saw that never saw baskets, but I heard baskets was good. I've really just been watching I

442
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Only watch shows that I used to watch when I was a kid and then I recently watched the bear

443
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,560
But I don't I haven't watched anything in the last like 10 years between those two

444
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
Mmm, the bear is so stupid

445
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:26,780
How long how much have you watched of the bear I've watched all of the bear Oh bears good the bears really good

446
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:31,100
Okay, I love watching things that I don't like it's a bad habit, but I still do it

447
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,540
I've watched so many shitty enemies, but I

448
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,420
so

449
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,420
My girlfriend's on the train

450
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,700
coming out of Ridgewood towards the city and

451
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,740
She noticed that the main guy from the bear was on the train and he had like his like cap down

452
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,620
And like had a mask on it was like clearly trying to look like

453
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,780
incognito

454
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,220
not trying to have anybody recognize him and

455
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,720
Some girl comes up and asked him like hey, are you the guy and he's like yeah, yeah

456
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
Meanwhile, he's wearing a full fucking chef's outfit

457
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
*laughter*

458
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
*laughter*

459
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
*laughter*

460
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
*laughter*

461
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
*laughter*

462
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,640
*laughter*

463
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
*laughter*

464
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
*laughter*

465
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
*laughter*

466
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
*laughter*

467
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
*laughter*

468
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
*laughter*

469
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
*laughter*

470
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
*laughter*

471
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,560
I'd walk around with all the makeup on all the time. Yeah, just like pictures of me leaving the gym paparazzi photos

472
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Yeah, just like cap fully down

473
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,920
Yeah, yeah doing a video where I'm yelling at the paparazzi like you're stalking me. You're fucking crazy

474
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,880
cling on makeup

475
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:58,360
God that is just so fucking funny

476
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
This is so awesome dude, I love that.

477
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Why do you hate the bear, Brian?

478
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,360
It's a nonsense show, it doesn't make any fucking sense.

479
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,360
The first season, uh, if anyone who hasn't seen it, go fuck yourself.

480
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Uh, first season is literally just, like, he's having this like, heart-breaking thing where his brother killed himself and took out a big loan.

481
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,360
And then, like, the end of it is just that his brother hid all the money in some spaghetti sauce.

482
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,360
And then they found the money? And then they're happy?

483
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Like, you still owe that money!

484
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,360
And to be fair, anything with the tone that you're using would sound very stupid.

485
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:40,360
You're just saying, "Yeah, and then this happened? Wait, so he's his godfather and it does him a favor?"

486
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
I'm not gonna lie.

487
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,360
And then he dies and then his son goes to Italy? What the hell is this movie?

488
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,360
$300,000 worth of money, and then he shoves it into fucking tomato canes, and then his brother finds it.

489
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
it. That's the whole first season. Well there's a lot of stuff in between. Mattie Matheson

490
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,120
says funny ass shit. I watched the first season like twice, one with myself and one with my

491
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,800
girlfriend and I didn't get the ending either time. I was like why did he do that? And why

492
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:22,120
did he kill himself? Because it was funny. It was cool. Stuff in movies and tv shows

493
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,480
should literally the only thing that screenwriters should be thinking

494
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,400
okay i wrote this a this this this part the first part

495
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,000
what should happen next whatever the coolest funniest thing is

496
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,360
so on and so forth eventually you get a tv show you ever watch oceans the

497
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,040
oceans movies yeah ocean either 12 or 13

498
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,720
either 12 or 13 they're like we need to sneak into this shit

499
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,040
how do we do it let's get a contortionist from china

500
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,760
to hide inside of a box and sneak that is awesome that makes yeah but that makes sense

501
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,960
the getting it makes sense to hide money in anything getting alone hiding it in sauce

502
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,920
just rob a bank man well they gotta take boxes into banks

503
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:21,480
is you you net gain money in that regard this is taking out a loan you still owe the money

504
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,920
and now you just found the money in spaghetti sauce now he just covered

505
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:34,600
you're telling me you're telling me patrick and spongebob

506
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:43,160
magic conch they got a magic conch and squidward don't want none of this we don't want it he don't

507
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:50,760
want it right? But then, now he's all hungry he's gotta eat a fly. Who's he coming to ask?

508
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,560
The conch. That's how you sound Brian with your dumb ass.

509
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,240
Ok now that we're talking about it, it makes more sense that maybe he thought that if he

510
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,360
just killed himself the loan would go away. Basically.

511
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,960
Why would he do that though? Well that's true, everything goes away for

512
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,880
you if you die. He's stupid. He's just like a stupid guy.

513
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
He is a dumb guy.

514
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,800
Yeah, they show that he's stupid in the entire thing.

515
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,360
He does that thing that every stupid...

516
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,600
You know how you know a character is stupid in a movie or a television show?

517
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,200
When they talk to somebody, especially their younger brother, and they go, "You think you're

518
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
better than me?"

519
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,640
That's how you know this guy is the dumbest villain guy in the entire...

520
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
That could possibly be.

521
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,660
As soon as someone says, "You think you're better than me?"

522
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,080
They are going to die.

523
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,560
They are going to lose.

524
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
There's no way that you win after saying that line.

525
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,600
Yeah, that's what happens in a lot of us in our Valorant games.

526
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
That's what we always do in those games.

527
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,600
When we're winning by a lot and then someone types "Hey, nice job fucking pussy" and then

528
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,880
we immediately lose every single game that ever happens in.

529
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,560
Yeah that's awesome man.

530
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,360
I really wish, I wish that I had started playing competitive video games when I was a lot younger

531
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,340
because I just am too shy.

532
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,740
If I'm losing or somebody does something that really makes me mad, I have never said a single

533
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,620
thing to anybody.

534
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,820
Well they make you be a pussy now because you'll get banned if you say anything rude

535
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
in competitive games.

536
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,220
Well that's the truth, I don't really know where the line is there.

537
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,540
Yeah it's not like Twitter.

538
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Yeah like there's no...

539
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
It's moved a lot.

540
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,460
It has, they've been moving the goalposts a lot.

541
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,100
On Brian specifically.

542
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,620
Brian would be an expert at this.

543
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,380
Last night we were playing some game and this poor guy, this really nice guy was like, he

544
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:48,580
was giving really amazing comms, he was saying, he was like helping us out with that, and then

545
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,500
nobody had said a single word the entire game except for this guy just saying like "oh he's

546
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,340
on your left, he's on your right" only person comming on the entire team.

547
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,700
Brian says "man I don't want to hear another fucking word out of you until you're not bottom

548
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,700
frag anymore."

549
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,700
*laughter*

550
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,700
I'm playing with this psycho?

551
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,700
It's all encouragement man.

552
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
If he wants to talk, he has to earn it.

553
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
It was like two rounds into the game,

554
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
he had one kill, you had three.

555
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
No, it was not two rounds into the game.

556
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
This was like eight rounds.

557
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
And you can't be calling plays if you're bottom of the leaderboard man.

558
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Listen, I was also there.

559
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
I was also there.

560
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
It was like six rounds into the game,

561
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
and as soon as Brian said that,

562
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
the next like three rounds, like that guy caught up to Brian.

563
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,500
to Brian. Look at look at my effect. You can't have it both ways. You can't take credit for

564
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,660
that. I just said it. It's encouragement. I don't think that reads as encouragement

565
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:44,580
to that guy. I think Brian's insanity when he's playing online video games, it's so much

566
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,020
funnier on CS2 because it does that little like filter on your voice, like the radio

567
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:54,780
filter. And there's that thing where he mutes on Discord and you only hear him from the radio.

568
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,140
It's just really funny to me when he's just like chirping at a guy's a little bit to be

569
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,540
like yeah yeah what do you think of a

570
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,260
person I'll give you two guesses and I

571
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,060
guess it's like wait I two guesses it

572
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,100
could be yes or no it's like yeah you're

573
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:13,940
stupid what are you talking about?

574
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,700
everybody's pretty fucking confused by

575
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,780
by how mean you are in those lobbies man

576
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,900
you have no patience for strangers no

577
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,900
No, absolutely not. I love my friends and I like to be nice to them.

578
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,900
Which means that everyone else who is not my friends...

579
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Fuck, they get the axe.

580
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Yup.

581
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Fucking, absolutely down and dirty, early Modern Warfare 2 lobby style.

582
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,900
See, that's what I mean. I never played Modern Warfare...

583
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,900
I played Modern Warfare 2, but I don't think I had a headset.

584
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,900
So I just played on, like, my... out of my Xbox speaker, so I couldn't talk back.

585
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,500
And so I thought it was funny when people screamed in the lobby, but I never did that

586
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,540
Yeah, I don't get the bug. I think I always found it also really funny

587
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,220
But I don't think I would ever find myself like caring enough for him

588
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,580
Mdvd nw2 match to just be out someone

589
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,260
Call duty sucks. Yeah

590
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:15,580
Not even like CS right now like we're playing ranked and everything, but I don't I don't care enough

591
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
So we're like, "Oh my god, I'm so pissed."

592
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
No, that's- no, you don't need to care.

593
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
It's just more about the yelling.

594
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,020
About the getting mad at them.

595
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,520
You know?

596
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
You just like the screaming and yelling.

597
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Well, not the screaming and yelling,

598
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
but I like the getting mad at them part.

599
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,020
It's very funny to get in someone's head.

600
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
In a video game.

601
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,020
Who is up with you devilish two?

602
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,020
[Chuckles]

603
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Well, I did play competitive video games when I was young.

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,020
I actually agree with this.

605
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Yeah, it is very funny.

606
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,820
these poor people they get home from the hardest job ever

607
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
every single one of them works on an oil rig

608
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
and then they log on and say

609
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,320
"hey"

610
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,820
"no, they're all 15, the worst thing in their life is homework"

611
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,020
"yeah, homework's hard, how are you gonna do homework right now?"

612
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
they get in

613
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
"they need to be humble"

614
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,020
"my whole job is homework, bro"

615
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
"that is so true"

616
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
"I fucking..."

617
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,020
until they pull up with the social studies

618
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
and then you say

619
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
"not me, dawg"

620
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,020
"I don't want nothing to do with this social studies shit"

621
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
I would, oh my god, if I was a teacher

622
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,020
a teacher I would be dropping bombs on you in social studies class you wouldn't

623
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,220
know what to do with this shit I mean one wrong you could drop well I'm not a

624
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,700
teacher so I don't have my curriculum in front of me the fucking social studies

625
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,620
what do you see in soldier studies Wow this guy's a lot of school I went to

626
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,220
school I didn't have social studies I don't know what that is social studies

627
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,700
man this was let me tell you what this was the hardest class in the universe

628
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
the

629
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
the

630
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
the

631
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
the

632
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
the

633
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
the

634
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
the

635
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,720
the

636
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
the

637
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
the

638
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
the

639
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,720
the

640
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,720
the

641
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
the

642
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,320
And they'd say is this a good map or a bad is this a real map or a fake map?

643
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,100
He'd say that's a real map. I don't think you went to real school. I

644
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:24,040
Went to a charter school. So it probably wasn't that good of a social studies program. I'm gonna be honest weren't known for the social studies

645
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,240
We were more known for recess. We had a really strong really strong recess competitive

646
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,520
A lot of a lot of people coming out of school known for recess

647
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Yeah, we sent a lot of people to Harvard for recess, a lot of people were studying recess at my school.

648
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
I fucked him with recess.

649
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,720
Me too, man. I loved it. Did every school have this?

650
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Our entire recess thing, we were in an old hardware company because it was a charter school, so it wasn't like a real school building.

651
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,720
It was like this old hardware company, it used to be a warehouse.

652
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:05,940
They turned it into a school, but the recess thing was just the parking lot of the company

653
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,520
that they fenced in and put two soccer nets and a basketball hoop in.

654
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,600
And there was one corner where all of the cool kids hung out, which was just in one corner

655
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
of this thing.

656
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,320
Did you guys have that too, where there was a secret corner in your recess room?

657
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
No.

658
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,280
No, not that.

659
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,160
We actually had the opposite, where we went to school in the parking lot and then had recess

660
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,960
in the old hardware building. Oh wow. Yeah. The old hardware. It was awesome. That's the

661
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,480
difference between Texas and North Carolina I guess. We had a field. I played football

662
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,480
every day at lunch and our coach was named Tom Brady. Stop making shit up. Stop. Don't

663
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:54,360
just come on here and lie. This is going to be a joke to you. I make money off this. This

664
00:36:54,360 --> 00:37:02,360
This is the only thing I have. You can't come on and say, "My coach was Tom Brady, my music teacher was Michael Jackson."

665
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
You can't say this shit to me.

666
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
We actually did have a fiancé.

667
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
Completely Tom Brady.

668
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
He was 60 years old.

669
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Just leather, tan skin as fuck.

670
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,360
From Texas.

671
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
And one time he saw me at Luby's with my grandma.

672
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
And he said, "Boy, you eating that green jello?"

673
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,360
green jello?

674
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
*laughter*

675
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
*laughter*

676
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
*laughter*

677
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
He would ask me that every day after that.

678
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
He'd be like, "You eating

679
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,360
your green jello?"

680
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
*laughter*

681
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
Lubies is a place you can only go with your grandma.

682
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Yeah, my grandma loved Lubies.

683
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Oh my god, that was the

684
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
after church special, dude.

685
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
What the hell's Lubies?

686
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
It's like a golden corral, or like...

687
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Like a buffet style

688
00:37:50,360 --> 00:38:04,400
That is actually a persona

689
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,000
There's a persona for line poorly translated

690
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,320
Social rank increased one one tier for yeah, you ate the green Tom Brady

691
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,040
You ate the green jello and said nothing

692
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
*laughing*

693
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
*laughing*

694
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Why you eating green jello?

695
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
You were eating that green jello like it was

696
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
gonna make me big and strong

697
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
*laughing*

698
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Like it was vegetables?

699
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
You were eating that green jello

700
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
*laughing*

701
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
You gotta respect him

702
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Yeah that's the goat, that's the goat man

703
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
That's part of the TB, TB whatever

704
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
What's his brand called?

705
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
TB12

706
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,640
TB12, they had a store, they had a TB12 store in Boston and when me and Adam went to Boston

707
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,560
like two years ago or a year and a half ago or some shit, we went into that store and they have like a

708
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,840
like a sports trainer person there who's like you can come in and talk about like what you want to

709
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:06,920
do and I came in and I talked to her for an hour about wanting to dunk and I was like yeah yeah I

710
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:22,600
the

711
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
So that's how I know that it's not true.

712
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
That none of that shit works.

713
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Is that they tried to sell me on Dunkin.

714
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Dunkin Donuts.

715
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Did you ever do like dunk training?

716
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh I did dunk training, yeah.

717
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
At my best, I could get

718
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I could get

719
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
like here.

720
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Ram here. At my very best.

721
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
That sounds pretty good.

722
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I was like 175 pounds. I trained plyometrics every day.

723
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
In high school.

724
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
So like a 5'4" 5'3" guy?

725
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,880
That's fucking insane.

726
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,640
Yeah, it's pretty good for somebody who's, you know, pushing six foot.

727
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,140
Right.

728
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,640
I always have really short arms.

729
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,720
I have short arms, so I was just like...

730
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,840
And my upper body was just like so scrawny because I was trying to lose enough weight

731
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,080
but make my legs strong enough that I could somehow defy God and jump high.

732
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,840
And I don't think I can grab room anymore.

733
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,160
I can touch the backboard, but that's it.

734
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm so sorry, man.

735
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Did you ever dunk, Brian?

736
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,840
I feel like you're right at the dunking height.

737
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,200
I did dunk training with a couple of my friends for a while.

738
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,280
We were just doing like pure plyo, fucking, like lots of jump training.

739
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,800
I never could really get it up there enough.

740
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Would just slam my fist into the rim.

741
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,640
Yeah, that's getting, stuffing yourself is...

742
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,320
That's why I only ever would try to dunk with like a Nerf ball.

743
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,240
because I knew I couldn't jump high enough to actually try with actual basketball.

744
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,000
So I knew that if I tried with the basketball, I would end up like

745
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,480
hitting it so hard because I would be so excited.

746
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,640
Fall backwards, break my head open, humpty-dumpty on the ground.

747
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,320
- I feel like six more months, maybe. But then I also,

748
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,280
I don't think I would have any use for it. You know?

749
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,680
- Dunking?

750
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,960
- Like I would just get blown.

751
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,000
- It's not like a skill that you use in other, it's only for basketball. What do you mean?

752
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,760
Yeah, like even if I went to go play basketball do these people would just they would just knock me down

753
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,240
Just don't know you get a fast break. I saw this happen many times you get a fast break. It's a guy

754
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,520
It's usually like a kind of tall white guy who is like this is my chance to dunk

755
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,880
He's not he's not gonna you know, he's not gonna posterize somebody but on the fast break

756
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,800
It's it's 1v0 on the end of the court. He goes up does like the worst dunk you've ever seen in your life

757
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
That's what you could have done. That would have been your peak.

758
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
That would have been it, yeah.

759
00:41:47,800 --> 00:42:08,800
For me, I wanted to get so athletically strong that I was like showing up to the court, my legs are like Donkey Kong barrels, the rest of my body is completely emaciated, and then I like go up, double pump hammer on somebody. I wanted to do that so badly, I would dream about it.

760
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
You wanted to be like a video game character, basically.

761
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,200
basically. Yeah, yeah, I wanted to completely use a special attack on just these random

762
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,400
guys at the basketball court. I need to start playing basketball again. I dream of being

763
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,040
a footballer, but I don't have the eyesight for it. Growing up in Arizona, around the

764
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,240
time I was playing basketball, everyone would love to pass the ball and then say Steve Nash.

765
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:48,320
damn wait that is so funny

766
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,280
it doesn't roll off the tongue like Kobe does

767
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,840
have you already talked about rex's new glasses?

768
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,360
no no somehow somehow we have not they look beautiful thank you what's up with

769
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,680
this man are they going dark? that's what I thought no they're not

770
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,960
transitions but there I went to this like glasses place in Soho and they

771
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:21,720
charged me like $400 for lenses I know I accepted that I'm getting old and dying

772
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,800
and that I I've needed glasses since I was like 16 and I'm just aging that's

773
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,800
just something that he had to do years ago.

774
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Yeah, but I...

775
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
It definitely gets worse as you age, right?

776
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,800
Right, it gets worse as you age, and I'm like, "I can do this, it's no problem."

777
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,800
And then I finally got them like two weeks ago.

778
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Is it $400 like how much glasses cost? I've never had them.

779
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,800
They're expensive, but if you have like insurance and stuff, it's a little cheaper.

780
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
I've only used like readers.

781
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,020
I mean, I guess I don't know like a good frame of reference to like how much it would cost in the US

782
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,880
But these are not I think these ran me like 100 bucks tops

783
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,120
No, they're okay. I

784
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:13,160
Have a bad astigmatism, which means I see like streamers when I look at lights like they're like really like blurry

785
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,240
And I work on the fucking computer

786
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,920
So that's bad. Yeah

787
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,600
Yeah, I think I went and got my eyes tested and I had a stigmatism, but it felt like such a like

788
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,760
Maybe I just was making it up

789
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
as they were giving me the test like

790
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,360
Stigmatism is such a it's because it's not like things are blurry as much as like your eyes

791
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,860
They're actually really hard to be be like sick like sure about a result

792
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,200
You get out of like that the machine because yeah, cuz you're trying like I'm trying so hard. I'm like I

793
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,480
That's probably an a every time they do a test. I'm like trying to hurt and my eyes are watering like I'm crying

794
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,080
I can't even I can't see nothing because there's water in my eyes

795
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,800
So I'm basically blind basically

796
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,320
One time to the eye doctor, but they gave I think the reason I never went back is when you leave

797
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:09,400
Or at some point they give you these eye drops that make you completely blind basically for like yeah

798
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,820
Our and I just hated that I think I got home and I was trying to do something and I was like this sucks

799
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Yeah, I haven't gotten an eye exam since high school.

800
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Not needing glasses.

801
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
You've been stuck with the same prescription?

802
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Basically. I mean, I got a new prescription, but yeah.

803
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,040
How do you get a new prescription without a thing?

804
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
They give you an eye exam.

805
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,040
Oh, you said you haven't had one since high school.

806
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,040
Yeah, until I went and got these glasses.

807
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
Oh, I'm seeing now.

808
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,040
Yes. Which is what I said after I got my glasses.

809
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,260
I was trying to get new glasses like now three months ago

810
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:53,040
Went in for the appointment and the whole time the dudes doing like a one two one two shit

811
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,900
And then at the very end he's like wow that's crazy

812
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:02,080
Your eyesight is actually way better than it was last time like what that's weird. I

813
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,400
Don't know how that would happen

814
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,920
And then he just keeps on going as a test. That's weird. You want to double check like yeah, okay, whatever

815
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,120
He asked you if you want to double check?

816
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,560
To make sure that like the shit that I said was good was good. I don't know.

817
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,360
Go outside and then, um, he's like, "Oh, and make sure you fix his address too."

818
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,680
And I was like, "What? Like, what do you mean? I told you my address whenever I got in here."

819
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,480
Uh, start talking to the guy. He had someone else's chart pulled up the whole time.

820
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,920
Oh my god.

821
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,480
A completely different person measuring me against...

822
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,880
So I'm terrified of using that prescription because I don't know what the fuck he actually put down.

823
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,880
Yeah, I think the guy's like...

824
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,380
Yeah, some like 60 year old fat Italian guy

825
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,880
just going off about how bad computers are.

826
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,880
When you pass like 20, 21, like you kind of don't need a new prescription anymore.

827
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
Is that true?

828
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
That is not true.

829
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,880
I think you get way worse as you get older.

830
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,880
I think it gets worse every year, every year you age.

831
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,880
I think the last pair of glasses that I had before these, I had for like 5 years.

832
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,880
That just means that you were lazy bones.

833
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:18,880
No, I didn't need new glasses and I got a prescription and it was basically the same prescription.

834
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
You're lying.

835
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
I'm not lying.

836
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,880
That's like when people are like, "Yeah, I didn't brush my teeth for seven years and I didn't get a cavity."

837
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
That's a totally different thing.

838
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Which is fine, by the way. That's fine.

839
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Yeah, it is totally fine.

840
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,880
I brush my teeth once a day.

841
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,880
Jow.

842
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
Ish.

843
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,920
It's so hard because I wake up and I immediately start eating and drinking

844
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,360
And what am I supposed to do stop doing that - oh, I need to go brush my teeth

845
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,760
But I have half of a donut in my mouth the other half in my hand

846
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,300
There's no way that I'm gonna put an end to this party to go fucking

847
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,360
Yesterday I was like taking a shower. I was like, I gotta brush my teeth. I was like, bro

848
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,040
I need to do I need to drink my coffee in a sec as well

849
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,140
So coffee will hurt more than coffee is poison when you've had when you brush your brush your teeth in the shower

850
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,240
That's the only reason I do it

851
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:25,920
Yeah

852
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,720
What the fuck?

853
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,020
I piss in the shower!

854
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,520
No!

855
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,020
I might as well be-

856
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,520
No!

857
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Yeah, dude!

858
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,020
What's your problem?

859
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,520
No!

860
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
That's a bad thing to do, man.

861
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,520
You're pissing, brushing your teeth.

862
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:40,520
As long as you piss before you start, like, lathering soap on you, it's fine.

863
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,520
I wash my pee, I'm not an animal.

864
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,520
If it's the last fucking thing you do in the shower, that's nasty.

865
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Yeah, nobody should do that.

866
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,520
Pee should not be- it all goes to the same ocean.

867
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,520
It's either in the toilet, or outdoors.

868
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,520
No other places.

869
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,920
doors you're killing plants. You don't pee in the sink?

870
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,040
Well that that's like basically a toilet but it just doesn't have a lid.

871
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,920
The shower is a toilet. Yeah dude. The shower is a place for cleaning. The shower

872
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,920
fucking removes stink from you and what is the most clean thing

873
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,240
that comes out of your body man? I'd put pee against spit any day of the week.

874
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,520
Earwax? Earwax is disgusting. Ew get that away from me.

875
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,640
Pee? Bring it closer. I like pee. You don't you don't mean this.

876
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,920
Yeah, you're lying right now.

877
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,560
You're lying.

878
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,640
You're being excessive.

879
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,440
Rex lied about the Tom Brady thing, now you're lying about drinking.

880
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,280
That is, no, that is completely true.

881
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,560
You lied.

882
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,680
Just admit you lied, man.

883
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,000
It's okay.

884
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,960
I wish.

885
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,760
We'll delete this.

886
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,720
You lied about Tom Brady was our football coach.

887
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,720
Just admit you lied and tell us your real name, Michael Jordan.

888
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,960
Well, that would at least be funny because it's the wrong sport.

889
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,520
The fact that it's in football and his name is Tom Brady is the reason why it is a lie.

890
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,760
I'm giving you Pinocchios.

891
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,120
I'm throwing Pinocchios at you.

892
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,400
It is 100% true.

893
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,160
It's 100% Pinocchio.

894
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,400
It's a 0% on PolitiFact.

895
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,080
This is not a true story.

896
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,600
I looked it up on KnowYourMeme.

897
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,240
It's not true.

898
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,040
It doesn't exist.

899
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,840
It doesn't exist.

900
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,080
Do you actually have capes?

901
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,200
Do you have red superhero capes behind you?

902
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,560
That's a blanket.

903
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,120
That would not surprise me, honestly, if you owned a cape.

904
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,320
That is a blanket.

905
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,240
You've looked at a cape on mine before.

906
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,200
You've looked at capes.

907
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,400
I have never looked at a cape.

908
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,600
You have looked at capes.

909
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:28,440
I've been looking, excuse me, all day looking at swords and looking at crazy Naruto headbands.

910
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,720
You definitely have considered a cape in your life.

911
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
I've never considered any of that.

912
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,640
You need to wear a cape to be a capesback.

913
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,120
I'm not wearing a cape.

914
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,480
Oh, you are, George, by the way.

915
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,080
You would wear a cape, though.

916
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,360
If you had a nice cape, you would wear it.

917
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,040
What is a nice cape?

918
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,040
You tell me, cape expert.

919
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,040
You would know.

920
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,880
I don't know anything about them.

921
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
You sound so...

922
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
You haven't even begun to delve into that.

923
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,120
You're being defensive because you do like capes.

924
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,120
You haven't begun.

925
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
It's coming.

926
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,000
As soon as you hit 30, you're gonna get a full cape selection.

927
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,400
You'll have a clothes closet, a cape closet.

928
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,400
You're gonna pick your clothes.

929
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
It would be pretty fun to walk around in a cape, I can't lie.

930
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Now that you're saying it.

931
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,400
Of course you think that.

932
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Of course you think that.

933
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
With a nice like bronze clasp with a little chain between it.

934
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,400
See, he's invented capes.

935
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
He's literally invented them.

936
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
Wait, wait, wait.

937
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,400
I'm gonna talk to him next.

938
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,400
He was like, "Yeah, I got a couple capes on the way."

939
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,400
Me?

940
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,400
I would never...

941
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,980
I would never even think to wear a cape. He's thinking about it actively as we speak. He's daydreaming about a cape

942
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,400
Do you care anything that you put on your body kill?

943
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,240
clothing wise

944
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,560
It was like Caleb has some tie-dye shirt oak swag headphones

945
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:43,320
Bagel bunny hat my bagel bunny hat shout out to baby bunny. These are some of the best gluten-free bagels in the universe

946
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
I see.

947
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,240
I have a watch on.

948
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,600
I wear a watch.

949
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,040
I have mismatched socks.

950
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,600
One is grey and one is white.

951
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,520
Yeah, I care about what I put on my body.

952
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,280
How about you, Mr. South of the Border T-shirt that I gave you?

953
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,840
This is my favorite shirt.

954
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
It's so comfy.

955
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
I knew it.

956
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
I'm a fan.

957
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,560
I knew something about South of the Border made me say he's going to like this.

958
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:11,120
He's going to like this T-shirt from this racist gas station.

959
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,440
I have a South of the Border shirt too.

960
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,640
I never wear it because it's like I don't want to be walking around with this shit on it

961
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,320
Yeah, you don't want to be twinning with me. Well, no, I don't want to be walking around you hate to do with me

962
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,960
Just admit it. You never turn with me. I would love to I wish that I got the same shirt you have that was cool

963
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,440
mine says

964
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,940
It has their their racist mascot and it says Pedro

965
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:41,440
Pedro's forecast and it has every single state with like a forecast on top of it, but all the forecasts a shit

966
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,200
It's like the weather's shit in the entire nation.

967
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,600
That's awesome, why would you not wear that?

968
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,560
Mostly because of Pedro.

969
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,120
Is it racist?

970
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,120
It's...

971
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:58,720
Hold on, hold on.

972
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,880
It's definitely pushing it.

973
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,840
Wait, what's that on your back?

974
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,480
Is that a fucking math problem?

975
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,920
No, it's this...

976
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:19,040
in Seattle. Some kind of radio station. This guy. He's fine. That's awesome. That's fucking

977
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:26,720
awesome. Oh, okay. I got the, I got the okay. Pedro's forecast. Pull it up. Pull it up. That's

978
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:35,440
fucking ironic. Partly shitty. This is something that I see that would, I would see Rex wearing.

979
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm sure. That's why I'm-

980
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,440
I need less t-shirts. I don't like wearing funny t-shirts anymore. I think I'm past funny t-shirts.

981
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,440
I mean I'm wearing just a Uniclone plain t-shirt.

982
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:51,440
I didn't mean that. Just wearing a blank t-shirt that you bought off Amazon is the way to dress.

983
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,440
I pretty much wear a white t-shirt most days that I got from Telco.

984
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,440
That's like- it was damaged and that's why they sell it there. It's like some Hanes t-shirt.

985
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,600
I just like I like normal clothes now man

986
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,360
I'm gonna get I'm gonna be one of these guys who wears like a $4 t-shirt and a

987
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,820
$5,000 pair of jeans that he has to sit in the bathtub to make fit, right?

988
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,200
Raw denim

989
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Yep, that is what that's called

990
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:22,720
Yeah, you could be a rod that I'm guy I could see that I could see myself

991
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,080
Love taking a bath. So it's kind of like killing

992
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,240
I'll take one tonight if you want me to

993
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,240
I love that.

994
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:36,240
The idea that I have a pair of clothes where I have to bath, I'm telling my wife, like,

995
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,240
no, you don't understand.

996
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,240
I have to be in there for four hours watching YouTube videos to make my jeans fit good.

997
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,440
Wait, that's a way to get out of it.

998
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,920
The Saturday thing.

999
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,960
Get raw denim today and then by Saturday, when you get them, you're like, I gotta be

1000
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
in this.

1001
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,520
That means I need to have some reason why I have to wear them on Sunday.

1002
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,800
I need like a denim convention to go to.

1003
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,800
I have church on Sunday, I have to survive with a denim jeans.

1004
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,800
You cannot wear denim to church.

1005
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,800
You cannot wear denim to church.

1006
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,560
My kind of cool church is I go to maybe.

1007
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,680
Yeah, those are blasphemous churches.

1008
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,440
What's wrong with wearing denim to church?

1009
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Sunday best.

1010
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,120
Sunday best, you need to be full, full light colored suit, praising God.

1011
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
Yeah, yeah.

1012
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,120
It's seersucker.

1013
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
He's worried about church.

1014
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,120
Take that back.

1015
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,120
Come on, man.

1016
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Take that back.

1017
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
That's ridiculous.

1018
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:26,840
Take that back.

1019
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,680
That's ridiculous.

1020
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,180
Hold on, dude.

1021
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,920
Take that shit back.

1022
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
I'm wearing shorts.

1023
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,120
I'm wearing this t-shirt.

1024
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,320
For the entire week.

1025
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,720
I haven't showered.

1026
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,420
That's why I'm showing up to church.

1027
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,320
That is how I always show up to church.

1028
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, you know what you should do?

1029
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,520
You should stop bathing.

1030
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,620
For the next couple days, Caleb.

1031
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,620
And stink max.

1032
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,120
To keep people away from you at the event.

1033
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,920
You keep bringing up stink maxing.

1034
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,620
Like once every couple weeks you bring up stink maxing like this is a real thing.

1035
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,900
It's going around.

1036
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,100
It is a real thing.

1037
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:58,900
It's a real thing.

1038
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,420
This is not a thing that men should be doing.

1039
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,140
It's going around.

1040
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:08,100
You should be forcefully stinky as like a force field to keep people away from you and from interacting with you.

1041
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,220
I'm already bald.

1042
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,260
I have that one... nobody wants to come near me.

1043
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,460
We talked about this last week.

1044
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,860
I ruin every restaurant I walk into with my head.

1045
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,860
They should make a hat that's made out of magnifying glasses.

1046
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,900
They should wear...

1047
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,260
And then you can like...

1048
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:22,740
Oh yeah.

1049
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,660
Have a ghosting scalp.

1050
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,460
I have like aphids crawling around my head like a basil plant.

1051
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,460
Yeah.

1052
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,460
No, it wouldn't burn your scalp.

1053
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,460
The sun would reflect off of your scalp and then shoot out and light things on fire.

1054
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Oh, that's a pretty good idea.

1055
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
Yeah.

1056
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,460
Beautiful. You gotta oil it up a little bit first.

1057
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:53,460
Yeah, I wanna go to one of those barbers where they shave your head and then they cover you in some green slime and then they rip it off and then they crack your back.

1058
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,460
and then make it

1059
00:56:55,460 --> 00:57:00,340
Yeah, I want to go to one of these, I think it's like in Turkey, it's like a full service

1060
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,220
barber where they like shave you and then they like crack your back and massage you and shit.

1061
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:08,820
I'm scared of the barber, I don't know what to ask for anymore.

1062
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,780
I haven't been to a barber in a long time.

1063
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,700
I want to go to one this Friday and I don't know what to ask for, I don't know what to

1064
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,700
say.

1065
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,700
Probably at the Hitler News.

1066
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:24,660
I talked to a girl the other day and guys, take this from me because I talked to one,

1067
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,940
Do not they are done with the with the hair on top short on the sides. They don't like it anymore guys. Yeah, I

1068
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,700
Mean, that's been over 2013

1069
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:41,940
She was complaining. She was she was she was like, why doesn't why do no guys have short on the top long on the sides?

1070
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:49,580
Beautiful is that what they like now Briar Tuck is hot now. Yeah, that's the new thing

1071
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,660
I'm gonna get this shaved.

1072
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,660
See, but you're gonna do this thing that

1073
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:00,660
that ol' Edie Modica doesn't like, man.

1074
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,660
I'm gonna get this- I'm gonna get this shaved.

1075
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,660
Is that- is that what she was saying?

1076
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:06,660
Yeah, yeah, you have no chance with Edie.

1077
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,660
No, but-

1078
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,660
It's a shame.

1079
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,660
What if I get an undercut as well?

1080
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,660
You don't want an under- you- you should get

1081
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,660
uh, steps.

1082
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,660
Yeah!

1083
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,660
You should get the Nike

1084
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,660
symbol kinda shaved into the back of your head.

1085
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:30,460
your head. No, you should get the Edgar. Yeah. So dope with the Edgar dude. I'm not going

1086
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,100
to get the Edgar. I'm not going to show up to my Mexican barber in Mexico and be like,

1087
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,780
can I get the Edgar? You should get my mom. You just say, give me the haircut that you

1088
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:44,540
give most other people. You have a female barber? I think it's going to be a female

1089
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:50,300
barber. Bro, let's go into sports clips. I'm not going to. You don't have a barber bro,

1090
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,300
You have a beautician, I hate to tell you.

1091
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm going to a place that has a plasma powerhouse.

1092
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,100
Do they put on football when you're getting your hair trimmed?

1093
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,700
I haven't been to this barber in my entire life.

1094
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,700
I'm going there for the first time in my life.

1095
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,300
Wait, is...

1096
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,300
Sorry, I just got distracted.

1097
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,800
Somebody sent a very racist message in the chat, guys.

1098
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,100
Somebody says "deports clips".

1099
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,400
Come on, that is not funny.

1100
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,300
That is racist.

1101
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,000
They fucking cooked his ass, oh my goodness.

1102
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,700
Did you cook them? Yeah, you did. But no.

1103
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,700
That is not, that's not gonna fly.

1104
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,300
No, knockouts. That's the, that's the like hooters haircut place, right?

1105
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,900
Knockouts? Do you guys have that?

1106
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900
No, what?

1107
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,900
I'm pretty sure, I think it's knockouts. It's like hooters.

1108
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,900
So it's like women in tops?

1109
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,900
Yeah, and they're in like very tiny referee uniforms and they give you haircuts.

1110
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:47,900
And it's the worst haircuts you could get because they're not like,

1111
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,900
We're not hired because we're good at cutting hair.

1112
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,900
Yeah.

1113
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,900
Why don't they have like a...

1114
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:52,900
Very popular.

1115
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,900
Why don't they have like a...

1116
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,900
Fortune 500 company where people...

1117
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
That is the dress code.

1118
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:02,900
It's like girls wear skirts and like low cut or high...

1119
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,900
Whatever these are.

1120
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,900
You know, like a C-suite.

1121
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,900
Like they're walking around.

1122
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,900
The CEO is a girl and she's got midriff showing.

1123
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,900
How come there's no company like that?

1124
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,900
Nobody would survive.

1125
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,900
Why?

1126
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
the

1127
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,900
the

1128
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,900
the

1129
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,900
the

1130
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,900
the

1131
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,900
the

1132
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,900
the

1133
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,900
the

1134
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,900
the

1135
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,900
the

1136
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,900
the

1137
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,900
the

1138
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,900
the

1139
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,900
the

1140
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,900
The hangover burger is fire.

1141
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,900
I watched a video today about the heart attack grill.

1142
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,900
You guys know about that?

1143
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:58,900
I knew about what it was, I didn't realize that the owner of it is like a complete lunatic.

1144
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:03,900
Where he, like people die at the heart attack grill, people die of heart attacks.

1145
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,900
And he does interviews and he's like, I'm gonna be real with you guys, it's good for business.

1146
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:18,900
and

1147
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:33,900
the

1148
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:50,180
and

1149
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:57,180
up

1150
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:12,260
the

1151
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:17,940
a bad list of crimes that he committed. But, okay no he's in there until 2029 which is

1152
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:23,340
really not that long. It's not that long. 6 more years. I will say he probably would

1153
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:29,200
have gotten 5 or 10 years if he wasn't the subway guy. I think he definitely got dinged

1154
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,500
for a couple extra, couple extra, he got dinged for a dime. Yeah imagine Jared walking in

1155
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,500
and seeing a fat judge and you know he's like "Bruh!"

1156
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:44,500
This one's in the bag. This one's in the fucking bag.

1157
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Do you think in like 2035 when we get into like the nostalgia from the 2010s,

1158
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,500
they're like "Oh let's bring Jared back, Subway" and he runs out of air.

1159
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
No I don't think so.

1160
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
You think they're gonna want Jared back? I gotta say man, I don't think so.

1161
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
I think that's probably the one thing that won't happen.

1162
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,900
Well, people forget that Carl- Carl alone had sex with a 13 year old and impregnated her.

1163
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,900
Yeah, but that's fine.

1164
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,900
What?

1165
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,900
He's a sports guy.

1166
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,900
He's mentally at like 5 years old.

1167
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:18,900
Like every sports player has been injured in the head so much that they're basically-

1168
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,400
It's fine to fuck a 13 year old thing that Rexio said.

1169
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,900
He played basketball, Rexio wasn't getting his head knocked around.

1170
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,900
When did that happen? What year did that happen?

1171
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,900
Like in the 80s when he was in the NBA, maybe they were early 90s.

1172
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,900
So literally, it's just not a big deal.

1173
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,900
What are you talking about?

1174
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:56,900
Not a big deal that Karl Malone had sex with a 13 year old and impregnated her and now her son's walking around doing videos on Instagram where he's like, "Yeah, my dad's Karl Malone, but he won't talk to me because he impregnated my mom."

1175
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,900
My woman.

1176
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,900
That's not good, my woman.

1177
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,900
He has to... see this is the pain of this, dude.

1178
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:06,900
This kid didn't grow up without a father, had to raise a mother, had to fuck his mom.

1179
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,900
This is not... this is all cascading...

1180
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,900
And she was still 13.

1181
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,900
Yeah, all cascading... now he's doing the same... yeah, this is making you crazy.

1182
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,900
You're acting... you're looking like John Lennon and your attitude towards women is mighty close to his as well.

1183
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,900
Sing us a song. Sing us something.

1184
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,900
You do have a John Lennon Halloween costume on, you have to admit.

1185
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,900
*laughing*

1186
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,900
*laughing*

1187
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,900
you're a hippie from the 50's

1188
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,900
that's not funny

1189
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,900
it is funny that you picked these glasses

1190
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:38,900
it's a little funny

1191
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,900
especially if you're like "oh i'm getting older"

1192
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,900
i'm gonna get the most annoying glasses possible

1193
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,900
age gracefully

1194
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,900
get some big square ones man

1195
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
come on

1196
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,900
you're holding on so brutally

1197
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,900
i have to go to soho for these glasses

1198
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,900
i just have to go down to soho to get these

1199
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,900
these 400 million dollar sunglasses.

1200
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,660
I wanted Chinese diplomat glasses, but they are too small for my face.

1201
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,900
And these were the next best thing.

1202
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,620
That would have been even fucking worse.

1203
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,620
No, they would have been awesome.

1204
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,460
Nobody would have ever talked to you if you walked around in tiny little glasses like

1205
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,460
this.

1206
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:14,460
Good, no one should talk to me.

1207
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,460
He's stink maxing?

1208
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,460
He has Chinese diplomat glasses?

1209
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:19,380
Yeah, I want to smell bad, wear Chinese diplomat glasses.

1210
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:20,380
I'm wearing a cloak.

1211
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,380
I'm wearing a cape.

1212
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:22,380
Oh my god.

1213
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,260
I'm wearing a seersucker suit.

1214
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,260
We need to go to China.

1215
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,900
We just have to.

1216
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,380
We need to send Rex to China.

1217
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,380
Yeah.

1218
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:38,780
Warzone, loot crate, out of a plane, just ride into China, see how he likes it.

1219
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,780
He will thrive there.

1220
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,780
He will completely thrive there.

1221
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,980
He doesn't speak Chinese, man.

1222
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,980
He will thrive there.

1223
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,780
I mean, I don't...

1224
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:48,700
Nick Landon's in China, and I don't think he speaks Chinese.

1225
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,700
And I can go...

1226
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,180
How do you know random white guys in China?

1227
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,180
There's not that many.

1228
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:55,180
There's not that many.

1229
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,180
What are you talking- who is this fucking guy? What are you talking about?

1230
01:05:57,180 --> 01:05:59,180
This is Ryder.

1231
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,180
There's an awesome Chinese guy.

1232
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,180
Um...

1233
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:05,180
Fuck. His name's like Nathan something

1234
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,180
and he is completely pro

1235
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,180
mainland and puts out like a shitload of

1236
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,180
YouTube videos. That's what I would do

1237
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,180
if I was in China. He's also completely

1238
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:15,180
bald, no eyebrows

1239
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,180
even. Uh...

1240
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,180
Great guy. Just constantly putting out

1241
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:24,900
Like shit talking videos against Hong Kong and like Taiwan and stuff. He's so dope

1242
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:28,460
Put me in the cheat pile dude, put me in the fucking button

1243
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:33,380
Like button here, the little class. China we are coming for you

1244
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:40,760
I don't think you have it in you to be in China. I think you're I think that either their collectivist culture would destroy you

1245
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,260
wrong

1246
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,260
He's a complete asshole, he's a white watcher leftist

1247
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:51,420
No, I think that you're I think that you're too into being an individual you're walking around like oh, I'm gonna have the funny glasses

1248
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,320
Oh, I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hands on my desk

1249
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:00,460
Why don't we hands on your desk in China that cut your hands off and it's not true. That is the truth

1250
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,540
That is not true. No, that's the fucking trade to say it man

1251
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:09,620
I'm working my mind is I've got a hundred hands on the desk. I mean fucking fried bugs

1252
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:17,260
You'd be walking around like this, they'd call you human chopsticks, you'd be doing...

1253
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,260
It would be bad.

1254
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:20,260
Okay, okay.

1255
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:21,260
Alright, that's enough time.

1256
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:25,660
I need to go pee so bad, so we are done.

1257
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,660
Okay.

1258
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,860
Thank you so much for joining us, thank you Brian for joining us also, even though you

1259
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:31,900
said some really racist stuff.

1260
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,900
I did not!

1261
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,820
I didn't say anything weird!

1262
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,820
I didn't say anything wrong or weird in any way.

1263
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,740
said something pedophilic but it's okay

1264
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:45,500
i've edited it out you literally said it's okay which i think is the

1265
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:52,060
definition i said i said it's nothing
