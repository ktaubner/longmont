9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,960

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,380
We're both on there and I've yeah this is the guy come we're going to kill a

57
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,680
kid.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,540
We're going to kill a fifteen year old kid

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,840
and here's me what

60
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,720
those two comedians on the nerves.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
so fun.

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,840
Yeah, they bring you on to talk about maybe China's invading somewhere.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,560
You're like, "Well, that's very interesting. Here's what I think that

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,400
Doug from the show... Doug would have to say about that."

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,680
It's a good idea, dude. Comedians are very good people. Yeah, yeah, and

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,400
they're funny. Better than most, funnier than most. Funnier than almost everybody

67
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,360
in the world these days. Dude, I would hate to be a non comedian. We call

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,060
call them civilians. Yeah, I don't like civilians. I would hate. Oh, my God, if I

69
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,880
were a civilian,

70
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,320
I mean, what do you even do? What do you do all day? The spark that- How do you

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,880
not have- what do you do with your, with your overflowing abundance of creative

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,000
energy? I guess doodle. So, you just draw- I guess you either doodle or jack off.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,680
See, I don't do any of those. I retain my, my- Right. I do- So, a civilian would

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,080
have- Doodling is jacking off, by the way, because it's not actually creating

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,440
anything. That's how I thought of jacking off, is because of the word doodle. And

76
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,080
you're thinking of your doodle. Yeah, doodle. No, but I mean like when I'm do I

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
mean like doodling is the same thing as jacking off because you're wasting your

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
your your less creative spark. Yeah, in the same way that you spill your seed

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,760
like yeah into a toilet. That's so fucking true. I mean, I guess yeah, when

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,640
I think about me versus a civilian, when both of us might have that idea in our

81
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,840
head of a naked woman. Yeah, the civilian probably sits down and cranks one out on

82
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,200
the toilet gets it all over the bath mat. Yeah, that's hanging on the side of the

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,800
tub. Yeah, and it drips down into the that you painted a target on

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,400
the corner, the space between the tub and the ground.

85
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,100
But me, the grout, that's the word I was looking for. Yeah, me, I'm thinking of

86
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,920
a joke about it. Yeah, two boobs.

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,040
Why not three? Yeah, two boobs. Wait, what is one the mom boob and one's the

88
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,000
dad boob? This is just the kind of shit a comedian comes up with that you guys

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,920
you could never even think of yeah. You see two things, one's a mom, one's a dad,

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,140
oh or maybe they're both dad. So where's the baby? Yeah, wait, so where's the

91
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,680
baby? Is that the baby? Yeah, pointing to the belly button. The belly button.

92
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,240
Wait, that's a reverse boob. And this must be the baby, and then I guess what's

93
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,720
under it is probably a similar looking sibling to the belly button. This is my

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
Edinburgh Fringe show. Yeah. Where I bring a naked woman on stage and I go,

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,080
"Okay, so let's break this down." Yeah. Hair,

96
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,960
hair

97
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,420
and and her feet also yeah do something like that there was there when I went to

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,380
Edinburgh fringe years ago. We need to do years and we need to do I remember when

99
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,960
you went and I was water. You think we would slaughter you think we

100
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,820
I thought that was an evil villains laugh. Is it not? No, it was a dog. Oh my

101
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,060
God, that completely sounded like a human. That was insane crazy.

102
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,460
So nuts. What the fuck, man? Oh, here comes a package. Oh, get ready. It's FedEx. Oh,

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,180
they're about to knock on our door. I'm really nervous. They're literally walking right up.

104
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,780
Oh my God. Please, no. Please, no. Please don't do it. Please don't do it. Please. They're

105
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,460
coming. They're going to knock on that door. They're going to come here. I swear to God.

106
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,420
It's this Goodfellas diner scene right now. Yeah, no, I think Fringe would be the worst

107
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,300
experience of your life. I can't believe it. Everybody who does it is like, "Oh, it changed

108
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,200
my life. It's like yeah man. You did Molly. Yeah, you put you drank for thirty

109
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,760
nights in a row. You chilled yeah. I don't think it's and then you ask like

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,180
how are the shows. It's for people came to every single one. The only people

111
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,980
who sell out the shows are this guy, Stuart Lee, Stuart Little, Stuart Little,

112
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:45,300
who's a very huge across the pond. He's a very and he does kind of sardonic kind

113
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,520
of dry British wit. The only the only joke I remember from from from the friend.

114
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,660
I went to two fringes actually. Wow. Yeah, because my friend went to school over there.

115
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,140
I could I should get a friend in the front of your head. Yeah. I obviously I remember

116
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,980
seeing a bunch like there are a bunch of people that I wanted to see that I like. There's

117
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,900
like oh like I'll go see this person because I know of yeah whatever, but the only like

118
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,500
the fun part is to walk into random stuff that you don't you don't even know something's

119
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,740
happening. I just walk into a bar and there will just be a show happening and you sit

120
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,360
and watch and the only thing that I remember from any of those was this guy who we like

121
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,280
just walked into this random show and he's doing stand up and the only joke I

122
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,480
remember is he was talking about Millennials and he was saying that they

123
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,560
don't he was doing literally like what you would like a he was saying that

124
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,720
Millennials don't look at sunrises anymore because they look to spend too

125
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,360
much time looking at their apps. He was saying he was fully honest like

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,360
earnestly like probably middle it like two young middle ages middle ages 600

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,160
thirty years old. I would guess like forties fifties, like two to not in the

128
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,800
right window for this type of thing. I feel like barely not a millennial yeah

129
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,320
and then the only thing I remember it a really strong accent. He kept being

130
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,080
like yeah and you'll see millennials in the in the park doing toy chi. Oh my

131
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,560
boy, she and then he didn't act out of toy toy toy, toy, toy, toy, and you just

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,760
go

133
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:13,240
and I've never seen anybody do Taiji in my life and this guy got a thirty day

134
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,400
thirty shows. Oh yeah. Well that's cool. Was it like, do they do shows in the middle of

135
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,320
the day in the morning and stuff? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds like hell man. I hate shows.

136
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,800
Well yeah, that's, it's, I mean, it is, it's the, it's the Mystery Science Theater 3000

137
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,240
style comedy fans delight. Yeah. It is the, it's the lol cow comedy fans. Yeah. Paradise

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,600
Playground. Yeah. You get to see one, you buy, you buy an expensive ticket to see like

139
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,640
Dan Soder one day or whatever, and then every other day you see people

140
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
wallowing in the filth

141
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,360
of their own brain. Here's what we do man,

142
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,240
you, me,

143
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,520
Patrick, okay,

144
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,600
right, Pete, I'm okay, Pete, Pete Holmes,

145
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,440
we run that town. We should do a play, we got to do a four person show.

146
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
We gonna run this town tonight. The other thing is, the other thing as far

147
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,800
as I can tell, if you get, if you get the like

148
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,240
official. I don't know how the whole thing works. I've know I knew some

149
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,600
people who did some shows and I don't know how you like get it. I think you

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,160
have to like get it and assert, but like I think that if you get a friend show

151
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,760
like they newspapers will send people to review your show. That's so awesome,

152
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,360
like no matter what like it's you can you can be you can just have the worst

153
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,640
show of all time and they'll send somebody to write a review of a show.

154
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,960
It's the worst show I've ever seen. It's one star. See if we can get like all

155
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,960
one star reviews. I really think we could do the worst show ever.

156
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,300
that's a great idea. That's a really good and try to get like to try to get

157
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,740
every day. I one star review in a different newspaper, make make truly the

158
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,600
worst show of all time. That is really genius. No, I mean what will we be?

159
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,720
What we even do? What is I mean we wouldn't have to try. We already did a

160
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,000
full fucking episode. How do you eat, but how do you even repulse Europeans?

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,880
Yeah, what repulses these sick animals? I would say, oh, we can take a shower.

162
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,240
we could take a shower on stage. We can any TV show or video game that has

163
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,180
colors in it. Yeah, we could brush our teeth. We could

164
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,020
we could listen to loud music, vegetables, rock and roll, that's great,

165
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,840
leafy greens,

166
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,640
cruciferous vegetables, toothbrushes, toothbrushes for sure. That's what we

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,200
could do. We could do just the whole thing. We could design the entire thing

168
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,920
to discuss, to discuss the European. Individuality. Individuality, yeah,

169
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,480
yeah, maybe entrepreneurship. Yeah, definitely. We could do an entire show

170
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:42,580
about an entrepreneur with the most amazing teeth in the world who eats six

171
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,660
small meals every single day or maybe he does intermittent fasting and he's in

172
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,060
really good shape. Did you see what the top joke of the fringe was? You see the

173
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,940
number one top J top number one joke of the fringe. What was the number one joke

174
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,020
of the friend? Let me look it up so I can read it verbatim. But it was a pun.

175
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,700
And who is the bard that this joke?

176
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Let's lips.

177
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,600
This is not a joke of French 2023.

178
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,980
Okay, so comedy do people do drama drama? Yeah. Yeah, it's

179
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,500
like plays and all the drama.

180
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,800
They do. There's a bunch of one-person shows.

181
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,300
I hate it's everything from one man shows to one woman.

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,180
Yeah, a solo show. No, it's over there. It's a one-man show

183
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,300
or a one woman show.

184
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,900
They don't call it solo shows.

185
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,200
Like God,

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
let's see. Okay,

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,940
The top joke was written or told by Lorna Rose Treen. So shout out to Lorna Rose Treen.

188
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
Lorna.

189
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,700
Here it is. I started dating, oh hold on.

190
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,360
Yeah, get it ready.

191
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,380
I started dating a zookeeper, but it turned out he was a cheetah. That was the best joke

192
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,380
I've ever heard.

193
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,520
That was the top joke of the 2023 Fringe Festival.

194
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,920
it doesn't even make any sense. He was a cheetah. You thought he was a zoo. You

195
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,680
dated a large wild animal and he thought he was a zookeeper because he was at the

196
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,660
no, you don't understand this woman just has a heavy accent. You're saying I

197
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,220
started dating a zookeeper and it turns out he was a cheater. It's a dead joke

198
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,320
and the joke is that the joke is about how unfaithful people are nowadays.

199
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,760
That is so sad. Actually, here's the here's the

200
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,000
is there a runner up?

201
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,940
so it's just this web. This web page I pulled up has all of them for the like

202
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,080
every year. I need to hear all these are all the exact same. Okay, give me one.

203
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,540
This is insane me twenty twenty two twenty twenty two. So I see what

204
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,220
happened in twenty twenty two. What was like a big news story in twenty twenty

205
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,460
two

206
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,700
the podcast about list podcast our list at a united states tour. So this is how

207
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,440
this is the year that this happened. Okay, give me the joke. I tried to steal

208
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,500
spaghetti from the shop, but the female guard saw me and I couldn't get pasta.

209
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,640
Oh wait, it's it's UK, so and I couldn't get pasta.

210
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,280
It works better in the UK, and I'm going to be honest yeah yeah pasta. It

211
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,080
doesn't make yeah. I went pasta, but I couldn't get pasta. That's funny. Yeah,

212
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,580
that's okay. So these are all going to be the female guard saw me. Well, you

213
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,260
had to say it's that I was wondering why the female guard, but there's no

214
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,800
there's not it's not called past him. Yeah, you have to say otherwise. It's a

215
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,060
yeah.

216
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,720
okay, give me the I couldn't get anti pasta yeah. See that I could be good in

217
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,660
an opposite kind of universe. I went to the I tried to steal. I went to the

218
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,680
opposite spaghetti store and the female guard tried to stop me and I couldn't

219
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,740
get anti pasta.

220
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,980
Okay, it skips a toy. Anti anti pasta already exists, though

221
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,980
yeah yeah, that's why I said it wouldn't be an opposite. It would just be a yeah.

222
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,220
Well, an appetizer store yeah. Yeah, I went to the appetizer. That's a better

223
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,500
joke. I went to the appetizer store and the female guard told me told me I

224
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,320
wouldn't be able to get an tp it yeah. I couldn't steal from and she and she was

225
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,620
an anti guard also yeah. So this is

226
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,580
this is from twenty nineteen, because I guess they took a couple years off for

227
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,680
cove it probably, but blow me yeah. So it's one and I think about here. This is

228
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,480
basically cove. It is brewing in this in the during this French, the nervousness

229
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,480
the guys, the it's on the influence of or you know years and this is co vid years

230
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,320
or they're in they're intersecting, but this is maybe the last carefree joke.

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Oh wow right, so last the last vestige of happiness for everything was so yeah

232
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
way. I need to know what it was like because these these last two have been

233
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,500
very dark yeah. So this one is is by olaf falafel. No, yeah, it's by olaf

234
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,700
falafel. That can't be the name of a him. It must be okay. Here's the joke. I

235
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,540
I keep randomly shouting out. That's all that's a great start to a joke. That's a

236
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,480
good set up. I keep randomly really, really good. That's a really strong

237
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,980
every every every comedian has at least one. I keep read. I keep randomly

238
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,820
shouting out.

239
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:01,860
I keep randomly shouting out broccoli and cauliflower. I think I might have

240
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,620
florets

241
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:12,500
all right, yeah, all right, that's my Olaf Olaf. Olaf Olaf. This guy just

242
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,040
your check out all a falafel on instagram, a bit as real or he crushes

243
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,580
the reels

244
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,880
yeah okay. Now we have the first real joke in twenty eighteen. This is the

245
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,920
first one that's not a pun that I'm going back

246
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,940
Adam row working at the job center has to be a tense job, knowing that if you

247
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,220
get fired, you still have to come in the next day

248
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,620
because you have to you have to get a job at the job center. They mean the

249
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,300
unemployment office. I think yeah they must have a different. They must call

250
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
the job center, the job center, the job, be

251
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,220
gotta go down to the job. Yeah, we can stop it man. This goes all the way, but

252
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,440
okay, give me the oldest. We go two thousand and nine Dan and to Polsky

253
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,840
okay, I'm anti Polsky hedgehogs. Why can't they just share the hedge?

254
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,480
I kind of like that one.

255
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,840
I kind of like that one a little bit. Hey hedgehogs,

256
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,740
I'm okay. That's like a joke man when I was a first starting stand up.

257
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,600
When I was like a type of joke, I would yeah, when I was like sixteen, I had a

258
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,360
joke that was like

259
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I sucked so bad. I was so bad for so long. I know man. It's I had a they

260
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,840
shouldn't you shouldn't be allowed to try to stand up in high school. Yeah,

261
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,920
and it sucks that if you're not like the only people who are really good at that

262
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,960
age are like like Dave Chappelle. Dave Chappelle was like fifteen years old and

263
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,880
was like really good. Yeah. And like if you know that if you do it one time and you're

264
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,340
16, you don't do well, you're like, well, okay. So I know that I have my ceiling is

265
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:50,360
way, way lower than I was hoping. But I think my first joke I ever told on stage was like,

266
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:59,040
it was like, hey, man, these ant eaters, that was the beginning. Yeah, again, another classic

267
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
thing of animals. These ant eaters, you ever think they get a little bit tired of eating

268
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,600
That's the kind of joke I think of now. It's kind of funny. That's all I can think of.

269
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,160
But then I remember my first time doing stand-up, I was at this hookah bar in Wilmington. Yeah.

270
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,680
And my mom dropped me off and she wanted to watch and I said, "No, you must leave." Right.

271
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,220
And I made friends with these like hippies who were there to like watch their friend

272
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,460
do like a DJ set at the open mic. And it took him like 15 minutes to set up and he went right

273
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,380
after me, but they were all they were drug addicts. Yeah, for sure. And the guy one of

274
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,180
the guys had like track marks all up and down his arm and I was just a little kid. So I

275
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:50,300
was like, hey man, why do you have all these holes on your arm? Yeah, and he was like I

276
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,100
give blood a lot. Yeah, and that really stuck with me. That stuck with me forever. I was

277
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,820
like that is the light that is a very, very skill. He went to he went to the he went to

278
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,420
to like the you know how like in a in a old TV show like their hero, there's the

279
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,420
the villains are the exact mirrors of the heroes and they have their own evil

280
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,540
organization. Yeah, he went to like the evil mirror dare and he learned like

281
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,900
twenty things to say when people ask you about the track.

282
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,940
Well, I guess he wants to say yes to

283
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,860
heroin. My there's a mosquito problem in my bedroom. That's a tattoo. That's a

284
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,700
failed tattoo. They went really slow. The machine got all broken. Just a bunch of

285
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,100
holes in my arm. I fell yeah

286
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,940
on a bunch of needles and I remember that I think they I was like sixteen, but I

287
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,580
was definitely a dork. I was wearing like yeah flannel and like like blue jeans.

288
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,620
You know like those those deep blue jeans that have like the yellow stitching like

289
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,940
that kind of like Levi's jeans. That was what I wore every day and I

290
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,180
they yeah they were like smoking a joint and they were like I didn't even ask

291
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,980
about that when they just told me it was a cigarette. I was like I know a weed is

292
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,980
man. Yeah, and now you don't know track. I feel like it's a fair. Yeah, I guess if I

293
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,460
don't know, yeah, assumption. I just didn't I didn't hang out with that many heroin addicts

294
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,140
up to that point. Yeah, you know, at least not doing it into their veins. Yeah, but they

295
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,100
were good people. They loved me and they I had a video. It's so crazy. I do. I just think

296
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,700
about this. What was your first time doing stand up? I was fourteen. That is so young.

297
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,780
Yeah, man. Yeah. I mean, that's what I can't do. They let you on. I exactly. Well, yeah,

298
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,980
me and my friend, we had to like find there were maybe like one or two open

299
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,220
mics in Boston that would even let a 14 year old in because they're all bars.

300
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,780
Yeah, of course. So yeah, they're not going to let you like we got turned

301
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,460
away from you could have done. Yeah, yeah, I don't think Muya was around.

302
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,620
Probably not. Yeah, in fact, it definitely wasn't, but it was at it was

303
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,780
at a Cheers. Really? Yeah, they had an open mic there and she had an old open

304
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,060
mic. Yeah, and that's what I think about. It's crazy, dude. I was yeah, I was 14

305
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,360
fifteen years old, I was doing literally the worst jokes of all time. Yeah, so

306
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,300
horrible, like like every joke was like the one I can remember is like this is

307
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,500
probably one of the first ones ever I did on stage, which is like oh like I

308
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,120
love skydiving, but everyone always freaks out when I do it in business

309
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,580
class,

310
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,580
like something like that, you know, like it's like completely nothing and yeah

311
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,580
just all only that that exact set up and punch line. Yeah, I in different

312
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,020
situations of like here's something you're not supposed to do in this

313
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,660
situation. I remember that yeah there are people walking around. You saw me do

314
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,500
stand up when I was fourteen and they were like that was a and they're ever

315
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,140
seen yeah, because I remember all the worst things, the worst stand up sets

316
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,580
I've ever seen yeah. Of course, and these these people definitely yeah yeah

317
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,620
so they were like yeah, yeah you of course you remember a fucking fourteen

318
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,860
year old kid doing yeah. The thing is you have your kid. These are people who

319
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,660
are who are probably I'll run into again in my life

320
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,160
and I almost already accessible. If they were at the cheers open, Mike yeah,

321
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,740
well, I know of a few of them that was Sam Jay there yeah

322
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:03,980
yeah. I talk to same day like multiple times. So she's very nice. Yeah, she's

323
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,580
very funny yeah, but again yeah, I was fourteen years. That is so fucking

324
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,740
awesome man. That is so awesome yeah. All of my I did that joke and then I did

325
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,940
a bunch of jokes about like that were just made up stories, but not made up in

326
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,420
like, "Oh, these are crazy, obviously made up stories." They were just like lying

327
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,940
stories that could be true.

328
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,260
You know? And it was all...

330
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,740
You don't go far enough.

331
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,620
Yeah. But I think if you're a kid, this is a recommendation to all the kids, all the

332
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,620
kids who are not civilians, the non-civilian kids who want to start doing stand-up comedy.

333
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
Kids who are in the trenches.

334
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,540
Yeah, the kids who have been enlisted by God in this holy army.

335
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,840
The divine mandate that's been handed down.

336
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,260
If you're a child and you do stand-up comedy, you have to do it about how weird it is that

337
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,000
that you're a kid yeah, you have to do about Pokemon. You have to do it about

338
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,320
like you have to do it about fucking about fucking about sex. That would see

339
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,020
that was you see you were fourteen. You could have done that at sixteen yeah,

340
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,600
you know I'm halfway a man dude that you just like I just got a like I was

341
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,840
eating pussy. The other flashbulb memory okay,

342
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,520
there was this guy there was like he was like a

343
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,440
like a resource teacher type guy

344
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,180
that it was like at my school very briefly and I liked I would talk to him

345
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,680
and we talked about like how I wanted to do stand up and he was like he said

346
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,940
that he was a stand up comedian and then we were like just talking about it and

347
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,260
then he told me one of his jokes and it was something about it was literally so

348
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,320
it was literally about something about his wife's like pubes like it was like

349
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,560
it's like some really graphic, like not like not really a joke, just something

350
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,120
about and it was like it was about his wife like like and he and then I

351
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,120
remember really vividly at the end of it. He was like now don't steal my job

352
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,600
dude. I'm like you should have done it man. What are you talking about eating

353
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,060
my wife? You the other day

354
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm in high school. Yeah, I have a wife and my joke. See that would be funny,

355
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
though it would be funny. That would actually be really funny. If that is I

356
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,120
mean that's what you have to do. If like a thirteen year old went up and was

357
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,840
doing like Rodney, that's so funny, but it wouldn't because no thirteen year

358
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,860
could ever do Rodney without seeming like their parent was forced. Exactly. That's

359
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,060
the other thing is what if you watch like if you ever seen an orphan, you ever

360
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,900
seen those old clips of Amanda Bynes doing stand up and she's like twelve

361
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,860
years old. No, she's like pretty funny, but it is clear that her parents were

362
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,060
way way way too involved. Yeah, because no kid is going to do this. Yeah, of

363
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,960
course, kids want to play. Kids love playing. Kids don't want to hang out in

364
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,460
smoky, dirty nightclothes. It's the worst experience of all time. Yeah, it's

365
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,900
awful. I used to get really bad stage fright too. Yeah me too man. Yeah when I

366
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:47,140
was like I used to like be completely shaking on stage. I was like freaking the

367
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,240
fuck out. I remember the second open mic I ever did was like the next week and I

368
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,620
remember being I did I had like I did the math and I was like okay if I do an

369
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,960
open mic every week yeah until I turn 18 I'll have done stand-up like over like a

370
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,240
like a hundred and fifty times by then yeah and I I was like and then I'll be

371
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,540
really good yeah, and I think I did stand up like four times in North Carolina

372
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,400
when I was a kid, because by the fourth time I was like okay, this is this is

373
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,900
this is another cheat code for every for every kid who wants to level up and

374
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,700
become a comedian. Start doing stand up as young as possible, do it ten to twelve

375
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,560
times and then don't do it for eight to ten years and then say and then when you

376
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,980
get back into it, you say yeah, I've been doing it since I was yeah. I started it

377
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,380
about eight years ago. I love saying that yeah, I did it when I was fourteen and

378
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,860
then I only did it for a year and then I stopped and I haven't done it since

379
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,460
that's what that's what I say is I say I say yeah, you know I started stand

380
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,620
about ten years ago. Yeah, it's so fun. It's very especially because like even

381
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,540
yeah, it doesn't even cat is nothing yeah my my second time doing stand up.

382
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,420
It was that it was a

383
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:57,500
an open mic at this comedy club and it was above a restaurant and there was

384
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,720
kind of like wedding party or bachelorette party or something that was at the restaurant

385
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,180
downstairs and they heard there was a free comedy show upstairs. So right before the

386
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,900
open mic starts, it's like, you know, 30 comics or whatever. That's the only people in the

387
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,220
audience. But right before the open mic starts, like 150 people walk up, just like drunk old

388
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:26,180
people and everybody else is like so excited. But I was terrified. And the guy who was hosting,

389
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:32,660
I like met him and talked to him and we like got along and he had these like this was 2000

390
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:42,180
and 2013 maybe 2012 and he was wearing you know people usually wear like red skinny jeans.

391
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:47,020
Yeah I can picture that. So he had like red skinny jeans on and when I went up I was like

392
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,940
and me and this guy really got along and I went up I shook his hand and was like thank

393
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,040
thank you guys give it up for yourselves and give it up for your host pants. You

394
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,460

414
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,180

415
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,540
stage. I say congratulations to his pants or whatever. I tell my lies. I do

416
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:32,940
my anteater joke and I it was a lottery open mic, so I ended up going way later

417
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,820
in the night and I told and my I had a curfew. I was barring my mom's car. My

418
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,220
mom was like be home at eleven yeah, and so I go on stage at like eleven fifteen

419
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,600
and so I'm on stage and my phone starts ringing with the ringer in my pocket,

420
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,220
and it's just like ringing so loudly, buzzing so loudly, everybody can hear it,

421
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,620
but I'm too nervous to touch it. So my phone just rang for like two minutes of

422
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,980
my set, completely dying, and then a lady in the front was like so honestly,

423
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,140
was like, "Hey, honey, are you okay?"

424
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,380
And I was like, "What?" She's like, "Are you okay?" I was like, "Shut up,

425
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,620
bitch. I think I just went like yeah, I'm fine yeah, I'm fine. Look at this

426
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,500
bitch of the front row.

427
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,780
Are you okay,

428
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:22,840
and then I yeah, then I just ran off stage pretty much God that is and what's

429
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,100
worse than you bomb as a kid bombing is already so do that yeah so many and

430
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,220
then you go and then you go home and you get grounded once or twice. I also

431
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,620
completely forgot everything because I was so I was oh yeah, I had lights. I

432
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,960
I said to to Joe and then we got on a after twenty seconds, your kid you'd be

433
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,160
well. I forgot yeah and everyone's to everyone's too nice. Yeah kid. Oh,

434
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,480
I but you know that you're an adult at heart yeah. I did so. I did the first

435
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,740
one to mature to be comforted. I did the first one and then at the second time I

436
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,080
told everybody that I was in college right and they were like Oh, what

437
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,920
college you go to and there's only one college in my town. So I was like I go

438
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,380
to you and CW and they're like Oh, we go to you and CW. What year are you and I

439
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,060
he's like I get of three yeah. I skipped a couple of grades. Actually, I'm really

440
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,740
smart yeah. I do I'm mostly in the lab yeah run into me probably never seen me.

441
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,620
I'm in the I'm a do experiments. My major is experimental ism yeah. I'm in

442
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,180
the lab pretty much all day and night. You wouldn't even recognize me because

443
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,180
the goggles I have to wear for the safety, because I'm dealing with so many

444
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,940
full hazmat suit yeah, so I'm the guy who walks around as a hazmat man yeah.

445
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm a professor

446
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,580
Yeah, and then I remember when I got to college, I was like, "Oh, maybe I'll do

447
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,540
like... Maybe I'll start doing stand up here." They had an open mic there. Yeah.

448
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,940
And I didn't want to 'cause I went to one one time. It was... Nobody was doing

449
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,060
comedy, it was all music.

450
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,640
It was like, "I don't wanna be the one guy who's doing..." And it was in the

451
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,120
dining hall. Hey. Yeah, yeah. Hey. You guys like music? Well, you're gonna love

452
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,860
comedy then.

453
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,760
but I went to a they had an in you know, I just had an idea, sorry, but comedy that

454
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,600
you can dance to

455
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,060
comedy with a beat comedy with a beat and you can dance to it the whole time

456
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,100
you can do the piano accompaniment. Yeah, Rory Scoville did that. Okay, that's

457
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,780
cool. Yeah, but I'm thinking we should get a piano accompaniment for the show.

458
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah, that's a good idea. That's a great idea. That's a really good idea.

459
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,980
Pianos can't be that expensive.

460
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,780
Buddy or heavy.

461
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,620
It's like you don't know the first thing about these. Sorry. I'm a little

462
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,420
confused. He weighs about a pound yeah, fifty two pounds for a piano. I went to a

463
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,660
I didn't want to do stand up, but I was like maybe I'll do improv. So I went to

464
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,100
like this improv like not improv club. I got a jam and it was just it turned me

465
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,140
off of comedy for probably three years. Yeah, I was like this. These are really

466
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,740
these are sick people. Yeah, it's these are sick fucking people. It's it's pretty

467
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,660
pretty tough. Yeah, one of the kids was, I think I've talked about this before, but

468
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,260
one of the kids was like, I met him there and then I ended up having a class with him.

469
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:08,540
And the first day of class when we did like the icebreakers, they were like, "Say your

470
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:14,100
name and a fun fact about yourself." And he was like, "Well, my name's Samuel and

471
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,820
I can actually do an amazing Jim Carrey impression." And then he stood up and went, "All righty

472
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,020
and just sat back down and we're like oh wow that's good man and this kid did

473
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,820
improv at my my college. I'm so glad that I will never again in my life have

474
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,300
to say a fun fact about myself. I feel like I had something recently where I

475
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,780
had to on like I think I was it was like shooting something and somebody and we

476
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,500
did icebreakers and I was like I don't need to know these people's names. Yeah

477
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah, get me in get me out yeah, I'm the talent. I'm Tom Cruise. Yeah, what I

478
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,040
don't need to know any of these fucking people's names and by the way, if I'm

479
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,500
ever a movie star, I will not be walking around shaking hands being like oh man,

480
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,700
it's I I'm so glad you're on this one because I saw you on the last one. I'm

481
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,400
going to say, would you mind hey there that tape is peeling up yeah. Can you

482
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,720
re tape that and then they go? Oh yeah right away, and I said I wasn't talking

483
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,980
to you. I was talking to a bug on the ground. Yeah, I was talking. I honestly

484
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,180
can't tell you people apart because you all I would talk to you. I would look at

485
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,160
a fly and I would say, can you tell that PA over there to get me a copy? Sorry,

486
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,260
I just assumed that was your boss,

487
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,320
because he's bigger than you or at least he acts bigger. Yeah,

488
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,860
man, I would be such a good movie star. I would make them build me a house on

489
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,060
set instead of a trailer.

490
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,740
I've been getting these videos on my shorter video feeds

491
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,300
that are is this woman who does intimacy coordination. That's your phone. She

492
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,180
does intimacy coordination. Is there anything on it? No, there's a photo of a

493
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,700
woman as the background. It's a painting. Okay, well

494
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,840
we to make fun of me for being disabled and not being able to tell the

495
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,360
difference between a painting and a photo. Okay, it's a new disability that

496
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,780
they're going to name after, but you can't solve a capture. I saw a cap. I'll

497
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,580
do it right now. You can give me four letters. Okay,

498
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,820
that's

499
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:15,420
only humans can figure that out. That's really tough. Actually, that's

500
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,280
actually really funny. No, I actually know the real way to do an audio capture.

501
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,660
Okay, it's

502
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,980
you say, okay, tell me what what these four letters are.

503
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:34,000
That was that would have been hard if you didn't say a b c d. Yeah, if you did

504
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,900
it, but I'm just doing an example. Yeah, it's hard to think of four letters.

505
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,700
It's really tough and not in sequence of the alphabet. No, yeah, that is really

506
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,120
fucking let me try again. Okay,

507
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:58,040
that was better yeah yeah, it's just scary that you couldn't spell something

508
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,420
by accident yeah. Don't people find captures all the time that say like

509
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,800
you're fat and stuff

510
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,780
you would think that they would have some kind of software technology. I

511
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,900
I used to look at you remember how like fail blog you seven or at least like

512
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,400
there used to be a million sites that were all like fail blog, but they're

513
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,120
like hyper specific. Well, that's why here's why fail blog a really

514
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:25,000
I hope fail blog never gets Saturday night live never gets cast on Saturday

515
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,200
and alive because they did that one website English remember that I do

516
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,800
remember that yeah, where it was just people from other countries who couldn't

517
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,300
spell yeah, they just had a million of those different and one of them was for

518
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't remember what it was called, but it was all captures that spelled things

519
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,020
and they would do a little like rage comics and it would be like I would

520
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,860
have a capture that spell. It said something crazy as part of it. I

521
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:51,160
remember that no those were sick yeah yeah, we need to be your fat

522
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,660
captures of completely. They suck so bad now click the bike, click the bike

523
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,460
until you can't click the bike anymore. I fail that no capture should ever have

524
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,820
a prompt where it says until you can't anymore. It's like I'll be here all day.

525
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,660
Yeah. Is that a challenge? I'll click fucking everything. Yeah, but I hate when

526
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,100
it says like click that when it's the traffic light one and I'm like well do I

527
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,500
click the parts with the box or do I click the parts that just have the lights

528
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,900
in it? Do I click the if there's like three pixels into the corner of this?

529
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,980
Yeah, do I still click that? Do I click this one? How much does the computer

530
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,900
know is a traffic light? Yeah, well I think captchas are also a complete scam

531
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,860
because I have a VPN and if I have my VPN on, it auto fails my captchas every

532
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,620
time even if I do it right. Really? Or at least sometimes it will be like, well first

533
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,240
of all it will give me a capture every time I google anything if I have a VPN on no matter

534
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,460
where it's set to. What? I've never heard of this. And maybe I'm just in trouble. Maybe

535
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,300
you are in trouble. Maybe they have something on me. You're getting throttled. I told you

536
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,220
they looked at my bag at the airport. So who knows. Have you ever been pulled aside? I

537
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,500
have been. And they wipe your butt? They wipe my electronics. They took all my electronics

538
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,240
leaks out of my bag and I to like turn them all on use them and turn them on

539
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,140
really yeah. This was the for an international flight yeah. That makes

540
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,220
some sense. I guess yeah it was ran, but who's going to fucking who's who's

541
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,360
coming from America, a bomb in a kindle yeah and he's coming from America to

542
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,480
kill Scott. I was yeah. I was when I was flying to fringe. I thought I was going

543
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,660
to destroy the friends. They could tell us a comedy terrorist yeah. They could

544
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,560
they did you know little did they know that you were just going to you know I

545
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,800
because I did I terrorized it man. I laughed in people's faces. Yeah, I

546
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,440
walked around. I said you're you're shite. Yeah, which is the ultimate quite

547
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,740
you are quite shite. Yeah, yeah, you are lower than you need to quite comedy

548
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:50,780
shite head. You need to shite you your pants shite your trousers right now.

549
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,460
Well, I guess try it would go in your pants before your I don't like that

550
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,700
other word that they call pants. I'm never going to say that word now. Well,

551
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,700
you know if you go if you so here's a fun. Yeah, the pants is what they call

552
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:08,020
underwear. So when you go to the UK and you say this sentence, tell me I'm

553
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,380
going to go outside wearing only my pants

554
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,820
with nothing over them, they'd look at you like you're psycho or here. That

555
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,500
would be normal unless it was really snowy outside and they would assume you

556
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,220
wanted snow pants over. They say what you're not going to wear snow pants over

557
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,940
your pants, but you don't wear anything over your pants. You could also say I

558
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,420
I have my fanny hanging out of my pants yeah and they would go. You have your

559
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,540
vagina hanging out of your underwear and say no you fool. My ass cheeks are

560
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,780
hanging out. Okay, you want to be on jackass? Yeah, exactly. They'd say you

561
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,780
want to be on ridiculousness and I go yeah, thank you.

562
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,820
Yeah, or here's one. These chips are made out of potatoes.

563
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:51,860
That one works yeah, but not if you're holding up a tortilla chip. Oh my God,

564
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,820
that would break their mind. Make sense in

565
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,900
either either country, would it to hold up a to teach

566
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:03,500
tips? Yeah, I guess you're right. That's kind of a nonsense. We're just saying

567
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,880
this is a chip. If you held up a to change, they would go. What the hell

568
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,480
are you on about? Are you daft

569
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,160
cultural differences man? I hate that. Here's another cultural difference over

570
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,060
there. Every instead of saying for rent, every apartment has a sign that says to

571
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,540
let so it looks like every apartment is a sign that says toilet and then a phone

572
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,380
number every single one yeah. Why do they call it letting some people call it that

573
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,620
here, though? Why see it's it's renting here, but then it's sub letting why not

574
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,460
sub renting yeah. I think let is probably a type of form of the verb lease and you

575
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,100
let them use this yeah. You at least you use this, but it's not at least though

576
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,620
unless you are very Missy.

577
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,420
I will Lee. I will lead you use my

578
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:57,620
apartment. I will well gamers do that's true yeah. They don't have leet speak in

579
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,420
the UK either. No, no, that's just how no it wouldn't work. No, it wouldn't work

580
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,660
at all, because a new is something else over there. A new is probably say that

581
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,420
over there. Yeah, you say it's a grass part of the body. That is my big fear

582
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,580
about going to other countries. Besides there being cartels yeah in every every

583
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,280
country has a cartel except America. I want to get involved with the cartel man.

584
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,180
You want to get involved with them? Oh, yeah, I want to you. We just talked

585
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,680
about this last night, but yeah, you should you should know because I don't

586
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,480
think I don't think you'll hear it from him. Jubio was was I think cartel

587
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,080
scammed. I think he was attacked by a cartel member. Really dirty police

588
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,480
officer pulled him over. Oh, one of the I've that was one of the things I read

589
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,680
about before I go to Mexico is that you shouldn't drive alone at night because

590
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,820
the police will pull you over and shake you down. He got pulled over. The cop said the

591
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,640
tickets $300 and you have to pay it in cash right now. And he said, I do not have any

592
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,240
cash on me. And he said, okay, well, there's an ATM at the gas station down the street.

593
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,640
And if you go over there, then it's only $30. And he was like, and I think Jubio just said,

594
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,880
I don't have $30. And he said, okay, then it's $10. And so he just gave him 10 bucks.

595
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,380
That's what I read about. That's what they do to you.

596
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:22,320
Why do we not have, why does every cop in America act like they are like, like a wage,

597
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,520
they're like crusaders. They're like, yeah, waging some whole, like it, it means more

598
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,700
than just get your money. Yeah, just get your money, knock people out. Why are you wasting

599
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,560
all your fucking time doing what we need to do? We need to have a system like Mexico where

600
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,520
the normal cops, and you know, now that I'm thinking about it, we kind of maybe already

601
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,520
do, but we need to make we need to model it more like this. The normal cops.

602
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
These are the guys they're going to pull you over. They're going to shake you

603
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,620
down. If you're walking from a home and you're holding a beer, they put you in

604
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,920
jail. Yep, and you have to pay ten million dollars to get out and you see

605
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,920
one of these normal cops and you're afraid, but they have the federales.

606
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:09,020
And these guys, these are the good guys. It's the opposite. Here. The hometown

607
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,460
the beat cops. These are good people. They're just walking around. They just

608
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,180
needed a donut. They needed some money. Cops don't get paid that much, but they

609
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,700
needed a little bit of money. I like the color of the outfit. Can't wear that

610
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,980
color. It's blue, man. I do think that if cops wore red outfits, you'd see a

611
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:35,340
lot more people signing up. It's just cooler. It's a little bit Nazi-ish, I

612
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,980
I guess. Yeah, well, they didn't wear red. They just had red on their arm. Yeah, but

613
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,540
if they today, well, I'm thinking of Red Skull. Yeah. Well, that was mostly his

614
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,900
face. You're so right more than his clothes. So fucking right. Yeah, but I

615
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,700
guess typically a red guy does wear evil. How do I around is what from what

616
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,740
I said? Could we people ask you and me all the time? Yeah. How do you fix the

617
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:01,700
police? Uh huh. How do we do it, man? Tears. I mean, just look at it's all.

618
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,640
it's all just different levels. You let you you have one

619
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,400
strata of cops that this is reserved. These are corrupt cops. We need to stay

620
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,780
where a special badge. Listen, you guys can walk around. You can be cops because

621
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,200
if we try to take you off the force, you're probably going to kill the

622
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,560
chief's family or something. You guys can't it's listen. It's it's giving the

623
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,480
it's given the little brother that disconnected Xbox controller. It is

624
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,320
giving that as fuck. Yeah, a five pointed sheriff star. That's what they get to

625
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,720
somewhere yeah and they walk around fuck it a one hundred pointed star,

626
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,940
because you guys are the most special and important police of all and maybe we

627
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,860
split their tongues

628
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,580
and they walk

629
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:47,020
yeah and cloaks, I said in a registration yeah, because then the game

630
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,220
is here. It's not don't break the law. Yeah, you see one of these cops. You

631
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,440
get the fuck away immediately. That's right. See that's the thing that's so

632
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,320
tough about police officer about fixing the police. You either need to make them

633
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,620
some on just like Singapore, like you do anything and you instantly get your

634
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,260
head blown off yeah or they need to be basically just doing nothing. Here's

635
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,660
another here in America they're in the middle man. It doesn't work yeah.

636
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,680
Here's another solution don't change anything about the cops, but make prison

637
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,180
really easy to escape from,

638
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,980
and then the cops will be there will be more criminals around the cops won't

639
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,940
the time to harass people who are what singing too loudly. I do think getting

640
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,540
me in trouble for singing at 4 a.m. on Sunday night. Yeah, well, the fuck you

641
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,940
I'm listening and it helps me sleep. Yeah, fall asleep. While I sing, I'm

642
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,860
doing rent in my kitchen. Sue me. I live in New York City. Okay. I thought this

643
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,360
is supposed to be the most amazing place on earth. I think I nowadays. I think it

644
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,960
is my oh yeah, because you walk around Manhattan. I got New York a fud. You did

645
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,600
Francis Ha. I just honestly I made a lot of it did make I was like, oh, this is

646
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,620
actually sucks because because it's the NYU kids all just moved in.

647
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:06,860
These NYU kids, pretty tough nerds. They're really it really is like another.

648
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,300
I mean, you know the type of like the like, oh, I look at that. Look at you

649
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,940
guys. When you see the new college kids walking around, they're wearing their

650
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,060
student IDs on a lanyard around their neck and they're walking around and

651
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,720
they're looking at everything. Yeah. You know that like you see, I was seeing

652
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,360
I was in Boston be like oh you guys yeah. Oh look at you best you oh you don't

653
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,560
know how bad it's going to be. You don't know what it's like. I don't know.

654
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,780
Title nine title, nine title, nine title, nine title, nine

655
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,160
transfer, transfer, transfer,

656
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,240
drop out, drop out, no financial aid, no financial aid, food pantry. You look

657
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,560
like food pantry. Yep Yep Yep alcoholic hit by a car

658
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,380
first one to die. Definitely the first one to die. Look at this fucking kid.

659
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,280
Yeah, you don't get that here because these kids are millionaires. No, these

660
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,080
kids are crazy man. They're really it really completely transforms the

661
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,520
experience of seeing an eighteen year old walking around and you see them

662
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,120
when you can you can fully they're doing the they're doing a movie walk.

663
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,600
Yeah, they're fully there. They're all completely invested in not looking like

664
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,220
that kid, but they're still wearing the fucking lanyard. Yeah, but they're doing

665
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,360
the they're doing a they're doing a swag walk. Yeah, that's when you got to look

666
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,460
at them and you can look at the clothes they're wearing and the way that their

667
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,120
face looks and you say yeah, that's that you're a no bomb back kid. Yeah, you

668
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,000
came to New York because you watched lost in translation. Yeah, I don't know.

669
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,960
I don't know why I didn't go to try to go to a college in New York. I didn't

670
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,920
even try yeah. I probably tried. I didn't I got wait listed really yeah. I

671
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,580
probably I think it I think I thought New York was a wack AF. It's I mean I

672
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,320
think it's kind of when I was a college in New York. Yeah, I think I agree yeah

673
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,820
Yeah, I think it's a I think it's too. I think it's too much. I think I don't

674
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:57,200
think that you can treat a big real city as a college playground. I think it will

675
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,000
warp your life when I was like when I moved to Boston. Boston was like the it

676
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,820
felt like the biggest city ever to me. It's goaded dude. Yeah, it's very small

677
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,640
though. It's tiny. That's what's so great. I was like scared of it. I was like

678
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,080
this is too big. I need to live on a farm. Yeah, I mean that's what that that

679
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,780
that is you have you that's what I mean. You can't go to the biggest city in the

680
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,520
country for calling nowhere to go, you know where to go, but but down yeah,

681
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,680
which in terms of size

682
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,020
yeah, you could go to Hong Kong. You go to Mexico City. That's true. You got

683
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,160
there's a lot of places in the world to go. I guess technically yeah, but I

684
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,960
don't think Mexico City has that that kind of New York swag. No, there's too

685
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,420
much swag here for a child to exactly. Yeah, that's why I also see that the

686
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,460
kids running around here. Uh-huh. The kids in New York are crazy. It's I think it's I

687
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,460
think I will definitely not have a kid in New York. No, I can't even imagine. There's

688
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:56,460
kids. There's a kid right now who is going into my wife's work over and over and over

689
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,460
again. He's like 16 years old and the owner was there one day and he was on his laptop

690
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,460
and this kid asked to use the laptop and he was like, no, I'm doing work. You can't use

691
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:09,460
my laptop. He's like, okay, I'm going to come back and I'm going to kill you. And so now

692
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,000
keeps coming in and being like where's the owner I'm going to kill him and

693
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,120
they're like he's not here. You got to go and he's like okay, I'll be back

694
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,380
tomorrow dude. I can't imagine he's like sixteen years old yeah. I know it's I

695
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,420
can't imagine raising a small child in New York. Everybody lets their their

696
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,080
their eight year old kid walk home from school yeah and it's like you yeah. You

697
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,720
would kids they call them yeah, but I bet the mom and dad are both home

698
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,120
and I bet that I bet they don't have a job at all and they're on there. They're

699
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,320
getting money from the government, probably to live here, probably

700
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,840
specifically to live here. Yeah, no, but I mean like you yeah, you would try it.

701
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,360
You would be trying to raise your kid right and you be trying to to be like

702
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,340
okay. This is the way I'm going to raise my kid or whatever, and then you they'd

703
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,240
be walking home from school and they'd come home and they they'd just know

704
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,680
about Rick and Morty. They'd have gone into a store on the way home and the guy

705
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,360
behind the counter taught them about Rick and Morty on their way home. Do you

706
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,000
never see like like large like especially in this in this neighborhood. There's

707
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,640
like large immigrant families that you're like why in God's fucking name

708
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,800
did you move to New York City? Yeah, why would you move to the most expensive

709
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,240
city in the country move to fucking move to Kansas? Yeah, if I was coming from

710
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:29,280
another country, there's no way I would move to New York. No, pay $2000 for rent

711
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,100
and have to like fucking it's not right to have a family here. No, it's wrong.

712
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,480
It's morally wrong, completely wrong. You have to you have to be yeah. It's

713
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,200
children should not have to have keys. Children should have their own country.

714
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,760
Do you agree kids should not have to have keys? Yeah, if you are under the

715
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,360
age of fifteen, you should not have to have a key to your house. It should be

716
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,840
it should be so it should be like a

717
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,000
driver's license moment when you get your key. Yeah, you should be like I

718
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,160
remember the first time I got my key to and I put my little thing on it and I

719
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,400
went. I got a key. Mine was a Red Sox key. Holy because that was I didn't even like

720
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,600
my Red Sox. That was the only option they had at the like Home Depot. That's

721
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,620
awesome. It was like yeah, you can have this. It was like it was literally you

722
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:15,400
can either have the Red Sox key or you can have this like pink fuzzy key. You

723
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,760
should have done the pink. Yeah, but I remember so I was like I got my key for

724
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,200
the front door. I got my key for the back door, which I would never ever use. Of

725
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,760
course, it goes through the basement. There's no reason to ever have it, and

726
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,300
and then I got like a third key for like it was literally like I wanted the key.

727
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,220
I was like I think the third key was literally like a closet or something

728
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,660
something that was never locked and I would never, but I was like I need

729
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,520
three keys on my key ring. You have to you just got to have a man because I

730
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,040
got a jingle yeah check it out yeah. I was wearing a key ring me to my keys

731
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,500
are getting my keys are blowing up. Yeah me too. I have way this this this

732
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,940
office was is a huge because there's two locks man or multiple locks. There's

733
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,280
too much. Yeah, look at all my keys man. Here's one that my mom here's a not a

734
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,800
key that my mom got me. That is a fake key. This is Caleb. That's not I have a

735
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:06,040
fake key on my key ring too. Oh, you do. Well, yours is a little cooler. Do you

736
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,600
know what this is from? What

737
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:12,320
my mom got me this for Christmas and it said I threw away the other part, but it

738
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,680
said it was key that said Caleb and then it was a little like piece of metal that

739
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,660
also was on a key ring that said the writer. Whoa, the writer. My mom got it

740
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,380
for me when I went to college. This is a promotional key, a plastic promotional

741
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,440
key for Disney's The Nutcracker and the Four Realms. That's beast man. I don't

742
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,600
even know what that is. Probably a musical, if I had to guess. Yeah, I think

743
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,160
it's a movie.

00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,200
don't think she has been out of town when I haven't also been out of town,

747
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,680

755
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:35,040

756
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,840
around? It's insane. These guys are I mean how this is a worthless life to live

757
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:47,400

758
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,440
takes care of a puppy. I feel like I feel like a dog who takes care. I feel

759
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,840
like some kind of mother dog. I really don't like it man. I literally instantly

760
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,240
within thirty six hours, every time I open my door, every time I open my door,

761
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,580
my entire house smells like farts yeah because I've just been farting in there

762
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,300
and there's nobody there to light a candle. The other thing I

763
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:12,140
I'm not I don't even try to do it, but within two hours the entire apartment is

764
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:17,620
trashed me to garbage. I don't even know what I do. There's areas that are

765
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,500
trash that I don't even remember touching yeah, and then I literally the

766
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,500
either the depending on what time she comes back the night before or the day

767
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,180
of I do it all. I clean everything. So this is probably every weekend when my

768
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,140
wife works like goes to work early in the morning and I don't have anything to

769
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,780
do and I have one day a week basically where I live like I'm living right now.

770
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:41,140
Yeah, the house is a fucking disaster in eight hours. It's crazy and then I

771
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:46,180
clean it. I put aside one hour before she gets home to stop watching movies and

772
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,760
playing video games on Sunday. This is clean the house. My this is my three

773
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,480
days in the middle of the week or like that.

774
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,540
What if she works from home Monday and Friday, so then Tuesday, Wednesday,

775
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:00,780
Thursday, I at least like I have a dog that goes crazy and he'll knock stuff

776
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,900
over, but I just won't touch it. What are you doing? How are you making the

777
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,540
house messy? I like it. I literally have no idea. Yeah, I think I just don't. I

778
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,620
just pick stuff up and then put it down in a weird place. There's socks in my

779
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,980
living room. I put socks everywhere in my house. I don't know where the fuck

780
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,720
these I don't remember that all the time. I think the dog might be taking my yeah,

781
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,160
maybe your dog is making Phil goes into the bedroom and takes when he wants

782
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,560
attention because he's not allowed in there. He'll take dirty clothes out of

783
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,680
the hamper yeah and he'll bring them into the living room. It'll just chew on

784
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,420
them till you notice yeah. I live. I have the most beautiful

785
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:39,400
my wife is at work neat life, because I have a I have a guy in my life that I

786
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,860
pay his. I pay his bills so that he can three days a week play eight hours.

787
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,700
And I don't get bored the day

788
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,720
yeah, I literally every day she's at work. I text him at eleven AM. I say

789
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,520
what a play I text him. I say day of play

790
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,580
and then we play for five hours. It's funny that you may have the same exact

791
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,780
relationship with you, but I don't like that he started splitting time with you,

792
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,320
because I had him first. Well, I hit it first. No, no, I hit it. He's with the

793
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,900
real man now. No, yeah, nope. He likes he actually likes that. I make him play

794
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,180
games that he doesn't even like at all.

795
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:21,420
That's actually what he likes. Now he likes someone who listens to his

796
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,460
problems and feelings and cares about him. I'm a good friend. I was worse

797
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:24,980
problems

798
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:30,940
because I'm a real man. Yeah, you're toxic. I'm not you're talking. You only

799
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:36,820
you're black and brown. I have more colors on today. I'm wearing my shirt.

800
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,820
You guys made fun of me for wearing that one time. Yeah, yeah, but she's with a

801
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,660
real man. Now a man who wears pink, so just black, brown and white, full pink

802
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,440
outfit on

803
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,100
doing that, but yeah, but only talk about the yeah, many words, pink and red

804
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,900
driving a Mary Kay escalade.

805
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,100
Yeah, she's a with a real man. Now a guy who cooks all his meals with an easy

806
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,340
bake of it. I was talking to people about it. He's a real Fisher price man. Did

807
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:06,820
have an easy bake oven growing up. No, I had a bug zapper. It made it had metal a

808
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:13,180
metal mould tray that made silicone bugs. Oh, I remember this and they were gummy.

809
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,360
No, you didn't eat them. I mean they were gummy in texture. I think there was

810
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,520
one that made gummies that you could eat to have around. They were like fishing

811
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,340
bait. They were silicone bugs. I mean,

812
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,340
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

813
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,500
I had an Easy-Bake oven and I begged for it when I was a kid

814
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,180
and then my dad finally gave in and it came and it was,

815
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,040
they only made it a giant pink oven with flowers on it.

816
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,880
And yeah, my dad--

817
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,520
- Did you not have an oven in your house?

818
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,820
- No, we had a normal oven, but I wanted the Easy-Bake.

819
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,860
- What's the difference?

820
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,300
- Easy-Bake is like a, it's just a,

821
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,380
basically a really low powered air fryer.

822
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,220
- Okay.

823
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,100
- And it comes with like premade,

824
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,840
like mixes for like making brownies and stuff.

825
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,640
and my dad actually the like week after Christmas put me in football.

826
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,740
I like got the easy bake oven. I was making brownies. I was drawing hearts on

827
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,640
them with frosting and he was like, okay, well, you're going to be a football

828
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:12,960
player now. Yeah, I was fucking terrified of the oven and stove as a kid. I would

829
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,720
not touch it.

830
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:21,160
Why? Because it had fire and got hot. It does get a gas stove, but did you and it

831
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,760
scared me so bad. Just the just the I mean, truly if the click is scary, yeah,

832
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,480
the click of the I was going to say if it didn't have the click, I feel like I

833
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,640
would have had a comp I would have been have felt completely. I wasn't that

834
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,560
scared of the oven. I was scared of the stove. The stove is a little bit scary.

835
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,080
Yeah, you know what I always I hated those. I burned myself so many times

836
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,360
because my grandma had one of those stove tops, the glass ones that get

837
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,040
really hot.

838
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:47,560
I don't know can convection. Yeah, I think I know you're talking about yeah,

839
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,740
they're like black glass that turns into a big red ring yeah and every once in a

840
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,160
while she would cook something and then I'd walk in the kitchen. I'd be like

841
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,600
well, Nana, I'm really excited for this meal lean on it on it.

842
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,200
Just burn the shit out of myself. Yeah, my dad would also always tell me the

843
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,260
story that when he was a kid, his mom was like cooking something in a pot and he

844
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,840
was like, ooh smells good and he took the lid off the pot and leaned in to

845
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,120
smell it and all the steam went into his face and burned his entire face. So I

846
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,800
I think that also is like a pressure cooker. Yeah,

847
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,700
that's cool yeah. So I think that also scared me pretty bad yeah. I'm gonna have

848
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:26,700
to do cooking and stuff. I mean I already that's a thing. Oh, I do all the

849
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,020
girl. Yeah, you're the you're the girl of the house. I clean and I cook, but I

850
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,920
only cook, but I only do it when because she's right yeah, there's no exact yeah.

851
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,240
I mean

852
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,880
even if I was the guy, even if I was cooking at all the meals, I wouldn't be

853
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,840
doing that for myself. I feel like I would still be eating. Well, I'm not

854
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,420
gonna make like a chicken and rice and broccoli for myself. I'm gonna last night

855
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,180
chicken tenders. Yeah, that's when I had four beers. That's what it should be.

856
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,940
Yeah, wow beer and I was up till two thirty in the morning damn and I knew I

857
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:01,180
had to come in and record early. That's the worst going to bed figuring out

858
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,140
when to go to bed. Yeah, because I don't know. I don't have a bedtime anymore

859
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,860
because she has a bedtime. So I have a bedtime. Yeah, but if she's not here,

860
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:11,940
what the fuck am I doing going to sleep so early man? I have YouTube videos to

861
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:15,440
you watch making you sad, sad, thinking about being lonely.

862
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,320
You're not even alone. I know I'm thinking about times I've been lonely in

863
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,840
my life for

864
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:27,560
three days on it. I will say last night I was I was sitting on my computer yeah

865
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,700
and the clock struck midnight and my first thought was like I'm fifteen years

866
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,060
old. Oh yeah, because I was when I was fifteen years old. I'd sit there. I

867
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,300
played tribes ascend and I'd listen to

868
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,280
YouTube videos. I when I was sixteen, I would stay up till six AM. Yeah, I

869
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,720
didn't go to school about anything.

870
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,440
Just who cares I do. I was lying in. I was I was awake lying in bed on

871
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:53,440
Wikipedia on my phone nerd. Yeah, nerd man. Yeah, not even up playing video

872
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,720
games or doing it. I would just be

873
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,520
yeah, yeah, doing nothing. If I could do it all over again,

874
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,000
military, I've started going to bed much earlier than I used to like and in the

875
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,520
past

876
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,860
In the past two years, my bedtime is shifted by, I would say, about

877
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:16,060
four hours earlier. Backward, yeah, yeah. There was a while I was going to bed

878
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,280
at 9 30 and it was amazing. I was like this is amazing. I woke up at 6 30

879
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,380
every day. I went to the gym and then I went out of town one time and I

880
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,580
haven't done it since. When I lived in Boston, my bedtime was 2 AM every

881
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:30,500
night. I would stay up till 2 AM. That's a really funny bedtime. Yeah,

882
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,720
well, that was the time, yeah, that was the time when I was like, I was like,

883
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,740
okay. If the clock says 2 a.m. I need to get it as I would just and again I'll be

884
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,480
doing nothing. I'd be up watching TV. I tried taking a melatonin the other day,

885
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,100
which I don't take very often because you're bad for you. I stopped taking it.

886
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,580
They're really bad for you, but I took one the other day because I just

887
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,780
couldn't sleep at all and it completely ruined my next day. Yeah, that's I

888
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,740
cannot believe I used to take it all the time. I feel terrible, but I felt like I

889
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,740
felt I wish it would have been better for me to just stay up dude. The crazy

890
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:05,420
thing about melatonin is that the like maximum dose that you're supposed to

891
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:09,340
take is ten milligrams. Yeah, and they sell like fifteen. Yeah, that's what I

892
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,420
mean. They sell it in like twenty. Yeah, I take three milligrams. I take like I

893
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,220
take well, I don't take it anymore, but when I was taking it a bunch, I would
