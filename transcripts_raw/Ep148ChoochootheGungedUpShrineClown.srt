00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,180
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,020
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,840
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,300
- Back with my tooth.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,140
- Turn up.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,980
- Back with some food.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,300
Fuck, I love food.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,260
I love to eat.

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,540
I have just one feet.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,140
Fuck, I'm hopping around, around the town.

13
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm looking brown.

14
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm looking, I got a crown 'cause I'm the king.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,740
I do the thing.

16
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,580
I'm about to sing.

17
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,420
- La, ooh.

18
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,820
- God damn.

19
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,820
- Damn dude.

20
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,800
- Fuck.

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,640
- That was beautiful.

22
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,460
- That was so crazy.

23
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,880
You got me feeling lazy and outside it looks hazy

24
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,340
and it is so crazy.

25
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,000
How crazy it looks outside it's so crazy.

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,220
That hazy clouds outside around.

27
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,100
I'm looking brown.

28
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:46,940
I'm on the town.

29
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,720
I'm wearing a crown 'cause I'm the king

30
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,740
and I'm gonna sing.

31
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,580
- La, la, la, la.

32
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,780
- Did we?

33
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,460
Oh my God, did we both say that we're looking brown?

34
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,420
Wow.

35
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,160
What an insane rhyme that is.

36
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,480
You know, I mean, when you're freestyling,

37
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,640
everything's on the table.

38
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,480
- Yeah, you just leave.

39
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,200
(laughing)

40
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
- Yeah, if it rhymes, it's okay.

41
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
- Yeah. - That's the rule.

42
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,360
- I was just at the beach, you know, so I, you know,

43
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,040
I'm, you can see I'm nice and tan.

44
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,880
It was beautiful.

45
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,220
- It was so amazing, like summer ray.

46
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,440
- I was surfing, I was windsurfing, I was swimming,

47
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,800
I was, you know, I was kickboarding.

48
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,640
Yep, I was windsurfing on a, I--

49
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
- I was flip sharking.

50
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
- Yeah, I was flip sharking.

51
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
I was, you know, I was like surfing on a lobster.

52
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,200
Like I was standing on a lobster and it was swimming.

53
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,480
Like a boat. - That's insane.

54
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,120
I'm thinking about this, why are there not more like,

55
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,680
okay, so you guys, you know like storm chasers, right?

56
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,600
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

57
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
- Why do people not like do that with like bears

58
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
and sharks and like dangerous animals?

59
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,440
- Grizzly man.

60
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,000
- Grizz, oh, I've been owned.

61
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
- And sharks can swim, so I mean.

62
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,320
- Yeah, I don't think, - Men can swim.

63
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,160
- Is there a shark grizzly man?

64
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Is there like a, is there a shark man?

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
- There are people who do like shark cages and shit.

66
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,360
I don't think you can follow a shark around because like--

67
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,340
- Yeah, you can't.

68
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,840
- Well, no, 'cause like humans, like, you know, if you--

69
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,900
- Yeah, I totally could.

70
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,240
- If you go underwater too fast or come up too fast,

71
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,800
you'll just explode, so like--

72
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
- No.

73
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,960
- That is funny. - If the shark like, yeah.

74
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,560
- It's funny that like, if you go down stairs

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
to the bottom of the ocean too fast,

76
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,520
and then you come back up, your blood explodes.

77
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,560
- Exactly, it's one of those things that makes you realize

78
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
like maybe God's creation isn't so beautiful after all.

79
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
Like maybe he didn't think of anything.

80
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,760
if you swim too fast you explode.

81
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,520
If God loved us he would let us swim fast.

82
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,800
It definitely is like yeah you're not like God if God exists he did not mean to

83
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,600
make humans like the number one because if we swim too far down we turn into a

84
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
cube.

85
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,760
He saw what was like pressed into a fucking like perfect cube.

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
He created us and he was like well these these things aren't gonna be able to fly

87
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
okay and then we made planes and he's like well listen up you fuckers are not

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,320
going down you may have figured out a way to go up but how much of the ocean isn't

89
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,040
like explored? 100% 100% of the ocean yeah 100% yeah nobody's ever seen

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
because you because you can't see underwater. We've only explored

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,080
0.1% of the ocean 0.0000001% I mean just whatever is on the beach pretty much yeah

92
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,240
yeah mostly like seashells and hermit crabs and all that. Once it once the waves like

93
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,520
when the wave is on the beach, I'll look at that part of the ocean.

94
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,840
You think one day, I mean it's probably not going to be in our lifetime, but one day we're

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,160
going to be able to fuck in, we're going to be able to go down deeper in the ocean and

96
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,920
we're not going to like what we see.

97
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920
That's pretty true.

98
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,880
You think so?

99
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Alright.

100
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,400
And what is it that you think that we will see in the ocean?

101
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,640
Monster.

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,500
You think we will see monster?

103
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Sea monster.

104
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,080
Guys, Patrick, place your bet on how much, what percent of the ocean is actually explored.

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,280
and charted. 98% like no has been explored so you think 2% yes I'm gonna go also 2%

106
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,660
it's 5% has been explored. Wow that's way more. That's pretty impressive dude. I mean I mean it was

107
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,380
charting the ocean is probably pretty boring because you're just like oh it's

108
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:16,260
flat down here maybe some rocks right. Now see how much has been explored by a fish.

109
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Google buy a fish.

110
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,940
See if that is a result for that.

111
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Oh yep, it says 100%.

112
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Wow, that's amazing dude.

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:28,220
That's the thing, if you're like, if you're one of these like, like deep sea fish, like

114
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
deep deep sea.

115
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,940
One of the ones that they made ugly because they knew nobody would ever see it.

116
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
Yeah.

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
Yeah.

118
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940

The god, yeah.

121
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
Yeah, okay.

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,260
Yeah, who do you think, besides god, nobody else is making fish.

126
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
I don't know.

127
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
The sea man.

128
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
The sea man.

129
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
The sea man.

130
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,260
The strange conspiracy theory that nobody else has ever heard of.

131
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,940
Yeah, there's a guy at the bottom of the ocean.

132
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,940
He's called the sea man.

133
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
A group of...

134
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
Well, you were asking about they, so I mean...

135
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,260
Well, I don't want to give them a gender.

Yeah, honestly, I only saw that it was like-- Michael Storch would be a better name.

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,040
I saw that newspaper article because Josiah Photoshopped me into it.

169
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,720
I will say, one thing that people are right about is like, sometimes you will be at a

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,240
pool party in the South, right?

171
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,360
you'll be like at a friend's house you'll be sitting on a floaty or whatever and

172
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,040
then you will look down at between your legs and you will see that it is a

173
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Confederate flag floaty that you were sitting on that's a you know that's a

193
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:05,360
Alonzo Slayback is either a confederate officer or like the coolest black guy of all time.

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320

We're not covering everything right now.

202
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,800
We're like Indiana Jones right now.

203
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,580
we're getting to the bottom of this yeah you guys ever know anybody's a Freemason

204
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,800
no I didn't know anyone who's a Freemason but no I mean we went to

205
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,640
school next to a Masonic temple yeah a lot so I probably play in a Mason's lodge

206
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,080
yeah and in high school yeah the same as the Masonic no no no no no no no

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,640
hardcore shows at the Elk's Lodge. I'm picky and choosy with who they who they make a like Illuminati

208
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,320
because I knew this my dad has this friend has been a Mason for like 40 years

209
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,520
and he does like linoleum floors.

210
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,360
- Well yeah.

211
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,600
- And when I asked him, I was like, what's it like?

212
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
And he was like, oh, it's pretty much

213
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
like free barbecue like twice a week.

214
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,080
- You know that-- - That sounds kinda sick.

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
- The Illuminati is just one of the biggest

216
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
MLM schemes of all time.

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,680
- Yeah, absolutely dude, yeah.

218
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,040

One day you're gonna get to drive our big pyramid Cadillac.

222
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320

226
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,920
guess you know cuz when you get invited there's a party and like do you have to

227
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,360
be initiated oh for sure do you get a gun and a badge you don't get a gun all right

228
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
They want to take our guns away.

229
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Do you get a cool hat?

230
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
Oh yeah, you get a fez.

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Woah, no that's the fucking...

232
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
the other one.

233
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
The Elks Lodge?

234
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
No, they're not that one.

235
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
The Shriners.

236
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
The hospital?

237
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yeah, they sponsor hospitals and shit.

238
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
That's like the hospital for like burned kids.

239
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,360
The Shriners hospital is for burned kids?

240
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,120
is for burned kids. Well at least there was one. Cause they keep fucking barbecuing all

241
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,760
these kids at some fucked up camp. No they come to parades and they drive tiny little

242
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,200
red cars and wear fezes. You never saw them before? You're thinking of clowns. No look

250
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Illuminati was like that yeah I mean I wouldn't have all these goddamn

251
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,640
To be honest, I didn't know until like this very second that it was like any type of community.

252
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,320
I just thought it was guys who like to ride little cars.

253
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah, no, Shriners are like the, I think that they probably have like a battle with the Masons.

254
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Yeah.

255
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Like good versus evil, you know?

256
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,600
Yeah, the Shriners are like the, like, it's like the rival summer camps.

257
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,960
And the Shriners are like, like the, like the one, I don't know.

258
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,580
like the jobs I never like or keys or meat masons are like fat camp and then

259
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,240
the holders are like oh yeah you're not coming to the pool party dad's gonna be

260
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,000
the writers are not trying to are masons what something listen I take it all

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,480
that Reiner's International also commonly known as the Shriners or

262
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,640
formerly known as ancient Arabic order of the nobles of the mystic shrine the

263
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,000
Masonic society established in 1870.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No!

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
We were just fucking talking these guys up.

266
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Does Masonic mean that they're Freemasons though?

267
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Are the Shriners Freemasons?

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,920
Let's see here.

269
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
And it's funny, it's like Masonry.

270
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
All Shriners are Masons, but not all Masons are Shriners.

271
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,400
A Shriners International is a spin-off from Freemasonry.

272
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,800
Man, you know, you might be a Shriner.

273
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,520
They did a Fast and Furious spin-off of the Freemasons.

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,200
You either go pedophile or tiny car is what you're telling me.

275
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
You come to a crossroads.

276
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Okay, it's a kid sized car.

277
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
It's a kid sized car.

278
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,600
Yeah, you take the kid, I'll take the car.

279
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm a shriner.

280
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
I want the little car.

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
And I want it now.

282
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
I got a parade to go to.

283
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,200
It's so funny, it's just like Mason, it's just buildings.

284
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,560
You're just making buildings.

285
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,280
Why is that the most evil people on earth?

286
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,560
Because they can make any building they want, dude.

287
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,080
They're playing fucking Starcraft.

288
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
You know what?

289
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
That is true.

290
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,120
They can fucking build a base at any point.

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,520
All these buildings, all these shitty like new modern buildings, we stopped letting the

292
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,360
masons build buildings and now we got all these fucking cubes.

293
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,480
Exactly dude, they understood that a good building needs a gargoyle.

294
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Yeah.

295
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Yeah.

296
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,520
A gargoyle and like just some weird mural in like a fucking, in the middle, made out

297
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,160
of like a mosaic of like a beaver.

298
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,000
That's a good fucking building man.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,680
Guys, what?

300
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,680
The Shriners are committed to community service and have been instrumental in countless public

301
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,880
projects throughout their domain. Shriners host the annual East West Shrine Game, a college

302
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
football all-star game.

303
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,600
What? The East West Shrine Bowl?

304
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,840
Many shrine centers also hold a yearly shrine circus as a fundraiser. And then there's an

305
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,000
image in this Wikipedia page of a Shriner Clown.

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,280
There's Shriner Clowns?

307
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
A Shriner Clown.

308
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
I would hate to break down-

309
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
He looks fucked up.

310
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Dude, this guy, if I saw this clown, this is the most evil clown I've ever seen.

311
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Shriner clown.

312
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,520
You know when they put like, I'll send this picture, you know when they put like a Halloween,

313
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,880
like a, make a Halloween mask of a clown and it's like, oh you made it too creepy, like

314
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
it's not scary?

315
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Yeah.

316
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,960
This is like what an actual scary clown looks like.

317
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,320
I would kill myself if I saw this clown walking up to me.

318
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah, these are like clowns that you've never actually seen in color because they're in

319
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,080
like all the scary black and white movies.

320
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Yeah, this is a horrible clown.

321
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Fuck.

322
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Fuck that clown.

323
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
Yeah, I don't fuck with this clown at all.

324
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,800
I would hate to break down in like a town that's like run by the Shriners because you like call

325
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,520
AAA and a tiny tow truck shows up.

326
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,560
Alright, Hitcher, might take a while.

327
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,360
Oh you go to like the mechanic in a Shriner town?

328
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Yeah.

329
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
It's just like the fucking...

330
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120
The ceiling's four feet tall.

331
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,840
The tools are way too small.

332
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,760
You show up in like a fucking suburban.

333
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,640
What kind of damn car you got here?

334
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Where'd you get this?

335
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
The Amazon?

336
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Jesus Christ!

337
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Jesus Christ!

338
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,560
Don't you know there's a Shriner town?

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,040
here's the info box that came up shrine clowns are often considered the most

342
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,400
visible ambassadors of the shrine organization headquartered in

343
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,040
Springfield Massachusetts the Melhurst shrine clown unit is very active in

344
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,840
parades charity benefits festivals and corporate outings all shrine clowns

345
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,720
donate their time and resources as unpaid volunteers.

346
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,640
I think these motherfuckers are more evil.

347
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,320
They have a fucking clown task force.

348
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,880
Imagine being-

349
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
Yeah, they have a clown team too.

350
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,840
We have a shrine clown task force.

351
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,160
We've been-

352
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,680
Oh, their logo.

353
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,160
Maybe the fucking Shriners were like,

354
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,960
"Oh yeah, no, the Illuminati, yeah, the fucking free-

355
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,840
"The Illuminati's 100%.

356
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,600
"That's the bad guys right there."

357
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,160
No, meanwhile, these fucking clowns are doing all this bullshit.

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,840
Shrine clown, I can tell that's a phrase

359
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
that will just be stuck in my head for a year.

360
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
Shrine Clown.

361
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
What the fuck?

362
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,600
Why is that font, why is the font like, it's like Chinese font.

363
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,840
It's like what they put on like a, on a kung fu, it's like, kung fu lessons for kids.

364
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,920
I'm pretty, I'm pretty anti-clown in general, but once you give them guns and walkie talkies

365
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
and shit, I'm out.

366
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,760
God, we can't remember if they have a button on their website to request clowns.

367
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, I'll request.

368
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't press that button!

369
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,960
All your windows bust open, they're all fucking zip-lined.

370
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,360
The Melha Shrine Clown's greatest contribution to the welfare of mankind is to warm a heart

371
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
with a smile.

372
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
If you would like to have the Melha Shrine Clowns at your event, please see the requirements

373
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
at the link below.

374
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,600
And then they have a clown's prayer too.

375
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Fuck that dude.

376
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
They have a clown prince!

377
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
What?!

378
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
No shot.

379
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:42,040
The clown prince is a real thing, it's not just something you call the Joker?

380
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
I guess.

381
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,380
Shrine or clown prince.

382
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Is he beautiful?

383
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Oh he better be.

384
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,040
Harold Michael bust my dad's a fucking clown name

385
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm just like wandering. I just through websites here

386
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,500
And I just got to this Pinterest link of of choo-choo the answer shrine clown and look

387
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,220
Dude I don't I'm done fucking with this dude. We're gonna get killed. Oh my

388
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
We keep talking about this

389
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,700
Tell this clown is not wearing any pants

390
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,640
This cloud is like wet and messy on his legs

391
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,780
Shrine guns a gun shrine cloud

392
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,340
- - the gun shrine cloud

393
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,820
All right

394
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,420
Go ahead and say I have nothing against these clowns. I think they're normal

395
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,340
I don't want you guys doing a fucking payday 2 at my house man.

396
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,340
I don't need that shit.

397
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
I'd rather fucking bust in with the clown shit.

398
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
It's all a joke on the...

399
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
It's a comedy podcast, don't try to attack me.

400
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:57,180
Yeah dude, you're going to look out your window, there's going to be a small white van parked

401
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,020
out front with no windows.

402
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,020
The fuck dude.

403
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
With an antenna.

404
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,140
A tiny antenna on top that's shaped like a bow tie that's spinning.

405
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,100
And then it starts driving away going like, "Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

406
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,220
You're gonna get owned, bro.

407
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,180
We need to start our own secret society.

408
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,020
You come home from work early and you open up the door to your apartment and there's

409
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,540
just a hundred clowns crammed into your kitchen, like, trying to bug it all at the same time.

410
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,420
Just tripping over each other.

411
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,340
We should have gave out membership cards at the live show.

412
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,460
We should have started our own society.

413
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,460
We can still do that.

414
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,460
That would have been a good move.

415
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,880
Speaking of the live show,

416
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,420
a lot of people met my fucking mom.

417
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,360
Yeah, dude, lucky them.

418
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,580
You met my mom.

419
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,420
Yep, lucky me.

420
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,400
A lot of people have formed--

421
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,580
Your mom touched me.

422
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,520
Amazing friendships with my mom.

423
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,220
Yeah.

424
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,060
Yeah.

425
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,180
Yeah, dude, that's why I was like,

426
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,740
don't bring your family, bro.

427
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,580
I know.

428
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,100
Yeah, they also, you know,

429
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,620
meeting somebody's parents is really demystifying

430
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,060
'cause you're like, I know exactly what proportion

431
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,100
of both of these people is in this person I know.

432
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,940
Right.

433
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,780
Yeah, you look at them--

434
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,740
I know why you are the way you are.

435
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,460
- Yeah, you look at them and go to the Fallout VAC system

436
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
and you just get every piece of info

437
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,060
you could possibly want about Patrick

438
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,940
when you look at his parents.

439
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,380
So it's not a good situation to be in.

440
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,780
Yeah, I don't like that.

441
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,860
Thank you to everybody for coming out to that, by the way.

442
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,700
- Oh yeah, thank you.

443
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,540
- Hope you had a lot of fun.

444
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,100
- I mean, we did give out the DVDs.

445
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,940
I guess those can count as the membership,

446
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,980
but we didn't give them out to a lot of people.

447
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,220
I think next show, that's what we do.

448
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,580
We get business cards and then we have a thing on it

449
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,520
that says sign your name here, something like that.

450
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
We need a mailing list, I think.

451
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,020
Yeah.

452
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,520
So it's like the first step to a cult, unfortunately.

453
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,520
It's like a mailing list or a call list.

454
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Yeah, I mean we have one. Patreon is, I mean, has that.

455
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
That's true. I guess we haven't been using our cult resources enough.

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
We haven't been good about our cult resources.

457
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,520
We do have to start, we have to start, you know, the organization that will defeat the shrine clowns.

458
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Yeah, we do need to have kind of an anti-clown.

459
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
What's the opposite of a clown?

460
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
What's the opposite of a clown?

461
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
A mummy?

462
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Probably a mummy.

463
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,180
- Not a mummy, dude.

464
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,020
- I don't know.

465
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,900
- No, 'cause here's the thing I thought of.

466
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,920
- Here's the litmus test.

467
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,420
- Clowns are the ones that are afraid of mice

468
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,380
and they eat peanuts, right?

469
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,340
- If it shows up at a birthday party and people like it,

470
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,080
it's too close to a clown.

471
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,420
I think a mummy would be big.

472
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,940
- People would not like it if a mummy showed up.

473
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,980
- Are you fucking kidding me, dude?

474
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,540
I'd do everything to that mummy.

475
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,920
- A magician.

476
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,900
- No, a magician is like exactly a clown.

477
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,740
- A magician is like a subtype of clown.

478
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,060
- A magician's a clown, stupid.

479
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,740
- A magician is literally, it's a subtype of clown.

480
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,580
It's like a--

481
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,180
subtype of clown they do tricks. It's the same thing with the Shriners and the Freemasons.

482
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,420
Clowns do tricks too. A magician is just a clown that's too shy to wear bright colors.

483
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,860
Yeah. It's a goth clown. Yeah. Yeah. Who thinks that it needs to do dark magic. I think the

484
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,300
opposite of a clown I guess would be like an insurance agent or something. Yeah. Or like

485
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,660
a hedgehog. Opposite. Or like maybe like a rock. Yeah. I had to think about it. A rock

486
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,220
might be the exact opposite of a clown. I'm looking up, I looked up what is the opposite

487
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,020
of a clown. What do you think you're gonna find? Okay, Killjoy, Bore, Pessimist, Moaner,

488
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:16,060
Mope, Miserabilist, Party Pooper, Prude, Damper. No, those are descriptors. We could call them

489
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,920
dampers or something like that or miserabilists. I don't want to... Then that makes us sound

490
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,760
like the bad guys. We're trying to fight this fucking clown Al-Qaeda. We gotta have real

491
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,520
people and we need people on our side. Okay? What about the regular guys?

492
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,920
That's yeah okay. Yeah regular what about the normal society? Nobody is Irish.

493
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,240
That's the number one rule. What? Yeah. That's too close to a clown. That's what

494
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,400
the fuck? Red nose. Yeah dude. Big puffy red nose. Big puffy ass red nose. Big red

495
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,040
cheeks. Red hair. True. Yeah inability to walk a straight line. Yeah really stupid.

496
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,040
there's too many of them yep yeah always the hell is going on right now dude

508
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,460
right yeah yeah you're right you got me you're fucking Israeli. Look I want to

509
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,780
say my bad I'm sorry about all that crap that's happening. Oh that bull crap who

510
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,360
even knows what it is but it's yeah but it's fully Patrick's fault that's all. I

511
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,980
also want to clear up that one time that that we did we didn't have the theme

512
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,640
song in it wasn't because of what's going on over there was because I forgot to

513
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,220
put it in and then Patrick told some people that it was because you know we

514
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,140
didn't want to be attached to Israel and then I put that I didn't know that he

515
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,280
told people that so I put the song back in because I just forgot it one time by

516
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,180
accident it seemed like we were like yeah it's over we support it now so just

517
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,900
so you know you know it's funny for us to draw a line on that like right now

518
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:45,860
yeah it's like Israel Israel just this year went too far yeah yeah great thing

519
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:57,540
to bring up that's hilarious

520
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm just saying it's like one of the worst things a country could ever do.

521
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Oh yeah.

522
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Oh yeah, dude.

523
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,220
We uh, but we, you know, I, the thing is, I'm, my opinion is whatever Biden decides.

524
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
That's my guy.

525
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
I'm sticking with him.

526
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Oh yeah, we're, we're becoming breadtubers.

527
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,020
I don't know if you know, all those like guys online that complain about like, uh, they

528
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,620
say like Chapo is Biden adjacent or whatever.

529
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,620
Uh, no, that's us.

530
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,940
We're the, uh, we're the fucking, we're becoming political.

531
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,940
I mean, if you, yeah, I mean, that's the one thing.

532
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Yeah.

533
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:33,940
That's right, I'm going to start fucking sitting on bad dragon dildos and shit on cam.

534
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah.

535
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
Why is that with that?

536
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Why is there...

537
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
And that is all for Joe Biden.

538
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,300
Yeah, I'm doing it for him.

539
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:45,060
Dude, I'm sending him all the fucking fuck tokens that I get on the fucking campsites.

540
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,540
Why do women want to have sex with a dragon?

541
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,220
Or men, I don't know.

542
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,980
Why is there a dragon penis that sells so many coffees?

543
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,620
I think it's a texture thing.

544
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,940
I think it's a texture thing. So if I was fucking, if I if I looked like the fantastic for the

545
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,860
thing you think I'd get a lot of pussy? I think some people would be interested in

546
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,660
having sex with you. In a gravel penis? Yeah. Alright dude I might have to become a scientist.

547
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,740
Yeah, wait. I don't know that much about the thing. Is his, is it like bit, he got bit by a rock.

548
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,540
He did not get bit by a rock. He did not get bit by a rock. Well no, is it, is it like

549
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
He got cosmic rays.

550
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,500
Cobblestone completely or is it like fleshy cobblestone?

551
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,660
I think it's just rocks.

552
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,140
I think he's just like made of rocks.

553
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,500
Yeah, he's just made out of rocks.

554
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,980
I mean I feel like it wouldn't be a very good power if it's like I just look like I'm made

555
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,020
of rocks but I don't, I'm not actually like strong or hard or anything.

556
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,180
I have all the strength of a rock but I can still bleed because it's flesh.

557
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
You can still pinch me.

558
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,660
That could just be bad dude.

00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,380
You just have like a, then he just has a bunch of like butt cracks all over his body.

560
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380

589
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,980
at a song yeah

590
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,020
Well I just, I mean probably any butthole we can imagine what it would look like on him.

591
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,380
Let's just search up man's butthole.

592
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,140
These people, these people drawing these Namor, you know, I might, yeah, 34 things.

593
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
They're so uninventive.

594
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
I might just, you know, Henry Butthole.

595
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
Oh no, that's, okay.

596
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Search that, just see what comes up.

597
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
That's a load.

598
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,020
I thought that they gave him a dick ring.

599
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
I was excited.

600
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,020
A load?

601
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,340
Yeah, like there's jizz.

602
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,420
He's coming a perfect ring?

603
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,980
It looked like a ring in his, it looked like a Prince Albert.

604
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Or he can control water, right?

605
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Oh, shit!

606
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,980
If Namor can control water, he can probably control cum, right?

607
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
So he can shoot it out and make it...

608
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,980
He can at least control the water part of it and just like white dust will keep going.

609
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,980
He can probably fucking bend it like a balloon animal once he pulls it out of his dick.

610
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
That'd be pretty impressive.

611
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,980
Here, here's a dog. Put this in your mouth.

612
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
A dog?

613
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Yeah, you make a dog with a balloon animal.

614
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Oh, god.

615
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,980
What's wrong with you, Pat?

616
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,980
I thought you said he was putting his cum in a dog.

617
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Well, he could probably do that. He's evil. He could probably do that, too.

618
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,980
Well, he's sometimes evil. Depends.

619
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,980
I'm sorry. I just laughed because I looked at the list again that we have.

620
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,980
I didn't even mean that as a segue. I just opened the tab and laughed immediately because I saw the picture.

621
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,980
We're doing a list from the pick-up lines dot net.

622
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,980
I can tell we'll be back to this website. This is a really good website.

623
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,980

624
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,980
and this list is "Top 47 Suicide Pickup Lines"

625
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,980

So there's 47...

627
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,980
Very good. 47 of them is nuts too.

Suicide pickup lines.

629
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:41,980
I think there's some repeating ones here.

630
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
Here, I mean I can come up with one right now.

631

634
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,980
That's on here.

635
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Is it?

636
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,980
I don't know, I haven't read it yet.

637
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
How did you know there were repeats?

638
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980

This will work every time. You can't spell suicide without you and I.

674
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,940
Do you say that in the thing? That's also a threat. That's not a pickup line.

675
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:22,780
That's a "we are going to commit suicide." That's way more about suicide than it is about picking somebody up.

676
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,440
Yeah.

677
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,940
You can't say that to somebody.

678
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,380
Number four, this one's not safe for work.

679
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,720
So don't use these suicide pickup lines. Don't use that one.

680
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Not this number, everybody else,

681
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,680
they're just pretty fair game.

682
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,320
But this one, don't use this on your boss.

683
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,580
- Are you a suicidal turtle?

684
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,520
'Cause you can swallow my straw.

685
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,080
- I don't think they're committing suicide.

686
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,320
I think they think it's a worm.

687
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,920
- I don't know that straw is that flattering either,

688
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,760
I feel like.

689
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,640
- Yeah, here's my straw.

690
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,100
My coffee stirrer.

691
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,300
- Yeah, you a quill 'cause you can touch my needle.

692
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,040
My little tiny needle penis.

693
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,320
Do you wanna see my needle penis?

694
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,320
it's one inch bigger. Yeah, are you an elf? Because you can have my gumdrop. Maybe it would

695
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,320
be one that you could say. Life without you is like coding while GitHub is down. All I

696
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,000
can commit is suicide. What? That's like, there's so many intersections there. What? You have

697
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,640
to have some knowledge of GitHub and probably... So does she! Yeah, that's what I mean. I need

698
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,360
to know that know that commit can also be used in a github context and then they

699
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
have to like suicide jokes yeah I'm gonna read I mean this next six through nine

700
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm gonna read just in a row because this is how these are meant to be sent I

701
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,000
think this is a similar situation I agree are you suicide because you won't stop

702
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,480
crossing my mind are you suicide cuz you're always on my mind is your name

703
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,320
suicide cuz you're always on my mind are you suicide cuz I think about you a lot

704
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,120
that's the fucking same one also there's nothing hotter than explaining to a

705
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,160
woman at a bar that all you can do is think about suicide yeah no no oh fuck

706
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,860
he's so hot he wants also like yeah maybe a pickup line to a pickup line that

707
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,080
opens with I think about you all the time is also maybe not the way to go right

708
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,200
if you're approaching somebody for the first time I'm so hey I've been

709
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,720
following I've been thinking about you a lot you're kind of like suicide in that

710
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,680
way I'm realizing that suicide pickup line really sounds like a number you call

711
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,560
and I kill yourself doesn't really sound right number 10 are you diving suicides

712
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,520
because you make my heart rate race I don't know what that means there's a

713
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,360
picture here this picture is what made me laugh when what I clicked onto this

714
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,060
dad yeah there's a picture here it's just a guy and it says suicide pickup

715
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:52,660
line and then it's the turtle one but he looks concerned yeah he looks like

716
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:58,540
somebody is taking the photo against his will yeah okay so now we get into the

717
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,900
funny suicide pickup line yeah those other ones weren't funny yeah there's

718
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:08,180
only two of these were serious credible threats yeah there's only two of these

719
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,580
girl you must be suicide because I've been thinking about you all day and are

720
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,580
Are you a suicide bomber because you have blown me away?

721
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Don't say that one in Ireland.

722
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,580
No.

723
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,140
Those are not that funny.

724
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Pretty funny to me.

725
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,140
I think I would laugh.

726
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,140
But there's only two of those.

727
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,340
Then we get into the depressing pick up lines.

728
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Yeah.

729
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,780
Which is pretty good.

730
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,940
The same one, are you a suicide because I think about you every day.

731
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,500
They have to keep putting that in there.

732
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,980
Okay, this one is at least a joke.

733
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,180
This one is, "Are you a toaster?

734
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,420
Because I really want to take a bath with you."

735
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,420
That's good.

736
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,540
Yeah, I mean...

737
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,120
Are you a noose because I really want to hang with you?

738
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
It's good.

739
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah.

740
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Yeah.

741
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
Thanks, buddy.

742
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
"Are you a gravestone?

743
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,660
Because I really wish you were on top of me."

744
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,820
You didn't say if you would.

745
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,260
I will hang with you.

746
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,780
Aw, yay!

747
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
I will.

748
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Yay!

749
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
And I will fuck you.

750
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Yay!

751
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
Is that what you want?

752
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
I'm gonna fuck you and suck your penis.

753
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Yay!

754
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,780
I'm gonna finger your butt.

755
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,780
Here's one for your fucker.

756
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
Hey girl, is your name suicide?

757
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,780
Cause I can't stop thinking about you.

758
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,780
Oh that's pretty good.

759
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,780
That's actually pretty good.

760
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,780
What about this one?

761
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
Hey boy girl, are you suicide?

762
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,780
Because I think about doing you a lot.

763
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,780
That's pretty good man.

764
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,780
Okay so now I'm starting to see how they got 47.

765
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,780
A lot of filler here.

766
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
Are you antidepressants?

767
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,780
you every day I'm going to kill myself

768
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,700
this one is a damn girl is your last name suicide and then in asterisks no why

769
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:55,300
because I think about you every day is your last name suicide and then her

770
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:01,340
saying no no are you a coffin because I really wish I was inside you right now

771
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:06,340
These could be zombie or Dracula themed as well.

772
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
It's true.

773
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Between the gravestone and the coffin.

774
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Are you a coroner? Because I really want you to inspect my body.

775
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Ugh.

776
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Are you... this one's gross.

777
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,340
Are you an electrical outlet? Because I really want to stick my fingers in you.

778
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
[laughing]

779
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,340
That's pretty bold.

780
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,080
I mean like I get like yeah, you wanna I mean like good

781
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,860
Yeah, are you a fish cuz look at my worm or whatever?

782
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,380
But to walk up to a girl at a bar and be like I'm gonna put my fingers in you

783
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:41,580
Can I put my finger in your mouth I fucked up I fucked up the pickup line, I'm sorry

784
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:49,000
You see to count my fingers cuz all of them these going in you right now. You better like this. That's a bad pickup line

785
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,280
Not good

786
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,040
Are you traffic because running into you would really make my day

787
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,580
That would not that was confusing I would I would I would if somebody said that to me

788
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,280
I'll be like I think you got it got it wrong. I think you messed it up

789
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:09,220
Yeah, I think you're thinking of birthday cake. Yeah traffic. You don't want to run into traffic. You'll die

790
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,940
No, you understand

791
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,260
Yeah

792
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,460
Sinking shit because I really like to go down on you

793
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,100
Scroll down and look at this picture not the one right here, but the one look at the picture after it this picture is horrific

794
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,940
Okay

795
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:38,140
So this is a this will work every time you can't spell suicide without you and I and the photo is kind of a GQ style

796
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,020
like

797
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:46,060
Shot of a nude man who looks like he's trying to stab his own back. Yeah, he also has some like bizarre

798
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,020
Musculature going on to some yeah, it's shaped body. He's ripped

799
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,620
except then the rest of them are just are just repeats and I just need to read you

800
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,780
this this last paragraph here from this list use only working paropa and phrases

801
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,380
that can tie this for girls and all brace note that dirty phrases are funny but

802
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,020
don't use them in real life in practice saying sexual smooth suicide phrases to

803
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:16,100
someone you haven't picked up yet is usually just creepy sexual smooth side

804
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,900
races. Wait, I just found one. I just found an insane one too. Yeah, what's yours? This

805
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,720
one is top eight Japanese pickup lines. I have a really good one too. Do the Japanese

806
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,100
ones and then this one's good. Okay, there's only eight of these. This is pretty easy.

807
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,980
Well, the first one makes no sense, but number two, are you Japanese? Because I want to go

808
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:44,140
full Hiroshima on you. Oh my God. That one is going to destroy, dude. Are you Japanese?

809
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,640
that'll do really well on someone who's Japanese.

810
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,480
- Right.

811
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,440
- Probably love that dude.

812
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,900
They'll be like, "Oh, I know what that is."

813
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,820
Are you Japanese?

814
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,780
Because I want to get into Japantese.

815
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,540
All right.

816
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,700
Maybe the Jamaican accent, that one.

817
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,040
- That one's a thinker.

818
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,960
- Are you Japanese?

819
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,500
Because I want to put my sake in your Nagasaki.

820
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,340
- What?

821
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,520
- That one doesn't make any sense.

822
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,140
Did you know that I'm quite a bit

823
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,500
like the Japanese public transport system?

824
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,240
When I come three seconds too early,

825
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,160
I will apologize profusely.

826
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
I just found...

827
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry.

828
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
No, I'm next, Patrick.

829
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
This one's good.

830
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Are you Japanese?

831
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Because I'll jam my penis inside you.

832
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
I mean, I guess that's a bait and switch.

833
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Jam penis.

834
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
It's a pun.

835
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Jam my penis.

836
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
That's really a stretch, man.

837
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Yeah.

838
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
That's a big time stretch.

839
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
I'm sorry.

841
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
I'm sorry.

842
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm sorry.

843
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
I'm sorry.

844
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,160

00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:47,660
And there was a dude who's wife, he was cheating on his wife.

1017
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:51,660
And I forget his name, I think his name was Remy Ramsaran.

1018
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,660
No way.

1019
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,660
That's like a $2 champagne.

1020
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,660
He was cheating on his wife and then he found out she was cheating on him with a guy in Clash of Clans and he killed her.

1021
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,060
killed her to him.

1022
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,260
Clash of Clans is crazy because it's like I mean it's clearly very popular and successful

1023
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,020
but I don't think I have ever once in my life met somebody who has played it.

1024
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,620
I don't even know what it is.

1025
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,620
That episode's-

1026
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,780
It's a game for your phone right?

1027
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,780
Yeah.

1028
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,980
That episode's fucking crazy too because they like have interviews with the guy before like

1029
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:28,100
he went to jail and the interviewer's talking to him and she's like, "So you were like,

1030
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,500
you were like cheating on your wife."

1031
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,340
and he goes, "Oh yeah, oh yeah, that was bad."

1032
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,980
(laughing)

1033
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,520
- Wait, wait, wait, so his wife cheated on him

1034
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,140
with someone in Clash of Clans?

1035
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Is there like a fuck button in Clash of Clans?

1036
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,620
- There's a chat in Clash of Clans, I guess.

1037
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,180
I don't think it was Clash of Clans,

1038
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,700
I think it's one of those adjacent games,

1039
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,880
but he was like, yeah, and then he,

1040
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:57,140
there's like the interview, the interviewer's like,

1041
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,340
"Would anyone ever describe you as like quirky or odd?"

1042
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,480
And he goes, "Absolutely, including everybody

1043
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,580
"that's ever met me, especially my wife, Jen."

1044
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,580
(laughing)

1045
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,720
- I never got that, dude.

1046
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,180
I remember people used to get,

1047
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:18,260
grown women would cheat on their husbands on Second Life.

1048
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,740
And the thing is, who cares?

1049
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,460
She's fucking Barney.

1050
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,700
Why are you fucking stressed out about that shit, dude?

1051
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,980
She's fucking, don't kill her, she's weird.

1052
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah, they were, ah fuck, have you seen that Second Life documentary?

1053
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,700
No.

1054
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,620
Oh dude, it's so- I never got it, I wish I had done Second Life.

1055
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,700
I played Second Life like in like, in college, like cause nobody played it anymore.

1056
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,700
Just, I will say the character creator, the most fun character creator of all time.

1057
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Yeah, I feel like it got- Oh, it made your guy really tiny?

1058
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,500
Yeah, you could do anything with that dude.

1059
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,700
I feel like all those people are on like VR chat now.

1060
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
Yeah, sure.

1061
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,700
That's a new one.

1062
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,300
I get those people who they spend like five thousand dollars to get like a full haptic

1063
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,780
feedback suit and then they walk around VRChat trying to hug kids.

1064
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,780
Yeah.

1065
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,780
It's fucking weird man.

1066
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
Yeah.

1067
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,780
Yeah.

1068
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
That's why Caleb got the headset.

1069
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,260
No, I don't have a haptic VR suit and I hate VRChat.

1070
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,980
Everybody's mean to me on there.

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,900

00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,280
My friend who was graduating told me this in a Zoom meeting because he had to leave,

1124
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,680

00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:57,360
appreciate a wholesome pickup line girl are you really princess peach for real

1131
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,200

- What?

1133
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,160
- That's nasty.

1134
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,900
- That's not okay to say to somebody.

1135
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,860
- You can't really, okay, okay.

1136
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,960
Hold on, let's see.

- No.

1139
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,100
- Use only working piropos and frases de cantadas

1140
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,380
for girls and hombres.

1141
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,780
Note that dirty phrases are funny,

1142
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,900
but don't use them in real life.

1143
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,420
In practice, saying sexual smooth Super Mario phrases

1144
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:25,020
to someone you haven't picked up yet is usually creepy.

1145

00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,840
Yeah.

1175
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840

00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,840
Yeah, the gangster jester.

1177
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,840
Oh, fuck.

1178
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,840
From the t-shirts?

1179
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,480
Might have been one of the fucking Shriner clowns, dude.

1180
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,480
Yeah, dude.

1181
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,480
Oh my god.

1182
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,480
If this was written by fucking...

1183
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Oh, you know what it is?

1184
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
I'm stupid, dude.

1185
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,480
The opposite of a clown is a mime.

1186
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
No.

1187
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,480
Oh!

1188
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,480
No, it's a mime.

1189
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,480
No, it's absolutely not.

1190
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
Yeah, dude.

1191
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
He's the Bizarro World clown.

1192
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1193
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,000
That's like you have a mi- like a clown is chaotic evil and a mime is lawful evil.

1194
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,640
They're still on the same end of the- they're still on the same half.

1195
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,120
Nah, the mime is the clown's shadow, brother.

1196
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
No.

1197
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,360
Listen to me on this one, brother.

1198
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,360
No, no, no, no.

1199
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
Yeah, you're wrong.

1200
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,120
The mime- you gotta- you gotta get- That's an insane thing to say.

1201
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,080
Nah, the mime is- the mime is the opposite.

1202
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,560
Nah, people will back me- people will vindicate me on this.

1203
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,320
He ain't got no colors on him!

1204
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,440
Yeah, but he's a silent clown.

1205
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,120
A mime is- Yeah, which is one of the defining things about a clown.

1206
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,600
Is it their loud? It's a French clown. No, clowns don't talk either. Yeah they do, they

1207
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:25,600
go like... what do they say? They don't say anything, they don't talk. But they do make

1208
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,360
noise. They honk. They walk up and they make your wife feel really uncomfortable. They

1209
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:35,600
say "I'm loving it." One time a clown gave me a caramel apple at a fair. Yeah. Pretty

1210
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:40,520
much scared me for life. What happened after that? I fell in love with him. Love potion

1211
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,880
the my uh no never mind i was gonna talk about i was gonna talk about a family

1212
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,760
member who's a clown but i probably oh yeah no that's a bad idea yeah i'm not

1213
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,360
gonna do that clowns have is that like a do they have a secret identities

1214
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:01,720
he's a normal guy who is a clown if that's what you mean but like not a clown all the time if

1215
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:07,880
you're a clown like do you do you do you keep your identity secret yeah there was a like there

1216
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,560
somebody finds out your name is Bobo when you're working you have to kill yourself.

1217
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,600
Yeah exactly.

1218
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,280
When I was in when I was in community college in Laconia there was a uh

1219
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,000
there was like a clown supply store.

1220
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,440
Oh like one of the cop supply stores but for clowns?

1221
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,520
Yeah but for clowns it was like a clown.

1222
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,400
That's the opposite of a cop.

1223
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,960
Maybe.

1224
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,920
Yeah maybe but it was a clown supply store it was run by a clown.

1225
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,640
No.

1226
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,040
Her name I think it was Serendipity the clown.

1227
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,080
Female clown.

1228
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,920
Honestly high sh*t of all time.

1229
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,360
She was dressed up like a clown all the time apparently. I never went in but my

1230
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,160
my professor told me that they had to shoot something there and he had a

1231
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,680
student who was afraid of clowns. And they had to shoot a clown that got rabid.

1232
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,920
They had to shoot a fucking clown.

1233
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,480
Dude, I do not

1234
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,800
I do not fuck with clowns. I'd like to, I'd like to, yeah, I'd like to publicly come out

1235
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,440
with that. I don't, I'm scared of the Shriner's Clowns now. I think we do need to

1236
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,120
The Shrine Clowns I think are maybe the most evil clowns I've ever seen.

1237
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,120
Yeah.

1238
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:14,640
Because, yeah, you're not only, you couldn't just decide between being like an Illuminati,

1239
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,160
a low-ranking Illuminati member, or like a clown that scares children.

1240
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,160
You had to be both.

1241
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,160
You had to split the difference.

1242
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
That's pretty fucking evil.

1243
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,280
You must be a fucked up individual.

1244
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,600
I really like clowns, but I like them because I like imagining them being killed.

1245
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,880
I just think it's funny.

1246
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,880
That's very funny to me.

1247
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,880
It's like Slipknot.

1248
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,040
I do I just sit there I mean that's you know that's probably where it what it

1249
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,760
would happen to me at a young age but I do spend a good amount of my time I'm not

1250
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,160
talking about you guys just talking with you guys just sitting around thinking

1251
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,880
about it like a clown in a meat grinder or something going how many clowns are

1252
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,960
murdered in the line of duty every year that's a good question yeah the line

1253
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,920
sorry the line of goofy my bad yeah what if it's like when one clown dies

1254
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:14,640
is

1255
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,700
like a in line with the rainbow

1256
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,580
that's you know that's the guy has a sense of the kids and it's like a flag

1257
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,380

1258
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:26,240
