00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
[music]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
After an interesting experience at Room Street,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
where the guys robbed a man of his thumb, his virtual wallet, and a lot of his dignity,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we had what we needed in spades.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Quantum crypto credentials for when we get into the iCup facility,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,880
Then we got access to ShinyAndro's crypto account.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,120
Also his car and his house.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,440
Next, we had to deliver that money to Mary Kate Cabrera.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,880
That's easy enough to do. We could send that over our PSPs.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,920
But then we had to meet up with her...

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,960
with Goldbeard, who would get us the golden bullets.

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,320
Mary Kate said she'd link us up after we did the job.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,240
After that, we'd only need to get the love slime

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,240
and potentially a way to perform a biometric scan matching Fatima Von Kissy faces.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,240
I suggested we talk through the different security gates we need one more time.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,240
So yeah, you guys just got away from Room Street after causing some mayhem.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,240
There are a couple places you talked about going.

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,240
I mean, obviously you have Shiny X.

19
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,400
- Is he still knocked out?

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040
Or is he locked out? - Yeah, what's going on with me?

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,600
- He is knocked out last I remember.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,640
- Okay, can I give him mouth to mouth?

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,520
- Can we have a dream sequence of him?

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,000
(laughing)

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
- Do you wanna go inside Pat's dream?

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,560
- Can we all be characters in Pat's dream?

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,880
- I think to wake him up,

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,800
we have to go inside of his mind.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,720
- It's completely white.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,440
The whole, it's completely white except for me in a room.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,740
Only white and you're completely

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,980
that's your dream is only white.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,740
It's completely white and I'm eating

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,020
just like a big Snickers ice cream.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,160
No, you're not.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,020
So, yeah, you're doing something nasty, actually.

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Yeah, you look closer in the Snickers bar is poop.

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,800
OK. Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,100
I leave or I leave his brain.

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
I hated it in there.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, no, you missed it.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,600
He's eating.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,900
He's about to see his father's penis.

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,700
Talk to him.

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,000
So you missed that.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,700
Yeah, but yeah, so you guys are so you have a couple couple

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,800
places you can go.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,000
Obviously you talked about, you know, rating shiny Andrew's

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,100
house since you have his key in his car.

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,500
I exist to his car.

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,400
Now, you can obviously also go back to Atlanta City so you

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,800
can make the trade with Mary Kate Cabrera.

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,700
and get those golden bullets.

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,600
Those are the two main places you would probably go.

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
But you know, whatever, you can go back to the hideout.

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,100
I feel like we've been trying to get these golden bullets for a very long time.

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,300
I strongly feel as though we should go get these bullets, boys.

58
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,700
Yes, I agree.

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Oh yeah. Okay, cool.

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,200
So yeah, I mean, we can do a little handy-dandy fast travel.

61
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,300
As you get back to Atlantis City.

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
I walked the whole way really slowly.

63
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
(laughter)

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
(singing)

65
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
(singing)

66
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
(singing)

67
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
(singing)

68
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
We're walking.

69
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Mm-hmm. And you're walking.

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,300
And you're walking the whole way there,

71
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
so it was like, what about,

72
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
I guess midday, and so now

73
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,300
it becomes late afternoon,

74
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
and you're about halfway there. You guys have been walking.

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I'm really tired. I want to go take a nap.

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,020
I'm gonna go take a nap.

77
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,940
Water break.

78
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,220
[LAUGH]

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,340
Okay.

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,700
Can I now drink water for about two minutes?

81
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,860
Am I still knocked out?

82
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,620
Yeah, we've been dragging you.

83
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,620
We have a camel that we tied you to.

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,340
We've been dragging you through the desert, which I think is where we are.

85
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah, you're in the desert of Gun City.

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,580
You're in the desert part of the city.

87
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,900
Yeah, and when you get to the, when you get to Atlantis City,

88
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:29,300
Cabrera sends you a message over your PSPs to meet her at the,

89
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
at De Niro's Diner.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,900
So it's a diner that is nearby the like main casino area,

91
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,200
the conch place in Atlantic City, Atlantis City.

92
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
So that's where that's where she told you to meet.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,700
So that's all.

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,100
That's all you guys can go there.

95
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,600
It's like that.

96
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
You guys can go there if you want or you can go.

97
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,500
We're back in the casino is what you're saying.

98
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,600
No, you're just in Atlanta City, so you're not in the casino right now.

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,100
You can go to the basically sitting down at the roulette table.

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
You are.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,300
You're telling me.

102
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,800
Yeah, I mean, there might be a lot of money or a little might be a window of time

103
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,700
that Cabrera will wait for you at the diner.

104
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,860
What was the name of the horrible game that we played?

105
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
Pig.

106
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,700
It was Pig.

107
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,500
You guys want to play round a pig?

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,660
No, I have no anything but fucking I'd rather flip a coin than play pig.

109
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,780
Is coin flipping a game at the Atlanta City Casino?

110
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,980
No, they throw you out if you flip a coin.

111
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,300
That's unregulated gaming.

112
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Whoa, no chance here.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,300
Yeah.

114
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,980
Um, I'm gonna go to the meetup with the Mary Kate.

115
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,220
I just, I piss my pants.

116
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Yup.

117
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
All right, nice.

118
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,820
You guys walk into, walk to De Niro's Diner.

119
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,820
De Niro's Diner has like a vintage 2097 feel.

120
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
So that's when Earth had like a retro gilded age.

121
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,020
Everything's very Baroque.

122
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,620
There's a lot of red velvet, a lot of mahogany wood,

123
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,920
Rockefeller kind of lanterns.

124
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,980
- This place is badass.

125
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,460
- Yeah, it's a pretty sweet, sweet place.

126
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,920
And so you go in there,

127
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,740
you see Mary Kay Cabrera sitting at a table,

128
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,860
you see her posse around her,

129
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,120
and she beckons you guys over.

130
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,580
And she says,

131
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,100
so I received the funds.

132
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,140
I appreciate that.

133
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,140
The thing I don't appreciate is your lack of discretion.

134
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,140
There's a reason why we're meeting here.

135
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,140
My passed out body lets out a huge fart.

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,140
Pash, you're doing a good mob boss thing by just having indigestion.

137
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
Yeah, sorry about that.

138
00:06:52,140 --> 00:07:00,140
Wait, what did you say? What you said again?

139
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,740
Sorry, we were all a little distracted.

140
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,740
I don't remember feeling to be discreet.

141
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,080
No discretion that you lacked.

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Is such that it's coming back to me.

143
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,000
That's fine, I mean, just tell him it was us.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,100
Yeah, I don't who cares?

145
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,700
We got you your fucking money.

146
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,240
Why are you complaining?

147
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,540
I mean, yeah, I mean, hey, I don't.

148
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,600
With all due respect, you didn't tell us to be discreet.

149
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,900
I would have assumed that that would have been a part of...

150
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Well then you were way too discreet.

151
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,440
Yep.

152
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
You were discreet by not telling us.

153
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
You were being discreet so much that you didn't even tell us what you wanted.

154
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,300
I didn't know we came to meet you in the Discretion Diner, your favorite restaurant.

155
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,060
Oh yeah, I didn't realize we were in Discretion City.

156
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,200
I thought this was fuckin' Gun City, you fuckin' stupid bitch.

157
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Yeah, on this street.

158
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,700
That part.

159
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Alright, alright, alright.

160
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Because we still want the other stuff.

161
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,700
The deal the deal.

162
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:11,900
And she snaps her cyborg finger and out comes Goldbeard.

163
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,000
Goldbeard who's a... Does he love gold?

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,300
He does love gold.

165
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,100
He has... You see him come out. You see first a barrel wheel.

166
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,740
and then you see a head inside the barrel wheel, you see a beard made of solid gold

167
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,220
and uh, two legs, this guy is walking, his beard is too heavy so he carries it around in a wheelbarrow

168
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,100
You wanna talk about being discreet? He's got a golden beard!

169
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,380
I call bullshit on this whole thing!

170
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,060
Do you not want the golden bullets then?

171
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,780
Gimme that shit, yes, of course I do!

172
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,820
Do it discreetly, and don't say gold bullets, use a codename.

173
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,320
Yeah, you gotta be discreet here.

174
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Like normal bullets.

175
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
It's a joke.

176
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Okay, got it.

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Uh, here are your normal bullets.

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Shh, shh, shh.

179
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Quiet.

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,820
You gotta be really quiet.

181
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,320
You have to be really discreet.

182
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
You never know who's around.

183
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:23,320
And uh, Goldbeard gives you guys a big toothy grin and coughs up two golden bullets.

184
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,520
bullets. I snatched them.

185
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,620
Nice.

186
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
I snatched them with my fingers.

187
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,820
Yeah, really, really fast fingers for that.

188
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,920
He has 10 of them.

189
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,120
Roll 10 times for each finger.

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,920
One finger.

191
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,220
No roll 10 times for each finger roll 100 times.

192
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,920
So yeah, you guys get the golden bullets.

193
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
That was so easy.

194
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,620
Mary Kate says to you now.

195
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,020
I had another end of the deal.

196
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,860
I promised you guys which was information about love slime. Thank you for reminding us

197
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:08,500
Just basically general like you just tell anyone the second part of our deal

198
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah, didn't you didn't even check if we were who we say we were before you said that

199
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,180
Are you who are you? We're us continue

200
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay

201
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:33,780
She says, "Now, I would expect your friend over here, the V-Folk, to know this about

202
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,860
Love Slime, but it has not been in production for many years now.

203
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,540
It was made by Swag Inc., which was a boutique techno-slime company.

204
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Anyway, it was too dangerous. So that's what's taken federation by the basis said and so they seized all of it and use it in the server wars now there been leaks since then.

205
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,540
Become sort of a designer drug designer product.

206
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,540
And I know somebody.

207
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,440
Or rather I just know that there's activity where a former friend of mine.

208
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Runs a danger club.

209
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,640
And you guys would know danger clubs are nightclubs where people do really crazy shit.

210
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,140
Like back and out.

211
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,740
Oh like back drinking.

212
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,240
They do backflips they drink.

213
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Oh God, I don't know if we should go there guys.

214
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,840
It sounds scary.

215
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,740
If you go there and you play cool, you'll probably get offered some love slime at some

216
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
point.

217
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,120
If you go there and you fuck it up, you won't.

218
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,040
So, okay, then we'll do, then we'll do good.

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Fine.

220
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
One more thing.

221
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,960
I had to call in a favor to get the cops to stop, you know, asking questions about who

222
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,360
Who were those guys who beat up that paralyzed guy?

223
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Who were they?

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
We don't know who you're talking about.

225
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,560
Yeah, we're so discreet we have no clue what you're even talking about.

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,080
So and who killed those other cops or killed one of them and then removed the lips off

227
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
another?

228
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Oh, I don't know.

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I've never touched lips.

230
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,880
You just don't know what lips are.

231
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Yeah.

232
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
What part of the body is lips?

233
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,180
He points at Travis Oswald.

234
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
That guy removed a cop's lips.

235
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,880
Oh, I wouldn't even know.

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,480
I look behind me.

237
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,980
There's no guy there.

238
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,980
There's a there's an eight-year-old child.

239
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:49,080
She serves him right you keep

240
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,280
eye for an eye.

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,080
Okay, so

242
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,820
If you aren't as discreet, if I can use our favorite word one more time.

243
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Good.

244
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,780
There will be consequences.

245
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:10,860
OK, what will they be?

246
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,160
Yeah, go ahead and tell us.

247
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,460
We already fucking ripped a cop's lips off.

248
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,920
What the fuck else can we get in trouble for?

249
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,960
Send people to try to kill you.

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,080
What do you think is going to happen?

251
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,380
We're the main characters of the thing.

252
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,000
You think they're really going to hurt us?

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,400
No, fuck you.

254
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
We're going to the danger club.

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
All right. Fuck you, too.

256
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,940
Yeah. So you guys can go to the danger club.

257
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,000
This danger club actually is is a repurposed

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,100
as repurposed abandoned techno slime factory from the first campaign.

259
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,740
It's been about two years since you've been there.

260
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,800
Oh, I remember this.

261
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
I remember that, too.

262
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,300
Yeah. And do you remember that?

263
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Do you guys remember?

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
They remember.

265
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
Not likely.

266
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,300
I was there last night.

267
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
You were not.

268
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
It seems like you guys are going to be at a serious strategic disadvantage.

269
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
We remember the exact layout.

270
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
I remember you and Granny.

271
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:14,300
So yeah, do you guys want to go to the abandoned Techno Climb factory that has turned into a danger club?

272
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes.

273
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,300
But first, glow sticks.

274
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Yup.

275
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Okay, you guys wanna go get glow sticks?

276
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,300
Yeah, but we don't have to do a scene of it, we can just have them.

277
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Yeah, you guys got glow sticks, yeah.

278
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Mine's purple.

279
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Mine's also purple, but it's brighter.

280
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,300
No, no. I have two in there. I have four like General Grievous.

281
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Mm-hmm.

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah, okay, fine. But yours are poison and they kill you if you hold them too long.

283
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
[Laughter]

284
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
Okay.

285
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,460
On your way there, Mommy gives Sullivan a call.

286
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,560
And Sullivan picks up and says, Hey, hey, Mommy.

287
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh, do you guys want me to put this on speakerphone?

288
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Yes. Talk to your damn mom.

289
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,560
No, this is not. Actually, yes, I do.

290
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,360
Put her on speakerphone. OK.

291
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,660
Mr. Sullivan, is that you?

292
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,960
And no, this is Mommy. Good legs.

293
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
We've Mommy frog legs.

294
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:25,980
the fifth

295
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,120
that's her name

296
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,320
the trim of the

297
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,460
fifth

298
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,520
the way both at

299
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,560
the fifth

300
00:15:38,560 --> 00:16:03,640
I'm Sullivan the frog my mom is mrs. Sullivan no I know that's what is your

301
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,000
dad's name. Don't tell me it's the frog.

302
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,140
No, it's Papa Sullivan.

303
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,300
Mrs and Papa.

304
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah, I don't know how this is so confusing.

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,300
Is this not normal?

306
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't have parents, I don't know.

307
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,400
I don't think you know their names.

308
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,380
I do know their names.

309
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,700
It's Papa Sullivan.

310
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,100
You think it's Papa Sullivan and Mrs Sullivan?

311
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,580
Maybe.

312
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,080
Maybe I should reach out to my parents.

313
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,420
I think you should.

314
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,460
I don't think frogs talk to their parents.

315
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,380
Don't, don't, didn't you just come out of a load of slimy eggs?

316
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,820
This is a, uh, Pierce, I'm gonna say this one time and one time only.

317
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,860
He is a future frog.

318
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,900
Why would he follow the modern frog's law?

319
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,540
It makes no sense.

320
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,340
Do you guys not slime out?

321
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,600
I mean, I still I'm out, but.

322
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,740
Mommy good legs has just been on the phone.

323
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,380
OK, mommy, get to the point.

324
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:17,560
So I met with Fatima and I was able to get some information from her.

325
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,000
There is one person who is in charge of extracting the crypto credentials.

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Now. If I mean, I'm not sure if you guys got crypto credentials or not,

327
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,560
You guys did get crypto credentials, by the way, from shiny Andrew.

328
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,440
You couldn't find them yet, but we're working on it.

329
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,200
Fuck yeah.

330
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,800
Nice.

331
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,300
OK, wait, even if I say nice.

332
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Yeah, nice.

333
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,360
That's got to be advantage.

334
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Give me advantage for him.

335
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,900
Nice. Nice is disadvantage.

336
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,840
No, no. Nice is in like he just remembered like, oh, yeah, we didn't get it.

337
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,800
There's no there's no that it does neither advantage nor disadvantage.

338
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,540
If it's that, if it's this interpretable of a nice,

339
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,540
it's just open to what it could sound like.

340
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,840
Well, they're on the phone.

341
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,640
How do you know?

342
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
How do you know she can even hear it?

343
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,940
It's a lower.

344
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,240
So it's a lower.

345
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,840
Maybe he's not because it's over the phone ice to something

346
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,240
else.

347
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
Yeah.

348
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,940
I mean, it's a lower difficulty.

349
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,240
Well, I rolled an 11.

350
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
So yeah, yeah.

351
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,140
So she says, okay, sure.

352
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,340
Well, you know, let me know when you get it when you get

353
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,640
nice.

354
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,140
Nice.

355
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,340
Yeah, we will believe.

356
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,940
We'll let you know, alright.

357
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,440
Hey, good luck, Oprah.

358
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
She bought it!

359
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,940
We're at the mall with our girlfriends.

360
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
That's why he's saying that.

361
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,840
She bought it.

362
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,340
She bought a bionicle for me.

363
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
She just bought it.

364
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,940
Oh, she keeps buying it.

365
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,240
She says, "Anyway, so I met with Fatima,

366
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,240
And there is one person who is in charge of extracting crypto credentials.

367
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Now, if Blotas gets a good look at them, he can get the crypto credentials from anywhere,

368
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,360
because then Blotas can mimic their identity.

369
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,080
However, Fatima wouldn't tell me exactly who it was, and I didn't want to keep pushing.

370
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,480
That said, there are only three people with crypto credentials who have set foot in the

371
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,400
I cup facility so I'm going to send you those their dossier now and she sends

372
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,600
you the dossier of the three people commit these to memory blow toss and on

373
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,300
the day of you can use one of them as your disguise and then figure out the

374
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:45,440
rest ask her to spell I cup I'd unknock out Patrick so he can stop typing

375
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Patrick's in like a Stephen Hawking wheelchair typing all of his messages.

376
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,440
I like that Patrick is following the rule of like, "Okay, I'm knocked out so I can't talk."

377
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,440
But I can send secret messages that nobody can hear to my friends.

378
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,440
That's what happens when you get knocked out.

379
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I just learned about the whisper function on Roll20 and I've been sending everyone a message.

380
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Oh, cool.

381
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Yeah, um, what does the dossier say?

382
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Wait, so, oh, I remember everything that's happened up to this point.

383
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,440
The dossier just has like three people's names and their faces as well.

384
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Which are?

385
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Which are literally Doug Jones, Stephen A. Smith,

386
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,440
[laughter]

387
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,720
and stinky Eric are the three guys and their faces their faces

388
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,600
well Doug Doug Jones is a white guy Stephen a Smith is a white guy

389
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:03,720
well stink yeah and stinky stinky Eric sticky Eric is a green guy

390
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
He better be green.

391
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Well he, so he is a, Stinky Eric is a, um, a fungoid.

392
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Which is a type of race in the Gun City world.

393
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
They are mu- what, what, what, what do they look like?

394
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
A fungoid?

395
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
What are their defining facial characteristics?

396
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I can tell you, Cam and I wrote up a whole bunch of lore for this.

397
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
So, first name Stinky, second, uh, last name Eric?

398
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,360
Yeah, what's his dad's name?

399
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,560
What's his dad's name?

400
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,360
His dad's name is Papa Stinky.

401
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
Papa Stinky.

402
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Okay.

403
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,260
Maybe I need a Papa Stinky after this.

404
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,860
I've been.

405
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,060
I've been in your kitchen.

406
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,860
You've been popping stinkies in fucking Kevin's house?

407
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,160
That's not nice.

408
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,660
Mm-hmm.

409
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,360
You keep that door over there closed.

410
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,360
You can't pop one.

411
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm never letting you in my apartment ever again.

412
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,760
Poppin stinkies instead of Molly's a fungoid is a mushroom

413
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:17,600
yeah they're mushroom... yeah. I didn't mean to get Pat going on that but I was laughing

414
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:36,560
at it. So Stinky Eric looks like a mushroom kind of

415
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:47,440
the

416
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,880
Mike and Ike's they look like Mike and Ike's.

417
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,320
No, they look like Mike and Ike's in D&D. I think that's what they were.

418
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,160
Mice and Id's maybe. I don't remember what the race is called, but they're just like mushroom guys.

419
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,560
They are, generally they don't do anything.

420
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,200
So it's kind of weird for one of them to be like a crypto credential guy.

421
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,320
Generally, they just kind of like sit around all day and find ways to collect money.

422
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
By doing as little work as possible.

423
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,880
And they are they have like a they're kind of part of money by doing little work as possible.

424
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,680
They try to collect money by doing as little work as possible.

425
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah, I mean, that's that's all the other two guys are just like regular looking white dudes.

426
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Right, who don't try to make money by doing.

427
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,360
They love to work hard.

428
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,320
They work hard. Yeah.

429
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
No, no, I like this damn mushroom.

430
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,080
Let's talk about this damn mushroom people for a second.

431
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,840
Look, man, you need a mushroom in your house

432
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,920
where you can rush around and get it all before I see you rushing stinkies.

433
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,160
Oh, I didn't write Doug Jones.

434
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,520
I wrote Doug jerk.

435
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,200
That's actually kind of cool.

436
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,640
There's no Doug Jones.

437
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
Yeah, he's Doug jerk.

438
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Stephen A. Smith and sneaky Eric.

439
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,440
Yeah. OK.

440
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,640
So what do we need these guys for? We talked to them about how to...

441
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,240
No, so what...

442
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,840
They are the three people, or the only three people with crypto credentials who visit the iCup facility.

443
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:29,040
So they either visit it for, you know, consultant reasons, maybe they work for another company that someone wants to partner with,

444
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,440
or they are the people who are in charge of transferring the funds.

445
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,840
Okay, I'm thinking maybe I could disguise myself as one of them at some point.

446
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Yeah, well that's what she's suggesting.

447
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:53,480
Is the day of when the day of the transfer is happening, right, which is the day you're going to be able to, you could pretend to be someone with crypto credentials who fits the right profile.

448
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,480
So I mean you could have sought these people out, you know, and gotten their crypto credentials, but you guys got crypto credentials.

449
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,720
So instead of doing that, you can just mimic one of them and make that a part of the plan.

450
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:09,640
Obviously, you can still try to seek these guys out and grab their crypto credentials

451
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:17,980
or kill them if you figure out which one of them is the person who is actually in charge

452
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,180
of handling the money.

453
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,140
First I think we got to hit the, we got to hit Club Danger.

454
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,020
Yes, no, this is just information she's giving you so you have it to use.

455
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Thank you, love you, bye.

456
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Okay.

457
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,360
What's your what's your mom and dad's name before you go?

458
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,860
Because your name's mommy already.

459
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,860
My mommy.

460
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,600
Or you're like Grandma Goodlegs.

461
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,060
Is that your mom?

462
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,420
No, it's her name is Felicia Goodlegs.

463
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,500
And my father's name is well, I mean, her name is Felicia.

464
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,000
Felicia Day.

465
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,700
Hang up. Hang up.

466
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,320
Miss Daring.

467
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,920
Yeah. All right.

468
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,800
Your father's the only name of your father's good legs.

469
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,380
Yes, yes.

470
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,880
Maurice Goodlegs.

471
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
How'd you know?

472
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,180
No, it's Seth.

473
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,280
It's Seth Goodlegs.

474
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,880
Why? What's Sullivan's?

475
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,180
You're not gonna fucking believe this.

476
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,080
Yeah, it doesn't.

477
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,220
Isn't this a little weird?

478
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,880
His mom's name is Mrs.

479
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,780
and his dad's name is Papa.

480
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,920
Stop!

481
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,560
And their last names are his first name

482
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,780
and his last name is just from is what he is.

483
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
these frauds are fucked up man

484
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,820
just hold on i'm just i'm gonna figure this out

485
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,820
i'm gonna figure out why this is

486
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,820
just stop stop telling people

487
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,820
basically we're pretty sure he was adopted

488
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,820
i don't think i was adopted

489
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
i hate to be the one who breaks the news

490
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,820
i'm pretty sure you're adopted

491
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,820
i don't think you hate being the one to break the news

492
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
i gotta really light

493
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,820
it feels good to break this news to you

494
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,820
his name could be like baby sullivan or something

495
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,820
now that i'm thinking about it

496
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,820
that might be the better

497
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,320
Tadpole with no legs, sir.

498
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,020
Yeah, were you- did you grow up with no legs?

499
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,420
Oh my god, Tadpole.

500
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,060
This guy knows everything about fucking frogs.

501
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,940
Just fucking shut up.

502
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
Okay?

503
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,900
I know a guy, his name is Tadpole.

504
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,340
If we're talking about him.

505
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,540
We just grow up- we don't grow up like regular frogs.

506
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,580
Dad's name should be Dadpole.

507
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,700
That's a very good point.

508
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,580
I mean that'd be funnier, but...

509
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,640
Your mind will be like, Madam Pole. Nice.

510
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,340
Yeah, then that's how many poles and I don't need

511
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,980
that's too many poles and I don't need to screw in a light bulb anytime soon.

512
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,480
No, they're bad at screwing in my bulbs.

513
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,780
I know. That's why there's three of you.

514
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,840
All right. It's OK. I'll let that go.

515
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,480
All right.

516
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,140
I certainly love the danger club. Mm hmm.

517
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Yeah, I mean, you guys can hop in Sullivan's car

518
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,440
and head over to the danger club.

519
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,220
Yeah, it's in the abandoned techno slime factory.

520
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
You guys are familiar with it.

521
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,620
It looks different now.

522
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,380
I mean, at the very least, it has a lot of

523
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,020
a lot of scary looking young people outside.

524
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,960
You see people start to you see people outside of the club

525
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,100
or just, you know, smoking techno slime or injecting techno slime or snorting it.

526
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,940
You know, it's a big sort of club scene.

527
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,180
You see people like smashing beer bottles on their heads.

528
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,580
They're all like challenging each other to do more and more dangerous stuff.

529
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,980
You have to. Is there like a vibe check we have to pass to get in?

530
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,520
No, no, you can just kind of walk in there.

531
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
This isn't space Berghain.

532
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,580
No, no, no.

533
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,720
Nor is it the salt salty spittoon.

534
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,840
Oh, yeah, I'm I'm Gary.

535
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,520
And when I literally you're 16, what?

537
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,520
What I made this in this whole time when I made this I was thinking of Barry G

538
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,520
thinking of Barry G saying he was 16.

539
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,120
I'm 16 I can't go in.

540
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
You're all deception Barry G.

541
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,920
Hang on I gotta get my lion boots on.

542
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,120
Barry I've got an idea.

543
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,320
Okay.

544
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,320
All right, so you see right next door to the club

545
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
is the Bigington Coat Factory.

546
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
the what?

547
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
The Biggington Coat Factory.

548
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,040
Why are you moving closer to the monitor?

549
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
[laughter]

550
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Are you doing that to hear me better?

551
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
No.

552
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,680
You gotta own it.

553
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
Biggington Coat Factory.

554
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Yeah, I mean you guys roll insight.

555
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,680
You're the ones trying to believe him.

556
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Or not believe him.

557
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,560
That is your strength save.

558
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,560
You roll, you guys roll insight on that if you believe him.

559
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:05,040
the

560
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,320
Insight is literally just to see if you believe him or not.

561
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,120
Then you can do whatever you want with that information.

562
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,920
Well, I don't need to roll because I believe that he's 16.

563
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Okay, alright, sounds good.

564
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,560
It's initiative, it's another I word.

565
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Jesus, dude.

566
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
I'm ready to fight him for this.

567
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
[laughter]

568
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
You're still locked out.

569
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,880
No, he's not locked out anymore. He's speaking with lucidity.

570
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
You just type in "insight".

571
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,880
[laughter]

572
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:43,760
the

573
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:56,200
the

574
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:16,420
of

575
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,620
Patrick Yoda was in some kind of severe either debt or...

576
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,260
I'm in debt with every club owner in the city.

577
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,540
Yeah, something like that because of cocaine.

578
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,340
I would say then that you might not know this club owner.

579
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,740
I mean, unless you directly dealt with him.

580
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,340
I don't remember.

581
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,140
To the nights we don't remember and the friends will never forget.

582
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,460
Yeah, sure.

583
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:51,700
So we can cry if you think if you've owed money to every nightclub owner in the city, we can we can address that when you're in there.

584
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,940
Or we can address that now and be like, you don't want to go in or you want to do something different, because then that could just be a truth that we're we're dealing with.

585
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:06,420
I take I take a marker and I draw a mustache on.

586
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,060
Okay, cool.

587
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,780
Actually, I already do I already have?

588
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,660
Yeah, yeah, the art Joey made.

589
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,140
I draw it longer.

590
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Okay, cut it.

591
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Draw the opposite of a mustache.

592
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,140
Yeah, just draw green Yoda skin over it.

593
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,140
No, I'd draw it longer.

594
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,140
Yeah, just look like you have a flesh disease.

595
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Also, isn't...

596
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,140
I mean, Barry G is...

597
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
You're like made of magnets,

598
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
so couldn't you become like...

599
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,140
Can you be like invisible or like slime to go in?

600
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,140
You could become slime and start to sneak around, too.

601
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,140
Yeah, I could do that.

602
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Come on, make 16 year old slime.

603
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,140
[Laughter]

604
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
You're 16, you're chock full of slime.

605
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
I want to see your 16 year old slime.

606
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
[Laughter]

607
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Cool, yeah.

608
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,140
You can just do that, it'll cost you some

609
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
techno points, it's your slither ability.

610
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Um...

611
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
So you can hold that form

612
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
for 10 minutes.

613
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Um, and if you use multiple charges

614
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,140
you can hold that for an additional

615
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,440
An additional 10 minutes after that you have six charges per long rest.

616
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,340
So you have six charges.

617
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,440
You haven't used it yet or you haven't used it since your last long rest.

618
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,940
I don't think if I'm remembering correctly.

619
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,140
No, you did use it once.

620
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,240
So you actually have you'll have you have five charges, but you can use it again.

621
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,640
Now.

622
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,040
He has six charges.

623
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,840
He has six max right now.

624
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,440
He has five.

625
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,440
So I'm saying I'm going to use it once and I'm going to go.

626
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,740
All right.

627
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm going to go look for some love slime in the girls bathroom,

628
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
and I just sit there away.

629
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,240
Okay, cool.

630
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,040
So we'll address that in a second.

631
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,640
You guys want to go into the Danger Club?

632
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,840
Yeah, of course.

633
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,940
Okay, cool.

634
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,240
Yeah, you guys go into the Danger Club.

635
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,640
All of you roll deck saves.

636
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,340
And I'm looking swagged out.

637
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,240
Right.

638
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,640
I'm dressed to the nines.

639
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Wow.

640
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:04,840
I'm dressed.

641
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,540
I have a longer mustache.

642
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,840
Holy shit.

643
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,140
failure on everyone's here.

644
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,940
Yeah, well Barry, sorry, you Barry, you didn't have to

645
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,440
because you're Slytherin elsewhere.

646
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,940
Cam, Pat, Yoda, Pierce, so blow toss, Patrick Yoda, and

647
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,140
Travis Ocelot.

648
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,440
You all are able to get out of the way of the swinging axes

649
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,940
that are of course coming down the second you walk into the

650
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,840
danger club.

651
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:39,040
You, Raymond Johnson, just sort of walk right through it.

652
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,840
I mean, you get hit, but you just sort of just take it.

653
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,640
Well, yeah, I mean, you take some you take damage, but it's

654
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,840
almost like you didn't even your brain didn't really register

655
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,140
it coming and when it's sliced into you.

656
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,340
You take two damage.

657
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,840
That's it.

658
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,440
Yeah, not that much.

659
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
It's easy.

660
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,640
Got a low roll.

661
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,040
Can I walk back through it?

662
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,440
Yeah, I mean you can and yeah way.

663
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
There's no way.

664
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
There's no fucking way.

665
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
You got another crit fail?

666
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Two zeros in a row.

667
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Get them all out of the way now before something happens.

668
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Roll it again.

669
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Roll it again.

670
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
I took another five damage.

671
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Five?

672
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
I'm kind of shaking.

673
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
That roll was fake.

674
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
So now I did walk back out the door.

675
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
So I do have to walk back through it again.

676
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,140
There we go.

677
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,140
Crit! Good crit.

678
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,940
Wowie yeah people watch you just like walk through get and get caught up so

679
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,580
fucking bad twice Evan another time walk through and like dodge it like you're

680
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,180
moving through like fucking like you're just moving through anything like it's

681
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,300
like you timed it perfectly and you're immediately noticed I just had to figure

682
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,580
it out a danger to figure out the time it's all about timing I'm doing you

683
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,500
- Do people clap when he says that?

684
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,220
- It's a timing, it's mostly a timing thing.

685
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,740
- People nod and look at him, yeah.

686
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,740
- No, it's not me, it's just timing involved.

687
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,700
- You see Sullivan hovering outside,

688
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,380
he's like, "Do I have to go in?"

689
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,140
- Yeah, and walk really slowly in the entrance.

690
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,100
- It's not about timing at all.

691
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,020
- That's the timing, the timing part is go real slow.

692
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,540
- Yeah, and now I'm not sure about your height,

693
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,000
but just stand on tiptoes when you walk too, just to really make sure of...

694
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
nothing.

695
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So the text is of holograms.

696
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,140
They're holograms and they don't hurt.

697
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,800
Yeah, and there also aren't axes, so don't worry.

698
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
If you see axes, you're crazy.

699
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Pffft, I got an 8.

700
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Man, Sullivan takes...

701
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
how much damage?

702
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,280
Okay, Sullivan takes 4 damage.

703
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:00,280
He gets caught on the action, swings up into the ceiling and gets caught in the mechanism.

704
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,780
He's just getting swung back and forth like the pyramid ride, the carnivals,

705
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,280
the Egyptian ride, you know the one, right? The Egyptian ship.

706
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Do you guys see that shit?

707
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,780
I know what you're talking about.

708
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,280
The pirate ship.

709
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,780
That's right.

710
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
It's a pirate.

711
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,280
Yeah, it's usually a pirate.

712
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,780
It was Egyptian for us.

713
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,280
Where I'm from.

714
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Egypt?

715
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
Egypt.

716
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,780
I was in Egypt.

717
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,780
- You got a part of an Egyptian rollercoaster.

718
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
(laughing)

719
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,620
- Egypt.

720
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,780
(laughing)

721
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,780
- I'm referring to all the rides as Egypt.

722
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,140
- Rollercoaster, just Egypt rollercoasters.

723
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,580
- Yeah, I went on Egyptian Magic Mountain.

724
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,540
- I went to this crazy Egypt themed restaurant in Cairo

725
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,380
when I was a kid.

726
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,620
(laughing)

727
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,580
- Okay, so yeah.

728
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,060
Yeah, I mean people are impressed with Ray William Johnson.

729
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,720
Yeah, the music is poppin', it's like crazy,

730
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,260
like fucking like lights like it would kill anyone with epilepsy.

731
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,960
It's it's a like insane club like

732
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,900
Dragula to Dragula bites back, which is Rob's obvious follow up

733
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,720
when he was he was revived against his will and forced to make that song good.

734
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,120
And that's what's playing all the time.

735
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,760
And you serious?

736
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,920
Can you write that and record it?

737
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,560
I would genuinely love to write Dragula to Dragula bites back.

738
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,920
Okay, your shot.

739
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,420
Yeah, Cam, Cam, I would need a I want to I want let's collab.

740
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,380
Cam, Cam, let's go.

741
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,280
They can't do it again.

742
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,180
Not anymore.

743
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,020
It's the same song with new lyrics.

744
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,120
That's yeah, exactly.

745
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,180
All this. Yeah.

746
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,920
Um, yeah.

747
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,980
And so you guys are in the club.

748
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,320
So, I mean, you see people like, you know, hanging out, doing drugs,

749
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,120
you people like like pulling, pouring like like

750
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,780
like acid on themselves and like screaming in pain.

751
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,320
You see people like going in.

752
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,260
There's like a little area with a cage with rabid dogs that haven't eaten.

753
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,060
And people are like fucking around with that.

754
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
It's like a you know, it's a scary nightclub.

755
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,480
People are going going kind of wacky.

756
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,780
So, I mean, you could try to start to find drugs,

757
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,620
figure out how to get the love slime,

758
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,160
which is both a drug and a chemical chemical component to make bombs.

759
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,180
Before we do that, I would like to nut on a piece of poop.

760
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:22,380
So we'll do that to Barry G you are slime.

761
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:27,780
And you're slime and you said you're going towards the girls

762
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,280
bathroom.

763
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,980
Yep.

764
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,380
I'm looking for a love slam in the course bathroom.

765
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,780
Okay, doesn't know any better.

766
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,880
I'm on the ground and I'm going.

767
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,680
Oh, I'm 16.

768
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,580
Can I have some love?

769
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,880
And I'm in the bathroom.

770
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
You're blowing your cover.

771
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,080
Yeah, how would you be saying I'm slime?

772
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,440
I'm slim. I have no age and like a real.

773
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,140
Yeah, I'm saying all this.

774
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,680
So where are you going to do that?

775
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,140
What am I?

776
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm in the girl's.

777
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm I'm 16 years old.

778
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,080
What am I?

779
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,140
Get to the girls bathroom.

780
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,180
You're either going to have to go through the front entrance as slime

781
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,180
or you can start to scale the building and find like a vent or some kind of window or opening.

782
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
He's slime. I mean he can go through the crack in the door, no?

783
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,180
What kind of a slime is he?

784
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:24,180
He can go through anything that has up to like one inch thickness, like one inch of a gap.

785
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
He's like a magnetized slime.

786
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,180
So he can really kind of get his toe flat.

787
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,180
That's such a huge gap.

788
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
It's a big gap.

789
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,180
It's a really big gap actually. It's like massive.

790
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Well yeah, you can't go through any crack.

791
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
Yeah, I would say.

792
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,180
Yeah, I'll go through the vents.

793
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Does it help that I walked in in such a cool way that the women of this club have already slimed every surface in the entire place?

794
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
And that maybe he fits in?

795
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,180
If that's... No, I guess not.

796
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,180
I'm sliming through the vents.

797
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Here's an example of it.

798
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Almost just as easily, though.

799
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,180
So he's like Flubber right now?

800
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
Yes.

801
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
He's a lot like Flubber made out of magnets.

802
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:22,140
the

803
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,460
>> You're invisible, look at you.

804
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,960
>> What?

805
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,840
>> [LAUGH] >> Look at him, he's not there.

806
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,300
>> Look at him, he's not there.

807
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,820
You're invisible, look at you.

808
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:40,820
>> [LAUGH]

809
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,020
>> What do we have to do again?

810
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,420
We gotta talk to- >> We gotta get love slime.

811
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,460
>> We gotta get love slime.

812
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,500
We're just trying to get- >> Yeah, we have to make Jubio make love slime.

813
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,300
>> All right, who's the craziest person in the room right now?

814
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,100
Who's the craziest person in the room right now?

815
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,900
That's a good question.

816
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
There is...

817
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,400
Me.

818
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
[Mimics a loud noise]

819
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
There is... whoa, okay.

820
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,400
I mean, you could do a little... I would say do a perception check to sort of...

821
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
And then... let's do... actually, no, just do insight.

822
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,400
I think insight should be like, if you're trying to suss out, like, who the craziest person in the room is.

823
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:36,920
Yeah, it's kind of hard. So you're kind of looking through the crowd and you're like kind of having a hard time discerning who could be craziest. I mean, you see some people like, you know, like, like stabbing himself with knives. We see other people like, like running their head through a wood chipper. And it's like, it's kind of all it's kind of hard for you to really tell like what the craziest person the club is.

824
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:44,720
Do any of these activities like necessitate the use of love slime as a sort of lubricant?

825
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,920
Are those all of the sexual activities?

826
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:53,880
Um, the sexual activities don't seem to need to use love slime, but I mean you could certainly

827
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
like...

828
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
You hear that, women?

829
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,600
You don't need to do anything before.

830
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,040
I mean you could start talking to people too and see what they know, or you can start to

831
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,200
or you can go towards some of the sexual activities

832
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,160
and do a little investigation.

833
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,000
- All right, I put both my guns to my head

834
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,280
and I say, I will kill myself

835
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,560
if no one gives me love slime right now.

836
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
- They're gonna like that.

837
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,400
It's the danger club.

838
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,240
- It's a danger club.

839
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,840
- Okay, I won't kill myself.

840
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,660
- No!

841
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,920
- Yeah, people, when you say you're gonna kill yourself-

842
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,760
- Or an opposite club.

843
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
(laughing)

844
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,400
- So yeah, you hold the guns to your head.

845
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,760
Some people are like, nice, nice.

846
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,140
It's like they're bobbing to the music

847
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,680
and then like trying to match you also.

848
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,960
Like they take out like,

849
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,520
they got like a machete and hold it to their throat.

850
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,360
Like, yeah, yeah.

851
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,160
It's like, that's how they're dancing with you.

852
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,560
Like, they're trying to like catch your vibe.

853
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,040
- Yeah, and you're cool.

854
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,240
- Yeah.

855
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,840
Yeah, they think anyone who does anything crazy

856
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,520
or dangerous is cool.

857
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,440
- You're a bartender?

858
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,760
- Yeah, of course.

859
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,520
- I go over to the bar.

860
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,640
And then I--

861
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,400
- Don't tell me this bartender is gonna serve a guy

862
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,720
who can only say ice cream.

863
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,200
- I can't, no, I'm lucid now.

864
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
He got cured.

865
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Oh, okay.

866
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
Cameron cured him.

867
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,320
Cameron cured me because he got annoyed.

868
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:21,000
I walk up to the bar and then I throw my little Yoda body onto the bar and I, you know, like

869
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,200
the shelves with all the glasses?

870
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,720
Yeah.

871
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,520
I try to drink all of them.

872
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,800
Cool, okay, yeah.

873
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
I try to drink everything in the bar.

874
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Alright, roll a few things I guess. I guess let's first have you roll a dex check because the bartender is going to try to stop you.

875
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,960
Okay, cool.

876
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Alright, let's see.

877
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,960
You're trying to duck and weave.

878
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Yeah, they can't do that well.

879
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,960
So yeah, you get around it. You're just trying to drink all the shit.

880
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Now roll a constitution saving throw.

881
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,960
Unless are you looking at what you're drinking?

882
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
16. No I'm not.

883
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
Okay, yeah. Alright, yeah.

884
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,960
16, okay. You're gonna

885
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
start taking some

886
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
damage. What?

887
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
Because you're drinking poison, some of it.

888
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
Some of it is poison. It's a

889
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
danger bar. It's a

890
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
danger club.

891
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Wait, how much did I get cured?

892
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
From the knockout? Because I only had

893
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I only had two hit points.

894
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,960
Oh, so I mean what you can do, well you guys took short rests.

895
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,960
So if you want you can use some of your, you could use, let's actually calculate that.

896
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
So let's say you had your full hit die back.

897
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,960
So you have six D8s, so how many do you want to spend?

898
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I'm going to spend two.

899
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Okay.

900
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,960
What's your max HP?

901
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
41.

902
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
Max HP is 41.

903
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I got three.

904
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Why not just do all of them?

905
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,080
Yeah, okay, I'm six

906
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:03,400
Yeah - I'll just roll two more 12 you mean four more okay cool

907
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:16,640
HP back and then yeah, you take you take a damage from the poison I

908
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,620
Had to like figure out how to like take me there's just some poisons that were too strong

909
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,620
But your constitution saving throw was pretty high.

910
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,620
Um, yeah, but people are starting to notice you too.

911
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,620
Um, yeah, they're gonna think you're cool.

912
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,620
Are these a throw up poison?

913
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,620
What?

914
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,620
I'm not supposed to, I'm supposed to be inconspicuous

915
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,620
or I'm supposed to be very cool right now

916
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,620
because I did this so people would think I was cool.

917
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,620
Yeah, there's a, there's a line.

918
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,620
There's, there's, there's, there's,

919
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,620
Mary Kay Cabrera doesn't want you to draw too,

920
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:47,620
like, to be too

921
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,620
indiscreet,

922
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,620
but what you're doing at this club

923
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,120
right now is kind of fine, right?

924
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:58,780
Like probably attacking other people is is indiscreet, right?

925
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,580
This is the danger club putting yourself in danger,

926
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,820
even like ransacking the bar is probably fine.

927
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,520
OK, just make sure I thought that we were supposed to draw

928
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,220
so much attention to us that that we get called into the VIP room.

929
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,180
It's kind of like that.

930
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,320
It's actually not a bad idea.

931
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,480
One of you guys should open up your asshole and say,

932
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,080
put love slime in here. I'm crazy.

933
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,020
Yeah. Well, I'm drunk as shit on the bar.

934
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,860
Do you want me to do that on there?

935
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,620
Yes, please.

936
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:33,080
OK, I'm going to drop my pants down.

937
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,320
OK, cool.

938
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
I do.

939
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,580
I undo my pants and I show my little green ass.

940
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:44,960
Yeah. Off. And I, I mean, I, I

941
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,620
That thing can gape.

942
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,780
Okay, yeah.

943
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,100
You know, you know that thing.

944
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,980
It's gaping, yeah.

945
00:47:51,980 --> 00:48:01,140
Yeah, I forget I, I forget what I was gonna say because

946
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:06,860
and I'm just standing there and I'm like, I, what?

947
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,220
I forgot what to put in here.

948
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,300
Ray William Johnson, out of the corner of your eye,

949
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,640
you see a familiar looking worm

950
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,100
and you see it slithering

951
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,840
through the crowd and towards Patrick's ass.

952
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,100
Worm? Worm!

953
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,500
You see the worm, it takes a second, turns around and sees you.

954
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,000
You're a worm.

955
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,300
And it slithers towards you.

956
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,960
OK, I grab him by the scruff of his neck.

957
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,640
- Yeah. - His whole body,

958
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,460
which is a neck.

959
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:48,760
And I give him kisses.

960
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,000
- Yeah. - And then somebody gives me

961
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,680
a kind of a weird glance.

962
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,880
And I say, "He's a poison worm.

963
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:56,840
Look how close I'm holding him to my face.

964
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,440
I'm being so dangerous.

965
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,800
I love you."

966
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,640
- Yeah.

967
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,460
(laughing)

968
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,300
Yeah, cool.

969
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,080
- We'll go back to that in one second.

970
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,800
So, Barry Gee,

971
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,920
you are now sort of climbing through the vents.

972
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,420
Roll investigation, see if you can like figure out where the girls bathroom is.

973
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,420
What'd you do?

974
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:20,920
Five, okay.

975
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Wasn't he just in there?

976
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
You just follow the girls.

977
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
I mean through the vents, I mean.

978
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,420
Oh.

979
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,920
So where's he gonna drop?

980
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,920
So yeah, you drop out of the vents and into, just sort of on the club floor.

981
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
And so people are just like stepping around.

982
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,920
So start rolling dexterity saving throws, you're a little slime guy,

983
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
try to avoid people there stepping on you.

984
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,360
that might step on you.

985
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,640
- Sit just on here.

986
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,160
- Great.

987
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,080
24?

988
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,680
Yeah, people are like stepping around, glasses dropping,

989
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,720
and you're just like able to weave out of the way

990
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,320
as like a little flubber guy.

991
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,920
- Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry,

992
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,040
excuse me, I'm sorry.

993
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,880
- Yeah.

994
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,720
(laughing)

995
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,640
And yeah, I mean, now you can sort of just follow the girls

996
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,160
to the girls' bathroom.

997
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,120
- I follow the girls to the girls' bathroom.

998
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,680
- Yes, cool.

999
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,520
Yeah, so you're in the girls bathroom.

1000
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,220
What do you want to do?

1001
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,520
I'm just hanging out in there.

1002
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,020
I'm asking girls where they're from and how old they are.

1003
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,820
They're like, what?

1004
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,020
What?

1005
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,020
Who's saying that?

1006
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,860
They're like trying to find out where that's coming from.

1007
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,020
Yo, where you from?

1008
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:28,760
Your age?

1009
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,560
No, I'm 16.

1010
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,100
Yo, no.

1011
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,540
They're just like, oh my God.

1012
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:59,460
and

1013
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
with the worm.

1014
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:07,820
The worm hops out of your hands and starts to slither away and you see it sort of beckoning

1015
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,700
you to follow.

1016
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,040
With what part of its body?

1017
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
Its tail.

1018
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
The main part.

1019
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
Its only tail.

1020
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:21,140
You know, like, if the head's facing you, you know.

1021
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,780
Fuck, dude!

1022
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,740
While he's following the worm, you can like, like, there's like cameras following him,

1023
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:32,580
see me out of the corner like on the bar and I'm grabbing a guy by the shirt

1024
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,820
collar and I say "put your love slime in me!"

1025
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,820
That works. Yeah.

1026
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,820
And the guy's neat.

1027
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,820
[Laughter]

1028
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,820
Yeah.

1029
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,820
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you two, you two are starting to get attention of people.

1030
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,820
Blowtoss, are you doing anything in the club or are you just like standing?

1031
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,820
I'm asleep.

1032
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,020
I was like flat on the floor.

1033
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,320
Yeah.

1034
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,520
Please down.

1035
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:12,720
Yeah right so you're going so the worm is leading you towards you see like a door back room and the worm you see like slams its head against the door knock knock knock.

1036
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:20,920
And it just opens and it's what is in and six it's a worm tail out and waves you in any see a gesture towards.

1037
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,080

00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,880
[Laughter]

1041
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,380
This, this worm is, is telling us to come in here.

1042
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,380
Okay.

1043
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,380
Mm-hmm, cool.

1044
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,680
So you guys go in there.

1045
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,180
I wake up. That was me waking up.

1046
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,180
Oh, okay.

1047
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,180
What sound did you make?

1048
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:47,180
Yeah.

1049
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,180
[Laughter]

1050
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,180
That was cool.

1051
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Yeah, I love that.

1052
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,880
It's a waking up sound.

1053
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,080
That's what it sounds like when you wake up, isn't it again?

1054
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:03,080
That's what it sounds like when you wake up like this.

1055
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,080
I was like a horse seeing a ghost.

1056
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,180
When you wake up, you're like.

1057
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:14,080
You sit up and you yeah.

1058
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,780
After you sit up.

1059
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,080
But before that you go...

1060
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,580
*snort*

1061
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
Yeah, I didn't hear...

1062
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,080
Every time he cuts out, I can hear it through the door.

1063
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,580
*snort*

1064
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,080
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,580
*snort*

1066
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,080
I'm hearing like him...

1067
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,580
stopping, and then just hearing like...

1068
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,580
*whoop*

1069
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,080
*snort*

1070
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,580
*snort*

1071
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,580
Barry Gee...

1072
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,080
You, uh...

1073
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,080
A security guy comes into the bathroom, and says...

1074
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,580
Uh, is looking around, and is looking...

1075
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,080
He's like, "There's a puddle in here if it's harassing the girls."

1076
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,380
And it's sort of looking around for you and he sees this view on the ground.

1077
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,880
And he sees like a puddle.

1078
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,880
And he's like,

1079
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,080
Hello, it's like trying to see if you're said shin.

1080
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,880
Just don't say anything.

1081
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,280
Playing slime women be crazy.

1082
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,280
Yeah, the guard does say that he card goes man women be crazy.

1083
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:23,620
Yeah, he starts to he sort of like sticks is the tip of his his his boot is

1084
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,120
bouncer.

1085
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,800
I should say not guard sort of towards a puddle of slime and start to

1086
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,040
move you a little bit.

1087
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,240
Yeah, they are.

1088
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,880
I'm going to call bouncers guards from now on.

1089
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,320
Roll roll.

1090
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,600
I mean, I guess, you know, here's the thing.

1091
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,280
It's up to you.

1092
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,400
How do you want to play this off?

1093
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,040
Like, because right now when he's sort of like nudging you, it is kind of

1094
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,060
revealing that you're a little bit more substance than just like some puddle of

1095
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,900
water.

1096
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:54,180
Um, but it's not immediately, you know, obvious, but

1097
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,400
why would it go? Why would a guy see a puddle and start nudging it with his

1098
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,240
boot?

1099
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,660
Well, because he was told by a girl that a puddle was talking.

1100
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,180
Uh, can I move myself under his boots?

1101
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,820
So he loses, he just strips over and false.

1102
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:11,380
Oh, Whoa. Very true.

1103
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:14,620
Yeah. Does he have it? Well, he's all magnets, right?

1104
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:24,620
the

1105
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:31,220
You can also attack this guy with depolarization or I don't want to make a scene.

1106
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,620
I just want him to trip over and fall.

1107
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,420
Okay, cool.

1108
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,020
Yeah, so what you could do.

1109
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,720
Yeah, I guess let me think of what you would do here.

1110
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,520
Let's just do a hmm.

1111
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,920
What's kind of check is this is weird.

1112
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,020
It's no real like, you know, I mean like.

1113
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:53,520
Dexterity check because you're sort of like maneuvering underneath his

1114
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,280
feet why are some sort of finesse and how you're moving your weird bodily body.

1115
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:07,320
A check so just just hit decks on the far left eleven okay cool so you you can only

1116
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,120
get a little bit under his boot and it has a little bit of give it is like huh he starts

1117
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,840
to like lift his foot up.

1118
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:19,240
I mean you're kinda like sticking to the bottom of his foot now a little bit.

1119
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,240
I mean, I'll give you a chance to react and figure out what you want to do too, though.

1120
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,240
I think it's enough time for you to like, have like, figure out either do you want to like...

1121
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,240
Because right now, as he's like lifting his foot up, it's like...

1122
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
It's becoming at least a little bit apparent that something's off with this puddle.

1123
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
Right.

1124
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240
Um...

1125
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,240
Can I just run away again? I'll just run away into one of those stalls.

1126
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
Cool.

1127
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,240
Where you can see me.

1128
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:51,440
Cool. Yeah, I would say like you're gonna move fast enough and take him enough by surprise that like you just get away and go

1129
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,600
One of the stalls you think hey, what the fuck and he starts to like bang on the stall

1130
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:02,700
What event he on the floor does that get lapped up on it by his slime body? Yeah that goes into his body

1131
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,920
Disgusting I don't think oh, I mean it's up to you Barry. Yeah, I didn't think it there

1132
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,580
But what this it's women. It's a woman's bad. I think it gets

1133
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:20,080
You think yeah, you can't have venuses how do how do women pee I don't know I never can I call Sullivan ask him a question

1134
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:39,740
I'm not giving you my mom's number. I need to call her right now. Some guys try to roast me on a spit

1135
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,940
Can we talk later?

1136
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,540
How does she pee, at least?

1137
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,940
I don't know how my mom pees!

1138
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,340
Okay, hang up.

1139
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,540
You're useless.

1140
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,940
Sullivan to himself is like, "Should I know how my mom pees, too?"

1141
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,340
[laughter]

1142
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,340
Um, yeah, cool.

1143
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:03,940
Uh, we'll cut back from that to you guys in the room that the worm is leading you into.

1144
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:18,940
You see a particularly like, it looks like a normal back room of a club, except it's a little bit more dilapidated, it's the abandoned Techno Slime Factory.

1145
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,940
Where people have sex.

1146
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,940
Yeah, people fucking. And you see...

1147
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,940
Ewww, you didn't have to say it.

1148
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,940
I cover my eyes.

1149
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,940
I throw up.

1150
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:44,940
Do you guys keep walking? I cover my eyes and hold my nose. Yeah? I hold my nose. I try to cover the throw up with my hand and the throw up shoots out so fast that it gets in my eye.

1151
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:56,940
Okay. What happens after that? I throw up more. Yeah, you tell me. Okay, cool. I get a normal healthy boner. Yep. Thank God, you know. I throw up on his boner.

1152
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:05,940
boner. So you walk, I say, guys, this is

1153
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,940
awful.

1154
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:15,740
It's called as you guys are as you guys are walking around and

1155
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,840
sucking puke off each other's boners.

1156
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
What the hell?

1157
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:44,640
Yeah, and watching people fuck you reach a part of the end of the back where it's starting to get really really dark like too dark sort of like in a souls game where it gets like pitch black in like an area and you walk through and it's just a wall and it looks like that and as you get there you hear familiar voice.

1158
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,640
Say, "Don't come any closer."

1159
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,600
You guys would recognize that as the mad suckler.

1160
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,960
Oh, this fucking guy.

1161
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,520
Yeah, who?

1162
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,420
Yeah.

1163
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:57,920
I throw up on him.

1164
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
"Don't come any closer." Where are we supposed to go?

1165
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,320
Okay, I got a mouth full of cock and puke.

1166
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,120
I'm supposed to make a...

1167
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,320
I'm supposed to talk to you.

1168
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,720
He holds out his inordinately long finger.

1169
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,720
I put my mouth on it.

1170
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,440
Oh, this is why my damn worm...

1171
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,720
That wasn't even my worm.

1172
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,040
That was just one of the worms he has.

1173
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:29,000
the

1174
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,800
I think Pat last time you sucked on his finger.

1175
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,640
Definitely one of us definitely.

1176
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,760
That was definitely me, yeah?

1177
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:43,000
He said, oh, I remember this OK.

1178
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,920
Yeah, you like it.

1179
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,480
You still like it?

1180
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,400
No, he likes it.

1181
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,680
I hate it.

1182
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,600
Watch this and I start walking towards.

1183
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,400
Down the finger.

1184
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,660
(laughing)

1185
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,120
- How far can you get?

1186
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,960
- And then I throw up.

1187
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,240
- Roll constitution to see how many inches you get.

1188
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,060
(laughing)

1189
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,280
- Roll constitution, yeah.

1190
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,880
- 10.

1191
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,720
- 10.

1192
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,880
- You can't even deep throw.

1193
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,720
You take those--

1194
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,540
- How many inches?

1195
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,380
- What?

1196
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,800
I thought that was for, hold on, let me roll a,

1197
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,480
okay, I'm gonna roll a D20.

1198
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,120
- Let me roll one more time.

1199
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,400
- How long is the finger?

1200
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,320
- Hold on, let me just roll again.

1201
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,360
- How long is the finger?

1202
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,360
We'll do it. We'll do it the same way

1203
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,800
dude

1204
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,120
No

1205
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,220
Just said you can't you know you got a ten dude. What the fuck you think?

1206
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,220
I don't think that your esophagus is long enough

1207
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:43,880
Ten inch we're gonna. I'm gonna roll small Yoda for a roll a d4 and if I get

1208
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,640
We'll do it the same way. I guess cuz this has this has no consequences

1209
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,440
So yeah

1210
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,080
You don't have to roll at all.

1211
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,080
Just say that you put it all in your ear.

1212
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,080
You get one inch before you throw up.

1213
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:09,080
*Laughter*

1214
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,080
Not even fully in your throat, dude.

1215
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,080
*Laughter*

1216
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,080
It just went past your teeth.

1217
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,080
At the lips, yeah.

1218
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,080
It smelled so bad.

1219
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
*Laughter*

1220
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:33,520
Okay, and Vansome goes like, "That didn't happen last time, but, um, look, just, I don't want

1221
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,680
too many people to know that I'm, I hear you guys yelling about love slime over and over

1222
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,080
and over again.

1223
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,240
Just take the love slime and go.

1224
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,240
Here I'll give you some.

1225
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,240
Oh, thank you.

1226
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,240
I have some.

1227
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,240
Just hold on.

1228
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,480
You have to keep this quiet."

1229
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,640
I hold onto his finger.

1230
01:02:49,640 --> 01:03:12,600
the

1231
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:19,600
the highest investigation

1232
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,600
- Nice. - See if this is real live love slime.

1233
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,600
- Oh yeah. - Yeah, definitely, definitely, definitely.

1234
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,600
- Oh, true. - Definitely really interesting.

1235
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,600
- I'll roll to see if it's real love slime. That's a good idea.

1236
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,600
Yeah, 'cause Patches would trick us.

1237
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,600
- I would. - No, Matt Suckler would.

1238
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,600
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,600
- Patches would never, but the Matt Suckler might.

1240
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,600
- He was based off of Patches.

1241
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
- Yeah. - Yeah, he's based off of me with my long hair.

1242
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
- You got that 26.

1243
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,600
- Yeah.

1244
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,600
Yeah, I mean, like,

1245
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,600
I don't know how much knowledge you have about

1246
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,080
Love slime this would be more Barry G's department

1247
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,760
but at least from we have the one guy who would know about this is

1248
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,280
We can always just go

1249
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:15,480
Where I'm just hiding behind under the stall and someone comes in I just go to the next all over and just

1250
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,480
- You're tormenting the bouncer. - You did nothing on this mission.

1251
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,480
- You did absolutely nothing. - I distracted the guard.

1252
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,480
- I distracted the guard. - We didn't need him to be distracted.

1253
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,480
- There's a bouncer. - You don't know that.

1254
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:36,480
- I distracted the bouncer. - He's in full plate armor and he has like a spear and a torch.

1255
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,480
- You're a guard. He's like, "No, I'm a bouncer."

1256
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,160
Yeah, you mentioned his steel boots, but he has steel everything.

1257
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
[laughter]

1258
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:55,600
I mean, with the 26, you can tell that, like, it's, it looks like a slime TM product,

1259
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,600
and it's definitely not Techno Slime.

1260
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,280
And that's like a pretty good indicator that it's probably Love Slime.

1261
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,960
I believe you, I just ran a check on this, basically.

1262
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,960
And, uh, yeah, you're, we're good.

1263
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,400
Okay, well...

1264
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,920
If you're going back to marry Kate

1265
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,100
Tell her I'm go I will return

1266
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,520
What the court?

1267
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,960
Well, yeah

1268
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:31,300
The Lord. Hey, you want me to say I will you want me to say he said I will return you admitted fucking act it out

1269
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,840
No, don't you don't have to act it out. Just can I paraphrase I

1270
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,240
If you have to, if that's too hard to remember.

1271
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,440
The mad suckler, he's gonna be swinging on by.

1272
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,280
Okay.

1273
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,240
It's pretty good.

1274
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,400
Okay.

1275
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,640
And yeah, and you guys got that there slime

1276
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,060
and you guys did it without killing anybody,

1277
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:53,900
which is good.

1278
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:54,840
Was it discreet enough?

1279
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah, you didn't kill anybody, which is good.

1280
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,120
That's basically it for discretion.

1281
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:02,200
But yeah, I mean, right now though,

1282
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,640
you have to figure out how to get Barry Yee

1283
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
out of the women's bathroom.

1284
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,900
Okay, do I have a humongous, silly straw?

1285
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:13,500
Okay.

1286
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,160
All right.

1287
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,900
That's all right. I'm teasing.

1288
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,660
Do I have a killer clowns from outer space, silly straw?

1289
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:24,300
Or is there one in the room that maybe they used to have a worm

1290
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,600
sounding or something?

1291
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,340
You have a worm.

1292
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,400
Oh, yeah, true.

1293
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,100
Can I?

1294
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,060
I have worms all around.

1295
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:34,160
Can I worm centipede my worms to create one long tube?

1296
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:40,000
the

1297
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,840
the

1298
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,340
the

1299
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,840
the

1300
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,340
the

1301
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,580
the

1302
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,820
the

1303
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,020
the

1304
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,220
the

1305
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,360
the

1306
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,480
What you have to roll is...

1307
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,480
Let's have you just roll...

1308
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,900
God, everything with you guys do is like dexterity, right?

1309
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,720
'Cause it's just your ability to like, put things together.

1310
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,720
Intellect! Intelligence!

1311
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,280
This is an intelligence thing.

1312
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,280
This is a very intelligent thing.

1313
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,660
Okay, so a saving throw?

1314
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:23,160
No, just regular.

1315
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:23,920
Regular intelligence.

1316
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,420
23.

1317
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:24,920
Oh!

1318
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,800
Fuck yeah.

1319
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,420
You... I don't know...

1320
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,620
You've just had a lot of experience human centipeding things, I guess.

1321
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:36,020
You're and I kind of I like whip it around the entire place.

1322
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,220
Well, that's women's restroom.

1323
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,720
That's going to be a check or you're going to have to get somebody

1324
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,520
to feed it in there.

1325
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,020
I want to see him whip it.

1326
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,920
Yeah, everybody.

1327
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,020
Everybody's kind of looking at me now.

1328
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,420
I already did.

1329
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,720
I did like the hard part.

1330
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,020
Well, you whip it and the the front of it just slams into the door.

1331
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:02,520
I actually, okay, all right, now could you, sorry, would you mind opening that door and

1332
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,520
every door between here and the women's restroom?

1333
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,200
Yeah, that one too.

1334
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,080
We each hold one of the doors open.

1335
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,080
My assistants.

1336
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:17,760
We all hold one door open and thread the worm.

1337
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,760
Yeah, you guys thread the worm through the club.

1338
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:26,440
I hear a large ruckus, then someone's knocking on the door, so I just leave there out, out

1339
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,440
of their

1340
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:31,440
worms.

1341
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,440
No, wait, no,

1342
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:38,440
I have one end of this of the worm straws in the women's

1343
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,440
restroom and I don't know where Gary I don't know.

1344
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,440
I don't know if Barry's in there.

1345
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,440
So I just start sucking.

1346
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,440
It's in the toilet.

1347
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,440
It's in the bigger than I thought he was.

1348
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:51,440
Barry.

1349
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,440
Yeah,

1350
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,440
it just keeps sucking.

1351
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,440
I'm just gulping down women's shits and used tampons.

1352
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,440
[laughter]

1353
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,440
Yeah, it's great.

1354
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,440
And then Harry slimes through the toilet.

1355
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,440
[laughter]

1356
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,440
Well, you wouldn't know if he came through at all.

1357
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,440
You would just like, "I think I got him."

1358
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,440
Yeah, "I think he may be in here somewhere."

1359
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,440
[laughter]

1360
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,440
And I'm just like, fountaining out just different shit.

1361
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,440
Just lost earrings and underwear.

1362
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,440
You know when women drop the toilets.

1363
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,840
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

1364
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:29,440
Yeah, thinking a girl lost earrings and yeah, of course, yeah,

1365
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,240
in a pink heart, a fucking Barbie.

1366
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,540
Yeah, yeah.

1367
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,240
A Barbie doll.

1368
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,640
Cool.

1369
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,040
I mean, you guys got the love slime.

1370
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:45,240
I'm I say we we chill out there because I think the last one

1371
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,340
was a little bit longer.

1372
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:49,140
So I feel comfortable in this one where it's at.

1373
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,140
Unless you don't.

1374
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:56,620
I rolled 100 dice.

1375
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:01,660
And I planted a bomb in the woman's bathroom and it blows up and then we run away.

1376
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:03,180
Okay good.

1377
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,180
Yeah.

1378
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,660
If you could have planted a bomb we wouldn't have had to do any of this right?

1379
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,660
I planted a bomb.

1380
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,180
Oh shit.

1381
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:14,180
Were you actually planting a bomb?

1382
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,180
Uh yeah I did it and it exploded.

1383
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,180
Okay.

1384
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:23,180
Yeah, that roll I just did was how much damage everyone in the club did.

1385
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,180
