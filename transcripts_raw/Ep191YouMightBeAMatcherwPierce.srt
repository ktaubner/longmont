1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,180
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,940
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,360
- Sing it.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,700
- I'm so scared!

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,620
I love it!

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,060
- I love it!

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,460
- That's a bike if somebody likes a haunted house.

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,380
(laughing)

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,960
- That's her walking around the haunted house.

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,800
- It could be so many things.

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,620
- Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,460
- Scary movie.

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,200
- I'm so scared!

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,320
- Or like this is one that could,

18
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,240
this is a multi-purpose one. It could be like, "I am there! I love it!"

19
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,400
That's like anywhere where she likes to be.

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
It could be a haunted house, but it could be anywhere else.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,600
It's usually, "I'm here," though, right?

22
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,560
"I... Nuh-uh."

23
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,600
It's hard to be there.

24
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, that's someone who's astral projecting.

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay. So, it could work for anything, too, if it's someone who's astral projecting.

26
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,640
You can astral project anywhere, so it works for anything.

27
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,240
What about this one? What about this one? They don't want to be somewhere, and it's,

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,280
"I'm not there! I love it!"

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
- That's better, I think.

30
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,000
- I'm not there, maybe like a tsunami happened in Japan.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,920
- Oh, and you love it 'cause you're not there.

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,080
- I love that you're not there.

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,160
Like you check in on Facebook

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,760
that you're safe after a shooting.

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,960
- Yeah, you say, "I'm not there, I love it."

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,880
- I'm not there, I love it!

37
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,560
- I do love saying, "I love it," like that.

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
Just in conversation.

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
- I love it!

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,080
- How are you enjoying your meal, sir?

41
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,200
- I guess I don't care, I love it,

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,800
could also just be for use for anything

43
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,040
that you don't care about but love.

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,120
no

45
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,000
no yeah give me a situation it wouldn't work in

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
skimmy situation here birth of child birth i don't care

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,520
i love it people who can use trial of the unconditionally i don't care whether

48
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,880
it's a boy or girl i don't care

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,000
in denver today what if it's dead

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
i don't care still about it

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,580
i still love those dead

52
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,880
yeah you're weird

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
the i'd stop loving you and i was really okay that's fine anyway i would think

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,800
about a cost i was just about to get a lot of

55
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,760
well the end of it i would say i love it

56
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,880
but you don't care. The important part is the I love it. No, you can't split that

57
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,280
like you can't compartmentalize, you have to take the whole thing. Say the words. I don't care.

58
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,280
The holocaust happened, now say the words. Go ahead, how do you feel about it Cameron?

59
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,560
Cameron Fetter. Cameron Fetter would probably say well every rose has its thorn. Don't speak for him.

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:24,160
What are you doing? He's touching my double knee. You're trying to distract from what you have to say.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,600
what you're talking about what you feel about the Holocaust

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,100
I care, I love it.

63
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,100
You love it.

64
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,100
You love it.

65
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,100
You love it.

66
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
What the fuck?

67
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
You didn't think that one through.

68
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,100
I guess we didn't think of other things to say instead of I love it.

69
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I it.

70
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
I care, I hate it.

71
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
I care, I hate it.

72
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
I don't love it.

73
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
I don't love it.

74
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,100
I don't love it.

75
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
I don't love it.

76
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Oh, there we go.

77
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
I don't love it.

78
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I don't love it.

79
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,100
I don't love it.

80
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
I don't love it.

81
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,100
I don't love it.

82
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
I don't love it.

83
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,100
I don't love it.

84
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
I don't love it.

85
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't love it.

86
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,380
There we go. Yeah, yeah, we'll be I don't

87
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,620

Basically Charlie Xe X we just prove that you love the holocaust don't I don't

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:37,060
That's what I would do if I went to one of her live performances. I would be asking her questions as she sings this song.

92
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
"So tell me Charlie, how do you feel about the Holocaust?" And then have her sing the lyrics.

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Then the show gets shorter. "Got her! I got her!" And then I'd get her too.

94
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,060
Yeah. I'd get her. I'm the getter. I'm the getter. I'm the getter grabber.

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060

- No, we can pull it up, or I guess Flash is over, right?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
- Yeah, there's a website where it's up there.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,880

147
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,720

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,500

165
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,500
you guys should curate the library. No people want a lot of options. The best

166
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,660
the best okay, there's like thousands. There's dozens of games out there. I

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
I think like five is a magic number.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Five is like the least magic number.

169
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
No, five is a small number.

170
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,200
Yeah.

171
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Right.

172
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:09,840
But--

173
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
It might be magic, but it's small.

174
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,160
Don't you want a lot of options when you're

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,840
going to play games on a swagpoop.com?

176
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
On a swagpoop.com?

177
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,800
One of them, yeah.

178
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,040
Yeah, I guess you're right.

179
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
Maybe 100 is the magic number.

180
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,560
Is there any way we could consolidate the screen, though?

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,280
What do you mean?

182
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,360
Like swagpoop.com/games, and then you can pick it all up.

183
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,800
No, unfortunately, they all have to be in the menu bar.

184
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
You can't do that on a website.

185
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,120
That's not possible. They have to, whatever link you want to go to, it has to be at

186
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,320
the top or else you can't get there.

187
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
See, I don't do web design, so I don't know.

188
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,240
Yeah, I've done a lot of training on this type of thing.

189
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,000
And you want to have at least 20 games that are on the bar of your website.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Right. And you have to scroll down on the bar to see them all?

191
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,600
Yeah, the bar is basically the screen at that point.

192
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,120
Because that's what a website is, is a screen with links.

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Right. Yeah.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,080
There's a lot of, I mean, I think websites are,

195
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,880
websites back in the day used to be so much better.

196
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
I agree.

197
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,400
Wow, before millennials ruined everything.

198
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,960
Yeah, if millennials wanted to make everything

199
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,880
look all square, spacey, and minimalist on their websites.

200
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,120
I think it was, yeah.

201
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Maximalist websites were way better.

202
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,920
I think it was those annoying ass people

203
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,120
in the 80s and 90s that ruined websites.

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,960
Yep.

205
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,280
It used to be.

206
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,120
They were better before that.

207
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
It used to be a bunch of punch cards.

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Yeah, it was cool as fuck.

209
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,340
I do want to I want to use one of those computers. I want to get a big an

210
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,200
odyssey. I don't fucking know what it's called. I don't either. I think that's

211
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
a different thing altogether. I think that's a good answer that a Greek man

212
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,020
went on. No, I'm thinking about the Magnavox. I'm going to go on an odyssey

213
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,080
or my name is an

214
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,160
street. Yeah, he's the most annoying. They were all he was like I'm going to

215
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
go on an odyssey. Yeah,

216
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,000
that's like if it's like if Columbus was like I'm going to go on a

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,940
Christophus I'm going to go to Columbia. You just go on a damn Odyssey already

218
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,400
man you're fucking ruining the he sits around talking about that Odyssey for so

219
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,820
long. I did it did first. He explained to us what an Odyssey was then he was

220
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,000
like all right. Well, when I go on it, I'm going to tell you some on my

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,820
going back and told me that shit. I would not have believed him. Let my go

222
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,320
on a camera knee to the store after yeah, I just went on a cable be yeah.

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,720
What's a camera? That's an adventure that camera goes on to the store.

224
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,640
well this one is to the story. He goes to the bathroom not often.

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,400
That is what I mean there's so many other people that have gone on odyssey

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,720
since no to so to Mario. No, you know what that's they call it at that, but

227
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,240
that was for the localization. It's actually a Mario. We were not in

228
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,640
java game in Japan. It's called Super Mario Mario.

229
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,960
Okay, that makes sense. I just translated it. Yes, Abe's a B.

230
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:02,760
Yeah, yeah, baby. What other odysseys are there in Indiana Jones?

231
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Does he go to every fucking movie?

232
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,360
He goes to a temple of doom and a raiders of the last ark.

233
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
He doesn't go on an odyssey.

234
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,660
He does.

235
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,160
He says I'm jonesing for a crystal.

236
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,860
I'm jonesing to go to Indiana.

237
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,760
Go on an Indiana eat to Indiana.

238
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,260
I'm jonesing to meet an Indian.

239
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,900
that is where Jones and comes from is Indiana Jones

240
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,620
no yeah because he comes from the soda what's that the soda Jones soda I'm

241
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,380
jonesing oh it does it actually yeah so they would say that yeah when the

242
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:43,100
commercial for Indiana Jones it's a they have that just that uh there's a few

243
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,900
places I went to in Seattle if they have it on in a fountain like like on tap like

244
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,020
get it Jones in a fountain fountain Jones yeah yeah I'd see the damn Jones so to

245
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,820
be like this belongs in a fountain this bumps all around that was insanely good

246
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,740
this fits belongs in a bump yep because Indiana Jones also looks for the

247
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,780
fountain of you you're thinking of the last crusade he looks at the last

248
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,540
crusade okay yeah he's not looking for the found a youth yeah there's no movie

249
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,460
Indiana Jones and the Fountain of Fuse. Whatever he's looking for is in the name of the movie

250
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,420
and it's after the end of that. Did he ever look for the Holy Grail?

251
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
He's looking for the crusade. No.

252
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,380
That was when he looked for the last crusade. Yeah, that's just part of the crusade.

253
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,540
That was incidental, yeah. That was just an accident.

254
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,020
Yeah, exactly. He picked it up and he was like, "Eh, well."

255
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,620
Excalibur. I thought that King Arthur was real until like a year ago.

256
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,620
I've been reading some King Arthur stuff. It's pretty cool.

257
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
He's cool. I think he is real.

258
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
You do? Yeah.

259
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,620
was an aardvark I think it's like it's like 99% of historians think he was a

260
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,460
clear Arthur and then 1% thinks thank you he was kind of real well there's a kid

261
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,980
in his court yeah that was Arthur yeah yeah okay what's is Arthur the odd works

262
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,580
last name the aardvark yeah yeah I don't know I think it's penance eW short for

267
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,740
Arthur the art works, yeah, I guess Arthur is the king of his own universe.

268
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,600
everybody has named it yeah so Arthur's a scratch don't even go there as a

284
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,640

75% of men. Buster is your Buster. You know what I'm talking about. Which is the muscle

301
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,760
pretty cool that they had a the Jewish family in oh here's a yeah I think I

302
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,480
should representation Tommy's actions towards dill in the Rugrats movie

303
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,580
he paralleled the sacrifice of Isaac.

304
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,180
That's interesting. I'm not sure I remember that. I remember yeah, I do

305
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,680
they have a lot of interesting Jewish representation, but I'm not sure I like

306
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
what they're going for with Reptar.

307
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,080
I don't think that's fair. Yeah, that's I don't think it's fair. First of all,

308
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,080
to have a giant lizard. I don't think it's fair to have two small Jewish

309
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,480
babies controlling is pickles a Jewish last name. Yes, okay, yep, no further

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,880
questions. That was an Ellis Island name.

Oh, whatever, pickles. It was like Schvartzweiner. You're gonna have funny ass babies. And your

like a movie. I know that's sick. I'm I that's what that can be. That is a

326
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,880
movie mailbox. That is a movie mail box in front of the house normal style

327
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,760
with a flag. Yeah, yeah, I thought the flag was so when I went to my

328
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,360
grandmother says she had one. I just play with the flag. I just put you put it

329
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,920
down. Yeah, well, the mailman has to come get this. We used to do. We used to

330
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,380
plastic toy on that mailbox. We used to put a rock in the mailbox and put the

331
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,780
flag and see if the mailman would take the rock and he never did. Yeah, you

332
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,680
forgot to put a stamp on it. Probably, yeah, because it's a rock going anywhere

333
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,400
with no stamps. Yeah, put a whole ham sandwich in the mailbox. You did. We

334
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,900
should put firecrackers in the mailbox and then we killed a pregnant lady.

335
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,900
and then I went back in time and went back in time and I went back in time

336
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,540
trying to save it. I lost my hands. I literally I watched like the first 20

337
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,460
minutes of that the other day and then I was like oh I don't know how to watch this.

338
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:32,460
Dude it's an upsetting movie. It's like the butterfly effect. Within the first 10 minutes of that movie he's

339
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,580
already getting diddled by by Eric Stoltz. Yeah it's one of those. It's like

340
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,620
it's like that like in 2004 when they were like we need like like we need to make

341
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,220
a requiem for a dream kind of like. The edgiest movie we can make. Yeah. And they made a time travel movie about like what if you

342
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,700
could go back and stop your molestation. Yeah and he keeps going back in time and

343
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,180
then showing up and he has like no nose and no eyes. Yeah. Oh I should have just.

344
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:03,140
And the moral of the story is like yeah probably don't worry about it. Getting molested was the best thing that could have happened to you.

345
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,340
molested is the biggest part of all yeah

346
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,380
another movie that I thought was called

347
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,780
the butterfly effect maybe you've seen

348
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,180
this Cameron they like go back in time

349
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,740
and they kill one t-rex this is the only

350
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,820
thing you can do they have a time

351
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,180
machine where you can go back in time

352
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,060
and there's like a tunnel where you're

353
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,620
not allowed to touch anything the only

354
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,740
thing you're allowed to do is kill this

355
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,300
one dinosaur uh-huh and then you come

356
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,860
back to the present you're like yay and

357
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
then they're like but you can't take

358
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,220
anything you can't touch anything but

359
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,260
one guy brings a butterfly this sounds

360
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,740
familiar and then at the butterfly animated it's not called the butterfly

361
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,220
effect but it is it's is it is it animated no I mean like it's live action

362
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,260
but all the maybe this is a prequel they come back and then yeah there's like a

363
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,980
weird plot point where they're like humans were the most recent animal to

364
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:54,540
evolve so if you change anything in the past the humans will change so what do

365
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,820
they come back to so they come back to a world where people are like see through

366
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,880
is it a sound of thunder yes yeah it is a battle it's based on a Ray Bradbury

367
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,200
story it is about time tourists and that's a link on Wikipedia okay that

368
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
just links to time travel I hate Wikipedia I think time travel would be

369
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,400
pretty cool yeah I wouldn't do it yeah I think I was going forward what I would

370
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,440
hate to go for it actually I would go back in time by by like one thing and

371
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,360
then and then resell it I'm going all the way back I'm not seeing anything

372
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,980
that we were up to I want to see the dinosaurs maybe the pyramids yeah this

373
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,980
movie sounds awesome I want to personally see William Shakespeare but

374
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,860
just my I see William you just want to see him walk around I just want to see

375
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,880
him yeah I don't know actually one guy or 13 you think about like like time

376
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,100
travel doing like a you you're you're a time traveler in this scenario actually

377
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,760
I'd probably make a music video you go probably film myself doing it make it

378
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,260
- You go, you time travel.

379
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,520
- I put my fingers in baby Jesus' mouth.

380
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,080
- I come back, I say, "Smell this."

381
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
- You go back in time to like 1750 or something.

382
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,260
You ever think about what it would smell like?

383
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,740
'Cause I feel like you're in the middle

384
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,900
of the most metropolitan part of 1750.

385
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,160
People are throwing poop out their windows into a trough.

386
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,700
- I know it smelled crazy even then.

387
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,040
- I'd go Germany.

388
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,280
(laughing)

389
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,540
(laughing)

390
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,680
- All right, yeah, okay, yeah, fist bump on that one.

391
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,460
I'd go to Germany, like 1928.

392
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,300
- Germany?

393
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,120
- Yeah, 'cause that might be the stinkiest place of all.

394
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
- All right, you don't get two in a row.

395
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,080
You don't get two in a row.

396
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,720
I'd go to Germany, 1928, and I'd walk around doing this.

397
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,600
I'd be telling people, like, this means you're gay.

398
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,200
(laughing)

399
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,440
- You'd walk around with a small mustache,

400
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,720
just being like, yeah, this represents what I do.

401
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,280
- They tried that with Charlie Chaplin, didn't work.

402
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,540
And then they do and then I tried to turn Hitler's mustache into into mean I get

403
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,880
hit by stuff and then I come back to the present the Holocaust still happened but

404
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,340
all the all the Nazis are doing this with their hands instead of doing the

405
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,320
blood fingers. That'd be cool. It's like you go back in time you're like this

406
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:16,160
means you're gay, this means you're gay, but this means you're cool. Yeah. I didn't mean to do that second

407
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,800
thing that yeah you know I just I just wanted to show everybody that I wasn't

408
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,600
gay not trying to stop the Holocaust just make the Nazi salute not happy yeah

409
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,400
yeah it's the lynch it's too hard to do you stop the Holocaust you know I mean

410
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,080
oh right cuz you think it was inevitable yeah it's gonna happen no matter what

411
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,280
anything you're gonna be Hitler I would go back in time I would go back in time

412
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,680
and I maybe bury a time capsule with a lot of money or something and then I

413
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,720
I would get it and I would get all the money.

414
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
- I would bury.

415
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,440
(laughing)

416
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,880
- I'd put a whoopee cushion.

417
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
- I think I'd bury my Game Boy under the dirt

418
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,360
and then I'd go dig it up in the future

419
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,320
and I'd get to play with it.

420
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,760
- Yeah, you don't really need time travel for this.

421
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,440
(laughing)

422
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,000
- Yeah, I'd build a sand castle.

423
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
- I'm going to bury something right now.

424
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,560
That actually sounds awesome.

425
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,040
- Did you guys ever do a time capsule?

426
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,880
Were you ever part of one?

427
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,360
I feel like I've, one of them should be opened by now.

428
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,200
- Yeah.

429
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,800
I think people open them and it's the most boring thing ever. Yeah, they put a

430
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,040
time capsule into the there's like a the fun of it is definitely burying it and

431
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,340
imagining what it's going to be like, but then when you're just near sitting

432
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,720
there near the high school old shit. Yeah, the high school in my town, they

433
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,860
put a time capsule into like there's like a little like you know like a an

434
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,420
island like thing at the time like we're just like a grassy area in the middle of

435
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,380
the street and they put like there were like benches and stuff there and they

436
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,880
just put a time capsule in the middle of that. So it's just this giant like metal

437
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,780
circle where they like lowered into the ground and just yeah just everybody

438
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,980
would just try to would just try to pay like lift it out of the ground. It's

439
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,720
like a crate. You can't move it. It's just so much. You always just see

440
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,240
people just be like I want to yeah, I want to whip this up yeah. It's right

441
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,980
there. It's not buried. It's right here. Senior prank yeah, lift it up just

442
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,500
putting it. I wonder if I want to do it

443
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:08,700
not even opening the time capsule just like I took it yeah. I would love to

444
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,300
no one else can have it. I would hate to bury my shit in that and be like, oh fuck, I actually

445
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,660
wanted that. Like what if you're like an idiot kid and you're like, I'll bury my Game Boy.

446
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,220
When you leave a $50 bill in your jacket pocket, that's just a time dollar. Yeah, exactly.

447
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,460
And then you open it and you're like, oh fuck, I wish I didn't bury this in my pocket. When

448
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,900
I was little, part of our like porch like rotted or something or like one of the steps

449
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,780
broke and they were like putting in a new porch and I made a time capsule that was like

450
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,900
a jar and I put one of every coin in it and I put it under the porch. That'd be

451
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,980
worth millions. You need to go get that. I know well they just I think redid the

452
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,180
porch again like this year so I don't I wonder if anyone found it. I think they

453
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,740
maybe took it without telling me. I mean I wouldn't tell anyone if I found a

454
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,980
time capsule like that. With money in it? Oh my god. With coins you go to the

455
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,060
arcade and go fucking crazy. Yeah pretty good. Well it's just one of every

456
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,340
so it's a what it's what it's six sixteen how much cents is that? That's

457
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,940
that's that's 41 cents you put well that's 41 you put a half dollar in there

458
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,300
no what do you think I have a half dollar what are you talking about he said one of

459
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,880
every coin you can get a half dollar yeah I also put all the Japanese coins in the

460
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,300
Chinese coins of the clothes for every ancient civilization you said every corner

461
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,500
of a rock dollar and still in circulation it's okay so why don't you

462
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,340
bring up a dollar coin that's not obvious I feel like a dickhead if I pay

463
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,140
with a dollar coin or a half dollar coin.

464
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,980
- I know.

465
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,500
- That's my gold coin.

466
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,340
- That's your gold coin?

467
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,620
(laughing)

468
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,980
- What are you talking about?

469
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,120
- That's my gold coin.

470
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,380
(laughing)

471
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,220
That's my nut.

472
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,500
- No one should have it.

473
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,620
As soon as you get a dollar coin, that's your gold coin.

474
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,460
- You're right.

475
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,400
- Same with a two dollar bill.

476
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,580
- I get a two dollar bill once a year.

477
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,460
- Oh, I met this flight attendant and he was like,

478
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,420
I always get my, I found this one bank

479
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,940
that gives me two dollar bills,

480
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,580
or maybe he specially requests them,

481
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,500
and he's like, and I always leave that as a tip,

482
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
even if it's like way way less than 15% interesting. I guess that is kind of

483
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,580
smart because people do covet those. Yeah, there's I don't think people really

484
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,100
covet those. No, nobody cares. It is. There's an old there's $2. There's an

485
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,220
old lady who would have come into my job at the liquor store. She was all in

486
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,180
blue, completely blued out. She lived every day. And she would, whoever was

487
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,300
working the register, she would just hand them a $2 bill. I got I would

488
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,060
sometimes see her going to store and I'd go over the register. Like, I'm just

489
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,940
status register here to get a two dollar bill please give me the dollar

New Cameron with a new voice and look at this I just moved my hair to the other side.

501
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,340
You point out exactly what's different.

502
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,980

503
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,980
Hello.

504
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,460
I don't think that would work on this lady.

505
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,420
She's pretty wise if she's getting two dollar bills.

506
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,660
She's not wise.

507
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,620
She's blue.

508
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,180
She's truly blue.

509
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,420
She's the bluest woman I've ever seen.

510
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,380
She was one of the bluest women I ever saw.

511
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
She's a blue bitch.

512
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Besides Cortana.

513
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,380
I want to have a kind of one every single day where the same color all the way down.

514
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,060
Yeah, I do respect people when I see that.

515
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,700
Yeah, black is like every you can do that nobody really notices.

516
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
That's a fun color.

517
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,700
If you do like mustard yellow.

518
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,500
I saw a dude who had a he had a fitted a Philly's fitted hat.

519
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,860
He dressed like a clown character.

520
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,140
Philly's fitted hat that was the exact same color as his sweatshirt.

521
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,140
Whoa.

522
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,100
And it was like a sand.

523
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,460
No matching pants though?

524
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,980
no i don't know how i i don't know that's not a source

525
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:58,120

526
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,940

529
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,700
there's a lot of

530
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,280
but these are sure only these are short so it doesn't count but they're sure it's

531
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,380
not a little bit of a short

532
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,380
all

533
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,500
all your own

534
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,020
uh... i want to know what it's not like a but you know i like i think it doesn't

535
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,100
count like

536
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,580
so it's not a little bit

537
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,900
okay i get it

538
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,980
where

539
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,260
you really do have to go outside and start banging garbage can

540
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,020
everybody my friend is matching

541
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,300
yeah it doesn't count if it's all like all one color because they're wearing

542
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,760
wearing like a track suit or something.

543
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,040
It has to be different clothes that are the same color.

544
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,500
- Like jeans that are the same color as your sweatshirt.

545
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,940
- Yeah, if your jeans are the same color as your shirt.

546
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,960
- Here's your sign.

547
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,800
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,620
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,020
- Here's your sign, most matching.

550
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
- Matcher.

551
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,020
(laughing)

552
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,860
- You might be a matcher.

553
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,660
- You might be a matcher if your shoes,

554
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,260
- If your hat, shoes, shirt, pants, socks,

555
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,600
- And your pants.

556
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,340
- If your hat, gloves, shoes, shirt, pants, socks,

557
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,380
and sweatshirt are all the same color,

558
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:24,020
you might be a match. If your socks take as long to put on as your pants, you're

559
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,700
a longer

560
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:35,660
trying to cash in on the on the on the you might be a red night things like I

561
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,380
have to like you have to diversify this. I've just spread it. I don't really

562
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,860
say redneck anymore. Yeah,

563
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,740
your gene pool has jeans in it. You might be a jeaner

564
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:53,240
yeah he's trying to he's trying to hit as broad an audience as possible. So

565
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,140
it's like harder than a longer.

566
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:01,420
If you walk outside, you might be an outside Walker. You might be an

567
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,100
outsider.

568
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:10,740
Yeah, if your house is a little old as a shoe, you might be a little old lady

569
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,260
doesn't sit on your top here we go here we go

570
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:23,860
in way now what now just completely changes the entire rules right in front

571
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,420
of our face yeah it should be like this if you live in a shoe you might be a

572
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,820
sure that's what we said who sits on their tough your ass is always on your

573
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,260
damn tough it off there's no way you for you for guys how do you remember get off

574
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:45,060
and not little miss my fucking insane I didn't remember if you have a neck that

575
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,140
is red in color you might be a neck redder

576
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:57,220
okay this I feel like maybe doesn't really but it segues into the list for

577
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,460
today top ten things to say when using the phrase there's two types of people

578
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,900
in the world there's two types of people in the world there's rednecks and neck

579
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:12,900
redders rednecks and mattresses and shoeers and longsockers

580
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,340
there's a few types of people in the world

581
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,620
there's jumpers and singers

582
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,880
and little miss muffins

583
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,780
if you jump around everyday

584
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,820
you might be a jumper but if you sing you might be a singer jumper

585
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,720
and who's to say you can't be both?

586
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,620
you might be a singer dancer

587
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,440
Chris Brown singer dancer. Oh yeah, you might be a brown neck.

588
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:49,720
If you get tanned on your neck and it doesn't burn, you might be a brown

589
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,620
neck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right number one is people that can respect

590
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,360
opinions and ones who argue about them. Yeah, I can respect differences in

591
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,380
And I can't I actually argue about

592
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:09,380
about

593
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,580
he's disrespecting my opinion

594
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,580
you laughed at it like you were attacking him

595
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,580
you like leaned in and opened your mouth

596
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,580
like you're charging a breath weapon

597
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,580
I know that was so funny

598
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,580
he just

599
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
I thought he was gonna take a bite out of me

600
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,580
you

601
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,580
you

602
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
you were you who were

603
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,580
you were I just have the I really do the stupidest sense of humor ever I just

604
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,580
like you just say the

605
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:04,220
and it's like we were two people

606
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
you

607
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,220
you

608
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,220
you

609
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,220
you

610
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
you

611
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
you

612
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
you

613
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
you

614
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,220
you

615
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,220
you

616
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,220
you

617
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
you

618
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
you

619
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
you

620
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:39,200
Well you guys yeah, yeah, I feel like me and Pierce really had it on lock there you guys

621
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,840
You try you guys try this one then see I think it's this this one's problem. I don't think it's a

622
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,320
Jokes it makes memes so here so how I would do it is like like

623
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,000
Yo, yo mama so fat

624
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,100
She she went out onto the beach and all the whales they've jumped out of the water

625
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,740
and they started singing, "We are family,

626
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,660
"even though you're fatter than me."

627
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,500
- Yeah.

628
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,620
- Me when I don't care.

629
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,700
- See? - Okay.

630
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,860
- See?

631
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,900
- I don't know.

632
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,340
- That was pretty, you guys are holding back tears.

633
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,380
- It was good, it was good,

634
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
but it wasn't as good as the first one.

635
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,220
- Yeah.

636
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,580
- There's nothing, nothing will ever be

637
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,940
as good as the first one.

638
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,620
- The first one is pure.

639
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,900
Well, maybe, yeah.

640
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,740
Well, it may be perfect as if--

641
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,100
- I still think the content of it was pretty funny.

642
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,500
- Yeah, it's true.

643
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,300
Maybe, no, what-- - It's not respect.

644
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,060
I feel like so maybe Caleb says that joke and then Pierce like holds up his phone

645
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,060
and he's created a new meme that's called like like joke that is not true Caleb

646
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,060
and it's like Caleb's face with a bunch of colors behind it and it's like

647
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,060
tells joke that is not true. Yeah, as usual.

648
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,060
That's important.

649
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,060
That's the most...

650
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,060
You have to say as usual at the bottom.

651
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,560
Because yeah, the socially awkward penguin could just be doing one socially

652
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,560
awkward thing. You know, he needs to say like, says yeah, when

653
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,700
when the ticket taker says enjoy your movie, I say as you do as usual. I

654
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,640
think we are new. I think we have a new kind of way to do this, which is we

655
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,760
should just not read the actual thing and just give it to them in the format

656
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,720
of like who we are okay. Yeah, so personally I really like dogs.

657
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,560
I would kill a dog

658
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,460
On the other hand, this one I think is maybe there's there might this might be

659
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,540
more than two types of people. I feel like there might be some middle ground

660
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,380
between this one. No, there's not. I think you like dogs right up to the

661
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,140
point where you would kill one because I would kill a dog. I like dogs.

662
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,740
Well, you said well, okay, so that's that you just disprove. That means

663
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,300
there's not two types of people. I guess there's only one type. It's one

664
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,020
type of person. Everyone is someone who likes dogs until they have to kill

665
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,820
one. Yeah, well, everyone, yeah. If it's just you like dogs or you don't like

666
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:57,500
you like you don't like dogs unless they're attacking you. Yeah I don't think you have to you don't have to hate dogs to kill one.

667
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,860
No. You know what I mean? No. I would kill a dog that was attacked. Not mutually exclusive. Yeah. Yeah if a dog bit my wiener I'd kill it.

668
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:10,780
Does anybody else instantly think of Michael Vick when reading this? Well he's the ultimate middleman. Here's another comment.

669
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,540
Right now I'm thinking right now I'm thinking of what they do in Iran. They kill dogs by injection of acid.

670
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Wait, they like strap him to a chair?

671
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Dog-shaped vial of acid.

672
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,620
It's like the dogs playing poker but they're all in electric chairs.

673
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
That's really good, yeah.

674
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:34,620
Well, here, this comment section is filled with people trying to do your kind of like two-person routine,

675
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:39,620
where there's a bunch of people who say, "And I'm the one who likes dogs. I love dogs. I like dogs."

676
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
But no one's replying to finish it.

677
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Right. "I like dogs. Pug will not be pleased."

678
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,820
In Thieves of Ostia, there's a man who hates dogs because one killed his daughter.

679
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,060
That's probably true. Yeah. What about this number six one? You want to try this

680
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:01,300
one Caleb? Number six? Yeah. I'm the kind of person who just hates Nicki Minaj. And

681
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,300
And personally, I live in a mental hospital.

682
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:16,980
But I do. He had no opinion on Nicki Minaj, but I do live in a mental hospital. I guess I don't

683
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:23,140
hate her. I've never heard of her. All I hear is blah blah blah. Yeah, this one, I don't know.

684
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,180
Hey, I love Nicki Minaj and I am not in a mental hospital.

685
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,100
Well that person, well that's because they're talking about Nicki Minaj, not Nicki Minaj

686
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,260
is a different person.

687
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,820
I hate both of them.

688
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
Okay.

689
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,420
That's number seven, I hate both of them.

690
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,140
Okay, so that's not, yeah.

691
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
That doesn't, hmm.

692
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,060
This option made me laugh.

693
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,580
Definitely using this one in real life.

694
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,660
I've been to mental hospitals before.

695
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
Damn.

696
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,900
Oh my god, get over anaconda.

697
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,780
There's Turn Me On and Marilyn Monroe.

698
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,700
You guys seriously can't give someone a chance.

699
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,700
Okay, so here's here, so I don't know whoever wants to take this, but I mean

700
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,200
I'm just I'm the type of person I play FIFA. I do yoga. You are one who do

701
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,620
yoga.

702
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,120
He fucked it up.

703
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,620
You are one who do yoga. Oh, you are one who do yoga. I've been waiting to

704
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:22,420
meet one and here's well. Here's the from the commenter from the commenter

705
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,120
Puga explains why this is these are this is a difference here. FIFA is much

706
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,100
more interesting and unpredictable. Yoga is neither of those things right yeah.

707
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,820
Well, yoga could be unpredictable. If you just do a surprise yoga move in the

708
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,540
world of fifa players, there's literally just one yogi for everyone. Fifa player,

709
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,740
there's one yoga player.

710
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,840
You play yoga. Yeah, can you win or lose it's? Well, it's the same as like it's

711
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,140
the same. So when you do yoga like and you're just kind of doing it by yourself,

712
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,260
that's like that's like doing like time trial, but like on a sonic level or

713
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,440
something yeah true all right here. I'll try this one out. This is number

714
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,960
seventeen number sixteen is good too, but we do number seventeen. I'm an

715
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,780
atheist plain and simple. I'm one who goes on about it.

716
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,180
I guess

717
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,080
there's a yeah sure

718
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,180
- Or this whole episode is just gonna be us,

719
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,580
it's just us chasing the high of the first one

720
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,780
and getting really upset when none of them work.

721
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,620
- I just thought that whoever was gonna do the,

722
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,460
go on about it would be like,

723
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,620
personally, I gotta, I think there was a God.

724
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,940
- Oh, we would actually go on about it.

725
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,980
- Yeah, yeah. - No, but he,

726
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,820
okay, what about this?

727
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,660
- But he's talking-- - Like, what about this?

728
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,700
Okay, so do it again, here, start over.

729
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,820
- But they're both atheists here.

730
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,100
- Yeah, no, but yeah, so--

731
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,820
- I'm an atheist, and that should tell you

732
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,740
everything you need to know.

733
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,300
- I'm an atheist, and I'm an atheist,

734
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,020
and I'm an atheist, and I'm an atheist,

735
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,020
I'm an atheist and I'm an atheist.

736
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,340
That is how it'll be sounding sometimes.

737
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,420
Oh wait, here's one, number 19.

738
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,900
I'm somebody who actually loves video games.

739

I'm a cancerous five-year-old.

740
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:01,380
Who loves video games more than a five-year-old with cancer?

741
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Yeah, that's all that's true.

742
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,380
They get to eat Mario with their make-a-wish.

743
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,380
They stuff it in that fucking bed.

744
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,660
They make fucking a thousand, they make millions of dollars from charities on Twitch.

745
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Yeah.

750
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,700

I'm a tea bagger. I'm a prostitute. We got him yeah the whole list

801
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,740
Yeah, just stay on the computer. What is it?

802
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,400
Does this he thinks that you get a prostitution teabag?

803
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:36,980
What are you a prostitute a teabagger you can you can teabag a prostitute nobody teabags man? Yeah, don't speak for yourself

00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,300
Except for Master Chief. Maybe when he kills a couple of

806
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,800
Alien freaks yeah, but yeah, you don't teabag a prostitute. You're not paying good money teabag

807
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,480
teabag. Well you to be allowed to teabag someone who's dead. You have to kill

808
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,760
the prostitute. Yeah, teabag. I feel like a lot of people kill prostitutes.

809
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,480
That's like that's one of the things that people do. Well, I've never heard

810
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,680
of that. There's those who kill prostitutes and those who don't teabag

811
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,700
prostitutes.

812
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,640
There's ones who don't not do not teabag. I'm and those who do teabag do

813
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,400
teabag. This is the opening statement of the defense.

814
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,960
I'm a person who grinds. I said that one already did yeah and I grind in my

815
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,880
sleep. I twerk

816
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,320
work. That's what it that's the one. Okay, show me your jiggling ass. All

817
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,800
right, not going to do it. What you put your coffee down. I'm not going to do

818
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
it. I put it that's that's like me putting my foot down. This is my foot

819
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,700
put that ass down. This cop is my foot your ass down to the ground and let

820
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,400
this coffee is my foot. How do how do women move this copy of my foot like

821
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,400
that? It's their back. It's a lower back. It's actually just their

822
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,980
you're tricking us. It's like this

823
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:52,820
rubber pencil. Look it's elastic. Yeah, that's actually their stomach that you

824
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,540
see from the side and it looks like their butt moving around. Yeah, it's

825
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,780
actually that's actually everything that's actually

826
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,220
moving the entire world and your eyes.

827
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,980
That's actually just air moving. It's shimmering air. It's like a it's like

828
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,020
It's like a mirage.

829
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,220
What's happening is they make a super hot fart that makes the air shimmer.

830
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,220
Oh, that makes sense.

831
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,220
Like when you look at a brick wall in the summer.

832
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,540
Those are stink lines moving on the inside.

833
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,620
You ever seen the video?

834
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,540
Your eye confuses stink lines for the vibration, like curve lines.

835
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,540
That's right.

836
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,940
You ever seen a fart while twerking?

837
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,700
I can, what do you mean see it?

838
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
Like you imagine?

839
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,180
Like somebody farts while they're twerking.

840
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,180
You see the butt moving and it goes like.

841
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,180
I've seen cake farts.

842
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,180
It makes a fart sound?

843
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,420
Oh yeah, I have seen that actually.

844
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,620
I feel like hearing that is the more interesting part of it.

845
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,620
You can see the fart.

846
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,620
You can see the butt jiggle with the fart.

847
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,900
Is it weird that I like the way you did that?

848
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,580
There are two kinds of people.

849
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,580
Try another list.

850
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
I think we went all the way through.

851
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,580
I think we juiced this one.

852
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,620
I'm one who takes selfies.

853
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,620
You actually are.

854
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,620
Well, here's one.

855
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,620
Yeah, fuck you.

856
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Bitch.

857
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,620
I'm a descendant of Seth.

858
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,620
I'm a descendant of Cain.

859
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,620
Seth?

860
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,620
Yeah.

861
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,620
Seth was the third one.

862
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Which one's Seth?

863
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,880
after it was it was it was able cane Seth Seth was the third shot. We didn't

864
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,960
hear about Seth what when I was growing up, no, you should have and you guys

865
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,520
purport probably stupid stupid guys. I know it's pretty funny. I was probably

866
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,140
able. I just couldn't count to I could yeah like said you heard Seth and it

867
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,060
just didn't go into your memory. This one's the story top ten best places to

868
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,340
poop. Have we done that one? I don't know. I think we have. I don't think so. I

869
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,760
think we could do this one. I'm a good Samaritan.

870
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:49,160
I'm in a toilet. I'm a good Samaritan. I'm Chinese. I've played cave story. I

871
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,720
bite into chocolate and people who eat it in pieces.

872
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:58,980
I'm the ones that like hyenas and the ones that like lions.

873
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:05,660
Wait, I like lions and you twerk

874
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:12,940
Can we do this top ten best places to poop one? Sure. Did we not do? I feel like we did.

875
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,300
All right, well let's do this. Let's look at it. Hold up. I feel like, I don't know.

876
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,860
Who knows? It doesn't matter. It actually doesn't matter whether we did it or not.

877
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:27,260
Holy shit. And I think it does. Damn. God damn. I mean this is similar to only the other

878
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,240
ones. You might be a thinker that it does-er. What about, what about, can we just do the

879
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,580
top ten most disgusting things that people can do? Yeah. Okay. This one's got to go.

880
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,100
go ahead and read this one. Okay, this is the top ten things people can do that

881
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:44,320
are extremely disgusting. Number one is rape. Solo Potato says, "Holy crap,

882
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,200
this is so bad. It's 100 times on this list. Which cruel, disgusting person

883
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,200
would even think about this?" Yeah. So that's the type of person I am and

884
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,060
Pierce, who are you?

885
00:49:53,060 --> 00:50:00,220
One thumbs up equals one prayer for the people who have had to go through this.

886
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,300
Yeah, there are two kinds of people in this world. Well, I just go through you

887
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,920
got you have you have two thumbs. You're only using one of them to give a

888
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,220
prayer. I mean that's right yeah. What's that's kind of why not just give number

889
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,380
to eat other people yeah, that's not good. That's pretty cool. Seriously

890
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,900
people are already doing this in China. They're selling baby soup. Can you

891
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,580
believe how unhuman that is honestly eating babies is really gross people

892
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,940
like this deserve to be thrown into jail. They don't do that in China and I

893
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,620
would know that is a myth by people who hate China. They did eat some in Hawaii

894
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,740
a few centuries ago. These are the two types of people. I know this is

895
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,500
disgusting, but your comments about baby soup. No, this is just plain horrible.

896
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,380
Peoples in China are just weird for drinking baby soup.

897
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,180
People don't know what adjective to describe

898
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:51,140
nasty. Wasn't that they refer to that that artist who did that thing where he

899
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,420
ate he ate a fake baby? I don't know remember that I don't remember. It's

900
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,900
pretty cool. Look at me to look mad real only cannibals and some survivors with

901
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:04,740
no food do that only cannibals. Do you think you need some animals and some

902
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,760
survivors? What's the point of eating people when you have other meats?

903
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,940
Good point yeah, I think I always

904
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:18,060
think about like I feel like every time you hear about like people cannibalizing

905
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,600
somebody, they always die like one day later. It's like when when you just

906
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,580
fucking chill for one day and so like eating your that's your chance, but it

907
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,320
it doesn't work. It almost never works out. I know, but that's something

908
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,960
that's your chan. No, that's not that's not your chance to survive. That's

909
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,000
your chance to eat a person. Yeah, it's the person in a reassimilate into

910
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,120
society. I was reading this thing where, like

911
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,180
some like serial killer guy killed a bunch of people and then like

912
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:47,320
baked put them into foods. I forget what kind of food some kind of meat

913
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,240
food hot dog and he gave he like gave them to people at like the like town

914
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,320
fair or whatever. So it's just a whole town just like eight people and didn't

915
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,160
about it. You imagine finding out about that after the fact and be like

916
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
there's that dark water movie that's based off of the or no dark water came

917
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,280
first and then a lease a lamb or whatever the woman who was found on the

918
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,160
water tank. Oh yeah, yeah, people were drinking her her body water yeah. I

919
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,480
just

920
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,320
yeah, but that's what I mean is like a

921
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:23,960
imagine finding out you were drinking a girl's water or eating a guy's meat

922
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,420
and you didn't even you didn't know about it and you know you don't you

923
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,220
don't get to enjoy it or be disgusted by it's like well, like if I found out I

924
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,660
ate a guy's pie or whatever that was had a guy that had a guy pie that had

925
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,220
pie guy

926
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,140
guys pie and I was like I feel like I wouldn't even be able to be disgusted

927
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,000
because I already happen like it's not like it's like if you ate a hot dog or

928
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,340
you found out a year later that was like a rotten hot dog. You wouldn't be

929
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,940
yeah. I'll be like okay, yeah behind me I'm living in the I'm looking for my

930
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,800
- It's ex-food.

931
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,620
- Yeah, exactly.

932
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,460
- I'm not worried about what I used to eat.

933
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,300
- I'm not gonna throw up, it's not still in me.

934
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,640
It's in the toilet, it's making, it's guy water now.

935
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,480
- Yeah, exactly.

936
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,380
- It's guy water for rats.

937
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,820
- Which we never thought could even happen.

938
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,660
- Yeah.

939
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:02,480
- We made guy water.

940
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,880
- Well, guy water is when guy pie

941
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,620
goes through a boy's system.

942
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,460
- A boy's boy.

943
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,420
(laughing)

944
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,260
- Guys, guys water can only be--

945
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,300
- The boy's system turns pie to water.

946
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,620
- Guys water can only be made

947
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,740
after it goes through boy's system.

948
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,580
- Yeah.

949
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,760
- That's the two types.

950
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,600
- Yeah.

951
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,980
- Boy's systems and guys water.

952
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,340
I just don't I don't I don't I would not I don't think even if I had the chance

953
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:25,620
that I would want to eat somebody unless I really hated them, unless I really

954
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,860
wanted to yeah, unless I was like really hungry, unless I didn't know that I was

955
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:34,540
doing it yeah. Well, there that's it unless I was being mind control.

956
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,900
That's like every do it unless someone made that was another knowledge. That

957
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,220
was another that's another really good hypothetical question to annoy a

958
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,780
girlfriend with is like would you would you kill me or would you eat me if you

959
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,120
had to and there was no other out that you are controlled to do. I asked her

960
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,200
the other day and she was like no. I don't think I could and I said like I

961
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,420
would eat you have to and she's like what I would eat you pretty much

962
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:01,160
instantly. Would you eat human flesh if you had to yeah? Would you go? Yeah,

963
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,760
right?

964
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,480
That's what I would ask of people. Yeah, people get people and then they say

965
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,280
yes, right and you're like what's wrong with you right? You're supposed to say

966
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,040
no. Yeah, yeah, just a resist. Yeah, good follow up. If you know, would you

967
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,640
cut off my head and eat my nuts and they say no, you just say okay, would

968
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,660
someone

969
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,660
would someone do that?

970
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,660
would someone do that?

971
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,660
because if someone could, they could.

972
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,660
yeah.

973
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,660
yeah.

974
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,660

976
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,660
are you someone?

977
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
interesting.

978
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
oh you're not anybody?

979
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,660
interesting.

980
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,660
have you ever had like tripa?

981
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,660
or like yeah tripa.

982
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,660
tripa tacos.

983
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:32,660
yeah.

984
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,660
you know how like when you bite into it it's kind of got that like mealy little like.

985
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,660
isn't it tripe?

986
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,660
no.

987
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,660
no no no.

988
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,660
tripa is like a fish right?

989
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,660
tripa is an intestine.

990
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,660
tripa is like a fish.

991
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,660
tripa is like a fish.

992
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,660
tripa is like a fish.

993
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:42,660
tripa is like a fish.

994
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,660
tripa is like a fish.

995
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,660
tripa is like a fish.

996
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,660
tripa is like a fish.

997
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,660
I think um, tripa is...

998
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,660
Isn't tripe intestine?

999
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,160
I thought tripe was intestine.

1000
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,160
Yeah, I don't know.

1001
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,580
I think tripa is intestines too.

1002
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,780
Is it spelled T-R-I-P-E?

1003
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Is it pronounced tripe?

1004
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,780
T-R-I-P-E.

1005
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,780
Oh, okay.

1006
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,780
It's probably the Spanish word for tripe.

1007
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:04,100
You think, well I'm thinking, like I've had a few tripa tacos in my day.

1008
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:10,180
I imagine that biting into that, like if you cooked somebody's balls it would taste exactly

1009
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,180
like that.

1010
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,180
Yeah.

1011
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,540
that whenever on fear factor they eat the ball nuts. I'm always like I'm

1012
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,020
something crazy. Yeah, a bull.

1013
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,700
The ball not bold.

1014
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,460
Bull. Yeah, well, it's would you eat a bull? I mean, I guess it was in a taco

1015
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,660
show. I guess I would. Would you eat a bull's nuts if he put his nuts in your

1016
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:32,660
face? You couldn't move and you were really hungry. You're starving for three

1017
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,740
days. You only needed one bite to live. Yeah, I'd probably do that. Well, if you

1018
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,500
know what they call, they say that like it's like candy. They said like human

1019
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:44,000
tastes like pork or whatever and they call it the long pig. I feel like pigs

1020
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,900
already long as it is long as hell. It's probably longer than a human, but yeah,

1021
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,340
well, I mean humans tall should be the tall and yeah, long that's a long

1022
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,920
standing, but what I would say is I feel like I would be. I feel like that was

1023
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,420
a good move because I would be a lot more likely to eat human or to try to

1024
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,700
kill and eat a human. If it was called like the tasty pig yeah or the yummy

1025
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,860
delicious, but the walking talking pig, though yeah, I feel like they could have

1026
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,400
done one better and called it gross pig though or yeah yeah pig just call it

1027
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,440
don't call it pig. Yeah, we were going to think they're eating meat pig yeah

1028
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,040
meat yeah. I mean because you could you could you could you know you could

1029
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,200
pretty easily accidentally order a long pig at a restaurant. I mean say

1030
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,160
somebody asks you how long is the line and you say long and then you also turn

1031
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,360
back to order you say pig. I love because you want the pig you got pig on

1032
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,200
the menu. Yeah, you're ordering pig and you but you're answering someone else

1033
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,040
you say long pig right here you are eating your cousin yeah well I heard

1034
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,960
that a restaurant in New York City actually a good you see this news clip

1035
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,560
that they're actually serving human flesh actually yeah and that but and if

1036
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,520
you don't like if you don't like that you should steer clear yeah not the

1037
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,320
restaurant that's what I said yeah if you even if you don't like it sometimes

1038
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,440
you will be made to eat it in certain situations yeah well where you have to

1039
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,600
Well, they say about that restaurant is that like a nut in a candy factory, it's

1040
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,440
gonna be in everything. All their tools, all their machines, they put cover it,

1041
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,760
they put... Well, when they bring you the food, when they bring you the food of the

1042
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:21,880
restaurant, they say, "Would you eat this if you had to?" And you say, "If we had nothing else on the menu, except this human meat, would you eat it?"

1043
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,880
it and they say yeah.

1044
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,320
The trick is they show you that before they show you the menu.

1045
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,520
So as soon as you get the menu and like if you say no, you get the menu, everything is

1046
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,520
crossed out.

1047
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
Yeah.

1048
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,520
Yeah.

1049
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,120
So yeah, what they say is there are one type of people who would eat this if they had to.

1050
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,180
Yeah, right.

1051
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:42,180
Who are you?

1052
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,180
I'm an eater.

1053
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,180
I'm an eater thatter.

1054
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:54,180
matter. I watch that comedy special early today. I think I think back and I think

1055
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,540
about all the stuff he said. You might be an eater humaner. If you would eat human

1056
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:05,340
if you had to. You are a human eater. There's no if anymore. You are an eater.

1057
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:12,140
You are a breather. Number three is pick up poop and eat it. Nasty. And someone

1058
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,580
says I heard that this can kill you still it's very disgusting

1059
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:19,660
they could kill you but it's still disgusting it's been in somebody's body

1060
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,780
it might have been in Donald Trump's body

1061
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:37,460
I'll tell you clearly than Hillary come on his shit would taste better than her

1062
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:46,060
pussy. Yeah, and that's on God. And I love pussy. I love Hillary Clinton. And I hate shit. But let's be real and objective.

1063
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,780
His literal shit would taste better than her puss. Yeah, and it's not even that it

1064
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:56,020
would taste better. It's just that I want to do it more. I would rather do that than fucking lick her snatch.

1065
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,020
So look, I tell someone at a party. It's not even about the taste, yeah. Yeah, I tell someone at a party I ate out

1066
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,860
Hillary Clinton. They would say, "Who cares?" Yeah, so did every fucking Boy Scout in

1067
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:10,100
America right but I swallowed Trump's log yeah using a fork and knife mm-hmm

1068
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,440
suddenly people are hoisting me on your knees then they don't know what you mean

1069
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:21,020
by log because it could mean you think yeah his white thing his white thing

1070
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:27,380
probably an orange thing yeah second of all if somebody said that they ate

1071
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,860
somebody's log I don't know that I think I would I would I would know it was poop

1072
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,660
I don't know. Do you think you'd get a tapeworm from eating his shit?

1073
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,660
Yeah, I don't know. I've heard people call that thing a log.

1074
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,660
No, he's a tapeworm. He's giant. You know he'd keep it clean.

1075
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:43,160
Yeah. I mean, he probably eats enough damn hamburgers from McDonald's and Covfefe

1076
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,160
that it kills any damn parasite that could possibly exist in his gut.

1077
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,160
And he probably eats Diet Coke and he poops a whole hamburger.

1078
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Yeah. And look, I don't like the guy. I sometimes think that he himself is a worm on the country.

1079
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,160
Yeah, made of tape. Sometimes he almost reminds me of a worm.

1080
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,000
- A red tape.

1081
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,840
- Yeah, a pee tape.

1082
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,060
- Oh my god, orange tape.

1083
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:00,900
- A yellow tape.

1084
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,720
- A pee tape worm.

1085
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,560
- Green tape worm.

1086
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,400

1087
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,220
- He's a pee tape worm.

01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,060
- Worm, green worm.

1089

- Red worm.

1090
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,220
- Yeah, Donald Trump is a green worm.

1091
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,060
- Yeah, he's a red worm.

1092
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:08,900
- He's a pee tape worm.

1093
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,720
- He's a hamburger.

1094
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,860
- He's a pee tape worm who eats hamburgers

1095
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,020
and drinks Diet Coke, and he still,

1096
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,620
and he hates it, but he'll still drink that crap.

1097
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,460
Crap, what?

1098
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,260
He's eating crap, like a tape worm.

1099
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,100
- Yep.

1100
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,920
