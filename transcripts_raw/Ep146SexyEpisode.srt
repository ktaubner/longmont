00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,560

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,800
you don't even know you drowned them that's bloodless you haven't not talked

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,920
about this all day cuz it's hurting me it's not I'm fucking hurt you don't

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,160
upset and I'm hurt it does not feel good to have killed man I'm afraid

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
afraid I might do it again. I don't think you I don't think you're that broken up

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,500
about it because after it because 11 minutes after you texted us that you

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,160
killed you texted us a prank to play on our girlfriends. Oh that was pretty funny

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,800
though a screenshot of the cracked phone of a bullet hole. Well that yeah dude have

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,880
you ever heard of somebody coping with trauma? What's wrong with you dude? I

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,720
thought it was funny. The way I just realized pranking my friends means that I had trauma.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,360
eye. In the darkness of having murdered two innocent children, yes they were mice, I

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,600
needed a laugh dude and so what's funnier than handing your girlfriend a

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,080
phone with a photo of a cracked screen on it and saying "Bae, Bae I broke my damn

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,880
phone." Almost nothing. I need $300 right now to buy a new one. I'm so sad I need a

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,000
blowjob. Don't touch the screen, don't touch the screen. Don't touch it, it'll break it

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,880
more it'll break it more and don't look in the bucket in the bed yeah either

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,440
don't dude it was so fucked it was like 3 in the morning I was asleep

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,520
Janna goes to Mike the mice that I had a problem with last summer they're

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
fucking back I don't know if it's a mice but there it could be it could be but

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,880
Janna was like the mice are in the kitchen I was like fuck dude I want to

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,960
deal with this thought I was gonna have to scare him away I walk in there we had

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,640
a mouse trap under the sink I didn't put it there it's one of those stick traps

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,560
the glue ones. Well they say they're humane but then...

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
They're humane but you got to get the mice off with olive oil.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
Well so I didn't know any of this because the directions say

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
that if you don't kill the mouse it'll eat its own

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
hands to get off of it. So I was like that's fucked up dude I gotta put these

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
mice out of their misery. So then I dunked them in a bowl full of

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
oil and I was like they'll probably just die

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,800
instantly just fucking just it'll be so easy I'll feel fine

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,240
about this. Both of them just fought like for their lives dude.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,200
They were like squeaking. Drowning is like I think the most inhumane way

51
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
you can kill something. The box for the, I mean these guys may have a

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,400
vested interest in killing mice now that I realize this. I think I should

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
trust the trap that like that causes mice to eat their own flesh. I think that's what's most humane.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,040
But I was like I'm trying to do this the most humane way possible. I ended up

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,920
fucking it up so bad because the mice one of them just died instantly one of them

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,640
just gay he was just like she just took a big breath of the oil the other one had

57
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,520
like a fucking he had a sight on his DVR he had to get back to you said he was

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,920
fucking trying to get back out of that thing he's stuck on the trap you said

59
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,440
drown and I thought you meant you like okay I like his head under the water

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,560
with my hands. I thought you took the trap and just put it under the sink and just let the water run.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,640
Yeah. Well it said oil is the most like the most like humane way to do it because they drown faster.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,080
One of them just refused to drown and then I started freaking out and so I just opened the

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,600
window and I tossed it out of the window. And then I was like, and then I like looked at my hands I

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,440
I was like, dude, what am I?

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,640
Why was that my instinct was to fucking throw it 30 feet?

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,440
- Dude, that was, that was my school Phelps.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,940
He held his breath for so long.

68
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,120
(laughing)

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,420
Number one, dude, he was the Olympic swimmer.

70
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,840
(laughing)

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,880
- Dude, I felt so evil.

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,600
I was up for like two more hours,

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,740
just like looking for funny, funny pictures

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,880
of cracked screens.

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,240
(laughing)

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,080
To deal with my trauma.

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,720
- The only thing that would help.

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,680
you go when you do you google my shattered minds and that came up and

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
you thought i was i have a funny

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
yeah

81
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,120
i have a good idea for a prank on a girl right now

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,960
yeah you

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,200
well yeah you originally pulled that that that like cracked bullet

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,440
bullet hole on glass image and you held it up to your forehead and you said this

85
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,960
is what i want you to do to me right now and she said make it happen

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,840
crack my glass and she said wait is your phone broken oh shit damn that's a funny ass shit

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,680
damn that's actually a funny ass shit i forgot about those two things those living things that i

88
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
I murdered 10 minutes ago.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,080
But yeah, I'm a murderer.

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,080
I think I might become kind of an evil blood craver.

91
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,480
Again?

92
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,360
No, but this is in a different, kind of more real way.

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,600
I was kind of faking it last time.

94
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
This one I've actually killed.

95
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,840
Oh yeah, we could all tell.

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,040
Yeah, I know you guys could.

97
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,760
But now I've actually done a dastardly deed.

98
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,840
And I feel really bad about it.

99
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
And I took all the--

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,500
So you're not evil.

101
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,240
I took all the other mice traps up,

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,960
mouse traps up, 'cause I was like,

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,640
I don't, I'd rather just live with mice

104
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,280
have to fucking drown anything else yeah I mean if you don't see him I guess it's

105
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,080
fine like if I so like I don't give a fuck about a mouse what's he gonna he

106
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,320
steals one of my chips I never finish a whole bag of chips you know you got it

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,300
you have to get some of those mouse traps that they do on YouTube where they're

108
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,840
just like scaled down saw traps and they're not even allowed to show the

109
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,640
footage no you know you gotta get rid of these mice cuz when Cameron and I come

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,600
over if they're in the chips we're gonna get mad I mean that's dinner time for

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,060
me right yeah well what I need is I need somebody like a Patrick to live in my

112
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,820
house like a cat and hunt the mice and catch you think you think I think

113
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,220
really I have to guard chips is what you're saying yeah pretty much okay

114
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,640
yeah or something you know it doesn't have to be chips you know I know you're

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,540
on this weight loss journey like maybe it's a maybe the mice are going for the

116
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,640
water well I've been I feel like I've gained a little bit of weight back you

117
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:54,640

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,520
You could ride it on your hands like a chimpanzee.

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
True.

150
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I don't know.

151
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,860
I already had a fucked up ankle from high school.

152
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,120
And you could skate after that, right?

153
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,180
Yeah, I could skate after that, but like...

154
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
And I saw a video of that.

155
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
That one was fucked up.

156
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
Yeah, I did...

157
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
That one was bad.

158
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
I did the same thing...

159
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
You're gonna be fine.

160
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
I did the same thing to my knee.

161
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,560
Well, knee's probably the worst place to do it, yeah.

162
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah.

163
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,840
I mean, I've taken my legs for granted.

165
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:50,080
I don't want to ever like, like I'm like full like, yeah, I'm the same way for granted way

166
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,280
on the same way about my heart and brain.

167
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,760
Yeah, like, I'm like my soul.

168
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,960
This whole thing is my right hand.

169
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,640
If I injure my right hand, dude, I'm killing myself into it.

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I don't care.

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,600
How if I fucking touch a tea kettle when it's hot, it's over for me, bro.

172
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Damn.

173
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,960
you don't have you know somebody could do it for you

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:20,360
nah dude no stepmom dad never remarried pretty fucked up he would never he never

175
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,680
thought of me once when he was deciding what to do the rest of his life oh maybe

176
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,400
Caleb was a hot-ass fucking stepmom you can try to fuck all the time I hate

177
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,880
nope I hate that so much my dad is so selfish what you hate stepmoms that

178
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,160
became like a like the algorithm people so many people look that up that the

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,080
algorithm only shows like stepmom stuff it's based on what you look at is not

180
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,040
yeah yeah it is it is private browsing does not keep your history yes it does

181
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,480
so you admit using private browsing

182
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,640
what are you looking at in that private browsing perhaps when I when I said when

183
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,320
When I go to PornHub.com it just shows me like how to make a million dollars in a day, how

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
to hustle harder.

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,640
Yeah, it's mostly cooking videos for me.

186
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
Yeah, I don't know what you're seeing on there.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Yeah, it's all based on the algorithms.

188
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,520
You're telling me you're seeing a bunch of stepmom crap where she's got her thing out.

189
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,880
Yeah, step crap.

190
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,200
She wants crap on her face.

191
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,320
She's stuck in the stepmom, stuck in the toilet.

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Wait, she's eating crap?

193
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah, stepmom got stuck in the toilet.

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I do not see that.

195
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
She has to eat her way out.

196
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeah, I think you do see that.

197
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,080
Stepmom stuck in the oven.

198
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,760
Yeah, also what are you doing so deep? What recipe calls for putting something at the back of the oven?

199
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
What is that next to your foot?

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
How fat is my damn stepmom she gets stuck in the damn oven?

201
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
What's that next to your foot? Is that the bell jar? What the hell were you reading in the oven?

202
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
What the fuck you doing in there? God damn

203
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,840
Stepmom's on some weirdo shit. I'll tell you that much because they don't have jobs for the most part. They go stir crazy

204
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,520
At home, they're like maybe i'll fucking get myself stuck on a

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,040
On nothing.

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,540
Yeah.

207
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,040
Hey, I'm stuck in the middle of the air, stepson.

208
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,240
I think you have to fuck me out of this.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,740
You walk into the living room, and you step up just like Exorcist floating in the air, just convulsing.

210
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,740
I've been cursed by a dark mage to be stuck. I'm in stasis.

211
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Yeah.

212
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
Stepmom flipped through wall.

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,740
There's probably been like an academic paper written about it, but it's just so fucked up that that has become like-

214
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Yeah, there's probably like an academic paper. Like, I wouldn't have tried to read it already, or like-

215
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,100
I have no like it's not like we're the first result that comes up when you

216
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,140
search stepmom porn and maybe I clicked on it thinking it was a video yeah and I

217
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,180
and I do not know any of the things that are linked in the bibliography no no I

218
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,300
keep walking into it I'm stepping I'm fucking stepping on rakes today you're

219
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,700

221
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,020
It's not a good day for me.

222
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm sorry buddy.

223
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,340
You suck in your thumb?

224
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,340
You prick yourself?

225
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,860
No, I have just a bunch of dead skin on my thumb.

226
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,060
I'm trying to get it off.

227
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,100
I don't know, I've been honestly very bummed out that I have not been able to skate.

228
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,300
A very short guy in a light blue shirt just walked over in this alley behind my building.

229
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,860
He walked over towards my window, the whole time looking directly up at the sky.

230
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,660
He walked over, he was sitting right outside my window, still looking up, he started clapping

231
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,140
above his head, and then he turned around and he left.

232
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,180
Short guy looking at the sky, "Buddy, I think you just had a run in with Chicken Little."

233
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,760
You might want to listen up.

234
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,860
He might have something to say.

235
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,020
Is he still there?

236
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,460
No, I was trying to, I can't see the sky from-

237
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,820
Maybe he's getting his keys from the person who lives above you.

238
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,860
Maybe, but why would he walk around the corner already looking upwards?

239
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,860
To see if they're there with the keys.

240
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,860
No, he wasn't looking...

241
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
He was looking up at the sky.

242
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
You won't accept any answer about this, because you're too baffled.

243
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860
I'm too baffled.

244
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Stepmom got stuck in the window on the third floor, dude.

245
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,860
[laughter]

246
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
She said, "No, you're gonna have to come around the rear."

247
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
He's like, "Okay, I see what this crap is."

248
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,860
"You're trying to make me smell your butt."

249
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Dude, imagine...

250
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,860
There's definitely...

251
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Here's a free idea for one of the

252
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,700
free idea for one of those people who like who writes like internet horror

253
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,660
flash fiction that's like oh the scariest thing is like a in an infinite

254
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,380
root beige wallpaper that's the yeah yeah is you walk in you walk into like

255
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,980
the room your your stepmom is is is stuck in like a door or something you

256
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,700
see your ass and and you're like oh I need to go talk to her go around to the

257
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,740
other room other side is also her ass dude psychological horror sucks dude

258
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,940
mm-hmm fuck that shit my my brain can't be scared I mean it's it's so it's like I

259
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,740
don't know it's here my brain YouTube just brainwashed people into thinking

260
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,660
that that this that people will like tell you with a straight face like oh no

261
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,460
the ghosts aren't scary dude it's not vampires it's yeah it's a guy standing

262
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,380
still yeah it's a it's a water a glass of water you don't know where it came

263
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,460
from you know yeah you know it's scary it's not it's not a serial killer who's

264
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,580
which is about to chop your head off, it's an idea.

265
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,420
- Yeah.

266
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,460
- It's when you think of something and it's not there.

267
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,380
- Fire.

268
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,800
I've been thinking about this for a while.

269
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,380
They should do a horror movie where the main guy--

270
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,260
- Is made out of fire?

271
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,980
- No, he's not made out of fire, he's just fire.

272
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,860
- The main guy like the--

273
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,740
- It's like the blob, but it's just a big fire.

274
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,580
- So maybe like a building.

275
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,140
- So it's a guy running away from a fire.

276
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,740
- That's pretty scary.

277
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,140
- A whole building, there's like a party on the top floor

278
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,820
and then like one of the lower floors catches on fire

279
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,580
and everyone on the top floor has to figure out

280
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,420
how to get down.

281
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,700
- I mean, honestly, yeah, I mean, perfect, easy.

282
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,820
- So the towering inferno, fuck you.

283
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,500
- But yeah, but I mean-- - No, fuck you.

284
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,820
- That's already a thing.

285
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,660
- You wanna fuck your stepmom.

286
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,180
- And OJ is in that movie.

287
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,020
- Teens nowadays would rather watch a--

288
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,540
- And OJ is innocent.

289
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,460
- Would rather watch a movie

290
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,540
where the fire's in everybody's minds.

291
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,580
- Yeah, fuck that crap, dude.

292
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,540
Hereditary, what's that movie even about, dude?

293
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,140
I think that has a stepmom in it.

294
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,380
She's not hot.

295
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,620
What are you doing, man? It has a step devil.

296
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,860
Yeah, also there's no naked people. Well, there is naked people in that movie, actually.

297
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,540
Fuck. And they're so sexy. No, they're old, dude.

298
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,780
Horror movies should have at least one pair of the boobs from American Pie.

299
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,180
That's pretty crucial. Uh-huh.

300
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,540
They should have

301
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,260
a big, the shiniest knife. The knife that's never been used.

302
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,100
A buffed and waxed knife. A demon, which instead of like speaking in

303
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,080
Latin or like backwards or something it just says fucking shit and like fuck me

304
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,340
yeah well yeah cuz the devil I mean curse words what do you fucking exactly the

305
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,540
devil wants you to say curse words yeah what am I fucking 30 years old you think

306
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,460
I'm allowed to hear this crap people people people think that people it's so

307
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,420
stupid dude that's those are the scariest demons and the exorcist and

308
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,940
evil dead when they when they try to kill you and they're also going like I'm

309
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,940
gonna fuck you fuck fuck fuck shit yeah it's like I can't be hearing that word

310
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,620
Yeah, come on dude, I got school in the morning and you're gonna make me say this crap.

311
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,620
What does Reagan say in the exorcism?

312
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,620
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell" or something like that?

313
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Yeah, pretty funny.

314
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
She also goes "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!"

315
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,620
If a demon said that to me I'd say, "Hey, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with soap."

316
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,620
They should have thought of that when they were doing the exorcism.

317
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,620
It probably would have worked, right?

318
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Yeah, "Hey, put some fucking, get some dial with some holy water mixed in."

319
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,740
I'm gonna hit you with the with the with the old soap and in the soap on a rope

320
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,780
in your mouth Reagan just need to be grounded yeah that's all they needed to

321
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,500
say yeah stop throwing up on the doctor from throwing up and turning your head

322
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,100
around if you throw up on me one more time young man you are grounded

323
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:08,180
you know I think I told you guys before my dad my dad told me that he watched

324
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:15,340
the exorcist in theaters with like his friend and his friend got like insanely

325
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,820
scared and had to run out of the theater in fear and the scene that he ran out of

326
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,580
the theater in fear was when Reagan pees on the ground at the party that's nasty

327
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,140
that's some nasty crap yeah it should have been like a law drama where they

328
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,420
defeat her by outlawing being green yeah take that up to Congress yeah yeah what

329
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,620
I mean honestly they should have just given her plastic surgery to make her look normal and then just ignore the other stuff

330
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:48,700
Did you guys I've talked about my mom and jump scares before but I thought I like I I couldn't

331
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,420
Still to this like I've seen the Exorcist still to this day the scariest thing in my head is just that picture of

332
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,860
Reagan yeah, yeah, it's because it's because yes from the maze game

333
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,980
And then just every every picture you would like every time you go on like I can has cheeseburger calm

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,300
like one in every hundred pictures would have a get would have a jump scare of it

335
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,940
and a gift see the maze game bubble rap maniac the the car commercial where the

336
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,540
car is coming down the mountain these are all way scarier than something like

337
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,740
get out you know that might be because I'm a white guy now but it's still I

338
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,780
don't know those are like actually scary you know I'm not I'm not scared to know

339
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,240
the scare I mean yeah the scariest thing is scared of the Babadook is when in a

340
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,040
movie trailer, the sound effects line up with the song.

341
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,480
- You know what else is scary?

342
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,120
- Very scary. - In a movie trailer.

343
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,120
So imagine like an 80s song, slowed down,

344
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320

It's got pianos.

346
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,800
- Oh, fucking Creep by Radiohead sung by a choir of kids.

347
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,280
- Yeah, but it's sung by the first person

348
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,280
that they saw on the street so that they could

349
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
sign them to a contract.

350
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,160

This is the crazy frog.

373
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Big, big.

376
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:26,560
That'll actually be a little bit of a scary thing to me.

377
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Coming this summer.

378
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Did you guys see the song?

379
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
The Crazy Frog, the movie.

380
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
It's just for crazy frogs.

381
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Oh fuck.

382
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Did you guys see the spiral thing?

383
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,640
Not yet, I'm seeing a drive-in this weekend.

384
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,440
I just saw the trailer for it.

385
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,800
Don't spoil nothing about it for me, please.

386
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
That guy cannot act.

387
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,160
Who, Chris Rock?

388
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,120
Yeah.

389
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,960
Really?

390
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,840
He's just like, he's just yelling all the time.

391
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,320
He looks amazing.

392
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Like he--

393
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
He looks young, dude.

394
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,560
Yeah, he looks like just as young as he did on SNL.

395
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,000
He's gotta be like in his 50s, right?

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, he's old as shit.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,160
Yeah, I guess he's a millionaire.

398
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,800
He could have been very young on SNL.

399
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,440
I'm a 24 guy, he's 25, I just--

400
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Ah, Christ.

401
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
He's four years old. He was born on a leap year.

402
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Shit!

403
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
[Laughter]

404
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Oh fuck. Did you guys ever know anyone born on a leap year?

405
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Yeah, Chris Rock is 56.

406
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Jesus Christ. Damn. Really?

407
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah, that's insane. That's nuts.

408
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Good for him. He does look good as hell.

409
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
That's like when you Google how old Seinfeld is, he's 280.

410
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Yeah.

411
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
You're like, what the fuck dude? Dude, he's gonna die one day.

412
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Isn't that crazy? Seinfeld?

413
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld is gonna die just like the rest of us.

414
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Nah, he's gonna be a fucking...

415
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
they're gonna put him in a...

416
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,880
You think he's gonna be like one of those old comedians that they like for some reason are alive forever?

417
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
Like Dick Van Dyke or like Mel Brooks.

418
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,040
Yeah, or like Jerry Lewis. Like just one of those guys is just...

419
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Jerry Lewis died.

420
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah, he died, but he was alive forever.

421
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
It's true. Yeah.

422
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
I forgot he died for a second.

423
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
They live in like Las Vegas in like a bunker.

424
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,960
And then the only time you ever see him is when Ricky Gervais goes to interview them.

425
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,120
Yeah. For AARP magazine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I hope to be one of those guys one day. I hope

426
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,320
to live forever, you know? I'm gonna die before I turn 70. I can tell you that already. You

427
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,520
think so? Yeah. You want me to make sure? Nobody in my family has ever, like, on my mom's side

428
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,680
has lived past like 70. Dude, it's fucked. Everybody in my family lives to fucking 100.

429
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,260
Really? I will, I can't kill myself. Yeah? I'm invincible. And they all smoked their

430
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:39,380
entire lives and they just ate like fucking potatoes and they just in grits

431
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,140
and then they just live to a hundred well we I think we're fucked as a generation

432
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,980
because we have all these like preservatives and like microplastics

433
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,980
and shit that like maybe we'll live way longer because like so like our brains

434
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,380
are being preserved by the same thing that like you're right that made fruit

435
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,900
not like all my slices of McDonald's not go brown all my relatives are born at

436
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,740
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution probably didn't have any sort

437
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,500
like you know outside toxins and even have McDonald's I mean we're probably

438
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,420
gonna live to it we'll live to like a hundred and twenty but then have children

439
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,980
that are like like half McDonald's toy yeah that's just like I don't know dude

440
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,020
my grandpa don't be born with a button on their back it plays it was like it's

441
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,940
naked they thought getting high was like fucking sitting at the top of the

442
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,540
chimney and just inhaling like I think like we're probably okay right yeah I

443
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,740
don't know I don't know I guess I probably did eat a lot of like bits of

444
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,700
toys that were in the cereal box growing up?

445
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,700
I uh, when I was like five, I was playing with Legos and I thought it'd be funny to lay down

446
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,340
and put a Lego in my, like a minifigure in my mouth, because I was like a giant.

447
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,260
And uh, well, a game I was playing.

448
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,980
And I remember, uh, just choking immediately.

449
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,620
That was the first time.

450
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,060
The second you get it in your mouth?

451
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,780
Yeah, that was the first time I ever got like CPR administered on me.

452
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
The first time?

453
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
What?

454
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,460
I think I had it one other time.

455
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,540
When we were looking for the list for this episode, I found a list that we're not going

456
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:13,420
to use, but it was just making me laugh because it was a list of toys that were very dangerous

457
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,180
and it was like there was one that was like an Easter egg that if you put it in water

458
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,580
it hatches and they had to recall it because children were swallowing it and then it would

459
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,820
hatch in their stomachs and create an intestinal blockage that was not detectable by x-ray.

460
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm just amazed that Pat has had CPR done twice to him.

461
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Probably not CPR, it was probably just my mom hitting me on the back.

462
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Okay, alright, don't say CPR then, because I'm thinking that you're like dead and somebody

463
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
had to revive you.

464
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
Well, I mean, not CPR, no, I mean, fuck, I meant Heimlich.

465
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Okay, so somebody fucking knocked something out of your mouth.

466
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
Yeah, I meant Heimlich, I got Heimlich and CPR confused.

467
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,820
Oh my god, dude, you damn near gave me a heart attack.

468
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:01,380
Those are very different things. Yeah, I completely understand why you're confused. Yeah, I had open heart surgery five times

469
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,440
I thought oh, never mind. I had a nosebleed. I thought CPR meant chest press rescue

470
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:19,780
I didn't think that

471
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
I would have believed that you thought that.

472
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
I've never choked on anything, dude.

473
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
Um, uh, that's not true.

474
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
I haven't.

475
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
My brother, my younger brother choked on water once.

476
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
At the dinner table.

477
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Oh, that's happened to me a million times, dude.

478
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
He like, he like, he like choked, or it was he,

479
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
no, was it water or a hot dog?

480
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
I mean if it, those are two very different things.

481
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
Yeah, if you choke,

482
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
choking on water is just coughing,

483
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
that doesn't count.

484
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
Yeah, you're not choking.

485
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
actively drowning.

486
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Yeah, choking feels good.

487
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:59,060
Yeah, my brother Eric, he either choked on water or choked on a hot dog and we were just

488
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,460
staring at him like, "What?

489
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,460
What are you doing?"

490
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,020
Yeah, do something.

491
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Haha, very funny.

492
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:11,180
Oh, ha ha ha ha.

493
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:17,420
The list we have today is, are you sure you're above 18+?

494
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Why did you get so purple?

495
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,720
Yes, I guess because I opened the splash page to ask if I'm 18

496
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,960
Wow

497
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,960

503
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,380
No don't say anything I have to edit out, fuck you, you make me do that so much.

504
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,500
Let's just open this one up, I don't give a fuck, we can try this one.

Okay, I'll, send it to me, send the list.

00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,080
Maybe it's only good for this thing but number two, just read it, it doesn't matter.

507
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,380
Number two on 27 erotic movies that will fulfill all possible sexual fantasies is Lolita.

508
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,620
(laughing)

509
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,760

510
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:30,420
- Number two, Alita, number three, Hard Candy.

511
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,080
(laughing)

512
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,200
- I'm starting to notice the theme.

513
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,300
- I bet you that they're right.

514
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,720
- Number three, Happiness by Todd Solans.

515
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,980
(laughing)

516
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,620
- This is a nasty website.

517
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,580

519
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,660
here are 69 quirky, weird, and kinky things

520
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,300
you need to add to your sex bucket list.

521
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,620
I mean, we all got a sex bucket list, right?

522
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,500
- No.

523
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,340
- No.

524
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,140
- Number one, sex.

525
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,100
- We don't. - Crossed off.

526
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,460
- It's crossed off, and that's--

527
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,300
- That's it, that's pretty much it.

528
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,860
- Gonna do it for my bucket list.

529
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,020
Sex and die.

530
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,860
- Die during sex.

531
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,760
- That is my sexual bucket list.

532
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,560
This is from Shaylin Jacob.

533
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,720
If you've been with your special one for a very long time, you know how monotonous sex

534
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,260
can become.

535
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,120
After all, how much can you experiment, right?

536
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,080
I mean, I for one fucking hate having sex.

537
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,320
It's fucking, what a chore.

538
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
It's disgusting.

539
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
It's painful.

540
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
It's like homework.

541
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
Yeah.

542
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
It hurts, dude.

543
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
Painful, revolting.

544
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Boring.

545
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,520
Yeah, dude, my balls look weird after.

546
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Difficult.

547
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,200
And it's like I have to call my mom, like my mom and dad have to be there, you know?

548
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Yeah, exactly.

549
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,280
It doesn't feel good, yeah.

550
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,680
You know until you're 25 like what is it 24?

551
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Yeah I think it's 24.

552
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah 24 is the age when you can finally start having sex by yourself and you don't need

553
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
your parents permission.

554
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Parent or guardian.

555
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Yeah.

556
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Yeah.

557
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,440
I forget I forget a pen all the time for the permission slip.

558
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Yeah.

559
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
I have to use my poop.

560
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah I have to sign it in blood.

561
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,800
Plus my fingers hurt by the end of it because I'm down there fucking fretting like a tar

562
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
hero.

563
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,680
I'm tired dude.

564
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,680
I hate that I have to be under the bed too while it's happening.

565
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,720
It's like can I get up there and like join in?

566
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,360
My back hurts after because the bed keeps hitting my spine.

567
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,320
It's moving a disc in my back.

568
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,620
Yeah, it's fucked up dude.

569
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,400
But if you still have hope and are willing to do anything it takes to bring back the

570
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,520
spice and kink in your relationship, we suggest you try these 69 titillating things with your

571
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
partner.

572
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,240
Number one, try out bondage.

573
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,820
You might just surprise yourself with your partner.

574
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,160
Yeah, my girlfriend comes home

575
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,280
and I'm wrapped up like Cindy Lou Who.

576
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,120
And I'm like, yeah.

577
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,680
- Wait, like who?

578
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,520
Hold up.

579
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,340
- The way you think about it.

580
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,180
- Like Cindy Lou Who.

581
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,020
- Yeah, I don't know about that one.

582
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,720
- Remember the Grinch wraps her as a present?

583
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
Are you guys stupid?

584
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,080
- Why go there?

585
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,920
- I don't remember that.

586
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,100
- 'Cause it was funny.

587
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,520
She gets wrapped up like a present.

588
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,720
- I don't remember that either, to be honest.

589
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,160
No, she sees him taking the Christmas tree.

590
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,560
And then he wraps her like a gift!

591
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,640
And then her dad walks in and he's like, "What happened to you, you stupid bitch?"

592
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
And she's like, "Oh, the Grinch."

593
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,040
And he's like, "You're a stupid bitch.

594
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,800
You don't know shit about the Grinch.

595
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,040
The Grinch lives in the hill."

596
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,160
I don't know what to tell you.

597
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,360
To me, this is the most iconic scene in the movie.

598
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,800
In the film, I'm sorry.

599
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,000
Number two, try rimming.

600
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's not everyone's.

601
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That's number two, yeah.

602
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Damn.

603
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
That means the rest of this shit's gonna be crazy.

604
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,000
Is rimming when you put your junk around the hole?

605
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I don't know what rimming is.

606
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,500
*laughter*

607
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,000
What's rimming?

608
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
When you put your junk around the hole?

609
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You're trying to draw a circle around it.

610
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,500
That's always what I imagine when I hear that.

611
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,000
Is like, use your dick like a pencil.

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm surprised you were of all people.

613
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't know.

614
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I don't know dude.

615
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
What's rimming?

616
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's getting your butt ate out.

617
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh what?

618
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well hell, that's nasty.

619
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I thought that was when you draw your, you use your penis.

620
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
No!

621
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Like you're playing osu on her butthole.

622
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I didn't realize it was.

623
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yeah, I'm playing picto chat.

624
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah.

625
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
My bad dude.

626
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,120
I'm really fucking this list up so far.

627
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,080
It's a good thing you figured that out before you asked anybody to do it or anything.

628
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
True.

629
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
You could have avoided a very awkward situation.

630
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,880
No, I thought I'd just draw a square.

631
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Yeah.

632
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,280
You're down there with a pencil.

633
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,880
Sorry, it's taking me really long.

634
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,320
I keep having to sharpen it.

635
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,160
Yeah, sorry, I'm following one of those, one of those like behind the scenes Simpsons videos

636
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,440
where they teach you how to draw Homer with three circles.

637
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,800
Number three, give anal a chance with lots of lube.

638
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,360
I used up all my oil drowning baby mice last night, so that might be off the table for

639
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,360
me.

640
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
You did it in lube.

641
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Oh, that's strawberry flavored lube.

643
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,360
Yeah, dude, at least it died horny.

644
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,360
I like this picture they put in of like a sculpture of a woman getting gangbanged.

645
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,520
Yeah, this is not a good... and then one who, one other woman who seems so horrified that

646
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,320
she has to cover her eyes.

647
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Yeah.

648
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Oh.

649
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,000
That she can't watch.

650
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,960
Source of this picture is the blog "Breakaway Backpacker".

651
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,760
What?

652
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,320
Try silent sex.

653
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,160
(laughing)

654
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,000
- What is this, what is this?

655
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,120
What is this made by fricking Charlie Chaplin or something?

656
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,960
- Yeah, I mean, come on.

657
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,800
- Hey, come on now.

658
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,120
- Yeah, it's actually the damn organist playing a tune.

659
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,560
No moans, no talking, just a whole lot of inward

660
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,080
and outward motion.

661
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,940
- That is what, yeah, you know it would be really hot

662
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,780
if we just--

663
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,620
- If you just shut the fuck up.

664

- Number 14 and 15, number 14, finger her in public.

838
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,380
She's going to love it.

839
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,900
I don't know about that.

840
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,020
- Yeah, well, yeah.

841
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,860
- There's, I don't know, number 15,

842
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,140
give him a handjob in public.

843
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,860
He's going to find it hard to keep calm for sure.

844
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,940
- And that one's bolded.

845
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,140
The handjob one is, but the finger one isn't.

846
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,700
So what's up with that?

847
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,580
- Yeah.

848
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,180
Think about that for a minute.

849
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,100
I don't think people like,

850
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,800
I don't think I would like that.

851
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,460

I'm in that dojo, you can't disrespect.

859
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,980
Don't you hate it when you're in the dojo?

860
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,820
Can't you disrespect?

861
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,620
You see that Korean flag over there?

862
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,900
That means we in the dojo.

863
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,380

871
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,460
This is a blue belt.

872
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
Only Master Ray can undo this belt,

873
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,780
and it's when he's replacing it with a new, better belt.

874
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,180
Leave my shit alone.

875
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,340
I'm almost up to red, I think.

876
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,220
I don't know the order.

877
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,820
Or my girl, we're in public, like at the zoo or something.

878
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,540
She starts like unbuckling my belt, and I'm like,

"Babe, what are you doing?"

880
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,940
She's like, "You know what I'm doing."

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:58,580
I'm just like, "Are you trying to wipe my butt right now at the zoo?"

900
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,900
That's ruining the day of a lot of people. Can you stop an elevator? Yeah, you hit the

901
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:13,500
stop button. There's a stop button? Doesn't it also like call the fire department if you

906
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,060
like talk to you in the elevator. And there's a camera in the elevator. Most

907
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,860
elevators at least. Plus there's the elevator attendant.

908
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:45,220

Number 19, have sex at your office or your partner's office. It makes for good

921
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,020
stories. I'll say it makes for good stories. Have you guys ever heard of the TV show?

922
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:51,100

926
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,220
I don't know what that could mean.

927
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:15,100
You remember that one of those like Swagopino Tumblr pictures where it's like, where like

Yeah.

931
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,900

00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,460
Give her a nipplegasm.

933
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:28,180
No, I think that would fit well on like a picture of a guy like holding his flat broom up and

934
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:34,860

1053
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,180
of these work due to our heart problem conditions. I am not sure that a sexy new sex position

A hot tub oasis, yeah, a hot spring, but then you can't drink the water.

1112
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,980
It's too hot.

1113
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,980
I would drink it.

1114
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,620
I don't know if that would be refreshing.

1115
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,860
I would just wait for a night time and then I would drink it.

1116
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,860
Alright.

1117
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,420

Squats, lunges, pushups, or bridges?

1120
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,380
Whichever one burns the least precious calories probably.

1121
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,980
So, I'm going to say crunches.

1122
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,180
Yeah, I mean we are in the desert.

1123
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:17,660
Yeah.

1124
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,500
I got to conserve every bit of energy I have.

1125
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,940
Crunches is not an option.

1126
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,220
Oh, I thought you said crunches.

1127
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,100
Lunges.

1128
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,820
Sorry, I'm having, I'm having, again, it's a mirage.

1129
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,820
My brain has, my brain is a mirage right now.

1130
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,300
Yeah, sorry, I'm seeing an oasis.

1131
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,140
I had a mirage thought bubble.

1132
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,140
I saw a speech bubble coming out of you.

1133
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,700
Next time, yeah, next time I have to play something awful,

1134
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,100
I'll say, "Oh, sorry, I thought it was a mirage in my brain."

1135
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:44,980
I say bridges. Okay, bridges. Gotta get a bridge out of the desert. True, I don't know what

1136
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:52,260
a bridge is, but a bridge is presumably goes over a body of water. The result is the "ohm"

1137
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:56,900
position, which I'll send you a picture of this in the chat, but the first line of the

1138
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:05,860
description of this is, "You belong to the lazy kind when it comes down to sex." But

1139
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:11,820
lazy doesn't mean uninteresting just like this position relaxing but far from boring your

1140
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,420
partner will sit cross-legged and you will sit in their lap facing them for your support

1141
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,520
wrap your legs around them and hug each other this is the number one way to not get separated

1142
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:25,020
in the desert true and also at night the desert actually gets surprisingly cold yeah plus

1143
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,480
you get plus you're like sitting like that you can use your your partner as a backpack

1144
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:33,640
and keep like gummy bears and all kinds of other things.

1145
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,160
(laughing)

1146
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,480
- Yeah, it's like a camel's hump.

1147
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,600
You just fill 'em with water.

1148
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,440
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1149
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,360
- Whenever you need some water,

1150
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:41,440
you squeeze them away. - No, 'cause you're both

1151
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,360
sitting like that, like you're carrying them around

1152
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,840
like that, and then sweat's gonna pool up.

1153
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,120
You put that through a filter, you got some water.

1154
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,680
- Exactly. - Damn, dude.

1155
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,040
You can't drink sweat, that won't hydrate you, will it?

1156
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,240
- Yeah, it can.

1157
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,640
- You can. - Obviously, if you put it

1158
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,320
through a filter first. - Yeah.

1159
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,280

1160
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,600
- Carry, if you gotta-- - If you put it

1161
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,400

1162
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,280
Yeah, it turns sand into water. Yeah, also I like the idea of somebody getting

1163
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,120
stranded in the desert but they just went on vacation there and they just

1164
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,920
like, they didn't like fall off of anything. They just went and got stuck.

1165
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,200
I'm sure that's happened. Yeah, dude. I would like that to happen to me. Baby, for our

1166
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,240
honeymoon, I want to go to the middle of the desert. Yeah, we put the

1167
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:30,120
the date of our anniversary as longitude and latitude and it took us to the middle of the

1168
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:38,120
Gobi Desert and we are going to die. Hey, rules are rules. Alright, bye everybody. Bye.

1169
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,880
Bye.
