1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,040
- Now recording.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,860
- We're back.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,160
- Now recording.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
- Now recording.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,560
- I miss Craig, man.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,400
What happened to him?

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
- Yeah, I heard him for, and I haven't--

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,640
- The Discord bot that we used to use to record, man.

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
- And that never worked.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,200
- Every time we do this remote shit,

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,920
which we're doing today because Cameron appears

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,360
to be stuck in a Wes Anderson movie, you guys.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,360
- Oh, shit. - With his 4x3 ass

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,680
and the paintings on the wall behind him.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,940
(laughing)

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,880
Did I say painting?

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,720
- Bro, I don't want-- - Those are paintings.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,920
- I don't want my damn armchair and my bookcase

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,960
to be in my shot, man.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,440
I cut that shit out. - Yep, yep.

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,000
You basically-- - You have to symmetricalize

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,960
your department. - There we go.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,920
There we go, see now, oh, now he's in tangerine, y'all.

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
Look at him. - Damn.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,720
Damn, now he's in fucking,

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,360
I don't even know what that would be.

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,560
Anyway, we are remote today.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Sad but true.

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,720
- I'm deathly ill.

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,480
- Cameron is falling deathly ill.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
And you know why?

33
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,120
- We had to unlock an episode, which sucks ass.

34
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,320
- Yep, and now we have to do this.

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,360
There we go, now he's completely wide.

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,120
What, Pat?

37
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,200
- Can you hear me?

38
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,040
- Yeah, man.

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,800
- Okay, everything, all right.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay, thank God, 'cause I have to,

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,680
I'm using the Zoom H6 into my computer,

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
and I tried to use it for FL and it made a bunch of crazy sounds.

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
A while ago.

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Cam, this is a much better look for you.

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
And you know what?

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
You may notice that now we're all synced up

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
in terms of wideness

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
because guys, me and Patrick are going

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
to the gym together, new gym buddies!

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Mhm.

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Snap it up, y'all.

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
I was on you, I got killed, man.

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Cameron's falling behind because of illness.

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Well, Cameron doesn't even want to get gigantic.

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,340
Gigantic what the fuck are you talking about bro? I ought to come over there and fucking kill you. What's your problem, bro?

56
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm gonna get gigantic a million years before you were you're talking about bitch. You're talking about

57
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,620
Look at you. You're just wide you're not even trying to get gigantic bitch bitch-ass

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,720
You pulled up to the gym, and then you ran and then ran away

59
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,140
Bro, I pulled up to the gym and God struck me down for a little go for a run and literally the run

60
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,740
- Run is the thing that caused this.

61
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,580
- Yeah.

62
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,620
- See, you should have gotten under the barbell, my friend.

63
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,460
- Yeah, I know.

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,260
- Everything's been cured in one session under the barbell.

65
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
- Why are you doing cardio?

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,460
That's not what this is about.

67
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,940
It's, you're not supposed to try

68
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,220
and keep your heart healthy.

69
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,060
It's not.

70
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,180
You're supposed to actively fight against your heart.

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,140
- He treats the gym like a joke, y'all.

72
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,300
- You're supposed to actively--

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,820
- I will say, he's doing it so he can get a real lock, y'all.

74
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
- No, I'm not treating the gym like that at all.

75
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,800
- As someone who's worked out with Pat,

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
Nobody has less fun in the gym than Patrick.

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
(laughing)

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
He fucking, he is, he's the only person I've ever known

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,200
to start going to the gym and you instantly got that

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,400
by, during every set, the last couple reps,

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,940
you should be making one of the ugliest faces of all time.

82
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,780
You're locked in.

83
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,520
- No, I'm completely locked in.

84
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm taking it--

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,760
- He's locked the fuck in.

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
- Uh-huh.

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
I know what's up now.

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
I know that, I mean, for a long time,

89
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,960
I have just been a guy who sits around the house and drinks beer.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Basically, I lived like Andy Kap for a long time, and I don't want to live like Andy Kap

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
anymore.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
You don't want to live like, what's that guy, Popeye?

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Burt Wimpy.

94
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Oh, Wimpy.

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Exactly.

96
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,200
I thought his name was Burger or something.

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
He likes burgers.

98
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
That's his hobby.

99
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
No, he likes burgers.

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
His special interest is burgers.

101
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,320
Are you sure his name is Wimpy?

102
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Yeah.

103
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
His name is Wimpy.

104
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,760
fifty percent sure fit that the look of a muscle it doesn't matter about it fits

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,760
him very well has a big I would be no he's when people are just talking about

106
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,040
him as you're comparing him to someone not going to the gym is yours his name's

107
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,720
would be yeah and I think it was a bit perfect analogy is the literally the

108
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,480
perfect analogy but he just has a he looks like a burger can we admit that

109
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,280
yeah you want to do is we burger is out you're saying he wants his on one

110
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,160
- His name was Burger or Hammy or something.

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
But I guess it's Wimpy.

112
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,960
- Yeah, his name is Wimpy.

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,940
His name is Jay Wellington Wimpy.

114
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,640
- That's a good one.

115
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,520
- I have been going through life as Jay Wellington Wimpy.

116
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
I've been asking people for money for a burger.

117
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,480
- But now Popeye brought you to the gym, man.

118
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,800
- Uh-huh, that's true.

119
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,040
- And now you're about to turn into the guy

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,200
who's bigger than Popeye, whose name is Burger.

121
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
- There's photos of his burger.

122
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
- I think it's Ludo, bro.

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,920
You don't know any of these.

124
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,800
- You don't know shit about Popeye.

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
- Oh yeah, the girl's name is Oil.

126
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,120
- There's a photo of him with a mustache

127
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,560
that does look like me, a little bit.

128
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,840
- What, Popeye?

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,920
- Wimpy.

130
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
- Oh, Wimpy?

131
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,580
- Yeah, of course.

132
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,420
- I'll gladly pay you next Tuesday

133
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,560
for a hamburger today.

134
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,520
- I see your eyes moving back and forth

135
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,720
as you read the sentence,

136
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,440
"I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger."

137
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,200
- I'll gladly pay you never for a hamburger right now.

138
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,960
What the hell, that's a terrible deal.

139
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,760
- I see your eyes moving like you're reading

140
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,760
a cute card. - Stop reading, man.

141
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,640
- We're doing live radio straight to the ears.

142
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,480
- Vintage air, wimpy, Popeye the Sailor Man,

143
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
I gotta stop looking at wimpy.

144
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,440
- You need to stop looking.

145
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,720
You need to stop looking.

146
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,080
Which is something he can't help himself

147
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,880
from doing at the gym, I've noticed that too.

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
- What?

149
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,540
- Oh yeah, makes sense.

150
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,640
- He looks at every single woman.

151
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
- No I don't.

152
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,400
- Just look, just look.

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,640
- Gets right up in front of him.

154
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
- I'm not looking at any women.

155
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,440
- That's how many sets they have left.

156
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,280
- No, I'm looking at--

157
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,000
- You're not looking at any women?

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,560
- I'm looking at every single old ass man

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,600
that pulls up there in a t-shirt that is way, way too long.

160
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,680
- Pat has some of the best gym fits so far.

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,500
He's on a legendary run.

162
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,120
Every single day, he pulls up in a thermal shirt

163
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
and a bathing suit.

164
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,660
And this is a, this is when you know somebody's serious

165
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,760
only about getting big, is when they are wearing--

166
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
- That's what I'm trying to do.

167
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
- Fucked up outfits possible.

168
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,920
And he always wears this hat.

169
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,380
This is his gym hat now.

170
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,060

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,180

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,020
how do you get to that point

179
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,020
of and i have never heard a piece of clothing that that happens to me

180
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,020
without me spilling a dessert onto it or jizzing into it

181
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,020
seeping out of your skin into the hat that it's calcified?

182
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
that is fucking disgusting man

183
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
that's crazy dude

184
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
it's a crust cap

185
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
you've never had a crust cap?

186
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
what the hell are you talking about?

187
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,020
so much sweat that it's turned into hard

188
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
hardness?

189
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
yeah

190
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
no I've never had that

191
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
that's just a thing that people have

192
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
wash your damn hat

193
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,020
I know I have to wash it soon

194
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,380
it soon. Why are you wearing it? No, not soon! You had to wash it soon. You shouldn't be

195
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,420
wearing it bro. You told us you have 40 hats. Yeah, but I'd like to wear this one to the

196
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,740
gym. You're not at the gym. Well, I just got back from the gym. Caleb and I went to the

197
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,540
gym before this. You guys didn't even text me? You are sick! You're sick, you bitch.

198
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,700
You're dying. You are on death's door. Wow. I know you well enough that I know that if

199
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,340
you even like go near a germ, you're going to sit there and just make like a dog noise.

200
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,380
Why are you being so mean to me? I've had the worst week of my entire life.

201
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,820
You're saying he doesn't want to get big, first of all. Now you're saying that he has

202
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,340
a dog's body.

203
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,500
If you think one germ could do this to me, you don't know anything about my immune system.

204
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,580
I don't wash my hands. I lick poop. I do a trillion things every day to get myself safe.

205
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,580
This is Caleb's immune system.

206
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
Caleb is sick probably.

207
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
I'm a strong motherfucker.

208
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
Caleb is probably sick.

209
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
But this season has done me in.

210
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,140
They're developing something new.

211
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,140
I've been telling, I've been.

212
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I think the allergies are getting.

213
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,460
Caleb is sick nine times out of ten.

214
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,180
I've been spreading this gospel all, all, every time.

215
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,220
Man, they're developing, the new disease is gonna be in the news soon.

216
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,620
And I think I'm, they gave it to me because I've been calling it out.

217
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,980
Okay, the first one came from probably some type of lab leak.

218
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,580
Mm-hmm somebody was eating, but I still think it was food, but I think somebody was taking their lunch break at the lab

219
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,300
They ate the soup and then it got out right

220
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:46,020
Covet yeah, I don't have kovat bro. I tested. No. What is the next one coming from I'm wondering oh, it's from me

221
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,100
Probably still soup

222
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,020
It's for me and my body you think your patient zero on this I think

223
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,260
patient zero

224
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,660
I would hate it if you were patient zero of something I

225
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,780
I hate it if either of you is patient zero.

226
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,500
I would hate it because then I could live or die.

227
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I don't care.

228
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I could be here or die.

229
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,860
Well it's not about the living or dying.

230
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,620
Patient zero is about the crushing guilt.

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
Yeah, it's your fault.

232
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,140
Of all the millions of casualties being falling on our shoulders.

233
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,660
Because your one body made the disease so much worse.

234
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
You were the only...

235
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,860
Yeah, but I wouldn't feel bad about being patient zero for anything.

236
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,580
But you're the only vehicle that this disease can be transferred through.

237
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,820
I wouldn't feel bad.

238
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,100
I would feel like God is slighting me somehow.

239
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,260
I've been having the most insane evil fever dreams, guys, last night.

240
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,940
I was trying to sleep, I couldn't fall asleep because I was so freezing cold.

241
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,020
I haven't been able to get warm for days on end.

242
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,960
I have no matter what I wear or how many blankets I put on myself, I'm shivering, freezing cold.

243
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,380
Last night I fell asleep and I dreamed for six hours straight about playing a made up

244
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,660
video game.

245
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
What was in the game, man?

246
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,020
It was like Among Us, but it was with real people and to kill people you had to throw

247
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
them into holes.

248
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,100
I played it for a long time.

249
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,580
- That sounds fucking amazing.

250
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,420
- It was fun.

251
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,620
- It's kind of like the Mormon YouTube channel

252
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,300
that does Among Us in real life.

253
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,580
- It was crazy.

254
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,140
And I also had another one about bugs the other night.

255
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,220
It's been, I've been having a strange existence.

256
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm sorry to hear that, man.

257
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,060
- I had a dream that I saw one of my childhood friends,

258
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,660
but he was the Statue of Liberty last night.

259
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,060
- Wait, sorry.

260
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,340
You saw him, you like were coming in on Ellis Island

261
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,620
and you saw your friend big and green.

262
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,460
- No, I saw him, I saw him after--

263
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,980
- But he was walking around as--

264
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,420
- He was dressed as-- - As Lady Liberty.

265
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,540
- Yeah, small or big? - Dressed as the

266
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,460
Statue of Liberty, and it might have been implied

267
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,020
that it was Halloween in my dream, but I don't know.

268
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,500
But I didn't wanna talk to him because he was dressed up

269
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,520
like the Statue of Liberty.

270
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,260
I just kinda cold-shouldered him.

271
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,100
- 'Cause you thought that

272
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,500
this was a cringe outfit. - Oh, hey, what's up?

273
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,620
I thought that being the Statue of Liberty was so cringe

274
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,500
that I just straight up just was like,

275
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,740
oh, good seeing you, and then walked away.

276
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,620
I had a dream that my favorite pair of pants went missing.

277
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,660
No!

278
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,500
Which was more of a nightmare, I think,

279
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,340
than anything else.

280
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,160
That's horrible. God damn it!

281
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,940
It was really, really, really bad.

282
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,540
I'm sorry that you're feeling bad, Cameron.

283
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,100
You know what we can do with this episode, man?

284
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,580
I need healing prayers.

285
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,100
Here's what we need, okay?

286
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,060
We're already doing remote, right?

287
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,380
We're all at our homes.

288
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,380
Look at Pat's home, looks wonderfully decorated.

289
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,060
This needs to be the audio equivalent

290
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,020
of cuddling up in a big blanket

291
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,980
with a big glass of hot tea,

292
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,260
a big mug of hot tea with honey, lemon, ginger.

293
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,560
- Ginger, turmeric. - Yes, all sorts of things.

294
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,540
Medicinal, cozy, this is what we're doing this episode.

295
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,260
- Cayenne pepper.

296
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,860
- No, not cayenne pepper.

297
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,820
I think that would make you sneeze.

298
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:58,500
no it's not is that some of the impurities of the not if you drink it

299
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,320
guys

300
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,620
let's talk about grant that dot o

301
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
it's going to work

302
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,820
how did it go to the woke empire has seized it and first of all under their

303
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,620
leather high-heeled okay

304
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,580
okay i i i i i think that you have a lot of it is that why and use it much as a

305
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
mother

306
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,260
and by the way you zoom up and uh...

307
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,020
the boot is worn by a hairy man's leg actually a hairy woman's leg

308
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:27,160
And are people saying it's woke because it's got black women in it is it woke to be a dominatrix

309
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,800
No, is why I think that's the opposite of BD BDSM woke

310
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,840
I think that is not pain is BDSM woke wokey. You're afraid of pain. I think it is woke

311
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,100
How's I think I don't know? I'm just letting the feeling that it's woke

312
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,540
I think what he's loved that crap is it like how woke ease hate they hate beautiful strippers

313
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:57,300
but they love fatty burlesques. They love Miss Andrie. And Polly Emery. Yeah. So GTA,

00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,420

325
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,420
I had to wear a mask, I felt so woke the other day.

326
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,920
Guys, the car troubles continue for Caleb.

327
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,760
- Yeah.

328
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,720
- I don't know if I, did I say this already?

329
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,100
I went to go fucking, I went to go replace

330
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
the side view mirror on my car,

331
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,260
which has no license plate and is sitting

332
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,700
in a parking lot behind the post office.

333
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,020
And I went to go fix the mirror

334
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,680
and the entire car was filled with green mold

335
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,940
all over every seat.

336
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,940
He told us that.

337
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,180
Yeah, I don't know if he said it on the show, but.

338
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,160
So then I went and I wore a mask to go fix it, and this is the wokest I've felt in my

339
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
entire life.

340
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,520
You gotta wear a mask to clean mold.

341
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
It's woke.

342
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,480
I know, so this is also woke now.

343
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
So now everything, even growths are woke.

344
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Spores can become woke.

345
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,960
Even your car, your car has become woke.

346
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,800
Exactly, now I'm not supposed to wear a mask.

347
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:12,640
GTA well guess what a GTA is theft auto grand grandly stolen your car mold has

348
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:20,240
green woke mold has stolen your car green haired woke yeah green haired woke mold

349
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,080
is completely stolen your car from you it's true and now it's making me wear a

350
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,880
mask. Green haired woke mold has grown over all my dishes in the sink. Even my fucking car is woke.

351
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,360
- The kitchen has gone woke because my wife

352
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,200
will not wash my dishes.

353
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
The woman won't wash the dishes, the kitchen goes woke.

354
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,680
- The Thanksgiving leftovers have gone completely woke

355
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,840
in my pantry where I drunkenly put them up.

356
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,320
(laughing)

357
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,080
On Thanksgiving night, my mac and cheese has green hair

358
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,340
and it stares at me.

359
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,280
And it makes me sick to even eat this mac and cheese.

360
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,600
- But guys, can I tell you the truth?

361
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,480
I think that God is punishing me deeply and I think the reason is because he wants to

362
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,960
take me out of commission because I'm one of the number one soldiers of Christmas and

363
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,360
in this woke world even God doesn't want Christmas to be around anymore.

364
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,880
So that's the truth man.

365
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,420
Has God gone woke?

366
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,840
God has gone woke first of all, second of all, we don't know.

367
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,520
We have zero contact with God.

368
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,040
He's abandoned us.

369
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,320
But here's the truth.

370
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,560
God has abandoned us, yes.

371
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,520
We were obviously we had giant Christmas plans for this week. Yeah for the show. Four weeks

372
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,040
of Christmas. We literally ended the last thing we have. And now one week is obliterated.

373
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,000
Literally a week of Christmas is destroyed. By some woke mind virus that Cameron has got.

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,760
I got the virus. The woke virus. I don't even know if there's going to be a week two. I

375
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,360
got AIDS bro. I mean I didn't get AIDS but. They gave Cameron HIV/AIDS one of the most

376
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,320
Horrifically killing diseases that ever has walked the face of the planet Earth. Well, you just make sure you're out of your eyeballs

377
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,540
That you just take 1 million pills and it's cured

378
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm taking them 1 million pills of cereal every morning for breakfast

379
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,000
Cereal is pills cereal is a box of pills. Yeah, and it's been healing me pretty well you guys

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,080
Can I tell you the actual truth? That's actually the truth that but what I said was also true, but this is also yeah

381
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
We're true. Yeah, tell me that's I

382
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,100
since start hitting record and since sitting down with you guys I genuinely

383
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,980
feel better than I felt in days on end. Yeah. You see this is literally healing

384
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,980
me in real time. It's because of the friendship. It's the friendship and it's

385
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,460
the idea that Christmas isn't ruined. We're giving you we're giving you the

386
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:47,900
gift. And it's honestly shitting on woke too. Yeah. That also. Shitting on woke. Shitting on woke is the gift that keeps on giving.

387
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,740
that keeps on giving.

388
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,740
- Shitting on woke is the greatest medicine, they say.

389
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,580
- Laughter.

390
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,980
- It's the gift that never fails.

391
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,940
- Laughter in the face of woke.

392
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,860
- It's the gift you give somebody that has everything.

393
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,860
- So now that you two are getting a gem.

394
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,460
- I got you shitting on woke this year.

395
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,900
- Oh baby!

396
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,980
- I don't know what to get my dad, man.

397
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,140
I got him a Blu-ray of the Godfather trilogy already.

398
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,420
(laughing)

399
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,300
I got him a Blu-ray player the next year so he could watch it because he didn't have a

400
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Blu-ray player.

401
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
God, I'm out of ideas.

402
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
I don't know what to do.

403
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,180
Fuck, I guess I'll get him shitting on woke this year.

404
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,220
I don't know if my dad would like that or not.

405
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,300
I can't tell if my dad...

406
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,620
I'm too scared to ask.

407
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,220
My dad is the one elderly person in my life that I really don't want to know his political

408
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
opinions about anything.

409
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Yeah.

410
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Yeah.

411
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,220
You know, I feel like...

412
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,100
At least your dad doesn't talk to you about the...

413
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,820
You know who my dad hates the most?

414
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Who?

415
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
Who?

416
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,660
besides Donald Trump, probably Donald Trump the most you know who else, George

417
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,860
Santos. Wow that's an interesting combination. He despises George Santos. I love George Santos.

418
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,380
I love George Santos too. Hey, give us all that money. Isn't that crazy that you can't

419
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,020
even, when you hit a certain age you can't even appreciate a guy like

420
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,260
George Santos anymore. Yeah. All you can think about is taxes. The only thing

421
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,620
that, the only thing my dad has ever done that has clued me into his political

422
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,420
ideology at all is that one time I told you this before that one time for

423
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,740
Halloween he dressed up as Caitlyn Jenner on a box of Wheaties and that's it

424
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,500
that's the only political thing he's ever done the only like statement he's

425
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,580
ever made and well it's not so little it's on Halloween well yeah and also I

426
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,500
asked him about it he was like I was like why did you do that he was like I

427
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,740
was just funny so even that he didn't really seem all that gung-ho about it

428
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:47,820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I think my there's definitely some a branch of my

429
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,780
family that's pretty anti-woke that I could probably get shitting on woke for

430
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:58,460
Christmas. Yeah, I could get my whole family besides my siblings probably the

431
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,820
roast of woke. The roast of woke on DVD. Probably the most probably I could get that for

432
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,000
every single one of my aunts, uncles, parents. Wait, we should make that. The roast of

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I could get the roast of woke.

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm selling on DVD for as a Christmas man.

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And release a Christmas gift guide.

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I could give that to them.

437
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The only problem is that...

438
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I guess I have a big family so

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
probably I would say maybe the majority of my family

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I could probably get the roast of woke for Christmas.

441
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh yeah, not my Aunt Joanne.

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Not the ones I interact with very much.

443
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Not my Aunt Joanne. She would probably

444
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
be at the roast of woke protesting.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But isn't a roast...

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Protesting the roast?

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,740
- Yeah, so the roast of the roast of woke almost.

448
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,580
- But isn't a roast supposed to be the roasting?

449
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,240
- Don't you love, at the end of your roast don't you say,

450
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,280
"Also I love you so much."

451
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,360
- This isn't the roast, but listen woke,

452
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,520
all that stuff aside, we love you man.

453
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,760
(laughing)

454
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,560
- You're so important to our society.

455
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,400
- Not.

456
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,700
- Would we need to get somebody to actually sit in and--

457
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,100
- Adam Carolla is the host.

458
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,300
but we need somebody to sit and be woke.

459
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,740
- Oh, JVN.

460
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,780
- Oh, perfect.

461
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,980
- That's not bad. - That's perfect.

462
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,700
Yeah, JVN would be great.

463
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,700
- I think they would walk out immediately, though.

464
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,180
- Or woke Patrick Doran.

465
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
- They would woke out.

466
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,420
- Look, I'll bite the bullet.

467
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll bite the bullet.

468
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,900
I'll put on a blue wig.

469
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,340
- Dude, I'd sit there. - Anything for a paycheck.

470
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,180
I'd be woke for the Roast of Woke.

471
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,620
- Wait, what is he doing?

472
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,020
- He's going to take his clothes off.

473
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,740
- Do we have an SJW wig?

474
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,660
We have a Karen wig, I think.

475
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,860
So that's going to be the opposite. That's part of the dais, the Karen.

476
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,420
The Karen is obviously going to roast you.

477
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,380
Karen is an anti-woke warrior.

478
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,660
Yeah.

479
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,100
So this wig is not going to work at all.

480
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,260
I know he's right next to the wig.

481
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,060
Until I organize the wigs.

482
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,180
Yeah, okay.

483
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,140
Alright, so I'm going to explain to this...

484
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,220
Pat, Pat, this is not wokeness, man. This is a Karen wig.

485
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,240
No, this isn't a Karen. This is a...

486
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,660
This is a woman with a male haircut.

487
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,160
Which is woke.

488
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,960
- But it's the wrong color, blood.

489
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,920
- No, okay, can I, I don't have a webcam.

490
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,160
Actually I do, hold up.

491
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm gonna change the color right now, okay?

492
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
- Okay. - And then you'll see.

493
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,200
- And then we could do,

494
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
- Whoa. - Okay, so that's red.

495
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,040
That's more. - Oh my God.

496
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,960
- Red skin, I mean completely purple skin

497
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,320
could also be part of wokeness.

498
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,480
And piercing blue eyes and a black shirt.

499
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,720
- This is looking, I guess, a little woke.

500
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
- If this person-- - I am woke!

501
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,640
I wish I had a voice changer.

502
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
- If this person walked down the street,

503
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I would probably assume they were woke.

504
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,680
I'm gonna be honest.

505
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,600
- This is a full body tattoo?

506
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,520
- A full of redness. - Of red.

507
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
And black eyes except for blue pupils.

508
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,840
- Blue contact lenses?

509
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,120
They call them contact lenses because of eye contact?

510
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,420
- Yes.

511
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,340
- I think so.

512
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,760
Okay, if someone walked down the street

513
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,160
with red skin and blue teeth,

514
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,660
I probably would say that is certainly a woke warrior.

515
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah, that is really a scary,

516
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,960
wokey walking down the street and blue eyebrows.

517
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,340
See, on the other hand,

518
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,520
this is God's most anti-woke man of all time.

519
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,660
It really is.

520
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,680
Yeah, you need to stop scaring me, Pat.

521
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,520
- Okay.

522
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,360
- Yeah.

523
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,180
- Well, I don't know.

524
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,020
Oh, there we go.

525
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
- Yeah, now it's normal.

526
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,360
- Yeah.

527
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,800
Did I tell you, speaking of parents' political beliefs,

528
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,240
Did I tell you, maybe I shouldn't say this, but--

529
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
- Let it fly, dude, it's a premium.

530
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,640
- All right, yeah, whatever.

531
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,640
My mom likes to send me funny-ass memes from facebook.com.

532
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,600
And we might have been hanging out

533
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
when I got this text, Cameron.

534
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,320
I think I might have shown you this.

535
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,320
But my mother sent me, it was a picture of,

536
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,280
okay, my webcam's frozen.

537
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,280
My mother sends me a funny-ass Nicolas Cage Photoshop meme,

538
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,200
right? - Yes.

539
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,240
- And it is Nicolas Cage as Prince,

540
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,140
and it says Prince, right?

541
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,560
So then I open up the screenshot,

542
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,860
look up a little bit, look at the page that it's posted to.

543
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,240
The page was called Transvestigations 2.0.

544
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,500
(laughing)

545
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,940
and i asked her

546
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,400
what she was doing in that group

547
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,180
and she told me i don't know my friend shared it it's not i didn't join that

548
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,420
group it's not a fact it was on my feet and believe it

549
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,420
i don't believe her at all i think that my mom has might have become a

00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,620
transvesta gator

551
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,380

movie to put it in the donor throats

00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,380
to push the trans agenda why else would you go in that many movies unless you

572
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,220
had a little bit of political escape she wants to put all men in the chastity

573
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,860
cages so that we can't reproduce

574
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,100
and that every single and every single man becomes the masculine aid

575
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,180
and uh... national treasure more like national treason

Fast times at Ridgemont High more like fast guys

turn into fast guys, girls into guys.

580
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,300
- 'Cause you're fasting the guys into girls.

581
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,660
- Into girls and guys.

582
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,780
- Girls don't eat as much as guys do.

583
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,080
- Fast guys into girls, guys.

584
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,900
- Yeah, so that makes not that much sense.

585
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,740

Gone in 60 seconds. Yeah, what's that about? Men's genitalia?

602
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,100
It takes really quick.

603
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:54,700
It's actually really quick and easy. It's actually not really a big deal and it goes right back on too.

604
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,900
Yeah, it's like a piece of Lego. Yeah.

605
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,500
I wish that, I think that we'll get to that point soon where we can hot swap everything.

606
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,820
Yeah.

607
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,700
pretty soon. Yeah, pretty. We're gonna get there. We're getting there basically instantaneously.

608
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:17,180
Let's see. It's crazy that there's like, like those trans, the transvestigation thing

609
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:26,380
110% started with the Michelle Obama rumors, right? Rumors is a strong word for truth.

610
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:35,740
Or a weak word. It's a strong word. Or a strong, yeah, a weak word. No. For truth.

611
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,540
- Rumors is a weaker word for truth.

612
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,380
- Rumors is a fleet word for music.

613
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:48,060
- No, I think rumors is, I think that made sense.

614
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,340
- Well, no, I know, I'm just kind of building off of it.

615
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,660
It's more like in the direction,

616
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,900
rumors kind of less truthful than a truth,

617
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,420
which you would imagine would be, might be weaker.

618
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,860
- I guess you're, oh, I mean,

619
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,260
so you're thinking more of like a really good t-shirt

620
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,100
that would say like rumors are a strong word for truth.

621
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,940
Like a sentence in a novel.

622
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,420
Rumors are a weak replacement for the truth.

623
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,580
That would work really well.

624
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,460
That could be good, yeah.

625
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,700
But yeah, Michelle Obama definitely is a man.

626
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,540
Yeah.

627
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,500
That's why she was putting food in schools

628
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,100
that have a lot of testosterone.

629
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,780
What woman on earth would marry Barack Obama?

630
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,400
Exactly, he's disgusting.

631
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,140
He's actually hot.

632
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,340
Yeah, he looks good.

633
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,180
I'm gonna be fuckin' honest.

634
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,800
You guys know he's a war criminal, right?

635
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
Yeah.

636
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,640
Wait, what do you mean?

637
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,480
That's what makes him kind of bad though.

638
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Apparently he uses drones to blow up, basically,

639
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,380
I guess, apparently it's either children

640
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,220
in one of these countries.

641
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,020
I use fucking drones to record soccer games.

642
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,860
Yeah. Who cares?

643
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,900
You know who else uses drones?

644
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,740
I use drones.

645
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,120
You know who else uses drones?

646
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,040
Who? The Queen Bee of the hive.

647
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,560
Yeah, what, so the Queen Bee is some kind of

648
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,420
serial monster?

649
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,260
No.

650
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,320
I don't fuck with the Queen Bee.

651
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,160
I don't fuck with the Queen Bee.

652
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,880
- Have you guys watched any of this lady who,

653
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,400
she went on Rogan like maybe six months ago,

654
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,920
but her whole thing is that she's like a bee expert

655
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,000
and she makes videos where she like moves colonies of hives

656
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,840
from wherever to wherever.

657
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,320
- I've seen the mushroom guy.

658
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,000
- But there's a bunch of guys who do this online,

659
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,720
but it's clear that Rogan just had her on

660
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,560
'cause she's like crazy hot

661
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,160
and he just wants to like talk to her

662
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
and then as she's,

663
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,560
and you can tell he gets a little bit bored

664
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,740
of the bee stuff like 90 minutes in.

665
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,040
(laughing)

666
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,040
And she just keeps talking about how the bees work.

667
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,240
And he's like, "Oh, okay, so where are you from?"

668
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,480
- Oh.

669
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,360
- Does he put his arm around her?

670
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,200
Like fear factor style?

671
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,040
- Well, she sits on his--

672
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,920
- It's the first time in Rogan history

673
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,760
that he sat on the other side of the table.

674
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
- She sits on his lap.

675
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,680
(laughing)

676
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,120
- Yeah, she sits next to him.

677
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,680
- I don't think I've ever watched the video

678
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,580
for a Joe Rogan episode.

679
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,600
And I also don't think I've ever watched

680
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,240
Joe Rogan episode with a girl in it.

681
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,880
Why the hell has Santa not been on?

682
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,080
But he was fully, he was on that tip in

683
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,040
Fear Factor. He was all up on the ladies.

684
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,440
That's part of what makes it so fun to

685
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,520
watch. Is he still like that or does he

686
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
mellow it out?

687
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I think he's mellowed out.

688
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,080
I don't think he has women on his podcast

689
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,920
that often.

690
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,820
Me and Eric talk all the time at the gym

691
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,520
about how funny it is that he

692
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,120
talks about whenever he works out.

693
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,200
Oh yeah.

694
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,540
The thing that gets him through like a

695
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,720
really hard rep at the gym is that he

696
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,640
imagines his entire, his like

697
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,880
wife and his daughters getting raped and the only thing that can stop it from happening

698
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,680
is if he does a squat.

699
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,720
Oh dude you never know.

700
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,640
They could be on a spaceship and some half alien hybrid bandit landed on the ship and

701
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,760
is trying to rape his entire family in the other room and the airlock button is directly

702
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,040
under his butt and his arms are atrophied from being in cryo sleep.

703
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,960
- So he's basically like squatting four points.

704
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,880
- Yeah, exactly.

705
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,880
The gravity generator is running haywire.

706
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
- Yeah.

707
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,480
- I mean his body weight has quadrupled.

708
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,560
- There's certainly--

709
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,240
- There's scenarios, man.

710
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,800
We've thought about these scenarios before.

711
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
- It's crazy that he thinks of that

712
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,500
'cause to get myself to work harder in the gym,

713
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,880
I think about Joe Rogan getting assaulted.

714
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,720
(laughing)

715
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,280
- And me having to stop it.

716
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,440
- Yeah, and not being the only one who can stop it.

717
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
- I'm in the gym lifting,

718
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm thinking I need to get strong enough to kill Joe Rogan's wife.

719
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,200
I need to get strong enough so that Rogan is never put in that position again.

720
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,920
So that aliens use me instead of him.

721
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
Yeah.

722
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,960
I squat so much that my butt becomes huge and then every single alien is just like, "Well,

723
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,360
we gotta probe that one."

724
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,760
That would be a really bad accidentally saying like, "Yeah, me too, man."

725
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:59,760
he explained that to you. I imagine my wife and daughter's getting attacked. Yeah, me

726
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,160
too. Yeah, dude, I imagine your wife and daughter

727
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,760
getting attacked as well. Oh, fuck. I fucked it up with Rogan. Oh, shit.

728
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Yeah. He's never going to have me back on to promote

729
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
my peanut butter. Telling him to keep the peanut butter.

730
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,760
To the movie theater ticket taker. Yeah. Just zoning out on Rogan. He says that shit.

731
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,760
You're like, "Oh, yeah, me too." Can you imagine my wife getting raped?

732
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:26,560
No, no, no, no. I imagine you getting attacked, bro. I imagine you getting attacked and I have

733
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:33,560
to stop you. Alright guys, this has been a bit long. This is our first 30 minute episode

734
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:41,440
of Joe Rogan. Dude, Joe Rogan starts talking about that 5 minutes into the episode. I do

735
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,320
think I would have a hard time paying attention for that long to do one of those things. I

736
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,680
I can't believe he does that for two hours.

737
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,080
It's fucking crazy.

738
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,160
- I'd start playing with the table.

739
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,240
- Dude, I'd be playing with his foot under the table.

740
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,120
You kidding me?

741
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,480
I'd be sitting there, taking my shoe off, rubbing his toes.

742
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,800
- I'd be trying to flip the interview on him.

743
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,020
- Dude, I got those Betty Boop socks

744
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,120
that each toe got a finger-like type thing.

745
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,640
I got fingerless socks on and I'm rubbing his feet

746
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,200
with my toes under the table.

747
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,360
- The table's too big now.

748
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,400
It's too big now?

749
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,920
- He made the table bigger because Mike Tyson scared him.

750
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,200
(laughing)

751
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,040
It's true.

752
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,600
The table used to be like three feet across

753
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,080
and they made it like seven feet across because--

754
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,640
- What, did Mike Tyson try to like fight him?

755
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,600
- Not even a little bit.

756
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,080
He just said that Mike Tyson was sitting across from him

757
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,920
and he was like, "I'm way too close to Mike Tyson

758
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,400
"and I'm really scared of him."

759
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
- Oh my God.

760
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,680
Yeah, but then like what, he's had like

761
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,240
fucking Edward Snowden on after that.

762
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,200
Like all these like--

763
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,860
through edward all the other will mother fucking kill your ass

764
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,660
and through the power of information

765
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,500
yeah a lot of people don't answer them

766
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,760
he's a a cyber assassin

767
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,440
they got that word snowed in still alive

768
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,940
yet was his address and can i get 'em

769
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,800
i believe he's a little bit of a road some he ruined everything for us

770
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,660
i know i don't want to know about it that's if that

771
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,120
the phone is on the

772
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,340
care and i don't care about we know bro

773
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,780
We know. I know my phone is weird.

774
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,540
I know it. Leave it alone, man.

775
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,220
I wanna be playing on miniclip.com

776
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,900
and know that it's taking my RuneScape password

777
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,940
and not care.

778
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,300
Yeah, man, we don't need Edward Snowden

779
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,500
to know about this shit, man.

780
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,620
I text my girlfriend and say,

781
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,520
"I'm gonna poop right now, I'm pooping,"

782
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,860
and then I get five Instagram ads for toilet paper.

783
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,940
It's obvious.

784
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,300
Yeah, they couldn't make it more obvious, man.

785
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,820
Pat, have you started getting gym ads

786
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,460
or like work stuff?

787
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,300
No, not yet?

788
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
No.

789
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,460
Then you're not going hard enough.

790
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,500
What do you mean I'm not going hard?

791
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I just don't talk about it in front of my phone.

792
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,740
Talk about it right now.

793
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,580
Take your phone.

794
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,400
We have talked about it right now.

795
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,900
You should be getting it from your credit card.

796
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,220
Bro, I have been--

797
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,500
They should have, if you signed up,

798
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,220
they should be getting you, man.

799
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,580
I have been eating so crazy.

800
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,900
Pat's been getting into protein, guys.

801
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,820
Bro, I have been eating--

802
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,660
That's the other thing.

803
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,860
He's been going after it with the diet,

804
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,440
also more than anybody I've ever seen.

805
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,140
He pulls up to the gym, he's eating 70 grams of protein

806
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,220
before he goes to the gym.

807
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,780
Completely arbitrary number he just decided

808
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,660
he wants to hit every day.

809
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,660
- It was easy.

810
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
- I never told him to do this.

811
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,620
- Is that too little?

812
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,580
- No, it's more than enough.

813
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,420
- Okay.

814
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,900
- For one meal.

815
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,420
- Well, that's 'cause it's just,

816
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,820
I just did the math the first time I ever did it

817
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,380
and then it felt good.

818
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,100
- What math? - And I was like, okay.

819
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,680
Well, I had the one protein bar that was 30 grams

820
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,180
and then the protein shake was 40.

821
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,540
And I was like, oh, I feel really good right now,

822
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,360
so I should just do this every day.

823
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,380
- Yeah, just get it in the-- - Every single time

824
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,420
I go to the gym.

825
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,800
- Fuck it, whatever works for you, bro.

826
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,340
But now that you two are both in the gym,

827
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,740
we have to decide which one of us

828
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,780
is gonna start using gear first, I think.

829
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,540
- I have the strongest liver out of all of us.

830
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,620
- I would say that you probably have the weakest liver

831
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,460
out of all of us.

832
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,480
- What are you talking about?

833
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,780
- It's been abused the most.

834
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,620
- Years. - That doesn't mean

835
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,440
it gets strong.

836
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,220
- Livers don't get experience points.

837
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,060
They don't level up.

838
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,260
- Yeah, they don't get better with drinking.

839
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,580
- Oh, I have an iron liver.

840
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,420
- My liver. - No, man,

841
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,540
it's like a sponge.

842
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,380
It's like a kitchen sponge.

843
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,340
- Your liver's definitely insanely fatty and--

844
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,200
- No, I got that tested last time I went to the doctor.

845
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,780
- At 26, you got your liver tested?

846
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,420
- That probably means there's nothing

847
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:41,860
to worry about. I thought that I thought that that's what the blood work was but I'm realizing

848
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,320
I'm just lying. I'm just lying to get on steroids. They have to give you they have to like do

849
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:51,860
imaging or something. It's like stick a camera up you or some shit. Well I don't have like

850
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,600
a fucking. Have you seen that photo of Bert Kreischer where you can see his liver through

851
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,760
his belly. That's OK. He looks good man he lost a bunch of weight. Yeah. Why do you think

852
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
- Why did he, bro, why did he take that photo with the towel?

853
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,440
That was so fucked.

854
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,360
- I've been meaning to say this for a little bit.

855
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,080
- I get he's trying to show his V-lines or whatever, but.

856
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,600
- Guys, if you are losing weight

857
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,760
and you want to take progress photos,

858
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,720
I do not need to see your trunk, man.

859
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,080
Keep the trunk back in your draws.

860
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,240
I do not want to see your fucking trunk.

861
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
Get that shit out of here.

862
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,880
- People get so excited about the trunk, man.

863
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,240
- I don't wanna see it, man.

864
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,600
No one likes the trunk.

865
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,680
The trunk is...

866
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,440
Nobody's getting into the trunk, dude.

867
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,760
The only thing people like is the arms and the chest.

868
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,680
Yeah, I don't need to see the top of the thing.

869
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,240
The only people who like the trunk

870
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,080
is a really scary gay guy who attacks your life online.

871
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,380
Yeah, exactly.

872
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,640
And who wants to get to the...

873
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,240
They wanna get to the bottom of this.

874
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,080
I'm gonna get to the bottom of that.

875
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,400
They wanna get to that root.

876
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
They wanna get to the root.

877
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
I don't wanna see that shit, personally.

878
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,600
This is the only guy, the only type of person who likes the trunk is the gay guy who also

879
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,880
would think it was really hot if you posted a picture of all the veins in your body.

880
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah.

881
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
If you somehow posted an x-ray of every vein.

882
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
Yeah, a body's ears, man.

883
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
They would go, "Oh my god."

884
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
A circulatory system.

885
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Just your spine and all.

886
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,880
Just your whole Dr. Manhattan eyeballs and circulatory system.

887
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
They would go, "Oh my god."

888
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Everybody else doesn't want to see that shit, man.

889
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
It's anatomical, bro.

890
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Those are like the gay guys that are obsessed with the gay guy.

891
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Would you post a picture of your body?

892
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Yeah.

893
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
I would.

894
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
I would.

895
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
I would.

896
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I would.

897
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I would.

898
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
I would.

899
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
I would.

900
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,060
It's a ball hanging out of your Patagonia baggies. I don't think so

901
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,260
Yeah, that is funny, but those are the type of gay guys that are obsessed with us

902
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:44,200
It's crazy. Those are the gay guys that ask us for like armpit pictures and stuff you get armpit asks

903
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,160
I don't know anything man. Nobody likes me. I like you know

904
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,960
I'd see your one of the few trunks. I'd like to investigate show it show us

905
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:01,180
I just it's not doing well right now. I'm unhealthy on dude. It's discolored. It has good days and bad days for sure

906
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,360
Today

907
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:10,560
Yeah, you got a bright purple trunk now. It looks like you've been like it looks I bet it looks horrible right now

908
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,700
I bet it's like photo of Jerry Su after he took that butt slam what who's that?

909
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
And is this does that mean? Oh

910
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,400
One or two listeners will know

911
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,020
Okay, it's a skating thing sometimes. I only speak for the listener

912
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,980
You should always be doing that yeah

913
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,380
Well, where are you guys you're entering another dimension?

914
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:38,180
No, I'm just good. He's got Jim. You're looking down into the corner of your eyes like a cartoon

915
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,260
I'm looking at you guys in the camera

916
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:45,860
Look at you guys on my screen. Okay, all right that makes a little more sense. Yeah

917
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,060
But I think that I've now gotten

918
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:55,180
Five people in the gym and for each and every one of them. It's changed their entire. It's so funny

919
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,980
I was talking to patches about this to be fully in there. I've been I've been really happy doing all the running this past year

920
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,060
I'm ready to stop with the damn running and do some better stuff

921
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:11,720
I was talking to patches about this the second you put Caleb in charge of something. He becomes like Scoutmaster

922
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,180
It's like your leader, man. I don't know it's you you built his PC with him

923
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,780
and he was like, yeah, I got him because I asked him

924
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,140
how to do it because I know that he would like

925
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,540
tell me exactly everything that I have to do,

926
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,380
which is why I started going to the gym with you

927
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,340
like day one, you were like, so this is called this

928
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,100
and what you're gonna wanna do is this, this and this.

929
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,780
- I was teaching him about eccentric

930
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,780
and concentric movement.

931
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,220
Dude, the thing is, man, I don't know what to do there.

932
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,420
I don't know what to do there.

933
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,820
I just have to sit there and listen to what you say

934
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,740
and then I'll just be a little worker drone

935
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,940
until I become gigantic.

936
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,460
- Exactly, man, you follow everything that I have to say.

937
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,700
I just think I'd be an amazing dictator.

938
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,660
I'm just good at giving people complete orders

939
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,640
and especially in one-on-one situations,

940
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,160
I think I could definitely become a personal trainer.

941
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,580
I'd love to be, there's a, oh dude,

942
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,180
you haven't seen him yet. - Dude, I'll be, oh my God,

943
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,860
I'll be your first, I'll be your first example

944
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,740
that you can use.

945
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,300
- Yes, you'll go on all the brochures.

946
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,180
There's a guy at our gym, you haven't met him yet.

947
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,440
His name is Bluebeard because he--

948
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,140
- Oh, you were telling me about Bluebeard!

949
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,860
- Dude, Bluebeard is a fucking legend.

950
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,960
He's this like, kinda fatter, older guy

951
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,120
who has completely blue hair and a giant blue beard,

952
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,820
like blueberry blue, like as blue as,

953
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,620
like it has, it's probably hours to his--

954
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,500
- Can I say something without everyone getting mad?

955
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,660
- What? - He's kinda sounding

956
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,580
kinda woke to me.

957
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,020
- Dude, he looks woke, but then you hear

958
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,940
the way that he talks to these guys,

959
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:52,500
he trains. He's a trainer and he's training like bodybuilders, like giant guys. And at

960
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,620
first I thought that he was some kind of freak, weirdo, wokey, SJW.

961
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,500
A guy with blue beard? You thought he was weird?

962
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:08,900
But it turns out this guy knows way more about working out than I could ever know. And we

963
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,220
have to hire him to train you, dude.

964
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,220
This would be an amazing training partner for you.

965
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:21,320
I mean, I want to look like a 1920s strong man at this point in my life.

966
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,980
You want to get that, the curled wrist fighting look?

967
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,220
I want to hold a barbell with my finger.

968
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:32,700
Oh yeah, one of the ones that has the big ball weights on either side.

969
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
And it's a bend-in.

970
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,300
I want to do this.

971
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,300
And have a big barbell right there.

972
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,900
You want to look like the gold gym logo.

973
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
Yep.

974
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,900
That's what I'm trying, that's what's going to happen for me in the next year.

975
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,660
I don't care about any of that. I just want to be a monster. I

976
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,620
Like what I'm saying?

977
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,260
All these guys you want to know we're not going for health

978
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,380
I'm not trying to be skinny at all

979
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,820
100 fuck you

980
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,180
I truly would just like to gain some weight for the first time in my entire life besides growing from a baby

981
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,580
Cameron if you wanted to gain weight you could have come to my weight gaining classes

982
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,020
Oh, you're saying come to growing up from the time you're a baby

983
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,460
I thought you were implying that you had been pregnant before and you got wife off of that

984
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,680
I don't remember what I said one second ago, so I can't remember you said growing from a baby

985
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,340
Yeah, I grew from a baby. Yeah like a plant grows from a seed

986
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,740
Yeah, or a guy grows out of a baby or grows from it's not

987
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:36,860
From Cameron what here okay listen, and I don't think I've gained weight since no no no no

988
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,660
I'm about to put you on to something.

989
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,500
Okay.

990
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,080
Two words, three words.

991
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,060
- Okay.

992
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,540
- Okay, I'm getting excited.

993
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,380
- Social.

994
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,420
- Ice cream soup.

995
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,240
Social, four words.

996
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,080
- I have ice cream every once in a while.

997
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,620
- You're gonna have an ice cream soup.

998
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,360
Uh-uh, you're gonna eat ice cream soup every single day.

999
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,060
You're gonna melt down that ice cream in your microwave

1000
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,480
until it gets completely melted

1001
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,700
and it's a little bit hot, kind of bubbling,

1002
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,860
kind of looking like clam chowder,

1003
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,860
you're gonna eat two bowls of that with every single meal.

1004
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,740
- It's true, people do this to gain weight.

1005
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,820
Why is it that we've lived in New York

1006
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,100
for years and years? - Ice cream soup

1007
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,340
plus Taco Bell fat fucking idiot meals.

1008
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,380
- That's how Mac got fat on always sunny men.

1009
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,940
- You need to eat, it's a T10 combo,

1010
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,140
so that's two tacos plus a gordita

1011
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,860
plus a Crunchwrap Supreme. - It's too much money

1012
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,820
- I'm trying to gain weight, man.

1013
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,660
I wanna spend $10 on food a week.

1014
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,100
I'm not about this shit, man.

1015
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,700
- He is the cereal and sandwich man, dude.

1016
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,540
- Yeah.

1017
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,380
- You and me, we like decadent dinners.

1018
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,840
- I don't fuck with meals.

1019
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,140
- He doesn't like these giant expensive meals like you and me.

1020
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,540
- You know what I made last night?

1021
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,780
- I do like it, but I just can't, I can't make it work, man.

1022
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,940
- Roasted delicata squash with pistachios and goat cheese.

1023
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,740
- Roasted Dan Licata squash?

1024
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,140
(laughing)

1025
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,980
- It does sound like his name.

1026
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,860
- Sounds good as hell.

1027
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,740
I love that. I roasted Dan Licata for dinner. That does sound, I've never... I could see

1028
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:16,860
him all bundled up. Roast like a turkey. Roast up with the twine or whatever it is when you

1029
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,100
get a rotisserie chicken. Just this most scared face ever frozen on his face as he burned

1030
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:29,340
alive in the oven. I wouldn't eat you Dan. I would never eat Dan. No. But I'd roast you.

1031
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:37,020
I'd roast you man but I'd roast anybody man I'm a fucking I'm a crazy roast I'm

1032
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,980
an equal opportunity offender yeah people always say that and they don't

1033
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,620
seem all that equal opportunity yeah then they have that one thing that they

1034
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,220
get really really upset at like if you made fun of Jeff Ross for dating a child

1035
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,340
yeah if you try to roast the Roastmaster General for dating that 15 year old girl

1036
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,880
I think me thinks that me thinks that he would put pull out the roast extinguisher

1037
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:09,340
He dated a kid right I don't think it was a kid I think it was a young girl tails

1038
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,340
I don't think it was a person of younger age

1039
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,260
But I'm not so sure it was a child

1040
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:21,880
Yeah, I don't think that's a pretty it's a pretty big accusation I don't I mean a child

1041
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,860
Well, you know, I think it was probably a 20 year old but again, I'm just oh

1042
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,500
- Oh, well. - Right.

1043
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,220
- Then it is all a legend.

1044
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,440
- But if you ask me, I don't think that Jeff,

1045
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,540
what's his name?

1046
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,860
- Dunham?

1047
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,700
- No.

1048
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,020
- Jeff Ross, man. - Jeff Ross.

1049
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,700
I don't think that Jeff Ross should be dating anybody.

1050
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,540
- Yeah.

1051
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,860
- He was disgusting. - So if he's Justin 8,

1052
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,420
- I will say I'd like to hear that dirty talk,

1053
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,680
'cause I bet that shit's funny as hell.

1054
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,100
- You look like a slut.

1055
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,660
Yeah, you look like a stupid...

1056
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,260
Your shit is, your ass looks...

1057
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,140
What if you're dating a girl you find out

1058
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,780
years into the relationship her ex was Jeff Ross?

1059
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,700
That would suck.

1060
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,420
I think that honestly,

1061
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,860
would probably be better. That might be

1062
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,020
one of the celebrity,

1063
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,460
no, I'm not gonna say the only one,

1064
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,560
that'd be exaggerating.

1065
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,660
That would definitely be a celebrity

1066
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,540
that like, if it had been a previous relationship

1067
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,500
of my wife, I would not have gotten married.

1068
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,940
Yeah, you would just think that you're

1069
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,620
the ugliest guy of all time.

1070
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,660
No, it's just, it's not bad at all.

1071
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,060
It has nothing to do with,

1072
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:31,580
it's just anybody who would want to date him

1073
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,280
obviously has something completely wrong with them.

1074
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,240
Right.

1075
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,080
I think there's a lot of these.

1076
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,040
It's kind of like, well, can you imagine,

1077
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,540
what if back in the--

1078
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,700
It's kind of like who?

1079
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,980
What?

1080
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,100
Who did you say it's kind of like?

1081
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,180
Caleb?

1082
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,080
I didn't say it was like anybody.

1083
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,780
Oh, I thought you said it's kind of like

1084
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,800
dating somebody specific.

1085
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,640
No, I was gonna say it's kind of like--

1086
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,920
It's kind of like it's kind of like Walton Goggins.

1087
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,560
And I was like, what are you talking about?

1088
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,560
The other one would be if somebody if my wife had dated anybody

1089
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,160
who's Urkel, who was taller than if your Steve Urkel would have

1090
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,480
also been a bit of a red flag.

1091
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,760
Yeah.

1092
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,240
Imagine how hard it would be.

1093
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,000
How hard it would be to be dating if you were if you're alive

1094
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,880
back in the 40s, you had dated Hitler.

1095
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,680
Yeah. That if and then you're trying to walk if you're a girl.

1096
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Yeah, and you, well yeah, you dated Hitler.

1097
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,540
Maybe you dated Hitler back when he was an art student.

1098
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,340
You know, maybe he was probably still pretty nasty,

1099
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,080
but you know, he wasn't full Hitler yet.

1100
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,260
And then all this stuff goes down,

1101
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,020
you're kind of trying to just live your normal life.

1102
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,820
Yeah, and then people are asking,

1103
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,860
you're on your first date on Hinge,

1104
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,660
back when Hinge was in the newspaper.

1105
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,980
And then you're on your first Hinge date,

1106
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,860
and they're like, so what was your last relationship like?

1107
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,180
Like, oh, it was a celebrity.

1108
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,140
(laughing)

1109
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,900
- You might know him.

1110
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,740
- Yeah.

1111
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,040
- Yeah, he was,

1112
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,580
he had a funny mustache.

1113
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,420
- Yeah.

1114
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,240
- You dated Charlie Chaplin?

1115
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,080
Oh my God.

1116
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,920
- No.

1117
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,900
(laughing)

1118
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,540
- Let's just say in a long, long time,

1119
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,560
he's gonna be in a funnily epic rap battle.

1120
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,620
He's gonna be in a very funny, epic rap battle.

1121
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,940
- Let's just say in a long time.

1122
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,340
Let's just say in a very, very long, long time,

1123
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:23,840
he's gonna be in the funniest epic rap battle of history.

1124
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,220
- This is the 1940s, somebody's saying this.

1125
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,700
- Yes, and somebody--

1126
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,060
- And they go, oh, Hitler.

1127
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,980
Oh, funny rap battle, yeah, it's gotta be Hitler.

1128
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,700
- Funny epic rap battle, then you find out

1129
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,140
that bitch from the time traveler machine.

1130
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,180
- That bitch from the time traveler machine.

1131
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,340
What the hell is going on with you, man?

1132
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,900
- I think I'm winded.

1133
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,900
i think you might actually be

1134
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,540
i think maybe i should record after going to the gym my brain is on shit

1135
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,680
time all my god

1136
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,100
he said himself

1137
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,120
fix it

1138
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,220
haha explosively louds well i'm sorry i feel like normally i can maybe pick up

1139
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,240
some slack here but i'd

1140
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,820
guys there's something wrong with me

1141
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,980
last night when i was lying in bed i had days of who of having some kind of

1142
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,700
massive epiphany about the world from the night before that i couldn't

1143
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,260
remember all i could think about was that

1144
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,020
well 'cause both of them the reason i had the deja vu 'cause both times i was just

1145
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,380
feverish lying in bed in the same position and i was it was because i

1146
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,580
turned over onto one side and i remembered oh my god i think the night

1147
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:30,300
before i was lying on my side like this and i was shivering

1148
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,540
and i was thinking about some kind of giant

1149
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,100
oval machine

1150
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,500
filled with wires and cables i can't remember what it was or what it meant but

1151
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,660
it was really i thought it was really important

1152
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,460
you were thinking of the ooyah? i literally invented something and lived

1153
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,460
You invented the OUYA in your head.

1154
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:46,460
It was completely, no, bigger. Bigger than the OUYA.

1155
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:52,460
I think that, no, if you have a fever, if you have a really high fever, at some point you invent the OUYA.

1156
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:58,460
At some point you think to yourself, what if games could be streamed directly to my TV?

1157
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,460
It was a good idea. It was before its time, I'll say that much.

1158
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,460
Yeah.

1159
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:08,460
Wasn't the point of the OUYA that all the games were like iPhone games?

1160
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,460
Well, that was the problem.

1161
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,300
- No, I thought that was the point of it.

1162
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,020
- No, you want to be able to do--

1163
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,140
- They tried to do it later with Stadia,

1164
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,420
but none of that shit worked out,

1165
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,260
'cause nothing is fast enough.

1166
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,140
- And that was Google.

1167
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:19,980
- Yeah, that was Google.

1168
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,980
- And why, who even care, who wants to do that?

1169
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,800
- I kind of want to do that.

1170
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,100
- Why not just sit on your couch?

1171
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,700
- Well, you kidding, that's the thing, Cameron,

1172
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,140
you do sit on your couch when you use it.

1173
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,060
- Yeah. - But why?

1174
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,900
- What do you mean, but why?

1175
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,020
- Not just have it on your game console.

1176
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,880
- But then you have to go download

1177
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,820
and wait and all this crap.

1178
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,060
And it'd be nicer to just have it all streamed directly.

1179
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,140
I had an episode last night.

1180
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,980
- What?

1181
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,580
- I've been painting my brick wall.

1182
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,420
This one's white,

1183
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,220
I've been painting the one in the living room white as well.

1184
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,300
Finally.

1185
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,140
And I got up on a ladder.

1186
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,420
Have you guys been on a ladder in the last couple of years?

1187
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,640
- Yeah.

1188
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,380
The electrician has not been in my house for weeks,

1189
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,180
this electrician, and he has left the ladder.

1190
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,500
He called me two weeks ago

1191
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,660
'cause his dad has been doing all the work.

1192
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,120
And I guess his dad almost died from COVID.

1193
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,960
- Okay.

1194
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,580
- And that's why there is still a ladder

1195
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,300
and multiple holes in the wall.

1196
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,340
- And you get up on it every once in a while?

1197
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,180
- Oh, good, yeah.

1198
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,420
I get up there, I open it up, I stand on it.

1199
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,260
It's fun.

1200
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,380
- You had a ladder in your last apartment too.

1201
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,940
- I also, oh yeah.

1202
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,420
I do, oh my God.

1203
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,180
- So last night, I got on this ladder.

1204
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,020
- Mo likes to get up there

1205
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,380
so I have to get on it to get him off.

1206
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,460
- I got on this ladder and I started painting

1207
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,500
and then I finished painting.

1208
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,820
And I looked down and guys,

1209
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,380
I refused to get down from this ladder for about an hour.

1210
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,780
I sat on the ladder and I watched TV

1211
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,500
because it felt so amazing to be that tall.

1212
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,660
And so my new goal in life is to be nine feet tall

1213
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,900
because I had my wife,

1214
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,180
I refused to get off the ladder

1215
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,180
until my wife brought me a tape measurer

1216
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,420
and then I measured myself

1217
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,820
and I was almost exactly nine feet in the air on my head.

1218
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,860
- Yeah, but that's like Robert Wadlow stuff.

1219
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:01,860
Like he couldn't even like--

1220
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,460
- I think I would have really enjoyed being Robert Wadlow.

1221
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,940
now you wouldn't have a wife

1222
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,660
well you never have a lot to do to use to a doctor young girls like back and i

1223
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,020
back in

1224
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,620
robert wadlow times it with women didn't like tall guys to the eat more food

1225
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:21,660
so you have to return to jobs as a woman was a little bit of zero

1226
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,300
nowadays women like tall guys

1227
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,300
because it woke means that women should have two to three jobs in the mention of

1228
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,340
one

1229
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:32,340
exactly and those women don't even realize that you're gonna have to be

1230
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:39,880
making that much food. They think that men can just eat McDonald's every day. No! McDonald's

1231
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:45,820
is a snack. That's true. It makes you more hungry I've heard because of the sugars. Yeah.

1232
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,940
But I'm not kidding man, I really, is that what life is like for you Cameron as a person

1233
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:57,740
over 6 feet tall? What? Being tall? Everything looked so small to me man. It was amazing.

1234
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,700
- Yeah, I guess people look pretty,

1235
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,860
you guys look pretty small.

1236
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,620
- I was looking around and I thought I was better than,

1237
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,380
I mean, it was only my wife in there.

1238
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,020
- I mean, to tell you the truth,

1239
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,500
I look in the, when it comes to tallness,

1240
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,220
anybody who's taller than me,

1241
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,540
and my brain is really tall,

1242
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,500
anybody who's shorter,

1243
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,660
I couldn't draw any distinguishment really,

1244
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,940
unless they're insanely short.

1245
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,900
I don't think I think about how tall I am very much.

1246
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,700
- All I'm gonna say is you, Caleb,

1247
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,540
you're lucky you weren't in that world's biggest army promo vid

1248
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,580
'cause now everyone thinks i'm the shortest fucking guy in the world

1249
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,580
'cause there's one clip where i'm in between

1250
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,300
pierce isn't in it at all

1251
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,660
all you can see

1252
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:46,020
is me, cameron, joe and alex and i look like a baby

1253
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,700
i look like their little brother

1254
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:52,700
i look like both their uncle and their little brother simultaneously

1255
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,940
i guess to answer your question, no i take it for granted

1256
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,780
you clearly experience any sense of this is all the patrick ever think about is

1257
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,420
this every single tall person takes it for when you walk by this happens i will

1258
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:07,860
i will say i will say though you guys really i mean maybe

1259
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,440
now at this phase in our lives were not taking so much public transport or

1260
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
anything

1261
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:15,020
there were any type of seat

1262
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,940
in a public area is a complete nightmare just in terms of

1263
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,020
we either leg room on a plow or a bus or something like that

1264
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,380
or having to just be touching people on all sides because your legs are too long on the subway

1265
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:32,980
and i know you're gonna go i'm okay with that but yeah it does suck and it's i'm perfectly built for

1266
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:40,500
public transit i have a big ass i experience this i have time no ass and tiny ass legs but but the

1267
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:46,580
upside the upside to being tall on a plane or train or a bus like on the amtrak or whatever

1268
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:52,740
you can be really rude. Like people, because my body is just too big for the Amtrak seats,

1269
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,020
if somebody tries to lean their seat back, I just start hitting their seat.

1270
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,100
And you get to use the women's bathroom.

1271
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,820
And I just go like, "Fuck you," and I start hitting them.

1272
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:07,380
Yeah, see, that's cool, because you have a physical, basically disability on a plane or a bus.

1273
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:13,940
Yeah, which is, that's, I wish I had something more, kind of, I wish that's,

1274
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:15,620
I guess that's the thing everybody says.

1275
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,020
- You wish you had a disability.

1276
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,580
- I wish I had a new take on this height issue.

1277
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,220
- I don't think about my height too much,

1278
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,780
but if I was going to a really high powered

1279
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,160
job opportunity, business opportunity,

1280
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:32,740
interview style pow wow, right?

1281
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,820
- Putting some lifts in?

1282
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,660
- If I had, no, no, no, no.

1283
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,500
- Or a run to San Francisco?

1284
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,480
- I'm not doing any of that shit,

1285
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,680
'cause that's compensating.

1286
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,880
What I would do, or I guess that's fixing.

1287
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,840
What I would do is there's no way

1288
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,960
that I'm taking the train to something like that

1289
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,000
where I need to be at my highest level of confidence

1290
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,640
because the prospect of walking by

1291
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,280
like a 50 year old woman who is taller than me,

1292
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,840
which happens probably once every three days,

1293
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,120
on my way to something like that,

1294
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,480
that would ruin me, man.

1295
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,920
- My first girlfriend was, - I'm taking a limo.

1296
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,360
- My first girlfriend, like my ex was like,

1297
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,360
- Way taller than you. - Six foot one.

1298
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,840
- Way, way taller. - My ex was like six foot one.

1299
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,680
- I wonder why it didn't work out, man.

1300
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,800
- Something like that. - Don't do that shit.

1301
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,800
That's not for us. I don't think that's why it didn't work out.

1302
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,800
That's the only reason, man. The only thing, the only time

1303
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,800
when you should be dating somebody who's taller than you, as a man,

1304
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,800
you should be dating someone who's, is if you're very short and they're very tall.

1305
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,800
There's something adorable about that. Well, I was very short compared to her. If somebody's like, if a guy's like

1306
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,800
5'6" and his wife is like 6'2", first of all,

1307
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,800
this guy's cock is, this guy has a absolute

1308
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,320
Giantly fruitcake log cock mm-hmm, right

1309
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:51,600
Do you guys get stuff off of shelves I have to get stuff off of shelves

1310
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:57,600
Are you one time are you forced to get stuff off of shelves that you don't even when you're sitting down on the couch?

1311
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,440
No, I would I am but here's the worst part 90% of the time. I can't reach it

1312
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,920
So then I have to climb up on the counter

1313
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:17,760
Step stool man. There was one time that I did I put something on top of the cabinets like in my in my apartment in Boston

1314
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,720
and I did get I

1315
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:28,460
Did like have to ask my ex to get it if you're tall you can hide stuff on top of cabinets

1316
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:34,200
Yeah shelves that nobody will ever see can be up that you can put anything you want up there

1317
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,120
Your own can top of on top of things. Oh

1318
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,360
See us us five foot nine guys. We have to make a burrow in the house exactly we have to dig into the wood

1319
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:49,920
Pull up a plank and Walter white all of our Reese's pieces

1320
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,520
Into the floorboards and we don't even get to put them in like they don't even get to keep them in the bag

1321
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,640
It has to be loose Reese's pieces under the floorboard

1322
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,320
Yeah, exactly because the bag would make too much noise when you walk over exactly

1323
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:08,700
Yeah, crinkle and then the floorboard is already making too much noise. We can't hide two noises exactly should get wise

1324
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:14,320
Uh-huh. I want to have a tunnel in my house to go somewhere. I wish. I want a tunnel from my

1325
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:19,500
Room to the bathroom so I don't have to walk through the living room and that's called the hallway

1326
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,700
No, but I want it to lead

1327
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,940
directly there I

1328
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,980
Want to have a house where I can press button at the door and it switches to whatever room

1329
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:35,680
Like you know what I mean you know it goes like yeah, and it's like it is the order of the rooms

1330
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:42,220
Like in like monsters honored to I never play it builds a new room. I think that's the game

1331
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,860
I haven't played it either, but I saw I wish that I had a big hamster water bottle next to my bed

1332
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,860
I wish I had a big hamster

1333
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,620
Big hamster and a cat that are connected to my I was had a hamster that was a size of a German Shepherd

1334
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,620
Yeah, I

1335
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,900
Said did you see I kept in a cage in my room? I never let it

1336
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:09,260
Shaking the bars. I throw a blanket over it whenever I'm home because it hears me walking around.

1337
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:17,260
It's trying to kill me. It hates me so much. I just drop mealworms in through the bars.

1338
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:19,260
That's how you're feeding?

1339
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:26,260
And I'm like, yeah, I can't get rid of it. Like, it was my uncle's pet and he died so I have to take care of it.

1340
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,260
A disgusting hamster monster? With human eyes?

1341
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,900
a quarter of the space in my bedroom.

1342
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,740
- Yeah.

1343
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,100
- I have to get rid of my bed and get a twin bed.

1344
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:38,700
- I think you'd like that.

1345
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,500
- It would be nice to be beholden to a demon.

1346
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,020
- Yeah, I think so too.

1347
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,780
Yeah, I think it would be nice to have--

1348
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,340
- That's the experience of at least 50% of dog owners,

1349
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,380
I would say.

1350
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,220
- That's my life.

1351
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,040
I'm beholden to a demon.

1352
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:53,880
- Is what I just described.

1353
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,720
Yeah.

1354
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,640
- A rattling cage that any time I want to not be

1355
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,480
want to not be babysitting something,

1356
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,280
it just screams at me in the most agonizingly terrible,

1357
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,840
and every time I leave, it just has actual human cries

1358
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,440
that I swear to God he's saying,

1359
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,960
"Stop, stop, stop, no, no, no."

1360
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,800
- Who, Phil?

1361
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,640
- Yeah, Phil, whenever I leave the house.

1362
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,460
- No, no, his slave.

1363
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,300
- No, my slave.

1364
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,800
- Yeah, I know, that's why I was asking.

1365
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,640
- Rupert.

1366
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,680
- It's Rupert?

1367
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,500
- Rupert.

1368
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,340
- My friend Rupert?

1369
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,180
- Yeah.

1370
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,000
- My friend Rupert is living in your house.

1371
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,840
- Yeah.

1372
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,960
Well, guys, Christmas is coming up and the four weeks of Christmas, you know what we're

1373
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:40,440
going to do? Executive decision. The four weeks of Christmas is being extended beyond Christmas.

1374
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,280
Just to make up for this week of atheistic laugh.

1375
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,760
I'll take some of the blame for this. I'm sorry for letting my body become weakened,

1376
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,800
but I can tell you guys I feel better already and we're going to have Christmas fun all

1377
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
month.

1378
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,300
- Christmas is, you're not going to fucking believe

1379
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,140
the Christmas shit we have planned.

1380
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,760
- And I'm not letting the devil take me down this year.

1381
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,960
- No way. - No, no, no.

1382
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,800
- No way, no how.

1383
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,480
- And can we do a quick prayer for you?

1384
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,840
Just to get this out of here. - Please, I really do like it.

1385
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,660
- Dear God. - Lay your hands up.

1386
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,980
- Dear God. - Do I have to do it?

1387
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:13,800
- No, you just need to take it. - Who art in heaven?

1388
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,760
- Just shut up. - Hallowed be thy name.

1389
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:21,760
There is a sick, sick boy in our presence.

1390
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,160
- Sick little boy, God.

1391
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,860
- Thank you, Jesus. - He has some kind

1392
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,980
of rare disease that is turning him into a cube.

1393
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:32,440
- Yes, Father. - And is making him stretch,

1394
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:35,680
and we need him to become himself again.

1395
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,680
We need him to turn into just the best he can be.

1396
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,260
We need, and you can do this.

1397
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,560
You're the one who made him sick because of his attitude.

1398
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,540
He had a bad attitude. - Forgive him, Father.

1399
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,440
- Forgive him for his bad attitude.

1400
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,280
He didn't know. - Don't say I had

1401
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:57,640
Attitude don't interrupt the prayer you that's clear you have a bad attitude you're interrupting a Caleb prayer

1402
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:01,000
I don't want to pray anymore you take this dear God this

1403
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,280
Poor sick stupid little boy has turned into a complete monster exercise this demon out of his body Lord in your holy name

1404
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,920
We pray please get this demon out. We want to celebrate Christmas with our buddies in real life, please God

1405
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,120
We have to decorate the entire office and have a Christmas party dear God

1406
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,440
Oh, God mighty in heaven in your hallowed be thy name Jesus Christ

1407
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,280
- Woo!

1408
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,600
Woo!

1409
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,760
I caught the holy ghost at the end there.

1410
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,800
- Dude, I know how to pray, man.

1411
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,640
I learned how to do that in school.

1412
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,720
- Guys, that looks so scary.

1413
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,440
- Yeah, you look like an evil goblin.

1414
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,120
- You look like a painting. - All right, guys.

1415
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:36,760
- God bless you and may Christmas start next week.

1416
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,420
- Yep, and tomorrow night we are at the bell house

1417
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:40,840
with Girl God.

1418
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,680
- Oh, shit.

1419
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,840
- Oh, true. - Get your tickets.

1420
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,580
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1421
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,520
- And never misses. - And I have a special thing

1422
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,840
I'm doing next week that I won't say yet.

1423
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,120
- But you'll see it. - Okay.

1424
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Bye.

1425
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:58,200
Jesus Christ, you look weird.

1426
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,840
If you couldn't tell, we're dressed up like Venus today.

1427
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,920
Although we had some amount of disagreement, I guess, over what color Venus is.

1428
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,520
That's okay, I got both going on.

1429
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,440
You do have both, but what's this black wig about, man?

1430
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,440
Well, we'll go down.

1431
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
You want me to start with my costume?

1432
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
Are you dressed up as Coraline?

1433
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
No.

1434
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,440
I'm dressed up as Venus.

1435
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,640
No, I'm just up as be any if I walked out on the street right now, any person who

1436
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,040
knows literally who attended at first grade would know I'm just as it would be

1437
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,040
some people.

1438
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,640
People think that you were Coraline.

1439
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,740
No, a first grader would look at me and say that's Venus.

1440
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:31,740
No, they would a child who was into science and into movies who would have

1441
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,840
seen movies in a movie.

1442
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,040
Why did you say movies?

1443
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,740
Of course, they'd say Coraline man.

1444
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,340
Well, if it was movies around Halloween time, if they saw me in a costume like

1445
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:41,440
this, they would say Venus.

1446
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,040
They would say that's Coraline.

1447
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,140
She's very pretty today.

1448
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,140
No, they wouldn't say that.

1449
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,140
They would say I like Coraline's mustache.

1450
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,140
Jumping off of pretty here,

1451
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,140
Venus is actually the name of

1452
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,140
the goddess, Venus is named after the goddess

1453
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,140
of beauty and of love.

1454
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,140
So I elected to put on a

1455
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,140
beautiful wig today.

1456
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,140
To show my

1457
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,140
beautiful hair.

1458
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,140
Now we're asking about the yellow raincoat.

1459
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,140
So let me explain this to you. Venus,

1460
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,140
the color can be, some people say it's

1461
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,140
yellow, some people say yellowish white,

1462
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,540
Some people say beige.

1463
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,640
This raincoat is yellow.

1464
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:15,940
Definitely too yellow for Venus.

1465
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,740
Some people at this table would say beige.

1466
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,840
I think two people would.

1467
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,940
Two people would say beige.

1468
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,240
But Venus has...

1469
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,640
It's surrounded by sulfuric clouds.

1470
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,040
It has a sulfurous atmosphere,

1471
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,240
which is why it's that color.

1472
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,140
And in the upper atmosphere,

1473
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,540
constantly acid rain.

1474
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,540
Oh.

1475
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:33,340
Wow.

1476
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,640
Wait.

1477
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,740
So you dressed up like Coraline

1478
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,040
because of rain.

1479
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,040
So that's the yellow.

1480
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,540
It's the yellow acid rain.

1481
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,840
And then I have a yellowish white shirt here.

1482
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
Uh-huh.

1483
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,840
This is kind of closer to the color I feel.

1484
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,840
You're dressed up like Cora Lane.

1485
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,840
Dude, chill. I'm dressed up as Venus.

1486
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,840
I don't know why you guys are stuck on this.

1487
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,840
I don't look anything like Coraline.

1488
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
You pull up a picture of Coraline, it's going to look completely different from what I'm wearing right now.

1489
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,840
I said Coraline though.

1490
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
That's not, then you said a nonsense word and you're proud of that.

1491
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,840
You're proud of making up a word.

1492
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,840
(Laughter)

1493
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,840
That's you, man.

1494
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
I don't know what you're talking about, guys.

1495
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,860
talking about. I didn't try to dress up like this. Oh, no, wait, no. She has

1496
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:14,480
blue hair.

1497
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,480
(Mario sound effects)
