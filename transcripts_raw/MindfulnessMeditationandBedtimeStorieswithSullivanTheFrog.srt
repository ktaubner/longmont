1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, hi everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Um, so uh, I'm gonna, this is something for you to listen to at night when you're getting,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
you're having trouble sleeping.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And, which happens to me sometimes, because my stomach, I got kind of a sensitive stomach.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And sometimes the guys will make me eat stuff that I don't really want to eat, like, um,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,720
like lint

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,400
and pieces of wood and so then my stomach gets all upset

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,480
because I got a sensitive stomach so

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,480
um... why did I start talking about that?

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,440
oh yeah I have trouble going to sleep sometimes and so if you're somebody who has

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
trouble going to sleep

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,960
then this is for you. This is for you to listen to, to help you sort of get your mind right

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,800
Um, uh, really, uh, uh, try to, um, be in your body.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,680
And, um, so we're gonna start with a little, a little mindfulness, sort of meditation.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,360
And then from there, uh, I'm gonna tell you a little story.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,000
And then, uh, hopefully, hopefully, not even by the end of this, hopefully by, by the middle of it, right?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,720
Like, like when you're just hanging out and stuff, or listening to me and stuff, you fall asleep before, before even,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,600
It even ends, because then I know it worked.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
So yeah, let's start with some mindfulness.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,060
Um, okay.

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,320
Hold on, I just gotta get...

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,100
I gotta get a...

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,440
I got a little bug lit here.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,060
Okay.

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,100
Um...

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,440
So, uh, um...

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Okay.

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:03,280
So start

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,920
by settling into a comfortable position.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,560
For me that's a lily pad. Allow your eyes to

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,600
close or keep them open with a...

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,600
that seems confusing. Or keep them open with a softened gaze.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,920
Start taking some long

34
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,920
slow deep breaths. Okay go on Mike.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,120
you know and so I settle into that and then on

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,320
what you and really really pay attention to how you're breathing

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,760
so like I breathe through my skin and stuff

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,640
so you if you breathe through your nose and your mouth you you should focus on that

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,360
focus on how it goes in and then

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,320
when it goes out okay

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,080
and also notice where your mind wanders to so if like you start thinking about

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,480
Going to the bathroom. Well, you should probably go to the bathroom.

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,640
You don't have to. Yeah, go to the bathroom.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,560
Actually wait. Yeah, hold on. I'll wait. You go to the bathroom.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,760
I mean you could actually just pause. I don't want to

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,200
wait. But if you might want to go somewhere else like you're thinking about your job or

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,160
your best friends and where they are and

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,600
why they told you to record this, then stop.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,720
Or just pay attention like oh, where's it going? It's going over there, then go okay.

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Now I know that I often think about how

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Sometimes I'm confused about what I have to do from day to day to keep my friends happy

52
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
And I know I think about that so I can you know

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,320
avoid that

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Okay, great

55
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,840
now

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,880
Now start relaxing. Imagine it from your toes

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,200
Imagine your toes getting relaxed and then keep going up your body. So then that's your foot and your ankle and

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,660
Well, then you got you got your calf and then your knee and your thighs

59
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,600
and

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
your parts

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,700
You got your stuff if you have stuff or if you got the stuff area

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,480
and then

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,560
Hold on let me look at my I guess okay

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Then it's my stomach.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,480
What about your backside? Hold on.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:42,800
Doesn't say the like, because I said calf, but really that could, that shit was supposed to be shin.

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,280
It's like where do I,

68
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,200
where does it start then? Because, because I don't, if I just relax my front side I'm gonna freak out.

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,900
Because then I'm like, oh no, where's, my backside's feeling crazy.

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,660
Okay, yeah, and when you when you're ready open your eyes

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,800
And come back for I skipped ahead now telling you how to wake up. Why is this tough?

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,320
All right, I was gonna go to the story

73
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,920
Okay

74
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,560
So if that didn't work nothing that didn't calm you down which happens, you know

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Try listening to this story. I'm gonna tell you

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Once upon a time there was a

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,520
Little

78
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
cat and

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,640
His name was Stuart

80
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,740
little and

81
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,440
He was not the mouse though the mouse is a different guy in another story is a cat named that

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,220
and he really

83
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,260
wanted to

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,600
Drink some milk, but there wasn't any milk around so

85
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,280
First thing he did is he went to the milkman and he said, "Hey Mr. Milkman, you got any milk for me?"

86
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,280
And then the milkman said, "Yeah, of course." And so he gave him the milk.

87
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,800
That's good.

88
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,240
So now that he's got the milk, so he goes, "Okay, that's awesome. Let me go

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,040
back home." And so Stewart goes home, but when he's going home, okay, yeah,

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,880
danger.

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Danger happens.

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,880
These three other cats who are much bigger, they come up to him and they go

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
"I see you got some milk there, Stuart"

94
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,880
And Stuart says "Yes, I love this milk"

95
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
And the three other cats say "Well, we're gonna take the milk from you"

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
"If that's cool"

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
And Stuart's like "Yeah, that's fine, I mean, can I have some of it?"

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
And they're like "Yeah, that's no problem, we'll share it"

99
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
"How's that?"

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
And then they agree

101
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
They agree on sharing it

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,960
on sharing it and so the four of them now are sharing the milk.

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:10,080
And so then, but then, a beautiful, a beautiful other cat that's very beautiful, like a woman

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:19,080
walks by and she says hello and keeps walking.

105
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay yeah

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,720
and then out of nowhere three

107
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,040
other guys come up and their names are Roy, Blitters

108
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,280
and Patrick.

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,600
And they come up to the cat, the four cats that are hanging out and they're like

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,440
where's Sullivan? And then the cats

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,920
go who is Sullivan?

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,880
and those three guys go never mind you are just four cats

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,440
we're gonna keep going but if you see Sullivan tell him we love him

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,480
and the cats say yeah we can do that

115
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,200
and they're like okay we're gonna go find our best friend Sullivan and tell him we love him

116
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,280
and so the cats are done with the milk now

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,080
and the three bigger cats go

118
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
Thank you for sharing the milk, take it easy

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,560
And he got the other cat, Stewart goes no problem man

120
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
No problem guys, you guys take it easy too

121
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,600
And so Stewart's going home and he's

122
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,960
He's got a belly full of milk

123
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,720
And then

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:40,320
Then there's a

125
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,160
He gets home

126
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,160
and he lays down on his couch

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,160
and he's going good to be home

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:58,160
with a belly full of milk

129
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,960
but then he gets a call from the doctor

130
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,600
and the doctor says Stuart you have cancer

131
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
oh man that's way too dark

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I don't know.

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,080
I was trying to come up with conflict.

134
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,200
The doctor calls and says, "Stuart, you have to come in for an appointment because you might

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
have cancer.

136
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
But we're pretty sure that it's all good."

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,120
"Yeah, all right.

138
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
That's fine."

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
And Stuart goes, "Okay, let me come in."

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,880
And Stuart goes in the doctor and he's in the waiting room.

141
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,120
There's all kinds of people around that Stuart's very nice to and they are very nice back to

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
him.

143
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,760
goes doctor what's that tell me what's happening I'm really worried that I have

144
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,720
cancer doctor says we just double-checked you don't got it and so

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
Stuart breathes a sigh of relief he's like okay that's awesome thank you so

146
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,520
much doctor and doctor says no problem however and Stuart goes what's up

147
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:09,400
Doc says, "However, there is a lost crystal deep inside Mariana's trench and you need

148
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:24,760
to swim down there and retrieve it or else the Dark Wizard, Math, is going to hurt everyone."

149
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,080
and the cat, Stuart, goes

150
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,640
then I will have to do that. Thank you so much. And so Stuart goes and

151
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,160
he goes to his nearest scuba instructor

152
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,520
and he says, Maria

153
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,400
can you help me? I need to go all the way down to Marietta's Trench.

154
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,880
I need to get the lost crystal and if I don't get it

155
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,520
then Matt is gonna just hurt everybody

156
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:59,160
And Maria says, "Okay, but it's not going to be easy.

157
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:06,120
While you are a cat, so you hate water, you are also very brave.

158
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,240
So I think you can do it."

159
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,000
And so then Stuart and Maria start working together.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,360
Maria's getting him really good at swimming very far down.

161
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,600
And he goes pretty far down.

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
And as he gets about 30 feet down one day.

163
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,160
And Marie is like, "That's very good."

164
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:33,680
So just for reference though, just so you know, while 30 feet is really good, Mariana's Trench

165
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,360
is about 10,000 or about 11,000 meters.

166
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,240
So that's like 36,000 feet.

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,960
So we're going to need you to go a lot deeper.

168
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,200
And so then the cat, Stuart, is like, "I don't know what to do.

169
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,180
I can't even imagine going down that deep.

170
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,260
What do you think I can do to make it easier?

171
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,660
Maria said, I didn't want to suggest this because you were paying for the lessons, but

172
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,420
we've grown very close, and so I don't want you to feel like I'm ripping you off, but

173
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,300
you're going to have to get a submarine.

174
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,220
And he goes, and Stuart goes, great, where can I find one though?

175
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,760
Maria says you're gonna have to go to the store to buy a submarine.

176
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,340
And Stuart goes okay. And so he goes to the store.

177
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,560
But first he goes to the milkman because as we established earlier about his

178
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,300
character

179
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,420
he very much likes milk so he's drinking the milk and then he's gotta go to the

180
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:32,920
store.

181
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,900
So he heads over to the store to the sub- where the

182
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,860
it's not like a store where they sell submarines. He's gotta build it.

183
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,780
He has to build it together. So first actually he doesn't go to the store.

184
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,340
Sorry, sorry about that. He does not go to the store first. First he goes to his engineering friend

185
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,320
Rick and he says Rick I need to build a submarine

186
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,260
And I need to go to the store to get parts. Can you come with me?

187
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Cuz it's gonna be very difficult otherwise

188
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,180
For me to figure out how to build this thing and Rick goes. Hey, man, you seen the news lately?

189
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:11,900
That'd be crazy. That doesn't go where you should go to the government and tell them you need the submarine or like a

190
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,340
defense contractor, somebody.

191
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,220
And Stuart said I don't have time for that. I need to just build it myself.

192
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,940
And Rick insisted that it would take less time to do that.

193
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,940
If you could prove how dangerous the crystal was, I'm sure you could get resources for it.

194
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,220
And Stuart said, Rick, you are way too uptight about this.

195
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,940
I just figured out how to introduce conflict into a story and I really need this to keep going.

196
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,820
Why are you fighting me on this? And so Rick goes I'm not fighting you on this

197
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:49,220
I'm trying to make sure that there's some you know realism here, you know, I mean you're a cat

198
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm a guy I think

199
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,960
So, I don't know what you're gonna want from this cuz cuz this is already off the rails like like

200
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Let's try to just have something to hold on to and then Stuart says well if I'm already a cat and you're a guy

201
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,560
What are we holding on to why are we even stressing about that?

202
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,940
You know, it's just the final points right and then Rick goes look

203
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:18,880
It's just about just just get through this part right? Leave me alone. Go to the store here. Here's a list

204
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,780
Here's a list of stuff

205
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,600
I told you to get and if you need to bring me back you can in the story

206
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,620
But try not to because you've you've created this sort of avatar

207
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
That's gonna

208
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,620
to critique yourself

209
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,620
and it's a very bad scene

210
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,620
it's gonna be very bad for you

211
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
Stuart

212
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
and Stuart's at the store

213
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
and he's getting all kinds of submarine parts

214
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
he's getting the tubes

215
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,620
he's getting the siding of it

216
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,620
the submarine

217
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620
with the metal siding for it

218
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,620
and uh

219
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
he's, then he goes

220
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,620
back to his home

221
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,620
and with the milk

222
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:04,380
got me rock while he was doing this and he starts putting together the submarine and

223
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,260
he turns on the TV because he doesn't want to just do that by himself.

224
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:15,460
You know he wants something to own at the same time and he sees a commercial for this guy

225
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:27,100
Luciano and he's a professional explorer and Stuart says oh man I got to tell this guy about

226
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,580
this because I'm just a cat and I've just been given this very difficult task

227
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,820
because the information my doctor told me about so maybe I'll talk to this guy

228
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,620
Luciano I mean he's gonna he'll help me learn how to explore so let me give him

229
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,980
a call he's got a 1-800 number on the television I'm looking at so I know I

230
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,860
can call him and so let me give him a call and so Stuart goes to

231
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:17,100
was

232
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,220
Doctor and that's a bit. Yeah, there's a lot of things he already did. I don't have to worry about that

233
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,860
so he goes to his phone and

234
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,260
He goes to it and he calls the 1-800 number for Luciano

235
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,260
And he says hello, it's me Stuart. I'm here to talk to Luciano

236
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,660
and there's of course there's somebody the line is like one moment, please and

237
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,060
So Stuart waits a little bit and then Luciano picks up the phone and he goes hello to you Stuart

238
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,380
My name is Luciano. I'm an amazing explorer. What do you need? And Stuart told him the whole thing. He said look

239
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,020
There's a there's like some kind of gem at the bottom of the Marianas Trench

240
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,860
And we got to get it before Matt does

241
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,380
And so then the guy goes that's okay, let me help you out with that in that case

242
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,080
Why don't you come to my office? It's

243
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,860
one two three

244
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,240
Street

245
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
And let's just come on back

246
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,220
and so

247
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,340
Well one two three party Street because I'm always about partying. I love to party and I love to explore. It's actually sorry

248
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,420
It's actually one two three explore Street

249
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,740
Come on back. And so Stuart comes back

250
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,380
He knocks he gets milk when he goes out and he gets it and he goes and then he goes back to the store

251
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,080
as well to get more submarine parts and then he goes to

252
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,940
Luciano's yeah, and so he goes to Luciano's

253
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,500
He knocks on the door

254
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,660
Luciano opens up he goes come here and then he goes in Luciano's house and he got on the wall. It's like

255
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,740
Again, like a big squid he attacked on the wall. He's got like a picture of him

256
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,700
In the desert with the gold and he's got a picture of him

257
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,820
also with the Dalai Lama and with Alec Baldwin and also

258
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,620
Obama

259
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,980
And so then Stuart goes wow you've met a lot of very important murderers

260
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:29,780
Luciano says

261
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,660
Luciano says

262
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,600
Pay no mind to that. There's lots we have to do today my friend

263
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,220
Tell me more about this

264
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,380
journey

265
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,560
And Stuart doesn't really know much more about it than when he already told him over the phone

266
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,960
So it's sort of kind of a moot point and Luciano goes. Okay, no problem

267
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,020
Let's see. You've already started building the submarine. That's great

268
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,260
That's a really good start and you should be proud of yourself and don't let anybody tell you otherwise

269
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,900
however

270
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,820
It's not gonna be enough

271
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,620
so

272
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,140
I'm gonna need to get my team together, and they're gonna be the best of the best and

273
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,020
Also, they really did intelligent and they've got your back, so don't worry about anything

274
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:25,580
Let's let's do it and so first to go to get Maria the scuba instructor from earlier in the story

275
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,820
And he goes Maria. I just do it goes Maria

276
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,700
I didn't know you were part of Luciano's team.

277
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,180
And Maria goes, of course I am.

278
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,940
Why do you think I know how to dive and stuff?

279
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,740
I gotta know how to do that if I'm gonna be an explorer.

280
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
That doesn't make sense.

281
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
That's sort of a backwards.

282
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,260
And then they go to Rick's place.

283
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,620
And Zurich goes, Rick, I didn't know you were part of Luciano's team also.

284
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,860
And Rick goes, of course, how else am I gonna build everything?

285
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,580
I gotta build everything to be a part of the explorer.

286
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,460
I did the logic backwards, but you get it.

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,500
Like, they knew Luciano, and now they're with Luciano and Stuart.

288
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
And then finally, they get the last guy.

289
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,340
And it's Doug.

290
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,740
No, no, I'm tired.

291
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,940
Let me come up with a different one.

292
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,540
I liked Luciano. That was fun.

293
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,060
His name is...

294
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,660
Her name...

295
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,180
Is...

296
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,340
Macchiato.

297
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,960
No, it's coffee. Okay name is

298
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,380
Balthazar and he and he

299
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,220
Is a

300
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:49,300
Magic

301
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:56,220
Me opposite light wizard he's the light wizard and Matt's a dark one

302
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,700
And so we gotta go find Balthazar because he's gonna be able to in the final battle naturally

303
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,660
we're gonna need them to fight so and

304
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,000
Luciano said this guy and I've known Balthazar for a long time

305
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
He can just about beat anybody

306
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,260
In a magic fight so he's gonna be great but to get to him

307
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,580
We're gonna need to break him out even though he's a very good wizard and kind but he's also

308
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,720
mistaken from for crimes and so we're gonna for

309
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Murder, and so we're gonna need to break him out of murder prison

310
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,940
and

311
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,340
And luckily for us we got the gang all here we got me the mastermind we got

312
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,280
Rick who can build stuff and we got Maria who can dive

313
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,460
And then we got used to it. And so it's like me. Well, what can I do?

314
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,900
and

315
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:09,100
Luciano says you are the key to it all to be revealed to you soon

316
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,140
Let's go

317
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,620
To prison first though. So we're going to prison we get to prison now. We get to they get to prison

318
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,020
And Stuart's like, "This is maximum security! How are we gonna do this?"

319
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,940
And, and, um, Luciano looks around and he says, "Okay,

320
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,220
we're gonna have to do this a couple fronts.

321
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,180
First, Maria, you're gonna dive into the sewer system

322
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,820
and use it to, um,

323
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,020
get inside the prison, after which you will steal a guard's

324
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:45,140
uniform and you will say, 'I'm taking this prisoner for a walk.'

325
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,340
and you wink and then you take out Balthazar

326
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,740
and you bring him outside

327
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,300
of the prison and then Brick's like okay well then what am I gonna do? Sounds like she's doing

328
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,100
everything and then Luciano says

329
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,860
oh you would think that because of what everything I just said

330
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,100
but what I didn't say was that

331
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,460
the only way that she's gonna be able to

332
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,380
get out of the prison completely is if you

333
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,380
undo the technological

334
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,060
powers on the doors because then that's gonna let her out with

335
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,300
a prisoner even if she dresses a guard that doesn't make sense so

336
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,260
you're gonna have to hack into the system because you not only build submarines

337
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,500
and source parts at a Home Depot but you also are an amazing hacker

338
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,340
so you're gonna have to do that and then Stuart goes but what am I gonna do

339
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,380
and he says, Luciano says Stuart

340
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,380
you are going to go into the prison and also be a prisoner.

341
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,540
And so that you can tell Balthazar what's happening.

342
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,740
So he's in on the plan before Maria gets there.

343
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,780
Cause otherwise he might, if like Maria takes him,

344
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,940
she might not have a chance to say something to him.

345
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,900
Like, Hey, I'm actually going to break you out of here.

346
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,980
Or he might think, or I think it'd be cool

347
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,620
if you're in the prison too.

348
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,160
Then Stuart says, "Okay."

349
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,760
And so Stuart

350
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,660
goes to the milkman and he says, "Look, I don't usually want to do this,

351
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,080
but I need to steal the milk from you so I can go to prison and save a good

352
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,000
wizard

353
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,720
so I can go through the Mariana Trench and get a gem."

354
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,880
And the milkman says, "That's fine with me. Just make sure, if you can, bring the milk back

355
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,460
when you're out of prison

356
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,660
or even before that, bring it back. Bring it back way before. Actually, can you

357
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:46,940
take the milk, I will call the cops on you and then in a panic you can give me the

358
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,500
milk back that can be the plan and Stuart's like okay it's a good idea

359
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,420
they do that cops come they're like we got your cat and they throw the cat in

360
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,060
prison he's got the uniform on he looks like a prisoner and the prisoners are

361
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,700
like who's this cat who's this guy and Stuart's like it's me I'm Stuart I was

362
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:21,700
called

363
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,660
is the wizard Balthazar. He is in here for things we don't even know.

364
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,460
Apparently it was so bad he sits all alone at lunch.

365
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,500
And Stuart says, "I'll sit with him." And they go, "Whoa, hold on. He's not very cool though."

366
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,340
And Stuart says, "Hey man, what's being cool when we're all in jail?"

367
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,180
And the guy said, "That's a good point, but okay, good luck, 'cause you're gonna be a

368
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,620
loser." And then so then

369
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,060
he goes over there, Stuart goes over there and says, "Hey, who are you, Balthazar?"

370
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
*laughs*

371
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Balthazar says, "You just said..."

372
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,060
*laughs*

373
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:00,060
Balth...

374
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Balthazar says, "You... I mean...

375
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
Come on...

376
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,060
I mean, you just said my name,

377
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,060
so I know you know who I am."

378
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,060
Oh man, I really...

379
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,060
Can I do that again?

380
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Let me just do that again, right? Okay.

381
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,560
Hold on.

382
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:23,900
So Stuart saunters over to the lunch table where Balthazar is.

383
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,040
And he says...

384
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,480
Excuse me.

385
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,440
And he says, "Balthazar, I know who you are."

386
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,640
And his voice gets really quiet so nobody can hear.

387
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,480
He says, "I'm breaking you out of here."

388
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,920
I'm taking you out of the prison.

389
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm taking you out of the prison.

390
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
I'm taking you out of the prison.

391
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,920
And Balthazar goes

392
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Okay, that's awesome.

393
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
I have magic spells I can use

394
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
but they took away my magic powers

395
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
when they threw me in the prison.

396
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,920
So if you're going to take me out of here, that's fine.

397
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
But just know that I don't even have magic right now.

398
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,920
So we're going to need to get my magic back.

399
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
So we're going to need to get my magic back.

400
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
And then Stuart goes,

401
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Okay, that's fine, but where's your magic?

402
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,920
do magic.

403
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Balthazar says it's deep in Marianas Trench.

404
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,920
And then, um, nah that's stupid it can't be in the same place.

405
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Hold on, let me, let me.

406
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Balthazar says it's, it's behind.

407
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
No.

408
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh, I got a good idea.

409
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,920
And Balthazar says, well, I left it in the parking lot.

410
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,920
No, that wasn't even the idea.

411
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,920
That just, I got nervous.

412
00:27:42,920 --> 00:28:00,840
But what if Barthasar left it with his former lover and her name is...

413
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Felicia.

414
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,120
Hey, so my bad, but I realized that I called her Felicia.

415
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,880
I think there's probably a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense, but this is something

416
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,040
I noticed when I was listening again for sure that I did change her name to I think Cassandra.

417
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
I'm pretty sure.

418
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,620
So I think it went from Felicia to Cassandra.

419
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,720
So that's the same character.

420
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
So I'm sorry.

421
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Bye bye.

422
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:37,220
Felicia and Felicia took his magic in the divorce.

423
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,480
So now he's got to get his magic back.

424
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,760
legally it does belong to her so hmm

425
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,480
that's that's pretty tough

426
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,040
thing but but yeah I think it's fine

427
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,440
yeah so she's got it she took in divorce so

428
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,360
we have to talk to her her and she's really she's really only talking to me

429
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
through lawyers now so

430
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,320
I'm gonna have to talk to my lawyer

431
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,600
and Stuart said okay okay this is boring though so we gotta keep going

432
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,240
And so Maria meanwhile is swimming through the sewers

433
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
blub blub blub blub blub blub blub blub

434
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
and she gets to

435
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,240
the grate that's gonna let her into the prison

436
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
however it is locked

437
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
and so she's like oh no I'm not drowning

438
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
blub blub blub blub blub blub blub

439
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
she forgot to bring a scuba gear

440
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
so she brought a scuba gear

441
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
she's not drowning she's like oh no this is locked

442
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
but then behind her

443
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
is a shark, not a shark but like

444
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,240
some kind of sea

445
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,520
I know behind her is a magic sea monster a little guy and

446
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,680
You've got a symbol on his head and it says M for Matt

447
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,720
And so she knows it's oh, no, it's from Matt the dark wizard

448
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,040
He must know on his tail and so he has sent this sea monster. It's not that big

449
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,440
It's like it's big enough that I can fit in like the sewer thing that she's swimming through the like pipes

450
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,840
But it's certainly certainly big enough that it is a formidable foe

451
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:10,300
So she presses on her wrist communicator which she got from Luciano

452
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,780
Luciano we got trouble here

453
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,000
Well, not true. It's like it'll be fine. You don't have to worry

454
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,560
No, she doesn't say she says she said Luciano we got trouble here

455
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:28,500
There's a fish summoned by man and he's gonna attack me. Also, it's locked. So I'm a little worried and Luciano says

456
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,540
Okay, good. Thank you for telling me Rick and Rick goes

457
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,980
I'm on it. So Rick changes course on the computer where he was gonna hack a different thing. He says I got it

458
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,740
If I'm gonna hack this thing, it's gonna make hacking the door later difficult. Louisiana says doesn't matter

459
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,040
We got to get our friend out of there and Rick goes you got it boss. That makes sense to me

460
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,520
And so he's hacking the door. Meanwhile, she's fighting off the fish and then we go back now. We're going back

461
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,220
to Stewart and Balthazar and

462
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,020
Stewart's like

463
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,220
Okay, so how are we gonna get you out of here then?

464
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
Umm...

465
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,020
Oh, no, Stuart doesn't say that.

466
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,220
Balthazar says, "How are you gonna get me out of here then?"

467
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,220
Stuart says, "Well, I've got a friend who's gonna help get you out of here."

468
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,220
And then Balthazar says, "How are you gonna get out of here?"

469
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
And Stuart says...

470
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
Oh, man. Um...

471
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,220
I guess, uh, she's probably gonna get both of us out of here.

472
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Otherwise, I'll probably get off in good behavior.

473
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,720
But she's probably gonna get both--

474
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,220
She's gonna get both of us out of here.

475
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,860
what she told me earlier so don't worry about it and so Balthazar is like

476
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:42,900
okay so what's going on and Sue says I'm not much

477
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,460
than Balthazar hold on sorry this is not they then go back to the prison cell and

478
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:55,700
we go back to the to the fight yeah and this hacking going on

479
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,420
Rick's trying to hack in and Luciano's like you gotta go faster man this not

480
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:03,980
to be good and then Rick goes I'm trying I'm trying but there's so many different

481
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,820
firewalls and attacks and so then Maria goes there's a lot of firewalls and

482
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,420
attacks out there and so she's trying to fight off the fish and and eventually she

483
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,940
gets a hand she puts a hand and slaps in the face just bops it and the fish goes

484
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:25,260
ah and it's really getting mad now so she's getting really worried and so

485
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,740
So the fish is coming to charge her and she's about to probably gonna bite him.

486
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,940
Probably gonna bite her.

487
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,980
But then the door opens and the hack has been completed.

488
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,180
And Luciana goes "Maria now!

489
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Go!

490
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
Hurry!"

491
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,580
And so she swims up to the door and the door is closing as the fish is coming towards her.

492
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,380
And Luciana's like "Rick make the door close!"

493
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,620
And Rick's like "I'm trying but I have to do reverse coding combinations."

494
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,940
and then it happens and she's found in the doors closed so it's okay

495
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,060
and she now is in the prison okay

496
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,780
and um...

497
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,500
hmm

498
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,980
and now she gotta get the guard uniform

499
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,540
so she goes in and she's like she's a communicator

500
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:15,660
and she goes Luciano I'm here you have the blueprints of the whole place right?

501
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,740
and he goes of course I do

502
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,020
so you gotta have to go left right and then up and then left again

503
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
and she's like perfect and so she does that

504
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,540
she does that basically but then she gets stopped

505
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,700
and God sees her and she goes "hey who are you?"

506
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,300
"you're not in uniform for the prisoners"

507
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,500
and she's like "uh oh I'm being compromised"

508
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,260
and then at the same time

509
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,500
Stuart Balthazar walking by back from lunch

510
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,100
and Stuart goes "I've got an idea"

511
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,820
and he starts going "meow meow" to the cat

512
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,340
And so the guy's like, "Who let this cat in prison?"

513
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,300
And so then she slips away, and Stuart runs away, and the guard's chasing him now.

514
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:03,540
And then, Stuart leads the guard to a closet,

515
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,300
and Maria comes in and she knocks him out,

516
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,340
puts on his uniform, and she and Stuart come out of the closet now,

517
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,420
and she tells Stuart, "You have to go, 'cause you're a cat."

518
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,780
And now everyone knows you're a cat, which was...

519
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,500
so you gotta go and so it's like okay but the first things gotta happen

520
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,980
I guess I made him a cat again. I mean not that he wasn't a cat

521
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,980
just...

522
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,900
yeah and so he goes okay

523
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,420
I can't get out of here though because I am also in prison

524
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,260
so why don't I instead sit on your head

525
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,900
and act like a hairdo and she goes

526
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,660
That is crazy enough to work, right?

527
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,780
And so then he does that.

528
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,260
And now she's got cat hair, kind of like a cat hair.

529
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,580
Like it looks, it doesn't really look like anything good, but it looks fine enough.

530
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,460
And she's really smart at like being like, this is just my hair.

531
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,380
So don't worry about it.

532
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,860
You know, it's like, somebody tries to tell you, you better stop making fun of me.

533
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,820
She can go or like, or somebody goes like, I'm, I'm making fun of you.

534
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,340
That's what I meant.

535
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:14,580
Yeah.

536
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,100
Someone's going like, I'm making fun of you.

537
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,220
she goes like I know what you are but what am I right you know so it's done

538
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:29,380
deal done deal so now she's she's got the wizard now and Luciano's like okay you

539
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,500
now you know where to go you gotta go left right left and then you need to

540
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,620
tell the guard at the door that you've taken this prisoner out for a yard break

541
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,260
and then you got to make a run for it cuz Rick's gonna have the gates open but

542
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,540
only hold it open for a certain amount of time because of the way that the

543
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,700
computers and the technology involved are doing things with the codes and the

544
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,660
doors. She's like that makes sense yes and so she goes to do that

545
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,580
she's got Balthazar to it says to her that's Balthazar by the way he goes

546
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,780
hello and then they get to the garden the garden she says look here this is

547
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,220
you know she says the thing they're in the prison yard now right okay and so

548
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
So Luciano's like, "Okay, ready now!"

549
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:17,220
And Rick hits the button that starts the coding, or opens the door.

550
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Through the code, through computers, and the door starts to open.

551
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,220
And the guards are like, "What's going on?"

552
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
And she's making a break for it with Balthazar.

553
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
And now she's like, "Balthazar, you gotta run too!"

554
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,220
And Balthazar, before she was like, kinda holding him like a prisoner,

555
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,220
but now she and him are both running.

556
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,220
And Stuart even hops off her head and is starting to dart around like a cat.

557
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,220
And now all three of them are going forward.

558
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
And then Stuart, um...

559
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Uh, the door's closing, Stuart slips in very easily because he's a cat.

560
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:53,220
And then Balthazar and Maria are going, but Balthazar trips on his wizard robe.

561
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,220
I'm...

562
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,220
I know he's wearing a uniform, but he trips on his wiz- it's just like a...

563
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,220
It's like they knew he'd be comfortable in it.

564
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,220
'Cause if you think about it, like, you know, you're not trying to like hurt nobody.

565
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
I guess some people are really bad in prisons.

566
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
But I mean if I had it

567
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
If I, like, you're gonna, maybe it's

568
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Maybe, well maybe they're just like, they wanted to make him comfortable

569
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
So he would get used to it so he wouldn't cause problems.

570
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
Yeah, that's kind of like a, that's kind of nasty.

571
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
That's kind of a mean reason.

572
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
To make him wear the robe.

573
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
But like still be like a thing that

574
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
So he's wearing the robe

575
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
But the robe also has the prison straps on it.

576
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
And so you know he's a wizard.

577
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
That's right, okay.

578
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
They did that so they want everyone to know, that guy's a wizard, be careful.

579
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,660
be careful but then he didn't have magic they didn't know that but they were like

580
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,460
that guy what that guy's a wizard so he's wearing the prisoner prisoner wizard

581
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,220
robe and so he trips on his robe and the doors about to close and Maria's all

582
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:53,220
the other side she's like no and then Stuart goes Balthazar you gotta hurry

583
00:37:53,220 --> 00:38:07,220
And so then, um, Balthazar, uh, uses his robe as a lasso.

584
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:13,220
He like, he ropes it up and he tosses it, exposing his body, which is fine.

585
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,720
I don't know where I even fixated on that.

586
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,000
And then it's grabbed by the rest of the gang and they go "Pull!" and they yank him because

587
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Because the robe is also tied to his...

588
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Because it's a wizard robe, but...

589
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,500
It's got like a cloak part, and so then they grab it and they pull him in.

590
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Okay, there we go, alright?

591
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Okay, so then they got him and then they get away.

592
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,000
And so now it's...

593
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,500
They're back together, the gang, and they're like, "Okay."

594
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,000
"Balthazar, we gotta find your ex-wife so we can get your magic powers back."

595
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,500
And Balthazar says, "That's gonna be difficult."

596
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,000
"Because we're only talking to our lawyers."

597
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And so Luciano says, "Okay, so probably then what we're gonna have to do is...

598
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You guys are on really bad terms then, huh?"

599
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And he's like, "Yes, very bad."

600
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And he said, "Well, what do you know about... Where can we find her though? Maybe I can talk to her."

601
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Said Stuart, the main guy, main character, Cat.

602
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
He's also a person. He says, "Maybe I can talk to her."

603
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Balthasar says, "Okay, if you say so."

604
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
She works as a...

605
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Um...

606
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hmm... Oh, she works as

607
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
a...

608
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
researcher at the...

609
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
um... the Institute for

610
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,960
magical studies we met when we were both going to school there

611
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,560
and they said oh the one the one on Main Street yes

612
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,280
and so you can go there Stuart but I wouldn't even bring me up because

613
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,960
it was really very acrimonious um you know we just it was

614
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,720
just at the end you know lots of sniping really just getting on each other's nerves

615
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,840
it was very difficult

616
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm just glad we didn't have

617
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,280
kids because you know that could be very

618
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,160
challenging

619
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,720
and so it's and also glad you can have kids i mean that you put maybe would be

620
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,140
nice for you to have it so still goes to the any meets her

621
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,560
he says hello

622
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,240
uh...

623
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,880
both as i was wife

624
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,400
cassandra swan of that's an embarrassing so he does not say he says hello miss

625
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
cassandra

626
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,160
uses yes who who is it

627
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,200
didn't mean it my name is stewart i'm here to talk to you about magic

628
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,240
she said it will you have the right places into medical research in

629
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,480
"Stuart, girls, we need some help. Are you happen to be a wizard of some kind?"

630
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,840
And she said, "No, I'm simply a researcher. I never practiced the arts. I found them to be dangerous.

631
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,680
Far too dangerous, in fact. Though I studied them, not to better understand them, so that we can

632
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,600
stop them from hurting other people." I think, you know, and he said, and Stuart

633
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,400
thinks to himself, "I see now why this was difficult, because they had different philosophies on

634
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,280
on what should happen with magic and so Stuart says well

635
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,280
we need your help because there's a dark wizard who's trying to get a crystal

636
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,360
at the bottom of the Mariana's Trench

637
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,080
and we need somebody who understands

638
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,780
the dark wizard's magics so we can prevent him from doing stuff

639
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:32,000
and she said that's actually that's like a perfect marriage of my interests

640
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,900
and

641
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,360
the kind of like and um... my my skills and

642
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,120
up and still it makes a perfect marriage from

643
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,400
uh... and then she she comes to the loose luciano's hot he has a high now by

644
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,040
the way luciano it was just like is a been there was like a department i think

645
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,360
there was a secretary i said earlier but

646
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,240
but it's also like a hideout and sky gadgets and he's got like a little area

647
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
for the submarine

648
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,240
and he goes there

649
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,120
which and still it leads leads her there

650
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,360
and she says

651
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,760
all not this guy again to she sees both is our involves i goes to it i told you

652
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:13,080
don't this is very bad now. Stuart says you guys need to just be calm and be

653
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,900
friends for a minute because we have bigger things going on and Stuart he

654
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,560
gets up on the table and he says there's a lot of people who could be hurt if

655
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,920
Matt gets this crystal so I don't want to hear about you your petty differences I

656
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,600
mean I don't mean to minimize them you know I mean you know I look at marriage

657
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,640
is very difficult I hear I've never been in a relationship myself I saw a girl

658
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,600
Girl Cat once, but other than that, um, diving there, I guess that doesn't...

659
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,440
There are just more important things, and I need you guys to get along right now.

660
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,200
And Luciano looks at Stewie and thinks, "That could be my protege."

661
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,540
And they sort of nod in agreement.

662
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,280
They're all bigger things. That they always agreed on. It was magic always.

663
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,720
Just different feelings about it, right?

664
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,920
Oh, that's cooking. This is really cooking now. Okay.

665
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,180
And so then Luciano says, "Alright, well, we got the team here.

666
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,180
A magic knowing expert, a magic having expert."

667
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:25,420
And then we got a scuba diver, water expert, and espionage, and Maria, powers, and Rick.

668
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Incredible technical abilities.

669
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:37,260
And, um, um, now, and Luciano goes to, uh, uh, uh, Cassandra and he says, "Look, I know

670
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:44,300
this might be difficult, but, but he's gonna need his powers to defeat Matt.

671
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,300
You know this.

672
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,820
You are a Magic Institute researcher."

673
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:54,660
And she says, "I, I will give him the powers back, even though I got it legally in the

674
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,460
divorce.

675
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:02,460
First I must see that he can fare in this adventure without them and then I will return them to him

676
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,940
at a time when I see that

677
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:11,780
And they're like that is crazy you're playing with a lot of fire then she says we can do this without magic

678
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,840
And he should know that there are things we can do in life without it and he goes

679
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,060
Oh here we go Balthazar goes like all man. Here we go and Stuart says that's enough

680
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,820
she reserves the right to withhold the powers and

681
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:30,220
He turns to Luciano and says, "We gotta just make this work, man!"

682
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Luciano says, "You will rise beyond your years, young Stuart."

683
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,220
"Um, okay. Maria, how's the water?"

684
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,220
And she says, "It's good."

685
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:50,220
"Rick, submarine?" He said, "It's good to go."

686
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,220
"And I'm glad that Maria checked the water."

687
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,300
Okay, everybody, time to pile in.

688
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,460
We're heading to Mariana's Trench.

689
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,780
And they all get in the submarine.

690
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,180
They start to go down deep into the water.

691
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:07,900
And now there's all kinds of creatures around

692
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,900
and they're chomping at the submarine.

693
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,300
And they're like, "Uh-oh, this is really tough."

694
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,440
And Rick, who's piloting, obviously, is steering.

695
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,420
And Maria's identifying, "Those fish are really nice.

696
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,940
So we should swim in that direction.

697
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,900
That school of fish is not very nice.

698
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,500
We got to avoid them."

699
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
So that's part of what she does.

700
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,260
And as they're swimming down,

701
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,060
they see something they did not expect,

702
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,980
which is a barrier

703
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,580
as they get closer to the trench.

704
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,060
It's a magical barrier.

705
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,940
And Cassandra immediately recognizes it.

706
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:48,940
She goes, "That is a magical barrier.

707
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,860
We're going to need to use some sort of magics

708
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,760
to get rid of it. And Balthazar is like, "Well, I'm waiting." And Stuart says, "Hold on.

709
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,520
What makes this magical barrier happen? Is it just pure magic or is there some

710
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,660
kind of source?" And Luciano says, "That's good thinking, Stuart." And Cassandra says,

711
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,560
"Yes, indeed it is. This barrier is probably being held up by four pillars

712
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,400
that we need to destroy that hold up magical barriers of this size in ilk."

713
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,200
And sure enough as they continue to pilot the submarine around they identify them.

714
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,680
And Stuart says maybe we can destroy them without using magic but using our

715
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,880
intelligence and some of the other weapons. I think we have weapons on

716
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,120
board and Rick goes I'm also the weapons guy yes we have weapons so that's fine.

717
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:48,400
And Stuart goes okay so let's figure this out and then someone

718
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
And at a note it goes "Not so fast"

719
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,200
And um...

720
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
They see this um...

721
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This man, the Supai

722
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,880
And it's Matt, the Darkwing

723
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
He heard them in the submarine

724
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,040
And he's swimming in the water but it's via magic

725
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,400
So he can breathe and talk normally and

726
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,840
Actually, he's uh...

727
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,840
He's talking to them through their minds

728
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,840
So he says "Not so fast" and they can all hear it in their minds

729
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,480
And Luciana goes "Did you say something young Stuart?"

730
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,480
And young Stuart says

731
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,040
I didn't say anything and Rick says I didn't say anything and then the other characters saying it as well, but then Matt

732
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,880
re-emphasizes I

733
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,120
See you have brought the failure that is Balthazar and his loser or ex-wife

734
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,680
so good job jerks and

735
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:44,040
Balthazar says dang you Matt and I heard about what you're doing and we're here to stop you and

736
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,800
Cassandra says "Yeah!" and they have like a moment of like, we know each other, you know.

737
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,280
That was like nice, that reminded us of something else.

738
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,600
And Luciano says "Matt, this is the last time I have to deal with you on my adventures, I swear it!"

739
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,960
And Matt goes "Hahaha, there's no way that's true."

740
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,240
I'm gonna come back again and again, but first I'm gonna get this crystal.

741
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,160
So I won't come back again and again, I'll get the crystal and it'll all be over.

742
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:16,000
But if you guys beat me, I'm not going anywhere unless you have to really beat me bad

743
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,680
To the point where I wouldn't

744
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,440
And Stuart says, "That might just happen today"

745
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
"Um, Rick, gun it!"

746
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,560
And Rick goes, "Right-o, Captain Stuart"

747
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,120
And uh, Luciano thinks, "Hmm, maybe he could be captain one day"

748
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,400
And then Rick zooms down with the submarine

749
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,240
And he's going towards the pillars

750
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:44,080
And uh, lo and behold, um, uh, Matt, Matt, who actually, you know what, and also going

751
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,800
back, Matt wasn't there, he was just talking through their minds.

752
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,480
I don't think they see him yet.

753
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,680
They just heard him through their minds.

754
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,400
I think that's better.

755
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,160
And so then they're zooming down the submarine to get to the first pillar.

756
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,360
And lo and behold, uh, the pillar has a big mouth.

757
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,840
He's going blah blah blah and he's shooting out beams.

758
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,120
And Rick is trying to swerve with the submarine.

759
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,000
They're like "Whoa!" and the beams are coming out.

760
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,440
And Stuart says "How do we stop that thing?"

761
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,320
And Maria looks around and she says "There!"

762
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,900
And she points at a fish that she recognizes.

763
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,880
And she says "That fish can plug up the mouth that's shooting out the beams if we time it

764
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,880
right.

765
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,400
And the best way to lure that fish throw is with cat."

766
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,560
And Stuart goes, "Uh-oh," he thinks, right?

767
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,160
And then he's now outside the submarine in a little...

768
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,960
He's got an outfit on to help him breathe in the water.

769
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,600
And Maria says, "Remember the things I taught you about being underwater?"

770
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,680
And Stuart goes, "Okay, you got it."

771
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,880
And so he starts to swim towards the totem pole.

772
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,400
Is it a totem pole?

773
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
It's just a pillar.

774
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,760
I keep imagining.

775
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,000
He swims towards the pillar while shooting beams and he's trying to get out of the way.

776
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,920
He finds a spot and he goes, "Here, here kitty kitty."

777
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
He's laughing.

778
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,800
That's a good joke, he thinks.

779
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,640
But it does work on getting that fish over there.

780
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:23,320
That fish, just like Maria said, just charges like a bull and just plugs up the mouth of

781
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
the beam.

782
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
The beam is shooting out.

783
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,240
The fish is still stuck in there.

784
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,720
Maria says, "That fish can handle any kind of beam.

785
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,240
You just gotta do that three more times.

786
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,180
And so they go up and go to the other pillars and they do that three more times and the

787
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,640
barrier dissipates.

788
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,240
And now they can finally enter into Mariana's Trench.

789
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,800
Which has very strange creatures.

790
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,240
And Maria's like, "I don't even know if I've seen many of these fish before we're about

791
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,960
to see so we gotta be careful."

792
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,900
Also, it will be incredibly dark.

793
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:59,880
And Rick says it'll be exactly 42,349 darkness.

794
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,920
Luciana says, "Okay, we got to be very careful. That's one of the

795
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,880
highest levels of darkness that are possible. Do we have any light that we

796
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,120
can use?" And Cassandra looks over to Balthazar and says, "I grant you back from

797
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:22,080
our divorce the light spell." And Balthazar says, "Thank you, Cassandra."

798
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,520
And it's very impactful. It's a very impactful moment.

799
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,560
And he shoots out his hand up and he goes light be bright and

800
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,360
It shoots up on top of the submarine now is glowing bright

801
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,840
And as they go and they go down Marianas trench and now they can see what's going on

802
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,440
They see all kinds of crazy as fish you can imagine

803
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,480
One that looks like a draft one that looks like a dog one that looks like a cat one that looks like a mouse

804
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,320
They look like other animals, but also fish and that's

805
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,920
And also some of them have the lights on their heads

806
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,920
Some of them have squiggly arms.

807
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,920
And it's very scary for a moment there, for sure.

808
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:14,920
But as they approach deeper, thanks to Maria's special intelligence and knowledge around the fish,

809
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:22,920
and not just fish, but other things that are down there, crazy plants, obviously, as well, that are shooting out stuff.

810
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,920
They are able to make it to the bottom of Mariana's Trench.

811
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,920
And then Luciano turns to everybody and goes, "Is everybody doing okay?"

812
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,920
And everyone says, "Yes, we're doing alright. Thank you, Luciano."

813
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,920
And he goes, "Okay." So now we're here at the bottom.

814
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,920
And look, it's a magic crystal.

815
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,920
And the crystal's there.

816
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,920
And we have to...

817
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,920
Did I say that they have to destroy it earlier?

818
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,920
Um...

819
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,820
What does it do again?

820
00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:01,920
I don't want to cheat, you know, I don't want to cheat and go back to what I was recording

821
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,920
But they have to just

822
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,840
They have to destroy it

823
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:15,520
In this case, that's what the doctor said. I mean I did he didn't say that but he did say that earlier

824
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:22,360
He texted Stuart and said "Stuart, you have to destroy the crystal forgot to mention." So Stuart was like "okay."

825
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,640
So...

826
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,360
They go, they, uh, they're, they're approaching it and then

827
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,880
Swoosh! Out of nowhere.

828
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,740
It is I, Matt, the evil wizard. And I just, I feel like a jerk for picking that name, you know.

829
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,280
I should have come up with something more interesting.

830
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,000
Can I, I'll change his name now.

831
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,480
I mean, it could be short for Matthias.

832
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,760
That sounds, I mean, it's not evil, but it's more formal.

833
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,640
Alright, Matthias, the evil wizard.

834
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,880
And then maybe mockingly, you know.

835
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,840
They could be like, "Yeah, sure, Matt."

836
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,520
And he goes, "That's not my name!"

837
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,560
Yeah, that's pretty good.

838
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,200
But I don't know.

839
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
That's sort of like a whole... I should've...

840
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
You know, you're probably...

841
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,560
Are you asleep, by the way?

842
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,720
I forgot I was trying to make you go to sleep.

843
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,760
This is too exciting.

844
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,160
I mean, you guys gotta let me know.

845
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,360
Because then next time I'll make it boring.

846
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
I wanted it to be a good story.

847
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,360
Um, sorry, anyway.

848
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,360
And he says, "I have arrived. It is I, Mathias the Evil Wizard."

849
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:33,360
And in this moment, this is where Cassandra turns to her former lover, Baldasar, and says,

850
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,360
"By the power of my attorney, I grant you back, after our divorce, I grant you now,

851
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,500
through your wizarding powers and Balthazar says are you sure and she says

852
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:53,220
I now know that you have it in you to just to not use your magic and to calm

853
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,840
down you know what and what I should have done earlier is he should have come up

854
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:05,540
with a solution because it would have been more impactful maybe he could have

855
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,540
Oh, well I guess Maria...

856
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,840
Uh...

857
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,520
That's fine though, but she sees that he wasn't like, you know...

858
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,300
"I need the powers so bad!"

859
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,800
You know?

860
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,080
There's probably other things that help tell you that she sees something in him, right?

861
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,380
We just don't get to see it. You can't see everything in the story.

862
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:27,040
I wish you could though, sometimes.

863
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,540
I wish you could see all the bits.

864
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,540
But...

865
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,880
Anyway, she's giving him the powers.

866
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,620
He's like, "Raaah! I'm the strongest now!"

867
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,580
And so now it's him vs. Mathias.

868
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
He exits the submarine.

869
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
They're having a water wizard battle.

870
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,580
Shooting spells at each other.

871
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
Going back and forth.

872
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,140
And while that's going on, Stuart's like, "Let's go get the crystal while they're fighting!"

873
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,140
And they go to get it.

874
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:57,820
And as they're approaching it, it's glowing bright red, crimson.

875
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,100
Crimson, yeah, and like different colors too.

876
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,100
And they get the crystal.

877
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,100
And when Stuart has it, he's like,

878
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,100
"Whoa, this is a lot more powerful than I thought."

879
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,100
And Luciano's like, "Be careful, Stuart.

880
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,100
This crystal could change everything.

881
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,100
You must destroy it."

882
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,100
And so Stuart goes and he starts punching it.

883
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:22,100
And he's like, "I can't destroy it. I'm trying so hard."

884
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,100
And Matthias laughs while he's fighting Balthasar still.

885
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,100
And he says, "Ha ha. You can't destroy this crystal.

886
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,100
I'm going to use it for evil.

887
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:38,100
The only thing that can destroy it is the power of true love.

888
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:47,100
And in that moment, Balthazar remembers how much he loves Cassandra.

889
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,100
And how much their differences are not so different and that they should reconcile.

890
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,100
This became more about love and about divorce.

891
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,100
And I don't think... I think people can relate to that.

892
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,820
And he remembers this and he goes "I love my ex-wife"

893
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,900
And he shoots the crystal and Matthias is like "Noooooo!"

894
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,820
And the crystal explodes and then *pew pew pew*

895
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,660
All the still stars start shooting around.

896
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:19,420
And Luciano's like "We gotta get out of here, Rick!" And Rick's like

897
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,020
already on it and he just guns it.

898
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,180
And now the wizard fight continues.

899
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:32,780
But now it's like, "You're not getting away!" and he starts shooting wizard powers at Balthazar.

900
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,660
Balthazar's like, "I'll stay behind, you guys keep going!"

901
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,460
And Cassandra's like, "No, Balthazar, you can't!"

902
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,220
And he's like, "I must. If my wizard powers are to be used for good, this is what it looks like."

903
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:49,420
And that's the way it is, and he's shooting, and they're like, "No, Balthazar!"

904
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,060
But they escape from the thing, and they get out of Mariana's Trench, like *swoosh*

905
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,580
*Grrraaaaaaah*

906
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:01,180
and they destroy the crystal of evil and they submarine to get back to Luciano's

907
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:06,820
lair and they're all really like really tired but they're also really sad

908
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:14,820
because now Balthazar's gone or so they think because soon flying up from the

909
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:20,820
water it's Balthazar. Balthazar are you alive? and he's like yes I am I have paid a

910
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:26,540
terrible price though. I might never be able to use my wizarding powers again.

911
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:32,500
But, because I had to, I shot them all at him and that shot me up and also trapped

912
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:37,860
him dead and sealed him. And I did that, gave up my powers so I could be with you

913
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:42,500
all. And Cassandra's like, "We should get married again by the years." And Stuart's

914
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:49,140
like, "Wow, we did it! That was an amazing adventure, Luciano." Luciano says, "Stuart,

915
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:54,140
"You did such an incredible job, would you like to come with me on more adventures?"

916
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,140
And Stuart says, "I think so."

917
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,140
"Sounds like a good idea."

918
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,140
And Luciano says, "Then we shall continue to adventure together."

919
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,140
"Me and you."

920
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,140
Stuart and Luciano.

921
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,140
And Stuart said, "You put my name first, that's so nice."

922
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,140
And Luciano said, "Hey."

923
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,140
"Um, yeah."

924
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,140
And Maria went back to teaching scuba diving,

925
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:18,500
She also got a million dollars for discovering a new fish

926
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,340
while she was under the Mayan's trench.

927
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:25,340
And Rick got hired by NASA for making amazing ships

928
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,380
in submarines and technology.

929
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,640
And because of them destroying the crystal,

930
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,420
they're absolved of the prison break earlier.

931
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,460
And also 'cause Balthazar didn't actually do anything wrong.

932
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,760
I forgot to address that, but he didn't do anything wrong.

933
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,760
It was a mistaken identity or maybe his magic misfired.

934
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,340
That's kind of interesting.

935
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,900
But anyway, that actually would be--

936
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,940
that's a pretty nice way to tie it all together, actually.

937
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,860
He went to prison because magic misfired,

938
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,380
and that sparked the whole thing between him and Cassandra.

939
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,180
OK.

940
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,820
And she abandoned him in his time of need.

941
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,900
Yeah, I like that.

942
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,860
I think that's pretty good.

943
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,940
And so that is the story of Luciano and Stuart,

944
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,380
and Stuart and Luciano, the amazing adventurers.

945
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,100
Yeah.

946
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,780
And that's your bedtime story.

947
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,580
And I want to tell you guys that.

948
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,660
So hopefully you're asleep by now.

949
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:23,500
You know, I hope you guys like this.

950
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,860
This was sort of a, kind of an experiment.

951
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,300
We never, well, you know,

952
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,020
we didn't get to go on an adventure today

953
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,860
with me and the guys,

954
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:35,660
so had to kind of come up with something.

955
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:37,940
And I thought, oh, I'll make a sleepy tape.

956
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,340
And then I started to do that.

957
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,980
And then I was like, I should tell a story

958
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,360
'Cause that's a sleepy time story.

959
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,180
Matter of fact, well, very good story.

960
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,440
And then I was getting nervous about that too.

961
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,140
But I think it's pretty fun.

962
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,180
But yeah, if you like this, let me know.

963
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,740
If you don't like it, I don't know.

964
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:56,900
I mean, you can let me know too,

965
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,540
but don't be too mean.

966
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,940
I get it, but you know.

967
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:08,820
Anyway, well, I hope you guys have an amazing day.

968
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:15,380
And if you ever wanna hang out, let me know.

969
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,540
Okay, bye-bye.
