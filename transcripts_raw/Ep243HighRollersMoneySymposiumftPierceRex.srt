00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,320
theme song for a show with about people with little money. Yeah, I guess it is.

102

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,520
about how she invented Scrat the whole time, right? Did she already invent Scrat at that point?

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,820
She had, well, Ice Age came out in 2001. So. She invented it probably back in 1970-ish.

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,140
yeah, she had been to scrat way back in the day. Yeah, I think we've

110
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,980
researched this heavily. Oh, I got the spiking chair, but you know what would

111
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,900
be great is like a show like that theme song should be a show about how you

189
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,980

196
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,500
he sized my shoe. He said he said my left foot's bigger than my right foot. He

197
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,760
sized your shoe. He sized my foot. He sized your shoe to your foot. He

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,580
customly tailored this shoe to my foot. Wow! I asked him, do you have anything

199
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,620

200
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,380
Just kidding. He said, no, we don't got that. I got to send away for a custom

Which you can't see, but it's completely true. Everyone who sits in this

210
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,220
chair gets a happy ending. Yeah, Caleb set up that chair incorrectly. He put

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,780

269
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,620
again. All right, I don't know if I came up with this joke because it came to me

270
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,620

287
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,260
say when he was sixty nine with the cat and then what the cat say rough,

288
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,580

289
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,800

291
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,620
right now and I only come one time per

292
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,940
year per year day or year day yeah dm per diem yeah, but the most money I spent

293
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,280
was shipping those fucking shirts. So you Canadian idiots, it's so cost so

294
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,460
much money and the lady at the post office got mad at me for doing it yeah,

295
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,240
so we're never shipping to Canada again. So if you guys are from Canada and you

296
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,860
didn't order something this time you're fucked you're done you unless we hire a

297
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,380
company to do it for us not happening. I will I'm not letting the other company

298
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,240
do anything with Canada. Canada is a poor country. You drive down your Montreal

299
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,540
ass to New Hampshire. You will have to meet me in Pittsburgh, New Hampshire on a

300
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,140
ski do. I will sell you the shirt there. Everyone in Pittsburgh gets around on

301
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,300
ski dues. They barely have cars. You know what you just may remember and I

302
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,340
think it's because of snow. Yeah. Did you guys see the news story? I saw this at

303
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,860
the gym on the TV, the new story that like an eight year old kid, he got lost

304
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,440
in the woods. Oh yeah. And he survived for two days by eating snow.

305
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,640
Yeah, and he slept in a wheelbarrow under a tarp or something. Yeah. He

306
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,940
just wandered away from home and didn't come back. That doesn't count,

307
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,160
right? To say you can't... You survive by eating snow. That's just drinking

308
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,920
water. That's just water. Yeah. He didn't survive anything. He was gone

309
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,740
for only two days. That was cool. He was young. He's dead now. Yeah.

310
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,440
That is cool that he had the wherewithal to think that snow is food.

311
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,920
Everyone in the comments is just like, "Disc is a survivor." No, no, no, no.

312
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,460
he was an eight year old kid and he's like I'm so hungry. I guess I'll eat

313
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,940
what's a whatever's on the ground under my feet right now. Yellows yeah, if it

314
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,620
hadn't been snowy, he would have been eating the dirt. He would be yeah or kid

315
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,500
was hungry and he was putting shit in his mouth yeah yeah, putting what I

316
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,660
thought that was his mother yeah. Oh my God, that's tragic.

317
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:52,660
He built a new mommy and daddy out of snow, damn snow mommy and snow daddy

318
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,700
yeah, that's how they found him yeah.

319
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Oh

320
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:03,380

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,500
let's talk about your let's talk about you spent. Let's talk about you guys.

322
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,820
I spend what I did money wise.

323
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,700
I fucking custom ordered stickers, embroidery patches. Oh, I went to Long

324
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,740
Island to buy a hundred dollars worth of laser discs so that I can resell them.

325
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,420
Okay, but yeah, I've been basically wasting a lot of money on art. Yeah,

326
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,620
that's Bala. That's a money move. That is art. I don't know if you ever heard of

327
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,120
guys like Picasso, Renoir,

328
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,420
Campbell's, the Campbell's Soup guy, Cos, David

329
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,620
or Jeff Koons. Jeff, all of these,

330
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,380
completely amazing artists. These guys, they spent money

331
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,080
and now people are still reaping the benefits

332
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,620
of what is essentially

333
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,260
colors on a piece of paper yeah worth worth. Exactly you look at the cost of

334
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,780
the materials, probably about a cent and in back then when Picasso was coming up

335
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,020
paper was everywhere. That was before that they figured out about the

336
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,660
rainforest having troubles and stuff for they figured out that you can just go to

337
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,500
the store like an office depot or something and just buy reams and reams

338
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,500
of yeah people. People used to have trees. People used to grow trees in their

339
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,700
houses like flowers. It was there was trees everywhere before, right yeah,

340
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,100
they could write their grocery list. They would pick a piece of paper off the

341
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,980
tree. Yeah room he was to build their houses around a tree and the tree would

342
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,900
grow in the middle of their living room. I bet back then when they invented

343
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,740
disgusting, I bet paper when they invented paper people acted about paper

344
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,200
like people act about phones. Now they're like the kids are always

345
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,860
looking at their paper. They're always on their paper. It's a fucking fad,

346
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,420
yeah, a fucking fad yeah, they're all walking around on their scrolls.

347
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,820
I'm going to get hit by oxen. I'm going to stick with sand yeah they're out

348
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,660
playing old school. I like sand. I like drawing in the same. You know there

349
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,580
was some just in timber like as who said papyrus, let's make it cleaner,

350
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,860
just paper

351
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,580
yeah papyrus

352
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,780
and you know, you may be a

353
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:14,500
Egyptian nerd that was like a papyrus. No paper paper paper

354
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,860
you talk about a multi but trillion dollar industry paper paper done the

355
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,360
Mifflin paper is the very thing that money done done done Mifflin. This is

356
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,420
Pam Dundee. I just send you

357
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:33,820
funds, get your funds up funds, get your funds up

358
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,020
Mifflin

359
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:46,140
Mifflin Mifflin I'm sniffing in more while in

360
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:52,760
but more Rifkin Meg Griffin, Meg Griffin, yeah, keep going, keep going

361
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,100
Meg Griffin, her she was drawn on paper. I thought she was the villain

362
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,100
yeah yeah, do we Griffin, but it was the chicken,

363
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,980
but it was a giant chicken,

364
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,500
giant chicken fight watching that shit all night.

365
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,220
Peter Griffin and the chicken, you know it's on site

366
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:23,220
Yeah, this is what millionaires do. This is what meetings are like.

367
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,220
You got to put that microphone up to your mouth.

368
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,220
See, we have mics that travel more than six inches because you need to relax in your chair.

369
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Anytime you're sitting up, you're losing money.

370
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,220
But look at this.

371
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
It's a kind of weakness to be sitting up.

372
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
But look at this.

373
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,980
See, so you can kind of get one of these lean back and really comfortably have a

374
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,420
spike up your lower back and then maybe a hard plastic chair back on the back of

375
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,220
your head that feels like a matrix port. I feel so bad for you. I feel like I can hear your organs

376
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,180
hissing because they got popped. And you can see that the microphone is resting on

377
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,580
my face. You can see it completely moving while I talk. Yeah, I can see the metal part

378
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,340
bouncing up and down off your sternum. Exerting exactly enough force on my

379
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,220
chin to maybe give me some kind of jaw pain migraine in a few minutes. This looks like a metal

380
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,240
little bug is feeding you. I would if this was my life and this was a

381
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,620
feeding

382
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,280
you're like your your mouth clit stimulated by

383
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,640
yeah. Do you guys think that we'll have feeding tubes in our daily lives?

384
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah, within the next time I'm sure I hope so a feeding tube full of

385
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,160
soylent

386
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,760
every day, so I like a fiend in it. They're going to be fetishists for

387
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,280
people who like to their food. People are going to be like

388
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,400
no, but is it because it do you think because of maybe misophonia people? I

389
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
feel like a lot of fake, fake

390
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,720
scarings like that or what do you call that when you don't like something

391
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,200
scary? That's not a phobia, though, or yeah, it is I'm flying away. It's a

392
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,200
misophonia. Is a phobia never spent his money? Oh yeah. What money did you spend?

393
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,000
I sent the lowest possible offer on a guy on grailed for these shoes. Wow, wow

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
wait, but you still got it. Oh yeah, he wait. Why wouldn't he take the highest

395
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,520
possible offer. No, no, I'm saying I said I spent the low it like the reserve. Oh

396
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,160
you're speaking a very advanced language.

397
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,640
Sorry, I'm so used to speaking about deals. You know you just got to send

398
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,520
you got to start low and then you go high. It's called anchoring right right

399
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,160
yeah yeah. What I like to do is anger in yeah.

400
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,360
If you don't give me the shoes for one fucking cent, I'm going to kill your

401
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,440
family, because you're an idiot yeah, because and also you're stupid. I'm

402
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,800
kill your idiot family that that attacks them from both sides. That's a pincer

403
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,960
maneuver where they're either either they're the type of person who okay,

404
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,920
there's two types of people okay. There's the type of there's no there's

405
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,280
the type of there to

406
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,960
you're thinking of types of crabs and scorpions. The first of person is the

407
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,840
person who says the person who says the person who says you can fuck with me.

408
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,240
All you want you say whatever you want about me, but don't you dare fuck with

409
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,640
my family and friends, you're going to get there's the other type of person who

410
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,020
says I'm a lone wolf. I don't give a fuck about my family, but if you think I'm

411
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,340
dumb, I'll

412
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,700
throw it out yeah exactly. So you get them from both sides. You say I'm going

413
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,480
to kill your family, you and you're stupid yeah, I'm you're a weird. I'm

414
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,460
going to make you and your family watch while I kill them simultaneously in a

415
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,600
pincer maneuver yeah well or in a more efficient way. Actually do the pincer

416
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,260
maneuvers. You say both you and your family are stupid

417
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,960
and I'm going to be there.

418
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm going to psychically drive you into killing each other through my messages.

419
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,280
Yeah, I read this thing eBay people. I'm saying there's like a shirt that

420
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,240
they're selling for $40 that has a stain on it and they say you are a robber

421
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,080
and I'm coming to call the police on you. I'm going to kill you. I read this.

422
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,680
That's my offer. Yeah, that's my I don't even want the shirt. No, it's

423
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,280
not. I've made an offer and I've typed in next to the dollar sign. It says

424
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,800
you are a bastard. What I do. I don't go on grilled. I scroll through

425
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,440
for everything I make an offer and I put in zero dollars and I put I put on the

426
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,560
Texas. I don't want it.

427
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,400
I don't want it anymore. I don't need it. I'll pay for shipping, but I'm not

428
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,840
paying for

429
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,160
if you want to give it away. I'll take it, but I'll probably throw it away. If

430
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,520
you give it to me, I don't really have anything to do with it. Yeah, I read

431
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,360
this new story when I was a kid that I'm pretty sure it's probably not true, but

432
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,640
maybe it is maybe Julio knows, but it was about I guess the cartel kidnapped

433
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,380
some people on a bus and they made them all fight to the death against each

434
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,340
other. Whoa, that's still is that true? I hope you think that that could really

435
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,820
happen. That's real yeah. I hope it's real. Well, a bunch of people I think

436
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,640
we're dying and dead. Is that more humane? Is that real? Can you give me a

437
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,180
nod? That's real you'd okay? Wow, he was there. He was there. You were there. He

438
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,360
was this lone survivor. Oh my God, you were the champion.

439
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,200
If that kind of stuff is happening because we outlawed like cock fights and

440
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,860
bull baiting. I yeah like we should bring

441
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,800
yeah there were the cartel are walking around there like kicking cans. We're

442
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,100
like what we do

443
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,780
we're not allowed to fight dogs that we're not allowed to put dogs fighting

444
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,500
against each other. Any more summer ever and I'm too I'm bored of selling drugs.

445
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,760
We sold so many drugs already. I'm bored of doing drugs, selling drugs. Yeah,

446
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,900
have you guys okay? So do you guys know what a bulldog is like? Yeah, like okay,

447
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,720
you know what bull baiting is? I'd so yeah, bull baiting and there's just like

448
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,460
do almost identical paintings, but they've been painted like thirty years

449
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,980
apart of like a bull attacking four different dogs at once, and there's

450
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,540
always a dog just flinging eight feet in the air. I guess that was a normal

451
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,140
thing to see.

452
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:37,300
We did an episode, it was like weird ways to get free food in London,

453
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,180
and I think bull baiting was one of the things. I'd never heard of it before.

454
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,220
Yeah, but... Well, you know in medieval times they did bear baiting. Right. It

455
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,860
was bears, they would have dogs fight bears. They would have a bear try to

456
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,100
like a pole and they would have like they'd let like ten. They just keep

457
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,700
letting dogs out. They'd see how many dogs it took to kill a bear tying a bear

458
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,900
to a pole seems like way more entertaining than like okay. Now that we

459
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,140
tied up, I guess let's make it die. Yeah, we'll play tether ball around it.

460
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah nowadays, it's all chatter baiting and and they're tying women to poles

461
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,860
yeah, they're tying women. Women are tying their financial security to poles

462
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:19,700
to Polish people. Yes, Polish people who single handedly fund most strip

463
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,040
clubs right

464
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,960
because you go you go because do you know do you know why it's because

465
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,640
Polish people that in their wallets they only carry one dollar bills,

466
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,220
because they don't understand what a twenty is they look at and they're

467
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,280
like two dollars

468
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,240
and then they see a five dollar, but they're like s.

469
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,420
What is this

470
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:43,800
is the same for some money they see a ten and they're just like wow yeah, a

471
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,200
hundred

472
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
I didn't they say they're like. I thought they didn't have a hundred

473
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,020
dollar bills. The most money I've ever seen yeah Polish people walk into a

474
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,380
strip club and they try to hang their flag up on the strip

475
00:29:53,380 --> 00:30:00,900
and they try to change the light bulb yeah, yeah, because it's dark in there,

476
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,640

478
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,520
light bulb right. The lights stay off because they got led strips, you know,

479
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,100
and someone's stripping all the wires that must have changed stripping that

480
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,880

486
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,780
too much. Y'all care too much. I just learned that I've been saying wrong.

487
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:55,280
It's sorry. I don't even know what it's his favorite. It's his favorite beer.

488
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,680
It's a beer that's so bad, but it's $2 and it's what color is it? Brown amber.

489
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Yeah, that's the beer color. Yeah, that is the main color of the order that

490
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,980
looks like syrup. Okay, here's what we're going to do. Now. We're halfway

491
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,780
we're going to transition into Rex's money mode. We're going money mode and

492
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:21,620
we're going this is as part of the high rollers money green talk green chat,

493
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,500
the green initiative, the green initiative,

494
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:31,260
the green win initiative. We're going to be doing a money Q and a a panel about

495
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,900
money to make money out of save money, spend money, use money, what its purpose

496
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,440
is,

497
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,240
how much things cost, how to use money, the shape without spending it, the

498
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,420
color, money for goods or services, smell, what is a good, what even is so

499
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,580
first off, what is a good? Probably something that's nice. Yeah, yeah,

500
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,460
exactly, and a service,

501
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:57,500
probably anything that's bad. Okay, so money can be used for goods and

502
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,240
services, yeah, and bads, and bads, yeah, goods and bads, goods and bads.

503
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,140
There's goods and bads of money, right? Yeah, so yeah, I guess my first

504
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:13,780
question is that I would like to ask is what is the number one easiest way to

505
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:18,220
make $1,000,000 instantly with zero time spent or any effort at all?

506
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,740
Probably robbing someone with $1,000,000. Okay, so have you how many how many

507
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,380
successful robberies have you pulled off in the $1,000,000 ballpark and what was

508
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,420
your method? Did you what what's the use case and did you use a case to take the

509
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,420
the money. What kind of receptacle did you or was it digital was it a

510
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,220
or was it digital

511
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,740
yeah kind of an eye bag yeah. Did you make someone buy something scamming baby

512
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,140
milk,

513
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,980
baby milk, skin that's the scam, the baby milk, skin, a baby milk, here's I

514
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,220
almost got scam. He almost fell victim to it almost yeah. I don't know what

515
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,820
that is. It's a scam where they ask you to buy baby milk yeah and then it's the

516
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,100
craziest scam. They come up to you. They say I need to buy baby milk and they

517
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:11,020
make you go into a store and you go in and they're like and actually I don't

518
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,260
well. No, they know they ring you up for the baby milk and it's like a

519
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,520
hundred dollars and it's not a real thing and then everyone in the store is

520
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,500
like you're doing that you're so nice for doing this. You should do this all

521
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:26,360
group hug. It's a fully like it's a it's a it's a Truman show scam yeah yeah

522
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,080
yeah scamming is very funny because you make someone buy something. I think that

523
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,460
is so so funny yeah, okay, so wait what have you have you are you speaking from

524
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,560
experience with robberies or have you just sort of seen them from a train

525
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,000
car?

526
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,840
Yeah, no, you go to you to the bank, easiest place to get money. That's

527
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,440
where they keep all the money right second easiest place you go to

528
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,460
Manhattan and you just start walking inside pretend like you walk into a

529
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,360
building right with an outfit. It's basically like a Swiss army knife of an

530
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,640
outfit, yeah, where you can do anything yeah, yeah, a suit jacket with a

531
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,720
janitor outfit underneath perfect.

532
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,960
just say you got to clean up the vault, a mop and a briefcase. So depending on

533
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,620
which side you're being looked at from, because then you're looking you're

534
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,940
walking past the front desk right. The people from outside they look in, they

535
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,040
say, oh that's just a janitor, so I won't even register him in my mind.

536
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,300
The people from inside yeah, the people from inside look and they say, oh

537
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,180
that's a high roller. I should bring him further into the building. Would you

538
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,900
recommend like a windex container that has like a label that I made called

539
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,180
money wash money,

540
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,460
and it's blue Gatorade. It's blue Gatorade in the windex bottle, so when

541
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,980
you take it off,

542
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:39,060
you drink it in front of the CEO and he's like whoa, he must be made of well.

543
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,800
No, that's what you do. If you get caught, you drink it really fast and

544
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,840
they go oh he's dead anyway. Yeah, we won't even bother catching him. Yeah,

545
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,100
whatever, whatever ammonia in his blood, people are chasing you and you're like

546
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,740
wait,

547
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:57,920
okay, I'm going to keep running around yeah, yeah, I'm done for you don't need

548
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,780
don't chase me anymore. I'm done. I just drank all this money wash

549
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,380
money watch and then you have to make a fake Google pay a screenshot on your

550
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,180
phone where you go. You say hey Siri is money watch dangerous to drink and you

551
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,860
hold it up and it says this person will die and all their money will teleport

552
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,740
back into the vault. Excellent yeah yeah that's not so hard that's yeah, so

553
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,980
that's a good strategy. That's strategy number one. You could yeah, you could

554
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,340
sort of David Blaine the coins in yours in your small bowel. Oh yeah, it's a

555
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,640
sarcophagus. You could eat all of the coins yeah and then just regurgitate

556
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,620
the coin, and if someone catches you, you could be like oh, I'm eating coins. I

557
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,900
thought this was corn. Yeah, they were my bad. I guess I'm not supposed to eat.

558
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,260
They were small and yellow yeah like a corn, gold, bullion.

559
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,840
So yeah, so to recap you walk into basically any building in Manhattan or a

560
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,380
bank. I guess we didn't talk about how to rob a bank, but it can't be that

561
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,560
hard. I know literally all you do is you say I'm going to have the money and

562
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,160
they have to give it to you because of insurance reasons for the life of a

563
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,500
human being, because if you say you're going to have it, that's yeah, that's

564
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,640
what that's you should say. I'm going to have it instead of give me the money.

565
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,620
You say I'm going to have the money and then they're like oh well, there's

566
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,520
nothing we can do. It's a brain hack where their brain skips over even

567
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,440
thinking about how you're going to get the money. It's basically it's something

568
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,960
called verbal hypnosis, which is a millionaire tactic that you are now

569
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
getting very poor yeah

570
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:27,140
and I am taking your money. Your wallet is getting light

571
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,340
your

572
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:36,660
yeah hypnotized the money, but anyway geodes yes or no precious rocks or

573
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,260
investment poor okay or investment yeah and for your investment into geodes,

574
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,680
yes

575
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,780
and physically inside of the geo inside the hollow cavity right to clarify yeah

576
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,440
inject it with a siren, little crystal in there. That's thousands of dollars.

577
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,040
Wow, wow, every just have to get thousands of dollars. That was the first

578
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,640
money right. You just basically crack open, you owed. Unfortunately, I think

579
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,240
the first money was human beings really, and we were traded by maybe an entity.

580
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,080
Yeah, in a company, a company, a company. Yeah, well, honestly, well, capital

581
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:20,880
exactly wow that is the world capital earth earth, damn blue planet and and the

582
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,000
green planet, the moon is the biggest place on earth, yep,

583
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,480
you can take vacation there

584
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,520
well, I feel like I'm learning so much already to be honest, yeah, okay, so moon

585
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,040
just switch up a few to the moon there and we have money that's a that's

586
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:43,400
actually true. If you add two letters and remove one moon becomes money,

587
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,280
and here's how I would deal that situation. You say, subtract one letter,

588
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,200
add to I say, add one letter and change one letter. Wow, you can always say

589
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,760
I basically, you know it and you know and you know, I would, you know, you

590
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,560
know how I would say how I would I would what I would do is I would say

591
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,680
take the take the word moon, apply our proprietary formula and then it's money

592
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,280
hide the entire process. Nobody knows what you're doing. You can sell it for

593
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,960
trillions of dollars. What you're doing basically is breaking it down and

594
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,360
reconstituting it into a little cheese, like a cocoon, a cheese it cocoon. Yeah,

595
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:26,120
but moon craters equator planet earth green and equators equals to all money.

596
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:33,160
Yeah, well, the great equator and I equate money with pleasure. Yeah, and

597
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,200
pleasure things. Should we be spending our like the our disposable income or

598
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,000
pleasure money? What should we be buying onions, onions, onions, things that go

599
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,640
bad? You need those immediately. Oh right, because the most powerful or

600
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,000
valuable asset I've heard this is time. It's a time equals money right our time.

601
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,160
Honestly, I would say time equals money times two or plus one hundred or

602
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,000
something that's more, but having spoiling produce around you that like

603
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,520
It's basically like having the exact same time. Let's get to the list.

604
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,560
You also make money. Exactly. That's also you can you go out, you hustle,

605
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,080
you're selling that on the subway, on the sidewalk, at the bank, at the

606
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
library, wherever you're allowed to sell stuff or wherever you're not

607
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,840
allowed to sell stuff. You tell people you got to buy this onion today

608
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,440
because tomorrow it's going to be basically nothing but smell. Let's get

609
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,520
a list of and it's also illegal to buy an onion tomorrow. That's true. Every

610
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,520
single disposable, every single item that will go bad tomorrow.

611
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,120
So check this out, I mean Pavlov, he was doing all this stuff with clocks and

612
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,440
stimulus and the ringing of the bell and that's associated with positivity.

613
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,360
And you know all these money makers, they're always like,

614
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,360
the church bell is ringing, that means I have to go make more money because of

615
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,840
the time that is in the ticking clock and it's all in the ears.

616
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,520
But you want a smell-based clock.

617
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Basically you wanna have things that ripen and go bad at different hours of

618
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,040
every day. >> Because of the smell of money.

619
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Exactly the smell of money and also like the hormones of that the

620
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,160
biological clock of that. Yeah, the cloud clock,

621
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,760
the clouds of that, the smell of the rain, cloud bread and it's raining money,

622
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,680
cloud bread, disposable cloud bread, disposable. Speaking of disposable,

623
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,880
can I actually share a tip really quick that I've found to be very helpful in

624
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,520
my financial life? Yeah. So if you see this that I'm drinking here,

625
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,960
it's a it's the bottle is Gatorade frost thirst quencher. What flavor in fact

626
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,500
this will

627
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:36,300
glacier cherry, it's hard to read yeah, it's clear, but what is actually in

628
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,720
here it's water. Okay, and do you know and do you know what the reason behind

629
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,400
this is? Yes, so I know what you're thinking. I know you can make a guess

630
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,080
did you're going to be wrong Gatorade in there long enough that the water and

631
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,880
the and the particulate matter that forms the Gatorade flavor settled at the

632
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,040
the bottom and then you synthesized a Gatorade syrup sold that for a profit

633
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,600
and then kept the water in the bottle.

634
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,240
No, okay, Pierce, no

635
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,940
the overhead on that is absurd.

636
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:08,160
You are an idiot, so much on Gatorade, dear God,

637
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,740
bottles and then that is even worse than the stupid thing. I wanted you to

638
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,900
say, which was that maybe I was doing this to save money on Gatorade bottles,

639
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:21,140
then I have to buy a water bottle or a gatorade bottle. That guess is also

640
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,480
stupid. You know what the real reason you reuse a bottle like this is okay

641
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,340
think about what happens to this bottle. You throw it in the recycling, okay, it

642
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,340
go yeah, it goes to a plant, it gets processed. This is all happening. It's

643
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,500
churning up the plastic that's costing money okay, and what you're thinking

644
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,180
you're thinking, but that's not money my money. I threw that in the bin. That is

645
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,740
your money. That's tax dollars yeah. Every time you are recycling a gatorade

646
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,220
bottle, your taxes are going up, right up, up, up, up, skyrocketing. You know

647
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,160
what? Also, and I know you didn't think about this, the illusion of wealth that

648
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,740
comes with, with water in the Gatorade bottle, the illusion of wealth when

649
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,240
people see the Gatorade bottle where they're like, "He must have, he can

650
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,160
afford the Gatorade, he must have a fucking fortune." Yeah, exactly. "He must

651
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:07,280
have so much money." It's true, but anyway, the point I wanna make is taxes

652
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,520
are very, 'cause you know, this fucking government, people at our, at our wealth

653
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,200
bracket, we're getting taxed about ninety nine percent on our income and

654
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,340
are on our assets and that last one percent is a squeeze. That one

655
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,260
Gatorade bottle can be the difference between zero and one percent wow yeah.

656
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,160
I guess throwing away your Gatorade bottle is just like you have the money

657
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,620
yeah, you have it, you take it yeah, you're garbage man, you get paid. I'm

658
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,820
tired of holding this. You have it. I don't have a room in my house. I can

659
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,480
just put all these in my hand is tired. Yeah, that's what a why that's why

660
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,200
most people have mansions. You keep the trash, you keep you put the trash man

661
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,700
out of business, the money that would get paid to the trash man that circulates

662
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,980
that trickles up the trickle up economic effect. I find these to be very valuable

663
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,720
because of their toilet like nature

664
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,960
in what way because they hold a liquid. The slot is big enough for for most

665
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,440
distribution methods of urine and shit. Yeah, I think it's just big enough for a

666
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,860
have you ever pooped in a Gatorade bottle? No, but I think you could if you had to

667
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,560
you could because you get all the P that comes out when you when you poop yeah,

668
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,480
so you have one in the back yeah, and then you could get rid of the what

669
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,440
we're looking at here is an initially burst of poo remove all plumbing in

670
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,780
your home, replace it with only Gatorade.

671
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,140
You still need to send them. Oh, you just put the cap on sorry. That's not

672
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,580
stinky now averted

673
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,740
no, you put the cap on oh the back yard, throw it in the throat and someone

674
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,700
else's back yard yeah yeah yeah, I don't have a back yard. Oh wait, there is no

675
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,380
someone else's back yard where I live, because I own the entire world, but the

676
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,780
problem here, the problem here is your neighbor finds a Gatorade bottle in his

677
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:54,500
back yard full of human shit and he thinks oh my God, oh my God Gatorade is

678
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,300
putting poo

679
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:03,380
you short Gatorade. Yeah, you short Gatorade you buy well, the Gatorade

680
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,440
I rock is shorted you buy it hostile take over you buy you completely take over

681
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,880
then you release a public statement that says that says Gatorade will no longer

682
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,740
use poop yeah in our production. You know what else you would have you stock

683
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,220
up you go. I rock it store you go next door to your neighbor. Your neighbor is

684
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,080
like you hear neighbor freaking out you go next door. You say you hear them

685
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,820
freaking out that you go what what what's going on

686
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,080
you don't even ring the you you you go up and you knock on the door and you

687
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,060
what's happening, what's going on? What is putting they're putting poop in

688
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,600
Gatorade bottles? You tell that neighbor you say I

689
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:46,140
will I will pay for the lawyer. You and I have a connect. Yeah, you sue

690
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,300
Gator. While this is happening, you are also shorting the stock. So now you've

691
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,940
won a lawsuit against Gatorade, but also you are Gatorade and if you're worried

692
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,540
about any type of insider trading or SEC regulations that might get you in trouble

693
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,220
you're suing them and also tell them shorting the stock poop to one trick.

694
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,820
You can use is just have a secret identity like spider man yep, where you

695
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,320
can be spider man when you're suing them, try wearing a costume, where a

696
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,100
costume with a bright color that covers your face. You change your you change

697
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,460
your name, you get two identities, dual citizenship, when you say like my

698
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,380
grandma's Irish or something, so then you get like the Irish citizenship stuff

699
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:23,740
and then you say your name is spider man McNally.

700
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,340
So you have a secret identity like spider man yeah, which I mean you don't

701
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,800
have to say Spider Man. You could say you could say Iron Man. How many

702
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,040
identities do you have? How many are you a card carrier for maybe five or

703
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,380
six different people? Because I imagine that's imagine you do this all the

704
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:43,340
time with the Gatorade. Of course, yeah, you have to run scams like that.

705
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,540
Oh yeah, yeah, I have like you have a list of scams that you that we can do.

706
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,400
Can you list a few of your names of your identities if you can

707
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,000
one just one one initials?

708
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,760
I'm sorry, I can't talk about it. Okay, then here's another here's another

709
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,760
understand. I understand I understand I bet I bet this guy's in a lawsuit where

710
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,600
he's the judge, he's the jury. I mean this guy has so many different

711
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,920
he's the

712
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,880
probably he has to go into the he has to go into the court one by one is

713
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,640
different people. I keep locking the door and looping back around. I actually

714
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,200
have to go to the bathroom, all right, call a recess, okay, and then yeah, the

715
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,400
the mirrors whispering into each other. It's him the he's all he's. Okay, I

716
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,980
have another question. I recently heard I was told that this year it is the and

717
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,120
this is, I believe true, the fiftieth anniversary of hip hop. Whoa, for real,

718
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,120
how is this going to affect money?

719
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,960
That's going to affect money in big ways because it's it's you know a lot of

720
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,260
I mean hip hop has changed. Let me just say that you can say that again. Hip hop

721
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,600
changed hip hop has changed. Why is it that

722
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:04,300
it's a funny on turn my funny on okay? Well, I'm not trying to be funny. I'm

723
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,300
just trying to say hip hop turn my serious on or that's not serious. No

724
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
turn my serious

725
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:15,300
maybe that's the change of it. Maybe yes hip hop has changed.

726
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,200
There we go.

727
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,000
So it's changed in a way. It used to be about breakdancing b-boying used to be

728
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,280
about all that stuff now. It's about hose and money money, which is good.

729
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,600
It's changed for the better. It's changed into jewelry about it. Change

730
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,320
change change jingling change jingling

731
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,840
jingling jingle bells, jingle bells, richest man on earth jingle bells,

732
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,320

733
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,720
and a billion dollars. So net worth net worth as we're and net work

734
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,720

735
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,700
but gazillion dollar

736
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,580

764
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:53,700
I don't even know where the fuck I you went to nut dot com. I think I put you

765
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,500

00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:01,900
and I uploaded just two pictures of my credit cards. Fuck dude, you got nutted.

767
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,820
You got nutted up in yeah damn. I got nutted up in and guess what it hurts to

768
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,200
sit

769
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,180
because your wallet is so skinny, your wallet is basically giving you a

770
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:14,980
credit card.

771
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:22,820
And it's swiping your ass crack. Yeah, I used to, my butt is so used to the

772
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,740
fat stack in my wallet, making me sit like this, sit like a Habsburg,

773
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,620
but now look at me.

774
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,980
Yeah, sitting normal. It used to be like this, 'cause my... 'Cause here,

775
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,220
let me do a quick analysis here on you. You do that pose. Okay.

776
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,980
So what I'm seeing here, do you see this? Do you see this shoulder? Now you see this shoulder

777
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,820
is right shoulder, left shoulder lower than the right shoulder. Let's draw a line from

778
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,920
this left shoulder. Let's go up to the right shoulder. You see the line in your head? Yep.

779
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:54,160
Make it red. Right. Now you see the stripes on his suit? Yep. Now add some horizontal

780
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,160
stripes like a grid. You see that red line against that grid? Yeah. What are you seeing?

781
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:05,340
Stock price going from the left in this position from left to right down and then it's going

782
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,300
up down. If it was going from left to right, I was going down profit. No

783
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,640
well profit for nut, not profit, not profit, instead of net profit. Yeah

784
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,540
that's probably why he calls them nut bugs.

785
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,120
It's supposed to be net books. I think it's going to be net succession based

786
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,980
cringe,

787
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:31,420
realistic or virginistic. Let's throw this realistic, realistic, really

788
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,640
Everyone is that stupid.

789
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,180
Do you have a bunch of family members like that who are doing things like that to you?

790
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Yes.

791
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,940
I have a bunch of family members like that but it's not about like finances.

792
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,700
It's mostly about like when like who's going to take over.

793
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,300
Right when are you coming to visit home?

794
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,300
Yeah when are you coming to visit home?

795
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,300
What do you want for dinner?

796
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,300
What do you want for dinner?

797
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,780
And I'm like you fucking fuck what?

798
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,140
Do you guys think that Mr. Coyne...

799
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,140
You fucking fucked hard.

800
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,140
Get out of my face.

801
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,820
Do you guys think that Mr. Coyne is based off of Mr. Nut in succession?

802
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,820
Oh absolutely.

803
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,820
Yeah.

804
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,260
something like strong. I did get I did. I thought it was that was one part. I did

805
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:09,020
think was a little cringe, even though even through the realism is like we

806
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,620
lived through the Mr. Nut stuff and we lived through the election and all this

807
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,420
shit and it's like and you're just gonna pretend. I don't want to relive it.

808
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,700
Yeah, like that. Some of us don't think it's a joke and I get that it's

809
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:25,340
supposed to be some kind of by also. Yeah, when you have this little fucking

810
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,340
little stream. I don't think that I also don't think that Bobby would be so

811
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,340
concerned about Mr. Nutt. This little ass Roman Roy string bean

812
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,340
mother fucker saying all those fuck wits who put money in Mr. Nutt.

813
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,840
Yeah, it's like it's not. I'm watching TV, I'm throwing the remote at the

814
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,340
screen. Yeah. Because I'm like he's talking about me. That's why I have a

815
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:47,340
Wiimote cord on my remote. Yeah. It's for when I watch HBO.

816
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:51,340
I throw my remote at the TV. I put it on when I

817
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:55,340
launch HBO Max and go, and I put it on. Yeah. And then I turn

818
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,100
on PBS Sprout, I take that shit off.

819
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,740
- 'Cause I know that they're gonna say something

820
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,300
that is so biting.

821
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,140
- Yeah.

822
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:02,980
- And so satirical.

823
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,860
- Gonna have me biting.

824
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,980
- Yeah, it's gonna have me biting my bottom lip.

825
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,820
And I'm like,

826
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,420
- Biting my wife out of anger.

827
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,260
(laughing)

828
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:11,280
- Taking all my anger by biting my wife.

829
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,420
- The show makes me so upset.

830
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,020
It's like when a dog just bites another dog next to it,

831
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,540
even though you're the one who's messing with the dog.

832
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,260
Is that kind of what you're explaining?

833
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,460
And is there a way to make money off of that action?

834
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,300
(laughing)

835
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,140
- Stuff a bite in?

836
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,140
Is there a way to make money off of biting?

837
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,140
Of course.

838
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,140
Can you detail it a little bit?

839
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,140
Sure, you got professional eating.

840
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,140
Oh yeah.

841
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,140
Got food tester.

842
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,140
Joey Chestnut.

843
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,140
Like a king.

844
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,140
What is your dream job?

845
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,140
Food tester or video game tester?

846
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,140
Probably both at the same time.

847
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,140
Wow.

848
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,140
Yeah, I can walk and chew gum at the same time.

849
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,140
I can't.

850
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,140
What happened?

851
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,140
I just can't.

852
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,140
But you can do other things at the same time.

853
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,140
Yeah.

854
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:53,140
I can poop and pee at the same time.

855
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,180
I can't help but do that. Yeah. Is there a way to make money off of that? Like

856
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,020
the surplus? There is a way to make money off of poop and pee. We've

857
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:03,620
already talked about Gatorade. That's what I'm saying. Oh yeah. Yeah, well...

858
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,060
What about a dog? There is a Korean guy that tried to give people money

859
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,260
for their poop and pee. Is that true? Yeah. Well, they have fecal transplants

860
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,320
too. They take children's poo and they... Oh, they spread to change your gut

861
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,300
biome. They up your butt. That's what it's for? Yeah, your gut biome. Changing

862
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,940
the gut biome? Yeah. What did you think? You thought it was just to put

863
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,300
I was up there. I thought it was for people who can't make poop. You

864
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,260
thought they put poop into them, so they put poop into them to

865
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:31,740
normalcy. So yeah, it's like a place. It's like an elective. It's an

866
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:35,040
elective surgery that puts poop in. No, it's like it's like the atmospheric

867
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,900
processors and aliens. Yeah, what's going on with the with the inserting

868
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,580
now? Is there a way to a child's poop into your mouth to change your mouth

869
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,620
bio? Yes, but most doctors won't do that and your insurance probably won't

870
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,660
pay for it, but I know that none of us here are rocking with health insurance.

871
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:56,300
Nope. We don't need to so not need that. We can afford the hospital visits once a

872
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,980
week for swallowing a kernel of popcorn and being scared of popcorn tree is

873
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:03,880
going to grow in your tummy. Yep, or when you laugh while you're eating like

874
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,700
or when you laugh while you're eating, you laugh while you're eating a piece of

875
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,120
celery. I have laughing disease. You laugh while you're eating a piece of

876
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,940
celery and you accidentally swallow the whole celery or when I'm walking down

877
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,380
the street and I think of something from my past and I start laughing and I

878
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,740
quickly run into the closest hospital and I say I think I got drugged yeah. I

879
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:28,020
think somebody rubbed LSD on my ankle on a cut that I have on my ankle because my

880
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,720
shoes are too small. I think someone put stitched LSD into the middle of my

881
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:37,240
jacket, the inside lining yeah and that's why I'm having memories. I think

882
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,260
I'm getting an acid flash back getting an acid flash back because I cracked my

883
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:46,260
back bending over to get the fucking the band aid on my ankle. I'm looking

884
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,640
this book said I had memories to look back on and I knew I was having an

885
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,160
ass. I'm looking I'm looking at the I'm looking at the bookmark that I have in

886
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,660
the middle of my copy of Siddhartha that I've been reading for twelve years at

887
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,240
this point. I'm twenty pages in and I'm looking at it and I'm turning it back

888
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,360
and forth and there's pictures a picture of tree frogs on it, but when I

889
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,480
turn it one way, I would turn it one way their legs are like this and I turn it

890
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,980
the other way their legs move a little bit and I'm calling the doctor and I'm

891
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,320
saying I got fucking drug. There's something in the water. People are

892
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,520
going to take me out. They know that I'm making a hundred dollars a day. Yeah, I

893
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,440
accidentally eat like just the end of like an edible that's only five

894
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,320
milligrams and I'm sitting there and I'm just like

895
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,920
yeah

896
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,360
and I'm calling my doctor on the phone. I'm like

897
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,800
so what do you mean you accidentally ate you were just hungry for what you

898
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,360
thought was a normal treat? Yeah, yeah right and where did my roommates

899
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,880
edible?

900
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,840
and he fucking got me yeah and it's my yeah. I need him to call. I'm sucking on

901
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,940
I'm sucking on a ballpoint pen because I like it. Oh, and you get inky mouth and I

902
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,540
got inky mouth and it's loads on my face and I call a doctor and I go in for a

903
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,180
consultation and I say, well, this affects my future ability to grow a

904
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,800
beard yeah right and I'm thirty five years.

905
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,280
I'm on the phone with my doctor and I'm so loopy and fucked up from all the

906
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,720
drugs after eating the ballpoint pen. I'm just only saying my inky stinky. Oh,

907
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,720
I fall out of the shower and my shark tooth necklace gets caught on the

908
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,160
curtain

909
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,360
and I call the doctor and say that I have a shark bite.

910
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,800
But we can afford all this. We can afford to call the doctor for all this

911
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,140
because we make money every day. I'm going into the doctor. I'm walking into

912
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,460
the emergency room. I'm cutting in front of everybody. I'm pretending that I

913
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,600
have a sinus infection and that's why I'm in the emergency room and then I

914
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,400
get into the room. I

915
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,440
go in and I say I want a peg leg.

916
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,340
but we have the money to do all this because we made a podcast where we read

917
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,200
the list and then we and here's the list. It's too much overhead on a list.

918
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,880
Yeah, a list cost too much sometimes you can't find a list. So then you make

919
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,280
up a whole episode about getting money. How much money do you have?

920
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,280
Probably $300 million. Yeah, holy shit. And that's right. I'm bringing your

921
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,080
different identities or is that just you as you have that money? Yeah, that's

922
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,560
just me. My other identities. You don't even want to know. I do want to know

923
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:14,360
is five probably like five seven dollars, seven from each of the different

924
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,360
yeah yeah my each of my identities has only five dollars, but I have a

925
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,120
hundred trillion identities.

926
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,920
That's actually really

927
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,320
isn't that hard. You just make yeah,

928
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,560
they just keep referring each other to

929
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:36,640
with one dollar and that should just go interest. That's what I'm talking about

930
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,900
yeah, I'm interested. I'm in making money. Is it a feasible money making

931
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,440
strategy to open a bank account, put in one penny and let it sit for a

932
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,540
hundred trillion billion years? Yes, of course, I'm going to invent a time

933
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:55,120
machine. You put 60 cents future on like people are picking up money tips from

934
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,460
fry. Yeah, yeah, he said shut up and take my money. That's the title of his

935
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,580
book. It's so interesting to go from fry character like fry to a character

936
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,200
like Rick Sanchez, because Rick seems to

937
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:13,020
think about how they're both. I mean they're sci fi protagonists in cartoons

938
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:17,640
right here, right, when you may be compare on money motivated and non sex

939
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,680
motivated. Rick is

940
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,660
that guy's in a whole different bag. He's in like he's not human. He's in a

941
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:29,640
green portal fluid more so than green bag yeah and emotionality right he's in

942
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,440
his feelings, but and drinking like he's basically into all fluid all the time.

943
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,680
I mean we talk about we talk about we talk about liquidity. Yes, Rick

944
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,480
Sanchez is talking about portal fluid and alcohol and there's a little bit of

945
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,760
green spittle on his lip on his lip. Fry is lip all the time. Fry what is a fry

946
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,480
French French fry potato solid frozen solid French French put all of your

947
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:00,900
money in French Franks, French Franks, the money fire kind of money that I

948
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,100
don't think they use any more. Find a type of money called a French Frank

949
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:10,600
find put or I think it was France that uses Franks, Francs. I think maybe

950
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,700
they used to a long time ago. Are they on the Euro now? They're on the

951
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:18,400
Euro. Okay, I hate to break it. What are your thoughts on this Euro

952
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,100
situation?

953
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,440
what the hell is going on over there? What the hell is going on?

954
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,960
I go, I'm saying Euro, right? The Bodega guy is saying Gyro, I say

955
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,780
Euro. He's saying Gyro. And he says Spider Man, I say you know.

956
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:45,160
But I'm saying Euro, he's saying Gyro, I'm saying Euro, and then I don't

957
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,060
know, should I just go to a Greek place? Should I not get a

958
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,880
euro at the bodega. Lamb is fine at the bodega. Lamb is fine at the bodega,

959
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,280
but should I just get it over rice like a normal person?

960
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,480
Listen, you got to make that decision yourself. Rice. That's a staple Asian

961
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,980
culture. Asian going up. That's money right now. Greece, poor. Are we looking

962
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:12,080
at a Chinese century? Gyro, of course. Okay. But gyros, that's a poor country.

963
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,880
Imagine a Chinese euro.

964
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,520
Wait, I think you just had a million dollar idea. Oh my God, think about

965
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,600
this. You use a scallion pancake to wrap around char siu pork.

966
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,680
This is actually a really good idea. I wish I had a big check to give you

983
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,060
listeners with some money advice you want to give what's your number one

984
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,240
piece of advice for anyone who's listening who's a poor fucking piece of

985
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,620
shit string bean is three inches tall yeah who goes on youtube all day eating

986
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:51,720
the italian job and drinking mustard. We were all there. We all got the italian

987
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,480
job. We all got the italian job at the seven eleven on harvard avenue. We all

988
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,560
ate. We all spent eight dollars every day on a food called salt chicken. We've

989
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,360
all done it. These people they're rationing monster hydro so that it lasts

990
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,240
for four days.

991
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:15,580
They're watering it down like hand soap in the bathroom. What do you say to

992
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,440
these pathetic fucking mongrels? Don't walk, run to the bank, take all your

993
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,860
money out, hide it under your bed,

994
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:27,920
go back to the bank, start a new bank account. Just get into the habit of

995
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,360
hiding money instead of making your bed every morning. Basically... Like a

996
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,140
squirrel with a missed a nut, missed the nut, take all of your dollars, take

997
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,000
all of your dollars, sew them together into a big money blanket.

998
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,380
Money is made out of cloth and then set it on fire because the future is

999
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:43,880
PayPal.

1000
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,600

1001

I do.

1021
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,040
No you don't.

1022
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,040
You ruined my point.

1023
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,040
You ruined my point because you wanted to be.

1024
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,040
No, no I didn't have a point.

1025
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,040
That wasn't the point I was trying to make.

1026
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,640
That wasn't the point I was trying to make.

1027
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,140
You are honestly, you belong in a high school debate team.

1028
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,440
That's like the level of annoying you are.

1029
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
You do do some debate stuff.

1030
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,440
Yeah, you do have that kind of talking.

1031
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,440
You told me I was wrong, so I told you I was right.

1032
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,440
No.

1033
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,440
See, that's a high school debate team.

1034
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Yeah, I'm telling it like it is.

1035
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
And I have to be the moderator every single time.

1036
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
Here's the point I was trying to make.

1037
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,440
I always have to be the moderator.

1038
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,440
Here's what you do.

1039
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,440
Here's the point I was trying to make.

1040
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,440
I don't even get to debate.

1041
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Before you were obtuse.

1042
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,440
Yeah.

1043
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,080
is that if it was the 1800s and you had no porn,

1044
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:26,440
who among us wouldn't start just randomly killing women and eating their breasts

1045
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,280
and their asses?

1046
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,680
You see what I was trying to get at? It is a good point.

1047
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,360
Because if you didn't have, yeah. Who's to say? I don't know.

1048
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,280
I don't know if I would have ripped.

1049
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,240
Can I honestly tell you that the reason I wanted to argue with you so much is

1050
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,400
because of those glasses. It's making me mad to look at you.

1051
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:48,360
well you have a bud light hat on so

1052
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:53,300
he does not have a bud light hat on, he has a mexico hat on

1053
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,540
oh it's the color

1054
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,480
it kinda looks like bud light

1055
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,280
if we're keeping it real right now

1056
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,280
still

1057
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,620
he got mad at me for my new hat that i'm wearing

1058
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:07,120
this hat pisses me off. he called me a poser but i just want to point out for a whole

1059
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,120
year

1060
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:11,120
he wore a frog skateboards beanie

1061
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,120
I thought it was from a...

1062
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
You have never won...

1063
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,120
I have a skateboard right over there.

1064
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,120
Wait, wait, no.

1065
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,120
Let's break this down.

1066
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,120
Hold on.

1067
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Let's break this down.

1068
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,120
Frog...

1069
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,120
What did you just say?

1070
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,120
Frog skateboards.

1071
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,200
Frog skateboards beanie.

1072
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,500
I don't skateboard, but I like frogs and I wear beanies.

1073
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,920
So how's that mean being a poser?

1074
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,920
Two out of three.

1075
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,360
This is a golfing hat.

1076
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,360
Yeah.

1077
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,360
I like hats.

1078
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,360
I don't golf.

1079
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,360
50% is more.

1080
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,360
What?

1081
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,760
I don't golf and I do like old English fonts.

1082
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,840
is on here. You don't golf. That's 52%. That's 52. You don't golf. You know what? How about

1083
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,040
right now? I have, I have a skateboard right over there. I have a skateboard right over

1084
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,920
there. We're going to turn the camera and we're going to see if you can ollie right now.

1085
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,280
Fuck you man. I'll do this right now. All right. No, he's doing the camera. No, no,

1086
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,280
You have to point the camera at you.

1087
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:10,160
Yeah, so Caleb is getting the skateboard.

1088
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,160
He's standing next to it.

1089
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,520
Okay, put one foot onto it.

1090
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,320
He's bending down as if he's winded.

1091
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,760
He looks like he's going to throw up maybe.

1092
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,840
His hands are just above his knees.

1093
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Okay, second foot on.

1094
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,920
He's wobbling a lot.

1095
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:23,880
He's really wobbling.

1096
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,080
He looks like a snow angel.

1097
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,760
He's got a beautiful stance.

1098
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,480
He has fallen off the skateboard without trying to do a trick.

1099
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:38,480
I'm just narrating here. No, no, no, no. Okay. So he's still st... he's doing again a star

1100
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:49,360
type pose. All right. I don't know really. Okay. So he's getting back on. Okay. He's

1101
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:59,920
almost destroyed our printer. You should move that. Fix the printer. Fix the printer before

1102
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,920
The printer completely almost fell over.

1103
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,920
We almost lost the printer.

1104
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
The printer I just spent $100 on.

1105
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,920
Yeah, we almost just lost the printer.

1106
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:16,920
Can you imagine how far I'm going to get?

1107
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,920
Caleb did the most 11 year old Ollie.

1108
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
He's adding qualifications now.

1109
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,920
You didn't say what age level I had to do it at.

1110
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:24,920
I'm not saying.

1111
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,920
I'd like to see you read at an 11 year old level.

1112
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,920
I'm saying you did it.

1113
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,200
you did it. I know but you had to add all these qualifiers to make me feel obtuse. I didn't

1114
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,920
make you feel obtuse.
