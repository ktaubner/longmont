that Lego song you call it awesome culture yeah you're trying to get

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,920
started it's not a thing I'm trying to get started I don't want to bring up

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,940
Joseph Gordon-Levitt see you could introduce us to no no no this is my

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,940
This is my coinage.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:22,940
This is my coinage.

28
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,940
This is like a hot couch.

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,060
This is like the chad of potatoes.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,140
Now I'm fucking, I'm regretting it so bad.

31
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,460
No, but you know, I actually, just randomly, you guys know Joseph Gordon-Levitt?

32
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,260
He's one of these guys I randomly call them awesome culture guys.

33
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,420
And they...

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,220
I don't know, I don't want to say, I don't want to say soy.

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,140
I don't want to say soy because it's played out.

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,260
I don't know what it's called, but I've heard some people, like people are saying awesome

37
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,740
culture. Yeah, like random people. I think I may have actually started it in my sleep.

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,320
But it's definitely going to catch on. You know what? You guys can make fun of me all

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,380
you want. I'm just going to keep calm and chive on. I just came up with this cool new

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,260
phrase called "You snooze, you lose." Which I think people are saying. I'm just going

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,620
to sit here and keep calm and chive on. I guess you're right though. If you want to

42
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,060
come up with something, you do have to force it on people. Because nobody started saying

43
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,380
"You snooze, you lose" until a guy was like, "So basically I came up with this new thing.

44
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,380
It's called like you snooze you lose.

45
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,380
And it's basically like if someone loses because they snooze.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I wish I thought of a funnier thing to say.

47
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Awesome culture.

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,380
So wait, you... break it down for me.

49
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
I just don't want to say soy.

50
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Did you enter into this episode knowing you were going to say awesome culture?

51
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
No, no I did not.

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,380
And have you said awesome culture before this episode?

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
No, I've never said it.

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
You said it, what about in your brain?

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,580
So you've never thought about it or said it before but you just said that you call it

56
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
awesome culture?

57
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,380
Yeah, pretty much.

58
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
You are lying dude.

59
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,380
You were like, this is going to be like, people are going to know this is like the day that

60
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,380
awesome culture started as a coin phrase.

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380
Fuck off!

62
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Fuck you!

63
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
Fuck you!

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,380
I never said it before!

65
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,380
People are going to be like, oh awesome culture?

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,380
There's going to be a Wikipedia entry for awesome culture.

67
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,380
It'll be like origin.

68
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,540
they're gonna add it to the Oxford English Dictionary like they do when they add like

69
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,140
Google to the dictionary and everyone's like "WHOA!"

70
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Wait you know my buddy Patrick came up with that?

71
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,420
They just added incel to the Oxford English Dictionary.

72
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,820
I didn't want to say soy!

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,820
I didn't want to say soy!

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,980
Well you did though, you said it.

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,580
You said soy and then you were like "that's played out."

76
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,980
I actually called them "awesome culture."

77
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,380
Well no, no, because there's a delineation between soy and what I think is awesome culture.

78
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380
Please elaborate!

79
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,960
Tell me what awesome culture is.

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,620
They're not like, cause Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I wouldn't call him a soy boy.

81
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,280
He's too handsome.

82
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,280
He's too handsome and he doesn't have a shitty beard and glasses.

83
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,220
He's just like one of these drug addict potheads.

84
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,720
It's like one of those, they're like.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,980
The difference is there's, he's a celebrity.

86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Yeah.

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,880
Because I mean, every fucking, you know, Ryan Reynolds, he's.

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
That's an awesome culture guy.

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,480
No, it's just a soy guy who's been like, like, bred to look perfect.

90
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah. I guess that's, I guess that's what I mean by it.

91
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,440
Have you ever met an awesome culture guy in real life?

92
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640

93
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,520

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,360
So you think what he did was awesome?

96
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,960
You think everything he's done is awesome?

97
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,120
No, no, he was like that though before he-

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes, toxic awesome culture dude.

99
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, I'm sick of this toxic awesome culture shit.

We wouldn't have made fun of you at all if you said "I like to call these guys the gods

142
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
of soy."

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
That would have gone over fine.

144
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
That was actually a soy boy.

145
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,320
He's more like a soy god.

146
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,400

This guy's less of a soy guy and more like lint-y.

150
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,360
He's like a lint chocolate kind of guy.

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,120
know it's like a hundred percent plant-based and like oh that's so

171
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,800
awesome honey come take a look at it like those

172
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,720
see that's what I thought that you were getting it like guys who say awesome

173
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,800
summer in the now that's its own culture yeah no it is it is like the guys culture

174
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,300
The guys who are really into CrossFit too.

175
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,460
Like guys who are like CrossFit is awesome guys and like

176
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,400
That's just like white people shit.

177
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Yeah, I'm just describing white guys in their 30s.

178
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,700
Yeah, you're describing like upper middle class white guys.

179
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,700
Yeah.

180
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,700
I mean, yeah.

181
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
I guess that is awesome culture to upper middle class white guys.

182
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Those guys are fucking awesome.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,700
It does fall under awesome culture.

184
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,600
The thing is we're naming a lot of different types of people and they're all fall, it seems

185
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,840
like awesome culture maybe is a bigger term than like reddit guy or beard guy

186
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,720
or 30 year old white guy I think awesome culture might have legs I mean we're

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,720
gonna see where it goes after this dude. Anybody who acts in a way that's awesome is kind of cool.

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,240
Guys who like awesome things. Yeah yeah no it's very obvious that they're like cool

189
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,680
in their in their private life or they're cool in like social situations

190
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:48,320
but it's annoying that it's that they're cool people. I you know what I mean? I

191
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,720
feel like you're making it more complicated than it needs to be. It's hey

192
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,640
man I didn't create it. God bestowed me with the term awesome culture. Yeah.

193
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
Showing it to people. I got hit I got hit with God's lightning bolt. Yeah. I'm coming down

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,440
from the mountain with the tablets of awesome culture. Uh huh. Explaining to the people. Trying to make awesome culture catch on like going to like

195
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
sneaking into like a DSA meeting and raising your hand like what are we gonna do?

196
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
What are we gonna do with awesome culture?

197
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,160
What are we gonna do with awesome culture?

198
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

199
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,320
Oh my god, hold on.

200
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,960
Here's my book.

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,040
Delineating Awesome Culture.

202
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,480
A study in upper middle class white men who say awesome.

203
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
Uh-huh and then semicolon.

204
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,600
And also guys who are soy or have beards and epic meal time.

205
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,520
and maybe and a guy who likes impossible meatballs?

206
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,920
Parenthesis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt vibes.

207
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah.

208
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Yeah, serious Joseph Gordon-Levitt vibes.

209
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,400
At least I didn't say Jared Leto. I feel like Jared Leto vibes is...

210
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,720
Why would, why at least? Why would it matter?

211
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,920
Yeah, what does that mean?

212
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
People would have gotten mad because people would have been like, "He's not awesome,

213
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Gordon's not awesome at all."

214
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
Right, people would have gotten very mad.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,080
He's crazy culture.

216
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,920
Yeah, he's psycho culture.

217
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
Which is another thing you've been working on.

218
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,320
Uh-huh.

219
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,960
Yeah.

220
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah. So what's psycho culture?

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
So it's kind of like hyper normalization.

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
You have my interest.

223
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,840
So it's kind of like how Jared Leto is obsessed with manufacturing consent.

224
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,920
Yeah. He hates it or loves it or he feels one way about it for sure.

225
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
I don't know. These are just things I've heard and I'm throwing them around.

226
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,280
Yeah. I agree.

227
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,480
Oh, fuck.

228
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,920
I've heard of Noam Chomsky but I don't know what he does. He's a breakdancer. He, I assumed that he

229
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,000
lived in a garden and he ate the plants and the farmer had to... And he was a chomsky. And the

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,640
farmer had to keep him away from eating his plants. He's a chomsky because he chomps so much. He

231
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,720
chomps on the carrots. Okay, all right. You're getting somewhere. We could get him on the podcast.

232
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,400
We tried once. Yeah, we did. We were the first. He tried to schedule it. Yeah. What did he say?

233
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
He kept blowing us off.

234
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
He would respond, but he'd be like,

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,280
"I can't do it right now.

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,720
"I'm actually busy for a couple months,

237
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,560
"but maybe in June."

238
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,960
- Yeah, he'd be like, "Email me again in June."

239
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
- Yeah, and then we emailed him.

240
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
- And then he'd email us back and be like,

241
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,240
"Yeah, yeah."

242
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,160
- Yeah, stuff's so crazy.

243
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,120
And it's funny that the second time they emailed me,

244
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
I was kinda like, "What the fuck's your problem, man?"

245
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
(laughing)

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,320
Like, seriously? - Stop responding.

247
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
- Yeah, like, what are you,

248
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
you're really just leading us on like this?

249
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
- What do you have to do?

250
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,160
Like, what do you, do you have nothing going on?

251
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,560
We already made this fucking poster dude.

252
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,060
Yeah.

253
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,560
What the fuck do you have to do man?

254
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,160
It's a boxing poster and it's us versus you.

255
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,060
And we had that shit printed.

256
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,760
It's all over Boston.

257
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Yeah.

258
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,560
It's in Cambridge too.

259
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,260
We used wheat paste dude.

260
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,360
We went old school.

261
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,260
We fucking hung them up.

262
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,660
We hung it up everywhere.

263
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Yeah.

264
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,360
You don't see enough of those.

265
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,600
they should do a pay-per-view fight with gnome chopsky on barstool

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,440
that'd be good you don't see any more what the the wheat pasted posters to like

267
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
sides of buildings whatever happened a lot in new york but

268
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
it's always like now it's like a rapper that

269
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,560
doesn't exist yeah yeah ricardo ricardo montalban

270
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,600
yeah new album is coming out that's the rapper's name

271
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,600
It's a different guy, Ricardo Montalban. It's uh, his name is also Ricardo Montalban.

272
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
I always like that when people try to tear him down and then there's another one right under it.

273
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,240
Yeah.

274
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,880
Yeah, that's pretty funny to just double make double do your poster so somebody

275
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,440
spends a bunch of time trying to get it off. It's like oh fuck, fucking fatty,

276
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
fatty penises, money on my ass.

277
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
Here's an idea.

278
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
Again.

279
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,000
So you, so you hang up one poster, right?

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,120
Yeah.

281
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
With the intention of it being ripped down.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,920
okay so it's also promoting along the edges oh shit mm-hmm so you hang up one

283
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,940
poster it's kind of shitty and then you when they try to rip it down there's an

284
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,080
even better poster under it but it's both of the posters are promoting your album

285
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,960
and when they try to rip that down there's a window behind it you're

286
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,960
standing in the window and you're pointing your gun at them your arms are

287
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,240
crossed yeah what have you like what have you like sealed a live bat

288
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,040
underneath the poster. So that when they when they undo it, they...

289
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,540
A dead bat falls on the ground.

290
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,040
No, no.

291
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,540
Is it suffocated?

292
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,040
No, no. It's like a freeze-dried bat and then it rehydrates.

293
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,540
And then it comes back to life and flies with them.

294
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,040
The air, the water vapor in the air is enough to just melt it, to thaw it out instantly.

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Well, no. You would have a contraption designed that dropped water on the bat.

296
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
There's fishing line attached to the poster too.

297
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,680
Yeah, you pull down the poster and it just there's just a thing that says please wait and a little elevator door and you just

298
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,120
Hear a bunch of clicks and clacks and like thumping and then after a minute the doors open in a bad

299
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:07,580
The contraption is they just they poke the bat a bunch yeah

300
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:15,560
The guy you pay they have a camera above the poster so the bat can see the person's face that's taking down the poster

301
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah, and also you think it's the one you're wearing like you're wearing like a mask like it's like a TV helmet

302
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,920
And it's got the person's face on the TV screen, so it looks like you're you're poking the bat

303
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,020
But it looks like you're the person's face. Oh

304
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,560
That's pretty smart actually that'd be some crazy shit. It'd be some fucking

305
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,880
sci-fi

306
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,640
Original movie maybe some awesome shit. Yeah, I'm on my awesome culture shit

307
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm never gonna live that down. Damn. Nope, you won't. No, I'm gonna keep bringing it up probably forever. Yeah, I

308
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,340
Don't get ready. Well, I don't care now. Yeah, I don't even care

309
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:01,080
Those guys I'll just I got one of those guys. All right, show me. Okay. Oh, wow. Oh

310
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,080
That's awesome. Oh

311
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,640
Wow

312
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,680
You're not making any sense of these awesome cultures. They just show me what it's like okay. Oh wow

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:36,840
It's not what he sounds like

314
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,440
Okay, all right, I wish I wish I was more articulate to explain what I'm or just shows or to play

315
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,120
Wow, oh wow, oh wow

316
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,040
This is can I do this is what I think Austin culture is like, okay, damn

317
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,920
for real

318
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:08,520
See that's a that is even a little clearer than oh wow. Yeah. Yeah

319
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,360
- Yeah.

320
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,200
- Oh man.

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,540
(laughing)

322
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,240
- Here's my impression of it.

323
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,360
- I wish I could have explained this better.

324
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,480
- Here's my impression.

325
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,320
- Yeah, do it.

326
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,140
- Okay, ready?

327
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,920
What was that?

328
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,880
It'd be something like that.

329
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,320
(laughing)

330
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,640
It's like an awesome culture, I hate those guys.

331
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
- Yeah, yeah.

332
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,280
- Yeah, this awesome culture guys always come to you

333
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,600
and you're like, "Hey man, what's up?"

334
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,880

They're always describing their features.

352
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,360

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,000

368
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
I even wrote a poem about it.

369
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Who wrote a poem?

370
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
You know, beans, beans.

371
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Yeah, I guess you're right, but they don't say baked.

372
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Baked beans, baked beans.

373
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Oh, you're right.

374
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
I forgot about that version.

375
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
The baked fruit.

376
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
I forgot about Weird Al's version.

377
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
Do you guys remember Baked Beans from Whitest Kids You Know?

378
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
No.

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Nope.

380
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:23,480
the comments okay what are you doing today I don't know I'm I'm this close to just

381
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,920
getting at you the baby beans I had last night maybe really gassy and it came in

382
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,960
handy since it was fart in the sorority pledges face night so it was time to go

383
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,600
over and by that time the gas was really one time to assume the position when the

384
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,440
first pledge had put her nose to sniff my butt I blasted one right in her face it

385
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,440
It was funny to hear a bunch of girls scream, keep farting in their face as pledge after pledge ended up gagging from the smell of my farts.

386
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,940
I bet their noses burned from smelling all the farts I farted last night.

387
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Even after I came home and went to bed, I woke myself up by farting really loud in bed.

388
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,440
That's not real.

389
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,940
Next stats.

390
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,440
For lunch yesterday we had hot dogs and my wife made her famous baked beans.

391
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Every time she makes them I load up on them.

392
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,440
After we ate I had to saw some pieces of wood with a handsaw.

393
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,940
As I was sawing, my belly started rumbling with gas.

394
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,440
I felt a fart brewing and I let it rip.

395
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
It was loud and smelled.

396
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,560
she walked outside to ask me something and she walked right into the fart cloud

397
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,560
she wrinkled her face at the smell I continued farting all afternoon okay so

398
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,680
what we got Nick Offerman and a sorority girl talking about their baked beans

399
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,000

403
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,960
after dinner I went to clean the bathrooms didn't take long for the gas to

404
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,880
I felt a gas bubble in my ass and when I started to bend over and clean I let it rip

405
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,340
And I just kept farting my girlfriend said she not only heard them, but also smelled them

406
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,280
I have chronic gas issues and fart all the time my girlfriend says I'm the gassiest 22 year old man ever

407
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:27,460
The gross dude yes, I love yes, yeah, just being specific about how gassy you are

408
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,720

He does I think I have a feeling all of these are written by him my girl lean the hard ones without nails

412
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,040
My girl learned the hard way not to stand behind me when I have bad gas

413
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,080
I had baked beans for dinner and afterwards while I was cleaning the bathroom

414
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,720
My girl was standing behind me while I was scrubbing the toilet and I had to fart really bad

415
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,120
I was bent over and I basically farted in her face and it really stunk. It's the same story

416
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,000
I just had a meal. Here's the next one. Yeah read this

417
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,800
These are all from gross - I just had a meal hot dogs and baked beans and I chowed down on the beans after dinner

418
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I went to play my baritone saxophone

419
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,760
Then the gas kicked in I was farting like crazy as I was playing my instrument

420
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:25,440
As my girlfriend said she could hear me farting, but nobody could hear me farting, but she could smell it

421
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
She said every time I fart it smells like what I ate and they always stink.

422
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,480
Alright, keep going. Next gross dude comment.

423
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,000
I had a veggie combo at a Mexican restaurant last night and refried beans.

424
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,360
At the concert I just performed in, I think my ass made as much noise as my instrument.

425
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,720
I could feel myself farting and I'm not sure how anyone in the band didn't throw up from the smell

426
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,680
because not only were the farts really loud, they also smelled.

427
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,400
I love the story he's created here.

428
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I mean, it's a universe here.

429
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
The gassiest 22 year old

430
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
who plays a baritone saxophone

431
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,400
which sounds like farts

432
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
*snickers*

433
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,900
The next three in a row are all about sports.

434
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,400
Football and soccer.

Another gross dude about football.

437
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
"I play football, and the only job I have as the fullback

438
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
is to block for the running back.

439
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
I load up on beans, and the running back knows

440
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
what way to go is by the sound

441
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
and smell of my farts. I'm not kidding.

442
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I fart the entire game."

443
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,160
God damn this guy here's another gross dude right here wait I want to read this

445
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,340
seconds I was trumping like a trooper when I came downstairs my sister fainted

446
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,680
and had a horrid look on her face then the pizza guy came and called the

447
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,560

448
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,000

449
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,840
fart and man did it stink she was really grossed out by the smell but I did warn

450
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:09,320
her that I had gas and the hiccups from the beans. Dude, gross dude's a fucking long suffering girlfriend. I had the hiccups too. My heart goes out to gross dudes.

451
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,240
Here's a comment. I am a girl I don't often fart but I just had beans my boyfriend and I

453
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Natalie Soden.

454
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,560
My friend is Mexican, so he eats lots of beans, so he farts all the time.

455
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Come on.

456
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
That's just facts.

457
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:37,560
If you soak your bean twice and discarding the cold water each time, and then you cooking it, it should not create any more gas in your belly.

458
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
I found more gross dude.

459
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Just wanted to share that I'm sitting in the break room at work, eating lunch and tooting.

460
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,640
We, here's another one, we had a cookout tonight with lots of baked beans. Caused a lot of gas,

461
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,040
especially my grandfather, who is known for his epic farts. I never heard anyone fart

462
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,960
as long or as loud as him. Anytime he ate, he had gas. You would hear a rumble followed

463
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,440
by a really loud, long fart.

464
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,880
Here's a good one. Oh, where'd it go?

465
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
No.

all that this is so unfair how are we going to make more wind what would Fred

494
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,040
Fartwell do Ralph and Henry eat from a can of baked beans so do fang and fluffy

495
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Who the fuck are Fang and Fluffy?

496
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
This has to be from a show or something.

497
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Mom and Dad want wind power. They're going to get wind power.

498
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,040
They high five with their spoons, then later they fart outside.

499
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,040
What? Poo-erg.

500
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:44,040
He and Ralph hold their noses. They look at each other. So do Fluffy and Fang. I'm guessing those are animals.

501
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,040
Wait a minute. If we're out here farting, we can't be inside watching TV.

502
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,040
They run back in only to find the TV turning off. It's already out of power.

503
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
What a sad ending.

504
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,960
Yeah, we out here farting fluffy and fangered

505
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,920
There their hat one of their Hagrid's pets. I looked up all right. I'm um

506
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm not oh

507
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,440
These all oh yeah, cuz it's Henry. Yeah, Henry Potter

508
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,400
Henry Potter Henry Potter

509
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,640
Ralph Weasley

510
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,040
Yeah

511
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,640
Let's move to number two yeah, he's oh

512
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,480
Oh here we go. This one, this is my favorite comment that I, that I've seen so far I think.

513
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,520
I got this friend named Grayson. He had cheese during the day and now he wouldn't quit farting

514
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,520
under the covers. He said he is proud of his creation but it lingers like a lost soul.

515
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:42,760
Oh my god. It lingers like a lost soul. Oh here's one from Gross Dude. I had four slices

516
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,200
of cheese pizza late after work and I'm paying the price by making toots in bed and I let

517
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,400
out several big burps to get the gas out so I thought I was all good.

518
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,520
If the gross food is to be believed by the way, he has on multiple occasions

519
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,840
revisited this list to catalog his farts from the night prior.

520
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,680
There's this this guy who said he had a friend named Grayson, he commented again

521
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,400
right after and said "I got this friend by the name Grayson. Apparently he had

522
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,680
cheese during the day, now he cannot quit farting under the blanket. I mean it's

523
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,680
lingering hardcore like a lost soul."

524
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,000
He's really trying to make his expressions stick.

525
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,080
He's kind of doing an awesome culture type thing.

526
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
Yeah, you ever heard of that?

527
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,200
Farts sometimes linger like a lost soul.

528
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Yeah, hardcore.

529
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
It's something I recently came up with.

530
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,080
Somebody's trying to dispute the friend Grayson's claims here and saying, "First of all, nobody,

531
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,400
and I mean nobody in the entire world has a friend named Grayson, so right there your

532
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,880
story is too ludicrous for words.

533
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,920
Asking us to believe that you had a friend named Grayson is like asking us to believe

534
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,900
in Santa Claus the Easter Bunny or the cystic fibrosis fairy gross dude says I'm

535
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:55,400
tooting in the break room right now what's the cystic fibrosis I've been

536
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,540
farting from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. every three minutes smelled like green peppers

537
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,000
and mustard gas my dad busted out the gas mask from the SWAT team it was meaty

538
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,880
my dad's on the SWAT team my dad's on the SWAT team and basically he swats me

539
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,800
every time I fart at my desk spigotty with cheese on the top SPI GGE TY

540
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,560
spigotty with cheese on the top and my brother almost killed me that night with

541
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,080
his stink I farted so big my dad thought there was a skunk in the house love

542
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:34,400
Dallas oh I I want to meet all these people I know I smell their farts I feel

543
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,840
like at least half of these have to be gross dude right yeah I mean gross dude

544
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,720
is he's he's let he's been waiting for a platform just to show xxxxx killer

545
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:57,880
machine xx comments I am a Packers fan she's had did you got onions yeah onions

546
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,080
which I don't think is that true does it I don't know I don't know but this

547
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,360
comment is bad breath for sure this comment here is suspicious I think it

548
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,520
might be gross dude. I'm thinking it is, why don't you read it out. Before practice with

549
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,440
my jazz band I had a cheesesteak with onions and onion rings for lunch. I'm the only guy

550
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,360
in the band which is very small but awesome. As I was driving to practice my stomach started

551
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,120
making noises. Right before practice I let out a muffled but pretty loud belch. The saxophonist

552
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,080
next to me was like "you have gas?" I thought it would help but as soon as we started playing

553
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,260
the farts started blasting out of my ass. It was like loud music coming out of my

554
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:41,600
bass sax and my booty except the ones out of my booty really stunk and the

555
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,280
smell wafted through the room. Some of the girls faces show that they were

556
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,800
grossed out by how bad they smelled. Well this is not him because he plays a

557
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,680
baritone this guy plays a bass sax. That's true yeah he couldn't be the same

558
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,400
person. I had a cheesy mash with lots of almost raw onions in it and then an hour

559
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,520
later all of hell broke loose the three cats are wide-eyed and ears pricked

560
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,160
every time another mushroom cloud of onion stink is emitted if they survived

561
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,960
the fallout they're going straight to a pet shrink to be checked for PTSD the

562
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,720
funniest thing is how these malevolent ass male strums defy logic by smelling

563
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:20,080
more like onions than onions itself themselves it's almost beautiful oh did

564
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,400
I I mean I do believe this is all gross dude it's gotta be yeah I think like who

565
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,600
made the list it's about a sit grocery made the list for sure nobody made the

566
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,600
list just it's always been there yeah yeah it's about a six-hour wait period

567
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,320
after eating an onion dish before they begin my farts could easily be mistaken

568
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,680
for an onion scented propellant lots of gas

569
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:52,640
other foods don't seem to have anywhere near the same effect I use leaks as a

570
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:59,720
substituting cooking when appropriate. He uses leeks? Yeah, ass leeks. Yeah, that's

571
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:07,720
that's fucking for sure, brother. Yes, sir. Damn. I don't, I've never had an onion

572
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,560
fart. I don't know if you guys have. Yeah, I think it might be like a specific

573
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,120
thing. Maybe I have them and I don't know. I think it's a thing. I think I've heard of it before.

574
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,840
Now I'm gonna have to test this theory. Yeah, I'm gonna have to eat a whole onion.

575
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,080
Onion like from holes. Yeah, I'm just gonna walk around fucking

576
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,980
My blast and my onion propellant

577
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:38,980
My ass ate some ramen with fried onions been farting for about eight hours now smells like rank mushroom

578
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:46,560
If your onion smell like a musher or your onion fart smell like a mushroom you gotta get your shit

579
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:58,140
Yeah, you're if you're mushroom smelling farts come from onions if mushroom for

580
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,320
For you might be a redneck

581
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,240
You smell an onion scented propellant that might be a fart

582
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,840
If you're making a bacon cheese lasagna with bacon and bacon and bacon

583
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,920
you might be an awesome culture guy. If you're in a jazz band with only one guy in it and

584
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,600
he's playing the bass sax and his instrument starts to smell real bad, he might be farting.

585
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,120
He might be gross dude. You might be a gross dude if you have an onion smelling propellant

586
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,720
that you spray out your ass every time you walk past. I found a schizophrenic comment

587
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,080
on the end of this onion.

588
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,920
- Oh.

589
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,000
- What does it say?

590
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,920
- Okay, we have discovered that not only do onions lay eggs,

591
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,440
they also reproduce at four times the size of their self

592
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,560
on a daily basis.

593
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,160
They also attended the orthodontist for braces treatment

594
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,640
and then a corn emoji and cabbage squad.

595
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,200
- That's not schizophrenic, that's just random as hell.

596
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,020
- I farted Thor this food.

597
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,160
I farted, I barley ever fart.

598
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,920
- Number four is some really good gross dude once again.

599
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,140
numbers eggs of course

600
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,500
this is this is really good

601
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,760
had like twelve double bags of my boyfriend's family cookout and i had so

602
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,300
much flatulence bubbly low-pitched duck farts slipped out here and there

603
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,880
i was most embarrassed when his uncle flex

604
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,360
i don't know so i let a big one about seven seconds long and he said

605
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,820
who baby girl that makes done did something vicious to those guts that

606
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,240
part was belt bubbly is house smell like you just put some warm eggs salad under

607
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,560
my nose damn then he walked away and I seek tried to secretly fan the smell

608
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:52,120
that's what I immediately know what flex looks like what he sounds like I know

609
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,280
what he's wearing I know where he lives

610
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,080
flex is literally uncle flex is leaping off the page he's wearing a cangle cap

611
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,600
uncle flex heard this girl fart and he knew immediately it was eggs yeah he knew

612
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,760
the eggs done did that eggs done did something something vicious to you baby

613
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,460
girl he liked it also that's he was like he was like like a sommelier he was like

614
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:29,080
like wafting it into his mouth yeah I was in history and I had a bad case of

615
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,760
bubble gut so I walked in front of this really annoying guy and I went until I

616
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,640
felt my horrible flatulence bubble around and I said here Larry deviled eggs and I

617
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,040
realized I released the bubbliest horrifically gassy fart in his face and

618
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,200
after the eight second long fart I walked away and stood there and that boy and boy

619
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,560
that fart stunk like I'd given him a deviled egg platter I said whoo-whee and

620
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,440
slowly fanned the fart away.

621
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
That's also Uncle Flegg's.

622
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,440
I think Uncle Flegg's maybe wrote this one too.

623
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,560
Whoa Nelly, I'll tell ya, I had an omelette for breakfast and I farted the whole way to

624
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,500
school and the whole day in it.

625
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,620
Super long and extremely bubbly farts smacked their way out of tight jeans and into the

626
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:19,000
faces of many freshmen on the steps.

627
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,240
Uncle Flex's tight jeans.

628
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Uncle Flex's tight jeans.

629
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,280
They smacked their way out.

630
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,240
Damn.

631
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm thinking about Uncle Flex now.

632
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Yeah, Uncle Flex is walking around with like leather skinny jeans with like a fart stuck in it.

633
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
A Hawaiian shirt.

634
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Like a kink in a hose.

635
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,840
Just getting ready to fucking absolutely let loose on some lady.

636
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Just like a bubble, a bubble in a fucking, in a pair of leather pants.

637
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Yeah, like an animal stuck in a snake in a cartoon.

638
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:59,360
Yeah, like when you get those in a box from Amazon or whatever where it's those packets

639
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
of air.

640
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,160
Yeah, yeah, it's just one of those, just ready to absolutely own some lady.

641
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,000
I had eggs for breakfast and all day at school I was letting out airy ones in class.

642
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,920
The best part was when I was talking to a friend and my butt was facing a group I hate

643
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,600
and I let out a ten second hot one.

644
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,240
I was just close enough to one boy that it blew his hair back a little.

645
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
No one knew it was me though.

646
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Did not.

647
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,200
Blowing someone's hair back with a fart.

648
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,220
I have six hard boiled eggs a day.

649
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,800
They make me fart a hell of a lot.

650
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,680
Mix that with vegetables that contain soluble fiber like broccoli and peas and you're going

651
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,720
to constantly smell like you shat yourself.

652
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Worst farts I ever had were 30 plus in one night.

653
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,880
Oh no, I had eggs for dinner on my hamburger.

654
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,120
I am planning on farting in my brother's room when he is in the shower.

655
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,440
It is going to stink, epic.

656
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,300
I'm Asian and my parents make me eat it so I fart a lot.

657
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,360
You do not want to smell my farts after eggs.

658
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,600
Once after breakfast I farted for 10 seconds straight, no joke.

659
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,360
Damn, no cap.

660
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
No cap.

661
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,660
That's how my farts smell.

662
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,660
I have a friend named Brooke.

663
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,240
Megan says hi.

664
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,380
I have a friend named Brooke.

665
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,880
I get nervous every time she eats eggs or beets.

666
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,400
Way to put Brooke on the fucking spot like that Survivor 101.

667
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,400
Someone just commented "Egg won"

668
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,400
*laughter*

669
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Yep, egg makes you fart the most.

670
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I had a egg buddy at 5 o'clock

671
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,400
and all I keep doing is farting.

672
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh, like an egg sandwich?

673
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
No, like an egg buddy.

674
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
An egg buddy.

675
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Yeah, I was gonna ask about an egg buddy.

676
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Like a friend.

677
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Like a friend who is egg.

678
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,400
I ate my egg buddy.

679
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
No, you didn't.

680
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Here's a comment from Red the Gremlin.

681
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,840
(laughing)

682
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,680
- Okay.

683
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,640
- Curry, number five.

684
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,800
- Curry, curry's up there for me.

685
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,720
This will make me, I mean just everything gives me diarrhea.

686
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,880
I think I discovered that having a sip of milk

687
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,840
will give me diarrhea now.

688
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,720
My life is awesome.

689
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,240
- I mean are you just lactose intolerant?

690
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,320
- I have no idea, I didn't think I was.

691
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,000
And then I just was like, you know,

692
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,940
it just doesn't feel right.

693
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,600
No, I've been the same since I was a baby.

694
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,600
I think I gradually became lactose intolerant over time.

695
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,120
If I can eat any ice cream but if I eat Ben and Jerry's I'm fucking, I'm letting out.

696
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,920
It's the love which is a secret ingredient you're allergic to.

697
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,920
Yeah.

698
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Yeah.

699
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Make you shit.

700
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Yeah.

701
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,320
It's all that freaking Vermont weed they're sprinkling into that ice cream to train kids.

702
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
To CBD.

703
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
To poison children.

704
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,200
I'm not gonna stop drinking milk because I will never let God win a single time in my

705
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
life.

706
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Ben and Jerry are in a-

707
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
- I'm trying to define my nature.

708
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,880
- Ben and Jerry are in a giant, like, dark fortress and they have a huge cauldron full

709
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,280
of ice cream and they're stirring it and they're going, "Mehehehehe!"

710
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,200
And sprinkling in weed and socialism.

711
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,280
- I hate those drug addict pieces of shit.

712
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,560
- I see those track marks on you, Ben.

713
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
I know what you've been doing.

714
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,480
- Come on, hey, it's Adam and Eve, not Ben and Jerry.

715
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
- Yeah, that's right.

716
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,000
- Stop fucking each other and fucking cumming in the ice cream.

717
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,960
over the ice cream that yeah disgusting fucking disgust smoking a smoke a doobie

718
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:20,920
and fucking each other over the ice cream beds fuck you dude fucking disgust me

719
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,120
it was crazy how that the the story broke after they released that flavor

720
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:38,480
milky ropes yeah Ben and Jerry they threw some milky ropes onto the

721
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,040
chunky dunks turn you to turn you to blammin Jerry fuck you you did yeah Jerry

722
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,280
Jerry's fine you can keep Jerry Jerry you're cool I know back I know that Ben

723
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,880
talked you into all this fucking I was gay fucking we did but do you think

724
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,920
Jerry from Ben and Jerry's is the same Jerry from Tom and Jerry's Oh which one

725
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,280
is Jerry and Tom Jerry he's the mouth he's the ice cream one yeah the mouse is

726
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:13,520
a good guy. Yes, you're right. He kind of is the ice cream one. He loves food. They both

727
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,440
love food. No, Tom hates food. That's true. Tom likes milk. Yeah, he likes milk. But Jerry

728
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,720
does too and it kind of makes for a bunch of playful situations. That's why he wants

729
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:32,920
to eat them. He's made out of ice cream. Ice cream and a drink. Yep. Five seconds of silence

730
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:38,440
Patrick said that. Patrick says that Jerry from Tom and Jerry's made out of ice cream.

731
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,840
You're right. Also, yeah I mean I guess, okay. Oh well. Yeah, he's made out of ice cream.

732
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:53,320
You're right. I had to do the logic in my head. I had to do the math. Here's a, um,

733
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,280
here's another, here's a comment on curry. I think this might be somebody who commented

734
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,960
earlier I kept waking myself up last night trumping like a trooper

735
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,360
trumping like a trooper dude here's that that's good there's another my wife is

736
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,480
asleep on the couch she came to the bedroom and started checking the floor

737
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,200
for dog poo only to discover the smell was from between the sheets haha I was

738
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:25,680
here's I was asleep on my bed and poo was smudged on my face I don't think that

739
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:32,080
has anything to do with what you ate. I think you got pranked on Jackass.

740
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,640
You got hit with the Brandon DiCamillo congratulations.

741
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,840
Yeah. Number six Brussels sprouts.

742
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,200
Ooh that's my favorite food. Brussels sprouts smell bad just being out.

743
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
No they don't. Yeah it's kind of the same. They smell but they're good.

744
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,520
I mean I like Brussels sprouts but they're good. They smell like fucking shit dude.

745
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,080
I've never had a smelly Brussels sprout. They don't taste smelly if they're raw

746
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,320
and they like sit on your counter for more than like 90 seconds.

747
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,760
Oh I guess I just don't do that.

748
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,800
Awful dude.

749
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,600
I guess I'll have to.

750
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,400
I'll have to think of it.

751
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,800
You don't leave them out for more than 90 seconds because they're gone.

752
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,280
That's right because I'll I'll fucking smell the fart smell and I fucking slurp them up.

753
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,560
Yeah.

754
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,400
Just shooting them.

755
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,680
The brussel sprout is part of the cruciferous.

756
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,800
It's amazing that we do a podcast where Pat's job is to read.

757
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,640
"Cruciferous" vegetable family.

758
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
- Maybe. - "Cruciferous."

759
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,800
- What does that mean? - No, it's "cruciferous."

760
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,760
- You're right. - "Cruciferous beuler."

761
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,160
"Vegetable family and naturally causes gas.

762
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,480
"Usually dairy has me farting like a Clydesdale,

763
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,880
"but this is just as bad."

764
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,680
(laughing)

765
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,280
- Do Clydesdale, I guess I've never heard a horse fart.

766
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,040
I've seen a horse shit all the time.

767
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,080
- Oh yeah.

768
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,200
- Those horses fart, too.

769
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,600
- Those horses got, they got fart around.

770
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,880
- The reason I know that is 'cause

771
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,640
in I would always read like joke books as a kid and there would always be jokes

772
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,640
where it's like the whole like about horses farting it's just like a thing in

773
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,120
like that type of joke I mean I always read those kinds of joke books always

774
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,280
have like specific topics they joke about yeah I told you about the one that I had

775
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,120
that was all about is all about leprosy yeah yeah exactly there's like a person

776
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,180
who wrote the book just has like one fixation that they end up writing like

777
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,300
20 jokes about. I guess it's a hundred and one jokes you got to fill up. I guess I am

778
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,940
aware of in movies a horse farting and his tail pops up. Exactly yeah. It makes

779
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,860
me wish I had a tail. Well what if they don't what if horses don't actually fart

780
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:34,820
that much and it's just the visual in the movie was so funny that it became a

781
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,940
thing. Maybe horses can't even fart. Maybe horses don't shit. Maybe when horses fart

782
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,520
their tail gets sucked into their butt. Mm-hmm. And they might have a reverse

783
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,700
fart going on and they burp they burp and it sucks in air from there through the

784
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,300
butt of the horse we should work at the zoo we should work at all my three

785
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,540

I'm a gay guy. You heard it first on the podcast.

794
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
It's just tuning into the

00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,700
(imitating a gay guy)

797
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
(imitating a gay guy)

798
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
(imitating a gay guy)

799
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
And then it just cuts

800
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,700
in and that's why Nancy Pelosi's

801
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,700
a pedophile.

802
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,700
And it's just the emergency broadcast sound

803
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,700
for ten minutes.

804
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,940
(laughing)

805
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,940
- Comment on Brussels sprouts in all capitals.

806
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:02,120
I am working on all types of sprouts.

807
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,320
- Brussels sprouts made me leave the room,

808
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,820
left the hamster behind, RIP Hammy.

809
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:12,840
- It's so fucked up to get a hamster and name it Hammy.

810
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,680
- Yeah, yeah.

811
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,220
- It's like you couldn't think of anything.

812
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,540
At least, even like Hamwise is better than Hammy.

813
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:21,420
- Yeah.

814
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,740
Hamwise the hamster that's pretty good right? Hamwise Gamgee. Actually you should work at a pet store.

815
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,660
Fuck a zoo. You should be in charge of naming all that. You should work at the puppy mill. I'm good at naming

816
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:34,540
animals. We've been thinking about getting a dog and I just saw a dog whose name was Jexter.

817
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:41,660
They dude they the people that work at pet shelters fuck up those rescued animals. He was heavily abused and he

818
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,460
is so afraid of humans. It's so like. I'd be afraid too of a human named me

819
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,820
Well they give them like new names at the show.

820
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,140
I bet that the people that work there, they start out naming them like, "Oh, this one's

821
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,580
Fido, this one's Rex," and they run out and they're like, "Oh, okay, then I'm gonna name

822
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,020
this guy's Legos, this guy's like Mega Bloks."

823
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,500
You also just get such fucked up names after a while.

824
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,180
You get fucked up names because every like Rob and Susie that you named ended up getting

825
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,660
lethally injected in front of you and you're like, "All right, I'm never attaching any sort

826
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,460
of real names."

827
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,060
My dog's name before, like when we adopted her, her name was Fudge.

828
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,580
How fucked up is that dude?

829
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,580
That's a good name though.

830
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,580
It's horrible.

831
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
That's a good name.

832
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,580
Can you imagine yelling that across the dog park?

833
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,580
Oh man, fudge!

834
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,900
What if it's like a dog that gets away, like you're like devastated because it runs into

835
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
traffic.

836
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Fudge!

837
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
No!

838
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:42,900
Like what if you're like, what did you do to Fudge?

839
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,020
Like John if the John wick dog was named fudge

840
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,520
Might as well like name the dog like dump or something

841
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,100
I would name it dog. He is a good one

842
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:05,300
Dookie is such a good dog name if I did not have a woman involved in this I would be naming a dog dookie

843
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,740
Right now is my dog shit dude

844
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,660
my dog do do do keep -

845
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:19,100
Dookie-do. Dennis Dookie. This is my dookie dog. Diarrhea doo-doo. Dookie David.

846
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:24,900
Diarrhea dump in his ear. I named him after my favorite song. Douglas Diarrhea.

847
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:34,660
Dookie poopie. This is the dookie dog. Yeah, it's short for dookies of hazard. This is my poop dog.

848
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:41,940
Yeah, he's a chocolate lab. He's basically a poop dog. Yeah, he's named exactly as

849
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,540
what he is my mom when my cousin got a dog and my mom got mad at my my cousin

850
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,940

00:50:50,940 --> 00:51:00,780

853
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,380
favorite vegetable it's crazy that they got them both yeah I hate eggplant. I don't like eggplant very much either.

854
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,580
I love eggplant dude. It's because you're Italian you're genetically predisposed to liking eggplant.

855
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:23,700
My wife touched my belly and I sounded like a chainsaw dang eggplant.

856
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,100
Oh man the egg and eggplant sandwich you remember that?

857
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:35,460
That thing sucked. Yeah that thing is terrible. I tried it once just because it was like

858
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,460
Are you putting a fucking-

859
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,460
Wait, wait, wait.

860
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,780
GrossDude's back on the next one.

861
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,780
We gotta step ahead.

862
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,780
Yes!

863
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,780
He's back on.

864
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,780
Number 8, Broccoli.

865
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,780
This first comment doesn't have a name on it.

866
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,460
It's absolutely GrossDude.

867
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,460
Had broccoli at work.

868
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,460
Horrible mistake.

869
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,020
It was my first day on the job and I was so nervous.

870
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,220
I get the worst flatulence when I'm nervous.

871
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,220
Farts smelled absolutely atrocious.

872
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,220
God, I was so embarrassed.

873
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,940
I knew everyone could hear and smell the gassy farts coming from my cubicle.

874
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,540
Later I was on the elevator with another guy and I farted a bad one.

875
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,020
I got really nervous and said I was sorry as I quickly fanned my butt as a couple other

876
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,180
loud ones bubbled out.

877
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,180
And he said it was fine.

878
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,900
to everyone. Later I decided to take the stairs to relieve some gas only to fart

879
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,480
a bubbly broccoli fart in a hot intern's face. Why is your ass... how tall are you dude?

880
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,180
Why is your ass always in people's faces?

881
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,180
They've got Ewoks in the internship program.

882
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,580
I just remembered like when I was a kid and I would go to like youth group I

883
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,500
would always get super gassy and have but I thought that it would be really

884
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,840
embarrassing if I like went to the bathroom all the time I thought people

885
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,060
would be like oh yeah that kid loves going to the bathroom or something so I

886
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,420
would just like lay on the floor on my back during youth group because it like

887
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,940
helped relieve the pain I was like this is way cooler than going to the bathroom

888
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:51,020
nobody thinks this is weird yeah I was so awesome here's the gross dude comment

889
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:55,440
yeah and this he has some of his classic themes going here if you want to have

890
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,420
bad gas just eat broccoli I was waiting downstairs to help my grandfather I knew

891
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,340
he was coming when I heard a bunch of loud farts coming from him. He toots all

892
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:07,380
the time when he doesn't eat broccoli anyway. There wasn't anything I could do

893
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,220
he was just sawing wood with a handsaw and as he was sawing he was farting at

894
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:15,080
the same time. When he finished he ripped another huge long one.

895
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,580
I-

896
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:24,020
Wait, see, he doesn't even eat broccoli in this. He just mentions that it'll give you

897
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,640
brought it'll give you bad gas and then tells a story

898
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:33,540
yeah see what it's like to talk to me gassy farts at a funeral it was terrible

899
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,240
I farted as we walked around to observe the casket and everybody had to walk

900
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,260
into my gassy cloud of farts I tried to fan the farts away but an elderly woman

901
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,500
caught me and said so you're the one who's got the place smelling like egg

905
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:10,260
rip ads every time I eat this broccoli the shooting machine not gonna have it

906
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:19,900

907
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:26,900

909
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,500

910
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,780
the break room

911
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,740
party

912
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,780

913
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,260
gaseous city

914
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,260
to pick up the break room

915
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,260
Number nine is pizza.

916
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,260
Hold on, I found a comment on the second page.

917
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,260
I found a comment, "I fart too much due to my unhealthy obsession with pizza."

918
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,260
That's from Pizza Guy.

919
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:09,260
"I do fart and smelling Italy. Absolutely disgusting."

920
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,500
(laughing)

921
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:17,580
- All right, number 10, soft drinks.

922
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,580
Bunch of gross dude ones in a row here.

923
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,420
- What?

924
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,940
- I've never farted after drinking soda.

925
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,020
- Okay, we just gotta get through

926
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,540
these gross dude soft drink ones.

927
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,060
- Okay, it doesn't make me fart, but gives me the burps.

928
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,460
Don't chug it before a game.

929
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,880
Imagine playing fullback in a football game

930
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,300
while blocking players while you had a case of the burps.

931
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,460
It also gave me a really bad case of the hiccups

932
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,280
the whole game.

933
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
was blocking all everyone heard the entire game was my hiccups and a big

934
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,760
burp

935
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,480
then the second one not only does Pepsi make a may fart a lot but it makes me

936
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,400
belt really loud that's why I am known as the belching blocking back all the

937
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,880
running back has to do is follow the sound of the fart or the belts coming

938
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,360
from me to know where I'm going to block and he can get the most yards and the

939
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,800
best part is the stink of the fart lingers I drink coke before a football

940
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,700
game perfect for a caffeine buzz but when you're blocking another player and you

941
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:14,360
get hit in the stomach you're going to belch really loud I play fullback and

942
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,120
the only job I have is to be a blocking back and believe me I belt belch several

943
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:23,160
times a game so much like like alliteration here it's so good dude

944
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,680
belching blocking back belching blocking back believe me I've built several times

945
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:37,500
times a game I'm the burpee black biggest baddest black black blocker and I bust

946
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:44,660
butt every time I block a full butt. When me and my BFF drink fizzy drinks I wet

947
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,700
fart and she burps they smell terrible so we taught the class bully a lesson I

948
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,340
farted on his face and she burped and blowed him for five minutes and she held

949
00:56:53,340 --> 00:57:00,340
it's not the fact that i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

950
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,340
what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

951
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,340
what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

952
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,340
what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

953
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,340
what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

954
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,340
what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's what i think that's

955
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,260
I'm that bully blowing belching burpee

956
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,740
Busting but

957
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:34,340
Here's here's another gross dude comment I chug two cans of dr. Pepper and after letting out a few nice belches I let several farts fly

958
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:37,800
Let that thing fly dude. Yeah, let that thing go

959
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,140
You love something let it go drink my butt exploded like a time bomb

960
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,300
Duh, coke is a soda frown face

961
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,020
I always drink Mountain Dew and I fart so much I have to go to my room and lock

962
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:57,260
the door until it doesn't smell anymore. You're running away from the fart.

963
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:04,420
Dude, number 11 is cabbage and it starts with the same comment as from broccoli

964
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:09,860
but just with cab- broccoli replaced with cabbage. And Survivor 101 replies, "Dude

965
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:16,100
you're not fooling anyone I read number 7." You have passed, that's a cicada 3301

966
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,060
test is if you notice that you have passed survivor 101 you're moving on to

967
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:25,700
the next round. Number 19 is green beans and the only one comment it says don't

968
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,300
make me fart. I don't know if that's I don't know if that's them saying that

969
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:34,780
green beans don't make them fart or if it's a threat. Please don't make me fart green beans.

970
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,900
Comments on refried beans Jesus Christ. Should we just read

971
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,620
through these before the end? There's so many long ones. Yeah which one is it?

972
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:49,180
Number 14 look at these I think it's not number one. No wait. There's a lot of gross dude also on chili

973
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,140
Okay, let's read

974
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,540
Chili or refried chili

975
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,660
I own a cleaning service

976
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,460
What

977
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,300
And one night I had to clean bathrooms at a restaurant after they closed since I knew it was going to be late night

978
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,020
I had a dinner later in the evening, and I had made veggie chili when I do a job

979
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:16,320
I worked by myself by the time I got to the restaurant the gas was starting as I was cleaning the first stall I ripped

980
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,720
A huge fart it stunk really bad. I pretty much tooted the whole time

981
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,180
I was cleaning and the toot smelled pretty much like what I ate and the smell lingered

982
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,460
Yeah, lingered like a damn lost soul

983
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:32,340
I had chili before for lunch before I went outside. I saw some wood

984
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:38,600
I was working for a few minutes before it kicked in my girl came out to see how I was doing first thing that happened

985
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,840
was I felt a good belch coming up so I let it rip and then another belch came up

986
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,000
and then it was all farts after that and they smelled real bad. Why did he have to

987
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:55,200
say he saw some- oh I'm a fucking idiot. He's sawing wood, he always saws wood. He plays football, he saws wood.

988
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,780
I thought that he said he saw it physically. Not only am I a

989
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,760
baritone saxophone player but I also am a drummer. The people in the pep band are

990
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,600
happy about that because the way I was farting tonight because of the veggie

991
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,600
chili I had for dinner. Someone was like, "Now the crowd can smell your ass instead of

992
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,600
us." Believe me, that seat stunk after I was sitting on it.

993
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,200
Wait, this is not gross dude, but is this like a thing? This is the second time this

994
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,280
is referred to in this list. A sorority wanted to find a guy who had the loudest and worst

995
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,280
smelling farts, so I went over for the contest. I had vegetarian chili so I could definitely

996
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,400
win. This is definitely gross dude. Yeah.

997
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,200
I won easily so they used my butt one night.

998
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,200
I ate it.

999
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,200
So they used my butt?

1000
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
I used my butt one night.

1001
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,900
I ate a ton of it.

1002
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:47,140
And all the new pledgers had to see how long they could sniff my ass while I farted constantly

1003
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,840
and stink up the room.

1004
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:55,120
Believe me, most of the girls were so grossed out by how bad they stunk.

1005
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,120
He went to the sorority with this plan.

1006
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,120
He was like, "I have an idea."

1007
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:02,920
"I'm gonna get so laid after this."

1008
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,120
Here's another comment from him my farts stinks so bad from the chili that my girl

1009
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:11,300
told she'd rather listen to me belch after dinner. I had chili for dinner and

1010
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:19,280
now I can't stop tooting tooting it's almost bedtime and I still have gas.

1011
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,920
God yes chili is king of farts. I'm sorry I don't I just want to keep reading

1012
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,360
green bean burrito number 25. Being a college student means you don't make the

1013
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,460
best dietary decisions. I was constipated I thought having a couple of bean

1014
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:37,140
burritos would do the trick. I was wrong. It did give me gas and throughout the whole jazz

1015
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,180
band concert, the Barry Sacks wasn't the only thing making noise. While I was playing, I

1016
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,580
could feel my tummy rumble and then feel the fart blast out and I could smell how bad it

1017
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,420
was. I continued playing and farting the entire time. My girlfriend was playing next to me.

1018
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:52,780
When I got home, I was still farting like crazy and my girl was like, "Seriously."

1019
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,660
Here's one that's definitely gross, dude, but it doesn't say it. I own a cleaning service

1020
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:00,660
and I just hired a girl who's a friend of mine who lost her job when Toys R Us went out

1021
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:05,460
business. She's a pretty brunette with a huge butt. We're getting ready to clean

1022
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,700
houses when she tells me that she ate refried beans at the Mexican

1023
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,340
restaurant and she has gas. As soon as we went into the house her tummy starts

1024
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,460
rumbling and a couple minutes later as she's cleaning a toilet I hear a huge

1025
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,020
fart come out from where she's working and then right after she ripped another

1026
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:25,860
one. Then I was hit by the smell of them. They really stunk but she's the best

1027
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,380
toilet cleaner I have and I'm willing to put up with her farting problem. So we're

1028
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,780
going to be cleaning houses and I'm willing to put up with her big smelling

1029
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,620
booty with a gas problem. Hey, if you're going to work with a good-looking

1030
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,260
college girl you got to put up with the fact that she farts like a dude and they

1031
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,760
stink.

1032
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,760
Okay, can I read one last comment?

1033
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Yeah.

1034
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,260
Okay, this is under number 54.

1035
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,760
Lamb.

1036
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Every time I eat it I can fart for England.

1037
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,760
*laughing*

1038
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,760
And they always smell like dog food.

1039
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Yum!

1040
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,760
*laughing*

1041
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,760
*laughing*

1042
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,760
Okay, folks.

1043
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,760
That'll do it for us.

1044
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,760
That's the episode.

1045
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,760
Oh, fuck.

1046
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Oh my god.

1047
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,760
Oh, fuck.

1048
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,760
I'm gonna cry.

1049
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,760
Okay, bye.

1050
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,000
(laughing)

1051
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,240
(laughing)
