1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,800
- Premium content.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,000
If you are not a premium subscriber,

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
please pause now and purchase a premium membership

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,640
immediately.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,880
(laughing)

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,960
- Okay.

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
Jinx, you owe me a soda is completely ruined now

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,460
because now, instead of having to actually physically

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,720
go to a vending machine,

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,360
you can just do a one-stop, one-click buy

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,720
on Amazon.com of soda.

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,060
- Oh, you owe me a soda.

15
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,720
- Okay, so for example, here I go.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,560
- Here I go.

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,460
- I'm going to Amazon.com.

18
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,960
- Jinx, you owe me another soda.

19
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
- Wait, you should order a bunch of soda.

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,320
- Amazon soda.

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,900
I hope I don't get some soda made in the Amazon.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,740
I feel like that's--

23
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,560
- Is this gonna be an Amazon,

24
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,200
can we do an Amazon episode today?

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,040
- Yeah, I'd be so down.

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,200
- Can we do a full episode?

27
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,360
- I'd be so down.

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,200
- Coca-Cola.

29
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
- I'm searching soda on Amazon.

30
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,040
Let me see if I can--

31
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,960
I can just sit here and I can buy 12,

32
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,360
say you jinx me 12 times in a row.

33
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,200
- Okay.

34
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,360
- I can buy that, I can buy 12 cans of soda for $8.99

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,840
with one click.

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,840
- Well, so here I'm looking on amazon.com,

37
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,360
I search soda and I'm seeing dry sparkling soda

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,760
in a glass bottle, 12 ounce lavender, four pack of 24

39
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,800
for $717.60.

40
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,200
- See, I'm looking right here,

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,160
10 pound bulk bag of baking soda.

42
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,120
- How much is that?

43
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,900
24.99.

44
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,740
- That's pretty cheap.

45
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,660
And that could handle a lot of jinxes probably.

46
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,560
- Yeah.

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,720
- I mean, yeah, I guess it's smart to just have soda on you.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,480
- We should just have a billion sodas at the apartment.

49
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
- Just--

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,440
- Or at the office.

51
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
- At least you should--

52
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,520
- We should send it to my apartment.

53
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,080
We should send it to my apartment

54
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,760
so that I can bring it to the office.

55
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
- So that we can, just in case one of us jinxes the other one.

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
- Here's a--

57
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,160
- You know they have new Baja Blasas?

58
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,920
- Blasas?

59
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,760
- I got so excited that I--

60
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,440
- Baja Blasses?

61
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't even really like soda these days.

62
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,880
- I don't either, I don't either,

63
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,200
'cause I went to the doctor finally

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,640
for the first time in like five years

65
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,160
'cause my health insurance is gone next year.

66
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,200
- Nice, okay, you're gonna finish your story?

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,160
- I'm gonna say the cool thing that I see,

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,260
which is that I'm on Amazon here

69
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,560
and I'm looking at, you can buy a soda button

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
like for a drink thing, for a soda fountain,

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,880
soda button and I scrolled down to see what, you know, customers also bought this product.

72
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,400
So the people who buy the soda button for a soda fountain also buy a Happy Buy Black Reptile

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Incubator 25 liters. Scientific lab incubator, digital incubator, cooling and heating.

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
Wow. That's pretty fucking dope.

75
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
I think that does make sense to me that the kind of person who would have a soda fountain

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,880
in their house would also have a bunch of lizards in an incubator. I think that tracks.

77
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Yeah. I would too, honestly.

78
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,640
Yeah.

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,440
If I had a bunch of soda, I would also have a bunch of lizards.

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
That's my fun demographic fact of the day.

81
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm going to be doing that on every episode now.

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,240
Just a little bit of demographic information.

83
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,920
About one person who likes one thing also likes another thing, usually.

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,080
I think that's, honestly, I think that's a fucking terrible gimmick.

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,160
What do you, it's not a gimmick, first of all, it's a segment.

86
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,000
It's an awful segment.

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,920
I just think that's not a good segment at all.

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,960
I think that, I'll do a different one.

89
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,120
Most people over 12 years old are anciently old.

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
I think I might have to do Caleb Unleashed if you're doing that.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Well that's fine we can each do a segment. I mean my segment.

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,920
No, no. You don't want to see Caleb Unleashed live, okay?

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,520
You don't want to be there for that.

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,920
All right.

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,320
Yeah, because you might catch a couple strays, all right?

96
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,800
Because my targets are getting hit by me when I'm completely unleashed.

97
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
I have a segment.

98
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
What?

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,120
I want to try.

100
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Let's go it.

101
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Get those fangs out you mouth.

102
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Get those fangs right out you mouth.

103
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
You put it, you put them back in.

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Don't tell me you glued them back on right now.

105
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Stop.

106
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Patrick was gluing on fangs before we started recording.

107
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Do you like my segment?

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
That's a terrible segment.

109
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
It was the worst segment ever.

110
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Yeah, why does it make your voice an octave higher for some reason?

111
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,640
It makes you, you do a bit, you replace L's and R's with W's.

112
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,480
You do a baby voice.

113
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,960
- You really lean into the kind of nerd voice.

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,680
- Do you like my fangs?

115
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
- I have fangs on right now.

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,340
- I have fangs on.

117
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,180
- Look at my fangs.

118
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,040
- Oh, I have fangs on.

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,520
- If we were in the same room.

120
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,360
- The same room.

121
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
- If we were in the same room.

122
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,020
- You can't even sit.

123
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,860
Stop talking like that.

124
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,700
- You'd be scared.

125
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,960
You'd be scared as hell.

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,920
- I would not be scared.

127
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
They're plastic fangs, you bought them from the store.

128
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
You look so ugly when you do that.

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
Stop making that face.

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,220
Stop.

131
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,920
- If we had this recorded on video,

132
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
people would like this.

133
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,160
(laughing)

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
People would like this.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,160
- If we had this recorded on video.

136
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,880
Can we record this on video?

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,640
- We should have recorded this segment

138
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,040
so that people could see my fangs.

139
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
- But nobody wants to see your fangs.

140
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,540
- Mom, can you record me on video with my fangs?

141
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm playing with my fangs, Mom.

142
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
Can you record a video?

143
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,580
- I'm gonna sing with my fangs now.

144
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,400
- No.

145
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,240
- Yeah.

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,680
- Please don't sing with your fangs.

147
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,200
- They did the mash.

148
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,560
They did the months so match.

149
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,000
I thought you were gonna say kiss from a rose.

150
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,120
How did that sound like kiss from a woes at all?

151
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,200
I just thought that you were gonna do a...

152
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,480
Cause I thought that maybe hitting the rose would have done you as funny.

153
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
There's no way that those fangs make you say woes.

154
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
That's not possible.

155
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
What are you talking about?

156
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,800
It's just my fangs that are doing this.

157
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,440
Now you're kinda, you just added kinda like a...

158
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,320
You kinda like added an old Jewish guy thing there.

159
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,480
My fangs are making me do this!

160
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,520
Okay, are you saying that old Jewish guys have fangs?

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,680
See, now you're getting defensive on their behalf for some reason.

162
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,760
No, I don't think that.

163
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,160
That is completely ridiculous.

164
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,160
That is completely ridiculous!

165
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,080
That is completely ridiculous to say that old Jewish people have fangs.

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
I didn't say that!

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,760
I said that you sound like you're making kind of an impression of an old Jewish guy.

168
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm doing an impression of somebody with fangs.

169
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm doing an impression.

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Alright, fine.

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,200
I'll take the fangs out.

173
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,160
Have you ever tried putting them on the bottom teeth?

174
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
God damn it.

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,880
Did your tooth fall out?

176
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,760
Yeah, he hurt his tooth.

177
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
No the glue.

178
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
The glue.

179
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
No the glue.

180
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
See?

181
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
Lesson learned.

182
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,880
That's why you don't play with your toys.

183
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
You just look at them.

184
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,440
If I take the back in.

185
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,120
Take those out of your mouth.

186
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Get those fangs out of your mouth.

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,560
- Okay.

188
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,760
- Okay.

189
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,840
That was a bad segment.

190
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,480
That was maybe the worst segment we've ever done.

191
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,960
- Patrick's Fangs is completely canceled.

192
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,300
- It's a banned segment.

193
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,120
- We're never doing Patrick's Fangs again.

194
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
- Okay.

195
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,800
- We're shutting it down.

196
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
It's over.

197
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,800
- What about Patrick's Two Front Teeth?

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
- Well, you already got a segment.

199
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
- You can't do a double segment.

200
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,940
- Well, I had to change the other segment.

201
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,340
You didn't have to change it, you did Patrick's Fangs.

202
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,200
You did a full segment, you did a full five minute segment.

203
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,680
This isn't Patrick's Fangs, this is Patrick's New 2 Frontiers.

204
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,040
That's not to say you don't get a second segment.

205
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,160
Well hang on, the other one was Candle.

206
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,720
The ratings were so low.

207
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
The ratings were never on the network again.

208
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,600
I'm looking at the live viewer count, or listener count.

209
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
We're down to four.

210
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
It's plummeted.

211
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,360
I've read that it plummeted.

212
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,920
I'd rather have four fans.

213
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
The release of...

214
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I'd rather have four fans.

215
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
You have two fangs.

216
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
- You have two fangs.

217
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,640
- Hold on, I'd rather have four fang fans than 400.

218
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
- Why'd you say fangs twice?

219
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,820
Take 'em out.

220
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,000
- Ow, ow, ow.

221
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
- Why are you gluing, every two minutes

222
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,800
you're gluing something to your front teeth

223
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,920
and you have bad teeth.

224
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,360
We've talked about this, you have bad teeth.

225
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,040
You are going to pull your tooth.

226
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,200
- I'd rather have four fang fans than 400 fake fans.

227
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Well you have neither, because we're at zero now.

228
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
(laughing)

229
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
Nobody wants to listen to your fangs.

230
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,800
- The Patrick's 2 front teeth segment has been a disaster.

231
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,640
- It's been even worse than--

232
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
- For the podcast about this network.

233
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,080
- Even worse than the Patrick's fangs.

234
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,640
- We really need a network.

235
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
- Yeah.

236
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
I think if we started taking some of these podcasts--

237
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,720
- I've been saying this for a while.

238
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,320
- Under our wing, then maybe they'll blow up.

239
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,280
- I've been saying we need to do a bunch of spin-offs.

240
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,980
We're doing, I wanna do beers we drank,

241
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,160
I wanna do a Caleb, Caleb unleashed,

242
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,160
which would be like every day.

243
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,240
- Maybe I could do like my demographical facts cast.

244
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,680
- Yeah, you could do your demo, yeah, you could do that.

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,260
Patrick could do anything not fang related.

246
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,160
Anything that has nothing to do with fangs.

247
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,100
Caleb and Lee should be like,

248
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,440
every day I do like a little 10 minute,

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,960
they call it a mini-sode.

250
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
And it'd be 10 minutes of me just like,

251
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm basically looking at the news,

252
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
like here I'll do an example.

253
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
What's the news website?

254
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,980
So I basically I'd go to CNN.

255
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Both parties push Ukrainian born GOP lawmaker to tone it down.

256
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,900
That one's kind of hard

257
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,780
'cause there's some stuff in there I don't understand,

258
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,020
but I'll try another one.

259
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,780
But okay, so like just an example like that one.

260
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,440
- I'm looking at the ratings right now.

261
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,980
They're wavering.

262
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,100
- Okay, okay, wait, hold on.

263
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,460
Workers in these two industries

264
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,500
are the only ones coming out ahead right now.

265
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,340
Yeah, what?

266
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:34,740
Only fans and probably Photoshop.

267
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,880
yeah

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,460
uh... hey and i was if i was on there to have i was like a second i'd be like

269
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,720
what do you mean that's that those are the same industries

270
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,700
all

271
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,020
home

272
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,340
you know see that i will get it and it's like almost like you're the unleashed

273
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,340
one and i don't know if it's a little bit better so just kind of like a

274
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,460
uh... there's a bit of a completely like to get to injured by lightning near

275
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,640
white house

276
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,740
uh... yeah that's uh...

277
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,600
that's i i was hoping for that happen yeah and we have a a biden skin is

278
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,820
lightning from Trump skin which was dark orange. Okay you can't you can't come on

279
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,640
you can't come on to Caleb Unleashed and actually do like one like one upping of

280
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,040
me like you kind of. Trump looked more like lightning because he was like an orange bolt from the blue.

281
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,680
I'm gonna throw a news story at you guys and we'll see who comes up with a better punchline.

282
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,120
Okay it's not really about punchlines it's more about like kind of being the

283
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,160
most unleashed so maybe Cameron has better punchlines and puns and stuff but

284
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,080
and is that what is it will she is the most unleashed i mean okay all right jennifer coolidge

285
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,760
says iconic film role helped her have sex with 200 people i just i want uh we should chop

286
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,560
her in half

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:56,000
we should chop her in uh quarters see that's a copycat and you basically owe me a soda

288
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,360
that is a copycat yeah that's exactly which copying copycatting is not a way to okay 200

289
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,560
people what is that what is that a colony of ants because it's so many people

290
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,800
that's not that many people I think there's a lot to people what is that

291
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,140
like a whole colony of ants and there's way more what was she in an ant was she

292
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,040
a queen ant it do you think ants is the worst bestiality animal here's another

293
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,640
here's another headline here okay Kate Bush was singing about anal sex and

294
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,260
Vaseline in the 70s? Kate Bush, I say great Bush, stick to the pussy, leave the

295
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:43,180
butthole out of this sex. Okay that's pretty good. Cameron, yeah your unleashed

296
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,100
moment? Vaseline, well my opinion on Kate Bush

297
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,380
vacillates. I can't decide if I like her or not. I think Caleb wins that one.

298
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
- That's right.

299
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,880
- That was not unleashed at all.

300
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,720
- Mine was clever.

301
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,300
- That was not anywhere near unleashed.

302
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,500
- Mine was really clever.

303
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,960
- Yours was not clever.

304
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
- Mine was extremely clever.

305
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,260
- Okay, also the listenership of Caleb Unleashed

306
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,360
is not gonna know the word vacillate.

307
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,900
- Well that's why, yeah, I mean this is,

308
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,500
okay, I'll do Cameron Leashed.

309
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,860
- You're more like a Bill Maher type, okay?

310
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,900
Like I'm more of a, kinda like, I'm a man's man,

311
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,300
and I'm doing, you're on the truck,

312
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,640
you're on a ham radio.

313
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,980
I only broadcast Caleb Unleashed on ham radio.

314
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,340
- Yeah, going ham radio.

315
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,860
See that's some Bill Maher joke, because nobody knows, none of my listeners have ever listened to Watch the Throne.

316
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,360
Okay.

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Okay, here's one.

318
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Israel was unleashing a wave of airstrikes in Gaza. It said it targeted the Islamic Jihad militant group.

319
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,960
The Palestinian Health Ministry says its strikes killed seven people and wounded another 40.

320
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
I got this.

321
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,260
Go ahead.

322
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,060
Wave.

323
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,360
Surf's up!

324
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,600
(laughing)

325
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,640
- Okay.

326
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,080
- Serves up!

327
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,600
- Yeah, uh, uh, strike, yeah, they, strikes,

328
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,780
they striked out.

329
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,080
- Struck out.

330
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,740
- They strikest out.

331
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,580
- Now, okay.

332
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,400
- I'm seeing here.

333
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
- Patrick, who are you gonna give that one to?

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,480
- Are they, I'm going on strike from this long ass headline.

335
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,800
It's like, it's, that's a freaking 12 hour day

336
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
of a headline. - That one's a little better.

337
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,560
That one's a little better.

338
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,920
But mine was so mine was perfect because it also it kind of made the point that it was a little too long by just

339
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,780
Focusing on a single word in the thing. That's true. You know what? I think this one's a tie wave

340
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,040
I'm waving goodbye to this long-ass headlines like a 12-hour day of work and I'm going on strike

341
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,240
Go how long the headline is I'm looking here. It says mark bar is real

342
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,160
Huh mark bar?

343
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,040
Mark bar, I'd rather have a Mars bar. I'd like to put a bar in

344
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,280
Mark Simpson's house and drink there

345
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:55,400
Mark Barr sounds like the name of a troll and I think a troll is writing these headlines

346
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,000
because of how ridiculous they are.

347
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,760
I don't think that you're doing a good job with headlines.

348
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,800
You don't think I'm doing a good job?

349
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah.

350
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,680
Hey, CNN speaks to doctor who performed abortion on 10 year old and here's Caleb's on leash

351
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
thing.

352
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
10 years old?

353
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
That's a pretty old baby!

354
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,940
(laughing)

355
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,720
- To be killing.

356
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,280
- That's pretty good.

357
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,120
- Yeah, that's a pretty good one.

358
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,240
- That one's gonna get him.

359
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,080
- Yeah.

360
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,600
- Yeah.

361
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,780
Okay, here, Caleb, I'll throw one at you, okay?

362
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,360
See if you can get this one.

363
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Watch Tubbs the Staffordshire Bull Terrier

364
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,400
love all her neighbors in these utterly adorable TikToks.

365
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Alright, let's hear it.

366
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,520
What was it?

367
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I'll give you another one if that one's not going to work.

368
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Wait, this one's good.

369
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Israeli airstrikes in Gaza kill nine, including senior Islamic Jihad leader.

370
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah, this guy's got senioritis and he's actually about to graduate from Islamic Jihad leader high school.

371
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Because he's a senior.

372
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Pretty good.

373
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,520
And the summer's coming up and he's basically got the worst grades.

374
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,220
grades. Watch this clever TikTok dog force his lawn mowing human

375
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,620
into games of fetch.

376
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,020
Well, the human sounds smarter because he knows how to work a

377
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,920
lawnmower.

378
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Caleb is unleashed today. Sunbathing pitties, Mayo and Olive

379
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,820
are the unquestioned champions of summer relaxation. Olive

380
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,680
- Olive Pit, yeah, somebody likes Popeye.

381
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
- Yeah, Olive Pits, what's that, Caleb's girl name?

382
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,980
- Yeah, that is Caleb's girl name.

383
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,580
It does suck having a name, a last name,

384
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,360
where when I name my kids,

385
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,580
10% of all names make it something funny.

386
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
- Yeah. - Yeah.

387
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,620
- Like Hamilton.

388
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,060
- What?

389
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,200
- If you call your kid Ham.

390
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,420
- Ham Pits?

391
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,900
What's a Ham Pit?

392
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
What are you talking about?

393
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Hamilton pits?

394
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
What?

395
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Why are you laughing like that?

396
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,900
You know, like a ham pit.

397
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,900
What the fuck are you talking about?

398
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
Like I can never name my kid like...

399
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah, you can never name your kid gravel.

400
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Or deep dark endless.

401
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Oh my god.

402
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
I could name my kid...

403
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
I could name my kid bottomless, but you couldn't.

404
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
but you couldn't.

405
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,040
- Bottomless Fetter?

406
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,980
- Yeah, that's a normal name.

407
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,060
- That sounds too much like Bottomless Feeder.

408
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,260
- Okay, Bottomless Doran, that's okay.

409
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,180
- Yeah, that would be fine,

410
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,800
but I could name my kid Orange.

411
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,700
- Orange Doran, oh wow.

412
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,900
I can't name my kid Orange Pits either.

413
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,020
See, anything that's like,

414
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,940
and like could be possibly used to describe a pit,

415
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,780
I can't do.

416
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,420
- Yeah, Patrick couldn't name his kid, I am not a.

417
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
I'm not adoring.

418
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,960
Because your kid would be adoring, see?

419
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Oh, true.

420
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
Yeah.

421
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,760
Tell you what, I'm not adoring your kid because you're going to have an ugly child.

422
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm not going to have an ugly child.

423
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
I think you were cursed to have an ugly child.

424
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Me?

425
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Yeah, I do think that.

426
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
No.

427
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Yep.

428
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,040
I think I'd have a cute kid and an ugly adult.

429
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
What?

430
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I think you're going to have a kid.

431
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,240
I think you would grow up to be ugly.

432
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,080
I think your kid is going to look like a far side kid.

433
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Me?

434
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Definitely.

435
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Yeah, it just looks like a torpedo.

436
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
Why?

437
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
What about me?

438
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,080
I think all the energy drinks that you drink, I think your sperm has a life-in-hell face.

439
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Okay, that's a good point.

440
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I think your sperms are eating their own tails and just rolling around.

441
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Caleb's kid would look like if Alfred E. Newman had a Mountain Dew mouth.

442
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Caleb's kid is going to look exactly like a jib jab.

443
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
No, because I'm marrying...

444
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, what if I

445
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,140
What if I impregnated what if I

446
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:19,600
Caleb's kids gonna have damn satellites on the side of its head. That's not true. Yeah, I have big ears, but that's just okay

447
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm gonna get like radio

448
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,000
No, he's not gonna get radio transmitted to it

449
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah, okay, if I have a daughter, I feel bad for her. But if I have a son he's gonna be a basketball player

450
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:38,380
player. Yeah. I think I listen I'm gonna be the ball. Hey, I'm gonna be the ball.

451
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,380
He's not gonna be the ball either. He's gonna be the listen. Listen, I've chosen

452
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:50,480
my mate well, okay? My father-in-law, full head of hair, okay? Yeah. And everyone in

453
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,780
that family is like over 6'2", all the men. So my son is gonna be, he's gonna

454
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:02,020
probably be like 6'4" or 6'5" honestly. Full head of hair, but I do think everyone in

455
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,580
her family dies when they're like 60. So we're just making a little bit of a

456
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,620
trade there. But it will be well worth it when I finally see, when I see pits hung

457
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:20,260
in the rafters of the of a triple or a double, he's got a triple double in the NBA.

458
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,780
Your kid is gonna get is gonna get frustrated and when he's like six

459
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:33,500
years old and he's going to eat you. I'm giving myself a big, I'm having a big scary son and

460
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,900
I'm going to teach him how to weight lift.

461
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,460
Dude, my kids are going to look crazy.

462
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,340
Your kids are going to get, are going to be like 5'4".

463
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Yeah.

464
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Yeah.

465
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,100
And there's going to be like 10 of them and they only ever stand in a line.

466
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I got, I got every.

467
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,300
They stand in a line with their hands behind their backs.

468
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,220
I got every like recessive gene in my family.

469
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,720
and my two brothers have full heads of hair.

470
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,540
My dad has full head of hair.

471
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,260
His dad, no hair.

472
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,260
His dad's got the horseshoe.

473
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,120
So I got that shit from that fucker.

474
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,500
And that guy's also five seven, so whatever.

475
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,380
So I think I'm maybe the generation skip.

476
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,100
Where it's like, oh yeah, you're normal until this fucker.

477
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,300
- No, your kids are gonna be born with no arms.

478
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,620
- I'm like, yeah, I'm the worst one on the Punnett Square.

479
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,820
I'm like my kids are gonna my kids are gonna look exactly like a combination of me and Megan Fox. You're I won't explain why

480
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,160
I'm afraid of what Cameron's kids are gonna be like

481
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:39,140
What do you mean Cameron's kids are gonna be born wearing trench coats and sunglasses

482
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:47,900
They're gonna walk up to you and they're gonna say something like there's a darkness in me, yeah

483
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,060
They're gonna get sent home from school for being too dark

484
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,260
work. Yeah, that might happen. Yeah. Cameron's going to have to homeschool his kids because

485
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,460
his kids are already going to try to like, they get caught casting spells in the bathroom

486
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,580
or some shit. Yeah. Oh, he levitating. Dude, speaking of casting spells, do you guys remember

487
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,980
the spells that I was casting on tour? No. Barely. There was a spell that I was casting

488
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,420
in San Francisco. Do you remember what just happened in San Francisco?

489
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,980
No. I was casting a monkeypox spell in San Francisco

490
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,220
the entire time we were there. Oh yeah, I do remember that.

491
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,740
And that was the first city to declare a state of emergency for monkeypox.

492
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,700
Oh right! You declared spells on every city. You declared disease spells on every city.

493
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,420
I forgot about that. I caused this monkeypox thing.

494
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,940
Dude. How many fucking people actually have this?

495
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,540
I've been just completely out of the loop.

496
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,140
I know, I just keep seeing, I just keep, I think it's fine.

497
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,580
I've been terrified of it because of my lifestyle.

498
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,420
You only get, yeah, you only get if you're weak, I heard.

499
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,780
Oh, that's an interesting way to say it.

500
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
That's what I heard.

501
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,380
I mean, I hate to repeat stuff like that, but you know I'm honor bound to repeat everything

502
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,940
I hear word for word.

503
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,900
Oh, that's interesting.

504
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
Check this out, look up...

505
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,900
There's only 7,000 fucking people with monkey pox.

506
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Suck my dick.

507
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:21,500
If you're honor bound to repeat everything you heard, there's a little thing called Chris

508
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,660
Rock the difference.

509
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,380
I've never heard of this.

510
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
The difference between me and you is...

511
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,100
It's that song.

512
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,620
Remember the Minions trailer where it's like, what's the difference between you and me?

513
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,540
it's like the minions and grew yeah remember the bill Cosby show where they

514
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,260
sang that song I was about Pokemon bill Cosby show it's yeah it's a bill Cosby

515
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,020
program it was on the Cosby shows a little intermission remember you

516
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,820
remember that episode of bill Cosby show where the kids are trying to make it's

517
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,900

521
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,900
Cosby yeah yeah I mean if he does no one about the stuff he does to people who

522

called a love potion. That's true. Yeah that's called Spanish Fly.

530

531
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,220
*sings* I love that song. That's what I call it.

00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,220
That song is called Spanish Fly. Really? I mean it has the same

533
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,220
effect. It has the exact same effect. It gets me bothered.

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,420
I think they were just covering each other in whipped cream.

539
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:45,500

747
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,580
Sorry fry machine warming machine is broke

748
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,660
Probably what they said you should send that to the news go ahead and read that one

749
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:10,580
You're about to read have monkeypox CDC advises no sex, but says masturbation six feet apart or virtual sex reduces risk

750
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:18,680
So these people are fucking sickos what the fuck

751
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,320
Yeah, I don't think I want to masturbate within six feet of someone with

752
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,720
funny it's so funny that's like don't just you like you have monkey pox but

753
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,120
you of course you can't just masturbate by yourself you have to go and be six

754
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:45,720
feet away from somebody. Masturbating six feet apart is so funny. Because I don't know because sometimes that shoots long. I mean

755
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,640
yeah I've had times that have shoot. Six feet apart I think you could still hit someone. That's still in the

756
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,600
splash zone. But I don't think nut has monkey pox in it. I think it's nut has monkey pox.

757
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,080
No the nut doesn't have monkey pox. Yeah so you could get technically you could

758
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,080
get nutted in your mouth. But I also don't I I guess if I was the one with monkey

759
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:10,640
pox and someone nutted six feet on to I would not want that to hit my rash or

760
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,160
lesions maybe. If you had monkey oh so you're kind of worried about it. I would not if I had I feel like maybe if I mean

761
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,220
'cause you can't spread it through,

762
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,080
but I would not want someone else's

763
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,400
kind of nut to shoot into my open wound.

764
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,140
- You're thinking of it like getting water on an open cut.

765
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,580
- Yeah, I might not like that.

766
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,580
- Gotcha, see I'm, yeah, I guess you're thinking of it

767
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,940
from the monkey pox perspective.

768
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,460
- I'm kind of trying to have an open mind here.

769
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,460
- Also, like how excited would you be if anybody,

770
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,540
if you didn't have monkey pox

771
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,180
and someone nutted on your chest?

772
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:49,700
if i i really have not monkey parks and somebody noted on my chest

773
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,020
i guess i would like that much either

774
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,460
probably

775
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,460
now so if you you i guess virtual sex maybe is a good option here because you

776
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,440
can use that thing on zoom where you can smooth out your face

777
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,580
and you will look like a jujitsu monster

778
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,500
when you join the sex call true true yeah you know you could be a good

779
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,700
- Photoshop elements. - Get a virtual background

780
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,200
to put yourself in a meadow.

781
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,620
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

782
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,500
- And a filter to give yourself like lipstick

783
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
and eyebrows and stuff, that could actually be really nice.

784
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,060
- Are you guys, do you guys ever think sometimes

785
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,500
that you're gonna get hit by a foul ball

786
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,460
from a baseball field that just maybe somebody hit it

787
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,320
so hard that it comes out of the stadium and might hit you?

788
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,660
- No, I can't say I'm worried about that.

789
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,260
but I am worried about like an icicle attack.

790
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,820
- I don't like somebody attacking you with an icicle

791
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,960
or it's just falls.

792
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,060
- It falls on me.

793
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,620
- You know what I'm scared of is--

794
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,940
- If that happened, it would be God's will.

795
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,500
- I'm scared of air conditioners

796
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,220
falling out of people's windows.

797
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,060
- Oh, that's scary.

798
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,900
- That's definitely scary.

799
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,580
- That's a new one you just put in me.

800
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,740
- Especially walking around like downtown.

801
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,300
- I feel like my main thing is cars.

802
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,900
I feel like I'm afraid a car is gonna go

803
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
onto the sidewalk and get me.

804
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,460
I'm afraid of getting behind the wheel of a car.

805
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,100
'Cause I feel like when I'm walking on the sidewalk,

806
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,940
I'm like, oh, this is a safe zone.

807
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,220
You can't get me.

808
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,660
But it's not like there's a wall or anything.

809
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,500
Yeah, true. They could just go

810
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,620
wherever they want.

811
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,460
Yeah.

812
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,040
When I lived in that basement level apartment,

813
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,500
I was worried that one day a car would crash

814
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,900
through the window somehow.

815
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,500
Wait, I just found a video of a firefighter

816
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,600
getting hit by

817
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,900
what the air conditioner

818
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,300
only there are

819
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,660
i'm sending it right now

820
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,220
did you guys see the video of the guy of the that way i think it was a k_-pop

821
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,300
group and all my god all this

822
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,100
best video i've ever seen so that is the only that is the greatest video ever

823
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,000
i've been so i think i've been watching it every single day and you know he's a

824
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,500
lot it's so he's completely fine he literally only his arm got bruised

825
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,700
it literally looks like he is entirely dead

826
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,040
he shouldn't have a head after that it's not that if you search chinese screen

827
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,920
crash it doesn't come up

828
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
yet it's just the website screen crash

829
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
yeah

830
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,640
cheap uh... i think some hong kong i think i texted it to you guys on call

831
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,200
no man he got the in green

832
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,240
oh yeah i think the firefighter all man's lead on that helmet on

833
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,740
feel like he's fine

834
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,480
yet he got back up

835
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,040
yeah i'm pretty amazing somebody takes a hit like that gets back up

836
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,540
Yeah.

837
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,860
Because like this, also what are the odds that the Chinese government just, this guy

838
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,380
actually did die and they were just like, nah, he lived.

839
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,380
What do you think?

840
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,440
Um, no, I think because it's more impressive that he survived.

841
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
That's what I mean.

842
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,660
I think that they're probably, yeah, it's probably some propaganda thing where they're

843
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,060
like, yeah, it's, he lived actually.

844
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,460
He survived an 8,000 pound screen crushing his head.

845
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,020
I think it was, well I mean, in China,

846
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,580
some of the technology they have over there is like,

847
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,460
I mean, it's mind boggling,

848
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,180
and I think maybe they could have a screen

849
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,220
that weighs one pound.

850
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,300
That's a really good point.

851
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,940
That screen could have been, you know,

852
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,620
that could actually have been a health screen

853
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
that actually heals you when it hits you.

854
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,380
They might have that over there.

855
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,020
That's a good point.

856
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,780
Have you ever seen the Carlsbad,

857
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,340
Carlsbad Gap credit card.

858
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,180
- I never understood that name, Carlsbad.

859
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,860
- It's in Carlsbad, California.

860
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,220
- Yeah, but why are you naming, who the fuck is Carl?

861
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,740
And why are you fucking shitting on him right now?

862
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,860
- Carl...

863
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:47,060
- Come on, you got this.

864
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,860
Come on, you got something here.

865
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,700
You have something here. - Carl Holtz.

866
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,800
- What?

867
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,300
- Carl Holtz was a German Nazi party politician.

868
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,300
What the hell are you even fucking talking about?

869
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,300
That's who the bad Carl is.

870
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,220
Wait, Herman Cain's dead?

871
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,160
Yeah.

872
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,260
God fucking damn it!

873
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,380
You've got Cain died from COVID, right?

874
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,260
Credit card to Scorpion.

875
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,740
Yeah, I just watched it.

876
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,940
Looks painful.

877
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,580
It's, uh, looks painful.

878
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,660
Have you guys ever been stung by a bee?

879
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,140
I'd never have been stung by a bee in my life.

880
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,140
Yeah, I got stung by a- no, I got bit by a wasp.

881
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,900
- I feel like stung by a bee is a bit of a,

882
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,340
you can get, they don't bite, they sting, right?

883
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,940
- All right, then I got stung by a wasp.

884
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,520
- You thought, do they bite?

885
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,820
- I think, I don't know. - Wasps bite,

886
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,660
but I know that you're not gonna say that.

887
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,480
- Bite?

888
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,320
- I just wanna see. - I know that you're not

889
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,140
gonna say that.

890
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,620
- I know that you're not gonna say that's right.

891
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,280
- No, they sting.

892
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,180
- All right. - I think something,

893
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,860
I think maybe some types of wasps bite,

894
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,320
'cause I've heard that before.

895
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,200
I think that, I think they can bite.

896
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,180
Do you guys have hornets in like Massachusetts and stuff?

897
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,540
Oh maybe it was a hornet.

898
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,780
Do hornets bite?

899
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,020
I don't know but hornets are the really big ones.

900
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,700
They look super super scary.

901
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,900
I saw one at the bodega the other day.

902
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
Nice.

903
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,980
Did you try to chase it?

904
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,460
No it made me a chopped cheese.

905
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,980
I was driving down the street while I was on vacation.

906
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,700
Me and my brother we were driving and a bee, we noticed that a bee was in the car and then

907
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:27,160
the bee tried to attack me and I swatted it away but I swatted it towards my

908
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:32,060
brother and then we couldn't find it again so and then he was mad at me all

909
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,480
day he was like oh you swatted the bee at me you swatted the bee at me and I was

910
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,900
like first of all the bee was gone after I swatted it so he flew out of the

911
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,020
window probably most likely second of all if I if I have a bee on me I'm not

912
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,100
worried about anybody else I'm just trying to get the bee off of my body

913
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,820
that's right that's what you should be doing I should be like oh I have to I

914
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,060
have to swat it in a way where it doesn't like fight that's like a fighter

915
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:08,460
every man for himself oh yeah like be in a room I'm not concerned about it's the

916
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,100
same wife yeah it's the same like it's the same thing is like it's like

917
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,300
collateral damage it's like the same as like like you know if like a drone hits

918
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:24,460
like a wedding it's like yeah we got the target and I'm not so worried about how

919
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,700
many other people if there was a caterer there if the DJ was there or whatever

920
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,180
and that's how I feel about bees it's just like I fucking hate bees I hate all

921
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:38,380
bugs I hate every single bug I'm not a fan of bees are there some bugs that I

922
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,460
think are fine. See that's weird that's so weird to like bugs I feel like bugs

923
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,300
I mean I don't I think there I like looking at pictures of them but I

924
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,340
wouldn't like being I wouldn't like like touching them or anything I feel like

925
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,940
that's weird. It's clear to me that that God in seven days made every part of the earth

926
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:01,340
he made every animal every lovely beautiful vista on this on this green

927
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,580
earth and then he gave he said told the devil he was like you can make one you

928
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,580
You can make a single thing.

929
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,980
There's a few things that I think the devil has made.

930
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,460
Besides bugs?

931
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,460
Yeah.

932
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,620
I think he made every bug.

933
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,420
I think I hate every single bug.

934
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,380
I honestly hate butterflies.

935
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,060
I fucking hate butterflies.

936
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,620
That's a little...

937
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,620
It's a bug.

938
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,620
That's a little too much.

939
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,900
It's a bit strange of you.

940
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:28,980
I don't want any bug anywhere near me.

941
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,380
What else do you think the devil made?

942
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,500
What about yourself?

943
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,020
basically a bald head is like the shiny back of a beetle. Wow. What the fuck are you even

944
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,660
talking about? You said that about your own friend. Bald head is a shiny back of a beetle.

945
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:51,940
You said that about your own ass friend. My ass friend? Uh, paws. Bugs don't have paws. Sorry

946
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:58,020
guys, I'm free associating. I can't stop. Cats have paws. You're one cool cat. I'm sorry I said that.

947
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:06,260
Now he's rapping. Holy shit. Holy fuck. Wow. Splat is what a bug should do.

948
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,500
Bug on a window. Yep. Mm-hmm. Skunk in the barnyard. But instead, many bugs will flew

949
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,220
into your window, into your house. They are more annoying than a mouse.

950
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,980
Yep. Keep going. Keep going. Yes. Oh my god, Cameron. A mouse likes cheese,

951
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,460
but a bug likes these. And I'm pointing to a picture of a guy being stung.

952
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,040
Damn, God damn.

953
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,380
These activities.

954
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,980
Holy shit, fuck, oh my God.

955
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,720
Like stinging freaks.

956
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,560
Oh.

957
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,640
And normal guys, and so do flies also sting.

958
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,760
They say flies can't sting, but I know the true thing.

959
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,700
Flies have a stinger, it's right under their dinger.

960
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,220
Yes, that's where it is.

961
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,800
Yep.

962
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,980
That's dead ass facts.

963
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,340
And flies like to buzz.

964
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,160
Light year.

965
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,480
That one of you guys should say light year.

966
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,320
Wait, I'll do it.

967
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,140
Light year.

968
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,980
Flies like to buzz.

969
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,820
Light year.

970
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:59,820
I like my cuz. Light beer! Because your cousin likes light beer. Yeah we drink light beer.

971
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:16,740
Before Thanksgiving, it's giving cousin time. It's giving cousin time. That's good. It's

972
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,620
Thanksgiving long walks with my cousin at Thanksgiving.

973
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,620
Thanksgiving cousin time.

974
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,420
Dude, I had some serious cousin time

975
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,260
this past couple weeks.

976
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,160
It was fucking, it was awesome.

977
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,660
It's so funny to be like hanging out with your cousins

978
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,240
as like a completely grown man.

979
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,080
Yeah.

980
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,820
It's so dope, dude.

981
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,340
I love my cousins.

982
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,180
Damn.

983
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,180
Damn.

984
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,440
Damn.

985
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,280
Damn.

986
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,540
It's honestly dope as hell to have an extended family.

987
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,720
Okay, we got 10 minutes.

988
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
Oh my god dude.

989
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
I was going to buy a new backpack.

990
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,720
It's so funny.

991
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,120
You can see him literally because he has two monitors.

992
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,640
So you see him going like this and his eyes are just going back and forth as he's scanning

993
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,500
every item on the page.

994
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
You ain't slick.

995
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
See I make it.

996
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,760
You're literally like a human barcode reader.

997
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,880
I was going to get a new backpack.

998
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
I make a specific effort to show you guys.

999
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,280
I have two hands on my fucking microphone right now.

1000
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
I'll do this, okay?

1001
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Yeah, there we go.

1002
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,800
You know what it was? You know what it was? I looked up that Carlsbad Scorpion video.

1003
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,960
And then you just didn't say anything for ten full minutes and looked at backpacks.

1004
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,520
And I had to rap.

1005
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,080
And you didn't have to rap. The rapping was pretty dope.

1006
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,420
I don't know what about watching that video was like, "Oh, the straps on my duffel bag

1007
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,200
just broke. I should just get something easier to carry my skateboard around."

1008
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,920
I need a new backpack. I wear a backpack almost every day.

1009
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
I can give you my old one.

1010
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,760
Mine is yellow and it looks suspiciously like a Fjallraven backpack.

1011
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,680
Yeah, your backpack's really funny.

1012
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,080
Yeah, my backpack is so si- I've had this same backpack since like the beginning of high school.

1013
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,280
It's like a hiking backpack.

1014
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,760
I might have to take you up on that offer because I low-key need a backpack.

1015
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,200
But I'd have to buy this backpack here.

1016
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,520
But not right now while we're recording the show.

1017
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,160
Yeah.

1018
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,600
I don't think that you need to do that.

1019
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,560
Okay.

1020
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,120
I feel like you're ripe for like maybe a like-

1021
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,920
I tried to, I literally like this week,

1022
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,520
because I'm getting kicked off

1023
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,220
my parents insurance next year,

1024
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:21,200
I have been trying to get back on Adderall so bad.

1025
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,120
Just trying to get, like trying to go to the doctor?

1026
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,360
I tried to set up an appointment to get put back on it,

1027
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,200
but like--

1028
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,440
You have to get a psychiatrist.

1029
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,480
Yeah, yeah, TikTok has convinced so many people

1030
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,280
that they have like fucking ADHD

1031
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,200
and they've been writing so many like Adderall prescriptions.

1032
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,880
- I think there's some kind of limit on them now.

1033
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,640
They made it really hard to get an Adderall prescription.

1034
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,440
- Well, it was already like that before TikTok.

1035
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,400
I mean, it's just been a controlled substance for forever.

1036
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,600
And it was already over-prescribed

1037
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,640
before it's even more over-prescribed now.

1038
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,720
- When I was on it in like high school and shit,

1039
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,040
I had to like go to my doctor,

1040
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,760
wait for him to write the prescription,

1041
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,680
have him write it, go to Walgreens,

1042
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,320
wait another hour to get that filled.

1043
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,840
- Yeah, you have to get a new prescription

1044
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,300
every single time you fill it.

1045
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,120
Like you can't just auto refill.

1046
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,040
- Yeah.

1047
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,180
- It's crazy.

1048
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,280
- Did you start getting on Kratom?

1049
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,200
- I did, I started doing that.

1050
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,080
- You tried Kratom?

1051
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,160
- Shai sent me those, like the Adol and the Relaxaid.

1052
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,680
(laughing)

1053
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,740
And so I took the Adol, and I didn't like the Adol,

1054
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,080
but the Relaxaid, Relaxaid's tight.

1055
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,600
- Does it have Kratom in it?

1056
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,440
- It's like Kratom and like melatonin.

1057
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,680
(laughing)

1058
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:35,800
(laughing)

1059
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,120
- I give that's a glowing endorsement of a relax aid.

1060
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,660
I had a crazy ass, very vivid dream the other night.

1061
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,160
And I don't get those often.

1062
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,400
- Dude, I need to go pick up some Kratom.

1063
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,560
- Dude, I have a bunch of relax aid.

1064
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,480
- 'Cause there's different kinds of Kratom.

1065
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,840
That's why Kratom's so scary.

1066
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,720
There's Kratom that you can take that just makes you like,

1067
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,640
like it like hypes you up.

1068
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,380
And then there's Kratom, if you take too much,

1069
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,680
it feels like you like did, you took like an oxy.

1070
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,840
So maybe I'll have to do that.

1071
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,120
I wanna take like 500 kratoms and see if I survive.

1072
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,080
- Dude, RelaxAid, glowing endorsement.

1073
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,880
Well, I'll say that now.

1074
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,640
- Yeah.

1075
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,480
- Perfect.

1076
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,040
- What else did-- - Perfect pill.

1077
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,280
- What else did the doctor,

1078
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,120
did you try to do that thing where you go to the doctor

1079
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,840
and you have like a specific thing

1080
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,080
that you wanna get out of the doctor?

1081
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,440
So you say like--

1082
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,280
- I went to the doctor-- - Oh, you're like

1083
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,600
a dialogue tree?

1084
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,440
- Yeah, yeah, you're like-- - I went to the doctor

1085
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,240
because I was trying to get Adderall--

1086
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,320
- I'm too sleepy. - And he said,

1087
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,040
he said, "Oh, you have to go to a psychiatrist."

1088
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,800
- But did he refer you to anything?

1089
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,680
- No, I tried to, I looked through my insurance thing.

1090
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,160
- That means you did a really bad job with the doctor.

1091
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,720
He didn't refer you.

1092
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,560
- Yeah.

1093
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,360
- Wait, did you tell the doctor

1094
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,880
I want to get an Adderall prescription?

1095
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,040
- Yeah, I was like, I'm trying to get back on.

1096
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,960
I was like, I have ADHD and I'm trying to get back on

1097
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,280
Adderall, and the guy was like,

1098
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,240
oh, you have to go to a psychiatrist.

1099
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,480
Just look in your network.

1100
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,600
If you say I'm trying to get a drug,

1101
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,960
the doctor's not gonna help you at all.

1102
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,800
- Yeah.

1103
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,200
(laughing)

1104
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,700
- That's so funny.

1105
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:15,320
Basically I'm addicted to this drug and I need to get it.

1106
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,200
- The last doctor I ever saw was my pediatrician

1107
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,840
five years ago and he used to write my prescription

1108
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,360
so I thought that I would just have to say

1109
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,480
the same thing that I say to him.

1110
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Yeah, I who's know that my old psychiatrist was like that.

1111
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,520
I could I would just be like, oh, I want I can you raise my dosage of Adderall and also

1112
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
can you do that?

1113
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,760
Like I would just tell him what I wanted and he would just write it.

1114
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:48,000
It's pretty swaggy and his name was I like my doctor's name on this podcast before in

1115
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,720
my eyes the prescription of the best prescription is probably waking up at 6 a.m.

1116
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,720
Go and surfing.

1117
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
Oh my God.

1118
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,240
Don't even just enjoying so many dolphins on the beach.

1119
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,280
Oh, yeah, I don't think I've ever seen a dolphin. Did you have a guy do a romantic contact with them? No, no

1120
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,080
I think I saw a guy do a backflip on a surfboard and like keep surfing. That's sick

1121
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,500
He was riding a wave and he did a backflip. I think that's a different name

1122
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,120
I could probably fall in love with a dolphin. What do you mean? It's not a backflip. He flipped over backwards. I

1123
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,200
Think that's a that's a it's a way. That's called a wind to go flip

1124
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,000
I think that I could non-sexually fall in love with a dolphin in like a before

1125
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,460
sunrise kind of way. Yeah, they don't have sex before sunrise, right?

1126
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,560
But I could just sit there, yeah, I don't know I've never seen it I just know they

1127
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,880
talk a lot so I just sit there and I just yeah so I just sit there and I just talk

1128
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,840
to the dolphin all day and just like fall in love. I don't know I feel like

1129
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,040
that's definitely possible. You can see all the water. Yeah but I would always I'd

1130
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,360
probably be in like a kind of a tank that I designed to fall in love with the

1131
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,380
dolphin that'd be up to my up to my waist. So you'd like to pick out the

1132
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,920
dolphin beforehand? Would you know which dolphin you are trying to fall in love with?

1133
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,920
Pick the hottest one. And what's your criteria for that? Because you

1134
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,600
haven't fallen in love with it yet right? You don't fall in love with it till you

1135
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,000
spend some time in the tank. Well kind of picking one that you would like to fall

1136
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,160
in love with and then kind of like falling in love with it. Let's think about that. That's actually that's a good point. How do you choose the hottest of an

1137
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:23,760
animal. I would say, so if I say you're an alien right? Or aliens are coming or

1138
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,920
whatever there's there's an alien species and we're making you know one of those

1139
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,920
one of those toys where you spin the button and it hits an animal and it

1140
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,000
makes the animal sound like the cow goes "moo" like those toys. But we're

1141
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,120
adding but we're adding humans to it okay? So I think that the one that you

1142
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,440
would choose, the human you would choose would just be like the hottest human

1143
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:49,840
right? Because you want to represent the best. You want the best for

1144
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,520
something like that. Sure. So I would probably take one of those toys or

1145
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,480
whichever one has a dolphin on it and I would kind of compare every dolphin to

1146
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,080
the picture that's on the toy. But dolphins didn't make that toy. A person made that toy.

1147
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,280
So that's whatever dolphin the person who made the toy thought was hottest.

1148
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,480
So I'm just trusting that person to have pretty good taste. You're trusting them slowly.

1149
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,760
I mean even though they've picked the hottest dolphin, cow, pig, cat, they've said that they'd...

1150
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,120
I mean...

1151
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,280
Dolphins are like the rapist animal.

1152
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,520
Yeah.

1153
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,640
So I think that's humans for the most part.

1154
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:22,760
Yeah, I would say humans are probably...

1155
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,560
I don't think it'd be hard for you to fuck a dolphin if that's what you said.

1156
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,960
I didn't... I already said I don't want to fuck a dolphin. I just...

1157
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,360
I got distracted. I saw another headline.

1158
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:34,760
There he goes. I think that I can have a mental connection with a dolphin...

1159
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,240
- Addison Rae advertising for Adidas

1160
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,960
in a Holy Trinity bikini,

1161
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,320
all I'm going to say is these people

1162
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,220
are just going to learn the hard way not to play with God.

1163
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,900
- That's a headline?

1164
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,840
- That is not a headline,

1165
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,300
that's just something somebody said about a headline.

1166
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,440
- Oh, okay, so you're not actually looking at a headline,

1167
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,280
you're looking at some kind of comment.

1168
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,480
- No, I'm looking at a picture of Addison Rae.

1169
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,360
- Okay, cool.

1170
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,740
But so I think that maybe what you should do

1171
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,660
is you should find the guy who made the spinning wheel toy

1172
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:11,660
and like talk to him and like see what's up.

1173
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,740
- Well I would also I guess, I would wanna find--

1174
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,980
- Caleb would you wear this praying bikini?

1175
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,460
- We're having a really important discussion Patrick.

1176
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,860
- I'm having, I have a very important question.

1177
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,700
Can Caleb wear the praying bikini?

1178
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,100
- I would wear any bikini at any time.

1179
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:26,940
- Yeah. - Okay.

1180
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:27,760
- Anything-- - Then you're

1181
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,100
disrespecting God.

1182
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,380
- Anything, no I'm not first of all.

1183
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,220
- Yeah you are because it says--

1184
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,900
disrespect to God. Because it says father on one boob son on the other one and then

1185
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,900
says Holy Spirit on the vagina. I remember my first time in God I remember my first

1186
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:47,060
time cussing in church. Damn. In a church yeah my my friend Jordan who became a he

1187
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:53,300
went into juggalo the juggalo world shortly after. So did Cameron. He said he said yeah I

1188
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,500
would never cuss in church and I said who gives a shit. No way. I swear to God I

1189
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,180
I said that. I said that. It was Sunday morning too. I think I said that. And here's what I

1190
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:08,740
was, here's the worst part because I was, I was a vegan and I couldn't have the, I

1191
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:13,220
couldn't have the, the like donuts and stuff they would bring for church on

1192
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:17,320
Sundays. I would take those those coffee creamers, those non-dairy coffee creamers

1193
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,820
and I would just drink them. So I probably, probably shortly after that I did a shot

1194
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:28,320
of some kind of coffee creamer. That's what the weird kid always does. I remember

1195
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,400
people doing that. Yeah but I was cool. I was really cool. I was, I could, there was a

1196
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,680
tree on the side of the church that I set the record for highest. That's not cool.

1197
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,640
That's just disrespectful and strange. You're literally have it, you have a shirt

1198
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,300
on right now that says the H word on it. No it doesn't. It actually says, I see that it says

1199
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:55,160
H-E-L-L. H-E double hockey sticks right there. No it says he. No it doesn't. He.

1200
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:00,160
It clearly says "he" right here. What about "full of heat" because that's what hell's full of and

1201
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,920
that's where Cameron's going for wearing a shirt that promotes it. I'm not going there.

1202
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,480
You're wearing a shirt that promotes hell. I'm not going there! You will be going to hell.

1203
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,400
God will grab you by your ear and drag you down to hell. I don't want to go there. You will go to hell.

1204
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,800
God can't touch my ear because I wear headphones. See the fact that you're

1205
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,800
already missing... Over a ear. You're underestimating God. It's like that's a clear...

1206
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,000
- I don't want to go to hell.

1207
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,840
- No, you're going.

1208
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,960
- I don't wanna go.

1209
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,200
I don't wanna go, I'm not gonna go.

1210
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,040
- I don't think it would work.

1211
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,840
- You can't make me go, I'll run away.

1212
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,040
(laughing)

1213
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,400
- I'll scream.

1214
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,680
If you make me go to hell, I'll scream.

1215
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,400
- I'm gonna tell everyone you kidnapped me

1216
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,300
and brought me here.

1217
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,680
I'll be pissed off.

1218
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,040
- I need to start doing that more.

1219
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,000
There was a scary guy,

1220
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,720
I took Phil to the park the other night

1221
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,040
and I ate an edible and I was like way too high

1222
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,600
to get into a combat scenario

1223
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,240
And there was like a scary guy that was like hiding behind

1224
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,360
like the bleachers at the park that I took him to.

1225
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,780
This is at like midnight or one in the morning.

1226
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,280
And I was like, I think if he came up to me,

1227
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,160
I would be like, if you don't get any closer

1228
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,800
or I'm gonna scream.

1229
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,000
(laughing)

1230
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,840
I really considered that.

1231
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,860
I was like, I think that might be my first

1232
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,240
course of action there.

1233
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,540
- I had a scary encounter last night too.

1234
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,720
- What happened? - What happened?

1235
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,360
- I heard rock and roll music playing

1236
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,520
outside my house at 1145.

1237
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,320
- No fucking way, really?

1238
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,280
- Yeah.

1239
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,120
- Did you--

1240
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:25,940
- And only moments before that I heard

1241
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,920
the noise of a glass bottle.

1242
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,760
- Wow.

1243
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:29,580
- What the hell, somebody's doing

1244
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,280
some kind of demonic bullshit.

1245
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,120
- Yeah.

1246
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,920
- I woke up to a jackhammer this morning.

1247
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,680
- Yeah, I was jackhammering your ass.

1248
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,520
(laughing)

1249
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,360
- And you woke up to it.

1250
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,520
- What the hell?

1251
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,240
What the hell, no!

1252
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,880
- Yeah, it's too easy.

1253
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,720
- Yeah.

1254
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,520
- All right, come to Portland in Seattle.

1255
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,880
- Portland in Seattle, please go to--

1256
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,720

1267
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,000
We sold out a show in Brooklyn.

1268
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,840
- Awesome.

1269
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,160

01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,560
that's in the past, doesn't matter.

1273
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,400
Go buy a ticket.

1274
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,800
Patrick is trying to confuse you into not buying a ticket.

1275
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,580
- In the past, we sold out a show.

1276
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,400
- Okay, I'm stopping recording now.
