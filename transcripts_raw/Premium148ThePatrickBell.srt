9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,960

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,400
Cameron has to pack, 'cause he's going to--

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,240
- Iraq.

12
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,060
- Iraq.

13
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,900
- I would love to go.

14
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,720
- He's going to Iraq to fight.

15
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,560
- I think it's beautiful there.

16
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,080
- I would love to send him to Iraq.

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,240
- I think it's beautiful there.

18
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,040
- I think you'd be easily blown apart.

19
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,360
- I don't think that it's a violent place.

20
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,480
I don't think I'd be blown apart.

21
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
I think I might I think I'm on my mind might be blown apart by its natural

22
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
beauty and the kindness of those who live there.

23
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Do you know how they pay for everything over there?

24
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:35,980
How?

25
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,980
By giving each other dinners.

26
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,480
Is that true?

27
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,980
Mm-hmm.

28
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,480
You use dinner as money?

29
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Dinner, yeah.

30
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
In the Middle East?

31
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Iraqi dinners.

32
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
It's what they're most serious.

33
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
This just sounds like a wonderful place.

34
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,980
Uh-huh.

35
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:51,480
So say like you want like it's like I want a t-shirt that'll cost you 25 Iraqi dinners.

36
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
So it's like oh jeez.

37
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,480
25 dinners?

38
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
That's why, yeah.

39
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
That's, well so what about if you're buying dinner?

40
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
What happens then?

41
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,600
happens then? That still costs dinner. Well but here's how they get you. You

42
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,120
think, "Oh dinner, this is gonna be nice steak and something," right? They

43
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,480
come out with a caesian fucking mubarak fucking giant pot of boiling hot lamb

44
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,760
lava and they're like, "Well at least give me a fork and a knife," and they say, "A

45
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,320
what and a what?" You eat that piping hot hand stew with your hand. Yeah. You have to wear

46
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,800
rubber gloves. They say, "No don't worry, we're gonna give you the

47
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,380
thinnest little piece of bread of all time so you can you don't completely third

48
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,620
degree burn you just yes you merely scald your hand and see in season barik or

49
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,880

50
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,420

51
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,260
Turkey they have a guy who spins them around you can't you can't catch him

52
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,820
that's true away imagine you sit you're in Turkey right you've been sitting in

53
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,860
in line for the new iPhone all day long, right?

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,700
And then you get up to the Genius Bar,

55
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,780
he says, "Here you go."

56
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,180

You're like, "What the hell?"

59
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,340
There's a false version of the iPhone

60
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,820
that the iPhone was sitting in.

61
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,380
A false case.

62
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,620
They pull the iPhone out every single time.

63
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,260
Every single retail employee,

64
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,260
every single restaurant employee,

65
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,660
every single employee in Turkey has to trick people.

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,860
do it when they hand over your grandmother's ashes after she's been

69
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,940
roll it they roll it down their arms and their shoulders like a Harlem Globetrotter

70
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,580
basketball and an ice cream cone and then they put it in most things are

71
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,940
served in an ice cream yeah so they serve meatballs and shawarma yeah place

72
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,380
near me there's of shawarma she's been shut down forever but a little opening

73
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,900
Avengers reference reopening now reopening now shawarma fi shawarma

74
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,420
shawarma fi all one word like it's an app yeah shawarma fi shawarma there is

75
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,740
sounds less like an app and more like a ray or maybe it's halal if I even more

76
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,780
like a ray yeah a really bad name there is it's either I forget what it's called

77
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,420
but there's some Turkish dish I'll see it every time

78
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
I used to know the name.

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Dracula's sausages.

80
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,420
No, I think it's intestine or something. I think it's stuffed intestine or something.

81
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,420
A sausage.

82
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Have you ever seen that? I think it's that H.R. Giger painting that Dead Kennedys used for Frankenchrist.

83
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,420
You know the one where it looks like, I think it's H.R. Giger, where it looks like dicks going into pussies.

84
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
This is what this food looks like.

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,420
Wait, there's an H.R. Giger thing that looks like dicks and pussies?

86
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,420
Yeah.

87
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
I don't want to see that.

88
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,260
it's a dead kid they know they call them they call him HR Geiger because the art

89
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,340
store he worked I was always getting sent to HR yeah penises and pussies and

98
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
- Oh, Popeye.

99
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,080
- No, he wasn't.

100
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,920
- He was an alien.

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,740
- I'm gonna give you a Popeye.

102
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,420
- It's actually another part of that

103
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,240
Kid Stays in the Picture documentary

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,560
where he's like, he gets--

105
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
- Talking about it again.

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
- It's so good.

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,060
- Most boring documentary.

108
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,900
- It's so good.

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,840
- When you talk about it, it's so boring.

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
- I was waiting to break this out, but Patrick.

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,340
- Oh yeah.

112
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,580
That's the shut up bell.

113
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,100
- The shut up bell?

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,480
That was not what I was gonna call it.

115
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,760
- No, I mean, I just, what is this?

116
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,040
- It's the Patrick bell.

117
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
- What is the Patrick bell?

118
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Oh, this is a

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
It's the Patrick Bell.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:12,560
I've got Patrick's old report card in front of me.

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Oh nice.

122
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,220
And I feel like this is maybe instead of having to fill it out and distract me and take notes,

123
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,720
maybe it's like whenever I notice he's being crass or a story that maybe might not have

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,760
an ending, I could ring the bell, which wouldn't be disruptive.

125
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,840
You can't do, I think the bell is completely disruptive.

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,400
I don't think it's disruptive at all.

127
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,600
All right, well try it Pat. Can we agree to try it just this one episode?

128
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,100
No.

129
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,600
What if we try for the...

130
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,100
Disagreeing.

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,600
That's disagreeable. That's disagreeable attitude.

132
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,600
What about for just the next five minutes?

133
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,100
I don't want to hear the bell.

134
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,600
Because it gives you a negative response trigger, right?

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I don't like the bell.

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Why not?

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,600
That's just disagreeable.

138
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I mean that is being disagreeable.

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
I don't care.

140
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,100
You don't care?

141
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,600
That's fine.

142
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
It's okay to not care.

143
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
It's okay to not care. It's actually cool to not care.

144
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
What if instead we made it maybe a lunchtime bell and we rang it when we got lunch?

145
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,480
What if we make it a funny joke bell and every time someone makes a funny joke.

146
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,360
Truly what happened, this was not, I just, we saw the bell when we were in the hardware

147
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,880
store and I was like we have to buy this bell.

148
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,280
There really is, it can be anything.

149
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Lunch bell.

150
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
It's a cool bell.

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Do you want to try the bell, Pat?

152
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
I don't want to try the bell.

153
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
But it's fun.

154
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Press the button.

155
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
No.

156
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,320
He got all upset because we rang the bell and now he's fucking, he wanted to try the bell.

157
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I feel bad.

158
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I don't want to try the bell.

159
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
He ruined the bell for himself.

160
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
You didn't do this.

161
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:34,400
about a bell. I don't want to try the bell. It's a fun bell. Just ring it. Look at this.

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,260
I don't care. You don't even think that that might be kind of fun to touch that bell? No.

163
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,360
Not even a little bit. It's like an easy button but it makes a ringing sound instead of saying

164
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,840
that was easy. If that changes anything. It's a sound board that only has one sound. It

165
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,560
goes ding. I'd prefer if it was an easy button. I don't know why you bought this bell. Because

166
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,920
it was not a hotel it was only where it's an obvious we should be a $40 you

167
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,160
should have got an easy listen to it here I was I was I was arguing with Caleb

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
about this would this be a cooler Bell if it was the kind of Bell that you hold

169
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,400
with your hand and ring back and forth like this because I wanted to buy that

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,200
one and Caleb said no and so we got that words there are more as a cooler Bell

171
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,920
this is another Bell again it's a Patrick Bell just because you called me a

172
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,120
moron and guess what that's a meanness I don't care I'm gonna be rude as hell

173
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,640
this episode for meanness and being rude to me and calling me a moron you got

174
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,480
another and for not caring again I don't care it's okay oh never mind I take

175
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,600
that shit I got the dinner bell but that bell sucks the dinner bell would have

176
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,760
been too loud and you can't just ring it what bells that it should have been too

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,520
loud did you have some kind of traumatic hotel experience yes really mm-hmm I

178
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
I guess you lived in a hotel.

179
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,700
A Lisa Lamb.

180
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Just that news story.

181
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
I remembered it.

182
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,120
I can never see a bell like that again.

183
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Or water.

184
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Have you ever done this?

185
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
I lived in a hotel for a year.

186
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,120
Have you ever done this at a hotel, or not even a hotel, anywhere where they have a bell

187
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,280
and it's like ring for service and you ring it?

188
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
Yeah.

189
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Does it feel kind of rude?

190
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
It's like honking your horn.

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
It feels really bad.

192
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,320
Yeah, it's rude as hell.

193
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,880
It's not rude.

194
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,040
It feels rude, but it's not rude.

195
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,160
- There's a, I told you about the time the oven was on fire,

196
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,980
right, at the hotel?

197
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,820
- No.

198
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,640
- I don't think so.

199
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
- You guys had an oven in your hotel room?

200
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,100
- Yeah, we were at a Town Place Suites.

201
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,360
- That's a hotel area.

202
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,840
- That's an apart motel.

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,320
That's a motartment.

204
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,160
- It's a motartment.

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,080
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,000
- But I accidentally left a plastic tray in the oven

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,660
'cause I thought it was a metal tray.

208
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,680
I don't know why the fuck somebody put that,

209
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,200
it was a plastic tray for the Continental breakfast.

210
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,040
- Oh, what the hell?

211
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,520
- And somebody left it in the oven,

212
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,700
and then I turned the oven on,

213
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,820
the thing melted down the whole tray melted down through the like...

214
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,140
Did it stink everything up?

215
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,020
The whole room smelled like melted plastic that was on fire at the bottom of the oven

216
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,700
and I didn't know what to do because I was like home alone and I ran down to the

217
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,060
lobby and I there was like three people in line ahead of me and I didn't want to

218
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,020
just yell "FIRE!" because I didn't know what...

219
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,520
Yeah.

220
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
I didn't know if it was like...

221
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
So you waited in line?

222
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,020
I waited in line while the oven was on fire.

223
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,260
(laughing)

224
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,480
And then I finally got up there and I was like,

225
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,560
a tray melted in the oven and it's on fire.

226
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,460
And she's like, okay, there should be like

227
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,180
an extinguisher on your floor.

228
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
'Cause I didn't know--

229
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,220
- On the floor?

230
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,960
- On the, like, first floor.

231
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,180
- Oh, yeah, okay, that makes more sense.

232
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,020
- Yeah.

233
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,860
- No, it was on the floor.

234
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,680
- On the floor.

235
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,460
There's probably something on the floor.

236
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,980
- I didn't know whether or not to call the fire department

237
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,820
or--

238
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,660
- They'll handle that.

239
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,480
They'll figure it out.

240
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,980
hotel as their own fire department their own thing going on you have to be if you

241
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,520
have a cruise trip cruise trip do you have to miss Bell I mean this talk now

242
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,840
this could be a really good kind of closed-loop situation I feel like Caleb

243
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,840
could really use the bell on himself and really make him laugh.

244
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,760
Honestly, me and the bell, this might be, I think I might have my own Caleb and the Bell,

245
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,920
Beauty and the Bell might be my new spin-off show. I love the bell. I do like the bell.

246
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,520
It's an instant out of whatever you're talking about. Yeah. You know, and sometimes I just

247
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,440
get a little too off on my own little path. No, hey, and guess what, I can use the bell

248
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,720
also. I tried to take the bell and he grabbed it. Pat is trying to not smile. He's rubbing

249
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Can you believe that? He's rubbing his face.

250
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
I hate this thing. He's rubbing his face. Why?

251
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Explain why you hate this.

252
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Caleb is literally monopolizing the bell. It's not okay.

253
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
That's fine.

254
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
No, you guys were talking down on this.

255
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
This adds a whole element of like

256
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
disruption.

257
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
It adds a bell

258
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,720
sound. I hate when our episodes

259
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
are disrupted. Not disrupted

260
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
like, for me, personally,

261
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
I can't

262
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
pay attention if

263
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,320
don't do that. I can't pay attention if there's even a scream upstairs or if

264
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,320
there's water coming from the pipes. I can't. So you're saying the

265
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
bell... This already fucks me up so much. You're saying the bell is doing the opposite of

266
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,040
what it... No it's doing exactly the opposite of what it should be doing. What

267
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,720
should it be doing? I shouldn't be doing anything. It shouldn't be here.

268
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,560
Alright give me the bell. Give me the bell. I'll put it somewhere. I'm not gonna

269
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm not gonna ring it, it's gonna stay right there. I know you're gonna ring it.

270
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Even looking at it is a problem for him.

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah. Yeah. So here's what I'll do.

272
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Here. I'm gonna take it.

273
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
We should, if anything, we should leave it.

274
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Well so why, okay, but then.

275
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Let me ask then, so why.

276
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
Why is this bell horrible but a hand dinner bell would be okay?

277
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Don't give it to Alex.

278
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Okay, here's my idea. Don't give it to Alex.

279
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
We hang it up, we hang it up on the wall

280
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
and if Alex and Joe need to talk to us while we're recording, they ring the bell.

281
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
(laughing)

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,440
- I don't think we, you have to kind of like

283
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,760
reenact that conversation,

284
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
'cause there's no way we could hear any of that.

285
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
- That wasn't for you guys.

286
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,700
- Well I had an idea for the bell,

287
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,900
and I don't know if you heard it.

288
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,740
- I didn't hear it.

289
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,000
- So we tape it to the wall, where the divider is,

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,820
and if Alex and Joe need to talk to us

291
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,400
while we're recording, they ring the bell.

292
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,920
- Why wouldn't they just say, well, you're okay.

293
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,540
All right, yeah, that's fine, I'll take that.

294
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,320
- That's a good use of the bell.

295
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Yeah, no, yeah, no, that's...

296
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Well, he just... I hate this even more.

297
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
What do you...

298
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,320
I just heard it. Now we can hear it, and the people listening to the podcast cannot hear it.

299
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
From across the room.

300
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I heard it all the way across the fucking office.

301
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
See what I mean? It's not good.

302
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Go get it. Go get it. No, it's great when we're in control of it.

303
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
You don't ring the bell also.

304
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Alright. Then we're in a good spot.

305
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
We're doing well now. Okay.

306
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Okay.

307
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Did you ring it because you needed to ask us something?

308
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:48,880
thing. He said no. He said no. Yeah. Okay. The Bell's gone guys. That was supposed to

309
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,680
last us at least 45 minutes. Was that a fun five or so minutes of the show? No. Yeah.

310
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,000
I think it was very fun. I thought it was really, really fun. It was not good for me.

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,080
I got yelled at by a little person this morning because. You were ringing a bell in their

312
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,560
face. Well yeah. And you were saying dance, dance. I wasn't saying dance. Trying to make

313
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,520
I was trying to make him grow. Yeah? Yeah. I thought it was a miracle grow in their pockets.

314
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,920
Growing bell. Right. I wrote that on it. So I thought it might work. You thought they were

315
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:24,640
like Tom Hanks in Big? Um, a child? A grown man trapped in a child's body? It wasn't a

316
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,840
child. It was clearly an older woman actually. She said that her, her, um. Why was she yelling

317
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,640
at you? Because Phil peed on her stoop. And I see this lady, there's this lady. I thought

318
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,080
You're gonna say Phil Peeta.

319
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,280
She's not a little, I mean she's not,

320
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,480
(laughing)

321
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,400
I don't think she has dwarfism, but she is a small person.

322
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Yeah.

323
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,320
And she has a son who's her exact same height,

324
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,040
and they walk around and they argue with each other all day.

325
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,720
And she's like maybe 60 years old,

326
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,840
she has crazy makeup on all the time.

327
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,860
It's like Mimi from Drew Carey Show.

328
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,140
I don't know, but I think that's the second Mimi reference

329
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,120
you've had in 24 hours.

330
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
Yeah.

331
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah, or maybe not even 24 hours,

332
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
probably 16 hours. Well look up a photo

333
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,520
of Mimi and you'll see.

334
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I'll look it up in a bit.

335
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,240
But I see right now that would have been a bell.

336
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,600
That would have been an easy bell.

337
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Ding.

338
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
Are you trying to ring a bell?

339
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
There's nothing there.

340
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm just hitting the table.

341
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
Me trying to ring a bell when there's no bell there?

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Okay.

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
She yelled at me.

344
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,880
I don't like that the bell was sabotage.

345
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,800
I don't like that the bell was an ambush on me.

346
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,920
You wish you had known about the bell before.

347
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,360
I wish I knew about the bell.

348
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,540
I was not clued in to the bell at all.

349
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
Now you know about it.

350
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,200
Well, maybe somebody left the office early yesterday.

351
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,260
- Because I have to, I'm nursing a stray cat.

352
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,940
- Maybe two friends came up with a funny prank

353
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,260
they thought everyone would enjoy

354
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,520
and it backfired a little bit

355
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,440
and we can all kind of move on from there.

356
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
- It was not a nice thing to do.

357
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,080
- It was funny.

358
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,900
- It was a prank.

359
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,740
- It was not a nice prank.

360
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,240
- A prank is not supposed to be nice.

361
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,520
- We immediately changed it

362
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,260
and it became an all around universal bell.

363
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,460
- I would not have called it the shut up bell.

364
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,660
That was all Caleb.

365
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,000
That was very rude of him.

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,860
- It was an ambush on me.

367
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,780
It's funny to ambush you.

368
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,500
It's not that funny to ambush me.

369
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,380
Maybe not to you, but to me and to a lot of other people it might be kind of funny to ambush

370
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,380
somebody.

371
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Then why am I here?

372
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,260
So that we can ambush you.

373
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Is that it?

374
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Is that the only reason?

375
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,940
Don't ring the bell.

376
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,500
Don't ring the bell, Alex.

377
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Stop.

378
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm sorry.

379
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
It's okay.

380
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,460
Is that the only reason to ambush you?

381
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
No.

382
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,740
No, you also sing songs and do stuff like that and that's good.

383
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,040
but it is funny to ring a bell at you every once in a while. It's not funny to

384
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,340
ring a bell. I think with time you will find. I think next episode maybe we can

385
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,900
try a different kind of bell that we're all in. What about a doorbell? But then

386
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,620
that's what I was saying with the bell on the wall. What about a doorbell though

387
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,020
that goes ding dong and then someone comes in and it's a crazy new character

388
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,380
that's every time the doorbell rings. That's pretty good too. Once per minute.

389
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:06,220
She tried to get me to wash Phil's pee off of her stairs and I said, "Okay, I had a cup

390
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
of coffee."

391
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,980
And I was like, "Do you want me to pour coffee on it?"

392
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
She was like, "Coffee?

393
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
That's even worse!"

394
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
And that's my entire story.

395
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,300
Did she sit on the stoop?

396
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,420
No, she was in her car.

397
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
She was just watching me do it.

398
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
She was like, "Clean it up!"

399
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,420
I was like, "What?"

400
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
She was like, "The pee!

401
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,620
Clean it up!

402
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
That's my stoop!"

403
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,860
I was like, "I--" It's not her stoop.

404
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
It's the landlord's stoop.

405
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,460
And then she was talking to her landlord. The landlord didn't give a fuck, right?

406
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,220
And then she told her landlord--this is just not really a part of the story--but

407
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,700
she told her landlord that her husband has been painting buildings for 45 years

408
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,500
and he would paint the whole place for one month's rent.

409
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,060
Wow.

410
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,740
Paint the whole building.

411
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,020
That's a good deal.

412
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,820
It's a great deal.

413
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,660
That's, yeah.

414
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,140
Yeah.

415
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,700
Wow.

416
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,260
She didn't even say if he was going to paint the building like a special color or anything?

417
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,060
I might have heard something like that.

418
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,380
Yeah?

419
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,780
Yeah, yeah, I might have heard her say that now that you mentioned what color I

420
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,500
think it was gonna be black. Really? I think the building, the brick building in

421
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,620
the middle of a block of other brick buildings. She said I'm gonna

422
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,620
paint it completely Vantablack. Wow! It's gonna be, I'm guess, Vsauce Michael is

423
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,940
gonna, is my husband, and he's gonna paint this completely Vantablack and he

424
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,820
went okay that's fine did you guys ever see Vantablack no they had some dark

425
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:32,380
black painting in a museum. It's spelled like Dracula saying want a black yeah I

426
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,800
want a black. But they're miss missing spaces. Girlfriend. It's maybe if Dracula's really

427
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
excited about that

428
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:54,400
is either funny bell could be wrong for ivan the black

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,440
Okay, it was this thing where they had a hole

430
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,160
And they painted it completely black

431
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,900
And there's no light in there and it looked like an infinite hole because of how they used some special black color

432
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:19,680
Was a movie extremely darkly black was a movie. I was in a museum. Oh, no, that's a movie - it's called the dark hole

433
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,440
I got confused

434
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,640
So it looked like it went on forever. Yeah, it looked like you're looking into like space or something. It was pretty crazy

435
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,480
I don't think space is that impressive when I look up at it.

436
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,120
The ocean is a little bit more impressive.

437
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
I agree.

438
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
The ocean, when I look at the ocean, and maybe it's just a matter of perspective, but the

439
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
ocean looks bigger than space.

440
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah.

441
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Yeah.

442
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
No.

443
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
I think so.

444
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
The space is all up, it's the whole sky.

445
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,280
The ocean is only the direction, I guess if I was in the middle of the ocean.

446
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,200
But I'm thinking about things on a 2D level where the ocean goes forever that way.

447
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,360
space space is just a space of just a picture that's hanging up there but I

448
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,080
go might as well be a ceiling well it's the same as the oh it's also if you

449
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,880
what's the day I would sooner I think I would sooner believe that there was no

450
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,160
space and that all that the sky was fake then that the earth was flat because the

451
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,120
ocean seems so big that this guy you'd sooner believe the sky was made then

452
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,280
that then the earth was flat yeah I don't sooner believe that it's sooner

453
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,120
Okay, so but those things that you feel like usually go together. Yeah, but I'm

454
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,920
Usually pick one of those. I'm saying I could pick one and that might be that the sky is probably fake chicken little style status

455
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:39,200
I think that's yeah, I think that's probably the more in chicken little does the sky piece is falling

456
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,120
I'm talking the movie universe. Uh-huh. The sky piece. Is that a

457
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,720
Is that did the aliens build a fake sky or was the sky always fake and it's like a Truman Show thing behind them

458
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,720
the thing behind the sky. Well, I don't know. I think it's a world where maybe

459
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,680
chickens can speak.

460
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Yeah, so when the chicken yeah, so is that why the aliens are making a Truman show? Is because they're like what the fuck?

461
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,920
They're chickens are talking on this world. That's so cool. We should make that a TV show.

462
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,400
I think maybe the whole atom test is an alien experiment.

463
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,600
The only thing I remember about that movie is when the guy breathes into the bag really fast.

464
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,220
And also that intro. Whoever, whatever character does that.

465
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,020
that the duck and my no the fat. I think it's the pig yeah. He goes why the hell

466
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,540
they got a they got two birds and they go and pig

467
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,060
that good point. Why are these why are why are there? Why is it that the world

468
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,340
of words as a as a kid though that duck was hot as fuck the ugly duckling. Oh my

469
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,020
God, dude, she was badder than Jessica rabbit bro. It's in her name. She's ugly

470
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:49,180
and that's a seriously and that's a kid. I said as a kid as a kid as a kid. Yeah,

471
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,540
I mean nice try you said that that that duck is hot as a kid

472
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,300
But yeah, I did say that you can say that like the kid

473
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,860
Character also a duck you say that the kid characters ugly all day long, but you can't say yeah

474
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,580
You can you guys it as a that I'm you say that ugly duckling is ugly

475
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,660
Yeah, all day long all you want as a kid if you say that ugly duckling is hot

476
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:17,200
Yeah, first of all that's fucked up. You're betraying the name of this character. No. It's like I say well. She's completely purple

477
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,920
Yeah, wait till she grows up. Yeah, that's what the story is about. Yeah

478
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,840
And she is the ugly duckling turns 18

479
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,080
That's the story. That's what the more of the guy who wrote the ugly duckling was just a pedophile. Yeah, who is that's his rehabilitation

480
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,460
Rehabilitation was like he the judge made him write a story

481
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,000
About a duck that turns 18

482
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,560
I don't know how long ducks live but I feel like probably the ugly duckling turned like

483
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,920
three and got really hot.

484
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Based on...

485
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Bro, are you hearing this?

486
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm saying in the story.

487
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Give me that bell back.

488
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,600
He's talking about the pedophile who wrote the ugly duckling is what I'm saying.

489
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Well you said...

490
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,440
You guys are kicking me out of this little world that you're building here.

491
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
It's not fair.

492
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
You said the ugly duckling.

493
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,160
First of all, he said the ugly duckling hot, then he said it's a kid, and then he said

494
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,880
it's hot as a kid.

495
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,440
you want to badly fuckling with your awesome suckling yeah on this duck. No

496
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,740
you guys are completely misunderstanding me here. I'm saying if I was a pedophile

497
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,500
if I was a pedophile and a duck

498
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:38,100
and this ugly duckling came up to me, maybe we had you all wrong all along.

499
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm starting to understand now that you say that. Yeah. I re-watched Blazing Saddles.

500
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Yeah, couldn't make that today. I think they could make it, I think. I think. But they

501
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,660
would have to be... I think they did make it today. I think they have to do... I think it just came out.

502
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,180
You know who would need to be the new sheriff? Who? Hoody Allen. Steven Yuen. Oh. That

503
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,100
would be a good-ass... So the movie... Blazing Saddles, but it's like maybe this with you

504
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,280
just kind of do a maybe. What if you do Blazing Saddles right? Yeah. Did you say

505
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:18,640
Blazing Saddles? No. Oh Tiger Woods, get Tiger in there? Dude, Blazing Saddles is such a good idea.

506
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,540
Holy shit. So if you made Blazing Saddles today. That's such a great idea.

507
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Oh fuck, Tiger. We need Tiger. Tiger, just break out roll. That's his 8 mile.

508
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,540
He calls it Blazin' Saddles. It's a pretty good--

509
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Remember how mad everyone got at him for just cheating on his wife?

510
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Yeah, dude, because he's living the most fucking-- they hated him.

511
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,540
I've told you what my grandpa has said about Tiger Woods.

512
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,540
Yeah, he was bringing too much hip-hop to the golf course.

513
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
No, no.

514
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,540
That's what I was saying.

515
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,540
My grandpa said one time we were watching--

516
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:01,440
mean we're just watching golf and Tiger is Tigers up to T and greatest golfer of

517
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,220
all time greatest golfer ball I mean pretty much it's between him Palmer has

518
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,540
a drink between him and there's no drinking a Tiger Woods so he's like the

519
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,900
best golfer of all time was Tyler the Creator

520
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,840
between Tiger and Jack there in his Haley and so he and my grandpa just says

521
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,940
you know the only reason Tiger what is Tiger Woods is famous is because he's

522
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,820
black. It's the greatest goal ever. And my grandpa thinks that he's only famous

523
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:34,360
because he's a black guy. Yeah. Just crazy dude. Yeah same with Eminem. Yeah. Eminem

524
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,260
only famous because he's white. That's actually true. Eminem's white. I thought Eminem was like Logic.

525
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,420
He's famous because he raps quickly. I thought he was like Logic? Yeah. What do you mean?

526
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,060
Like a lyrical miracle. Oh he is a lyrical miracle. Did you guys see that

527
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,540
that Sauron in the new Lord of the Rings show they released a picture of him a

528
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,340
while ago and he looks exactly like Eminem.

529
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,180
- That makes sense.

530
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,300
- He's like a bleach blonde evil white boy.

531
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,140
- Whoa.

532
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,220
- If you look at the picture.

533
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,860
- Draco Malfoy status?

534
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,180
- Yeah, but he looks--

535
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,620
- I watched that show for like two seconds the other day.

536
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,460
- It sucks dude.

537
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,060
I watched 20 minutes of it and I had to turn it off.

538
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,900
- Yeah.

539
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,380
- It's really not good.

540
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,860
- It's rated PG-13.

541
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,740
- Yeah, well I wouldn't have watched 20 minutes of it

542
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,780
if it was rated PG-13.

543
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,180
- They only do the rating 20 minutes in.

544
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,020
Let me see.

545
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,020
That's Sauron. What the fuck? He just looks ugly. He looks like an ugly...

546
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,140
He's so funny dude. They just made him Eminem. He looks like a fucking deathcore vocalist.

547
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,140
He's supposed to be... He's got the bleached eyebrows too. He's got a bleached buzz cut.

548
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,020
How you doing a buzz cut back then? Is he a child in this? Why does he look so young?

549
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,740
I think he's in disguise. He's in a magical disguise to fool people.

550
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Yeah.

551
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,980
The whole thing of Sauron at the second age is that...

552
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,540
I thought Sauron was some kind of fucked up angel.

553
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,340
No, he's a devilish angel.

554
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,820
He's a sorcerer. So he disguises himself and then he makes the whole kingdom follow him

555
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
and then he betrays him.

556
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,700
He's the best friend of a fallen angel guy.

557
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,660
I think he is. I think he is a fallen angel. Wizards are fallen angels in Lord of the Rings

558
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,580
basically. Or they're like, whatever, they're like supernatural creatures.

559
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,260
And dragons are just dragons.

560
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,020
Dragons are dragons, yeah. And then there are also giant spiders, and those are spiders.

561
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,780
There's also werewolves, and you can probably guess what those are.

562
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,420
And clearly hobbits are supposed to be hobbits.

563
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,580
I think hobbits are the Christians, right?

564
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,980
No, hobbits are British people.

565
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
No, but hobbits are Christians.

566
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,140
Hobbits are like, love me wife, love me punts of the earl.

567
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,460
Yeah, and the dwarves are Muslim.

568
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,660
Dwarves are Jewish, unfortunately.

569
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Really?

570
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
Yeah.

571
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:48,340
the elves are muslims. I don't know if there are muslims. I think the ancient wisdom shit

572
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,620
going on. I think muslims live longer. The orcs are the mongols. They're mongolians.

573
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,700
Well hey, you can't say that word. What word? That word is just as bad as the r word. Orc?

574
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Mongol. You said it. You said it. I said it to prove a point. It is funny that the word

575
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,240
mongoloid does come from like Mongolian. I think that's not funny it's kind of

576
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,920
fucked up I actually don't like that kind of I think it's funny that it's an

577
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,320
antiquated term. Can we cut out with the racial division?

578
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:31,360
This isn't racial this is a mental division. Can we leave the mental division in the

579
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,360
past and just thinking about this today I I told you about how I was in like

580
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,440
special needs classes in middle school right yeah I know yeah maybe you didn't

581
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,120
tell me I know just fight figuring out like two weeks ago two three weeks ago

582
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,960
that that math class that I was in where we like learned fractions through

583
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,640
cooking was them training me to become a line cook

584
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,840
yeah they just put all you guys they put us all in a like four of us in a row is

585
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,440
five kids and then one of us moved yeah and then it was four kids in a math

586
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,480
class and one of the things we learned how to cook was churros which was Pam

587
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,140
baking spray over a tortilla covered in you might have been working at a Red

588
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,640
Robin they might have been it might have been a false like a like a studio set of

589
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,560
a classroom yeah actually you were in the kitchen of a Red Robin I just make

590
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,260
- I swear to God. - Making campfire sauce.

591
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,980
- It would make more sense.

592
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,240
- Yeah, I think so.

593
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,680
It's a pretty good idea.

594
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,320
The high school kids are,

595
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,200
I mean, essentially they're free labor.

596
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,040
- Yeah. - Right?

597
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,720
- I remember the--

598
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,280
- They should be making the license plates,

599
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,760
not these poor prisoners.

600
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,920
These prisoners got pushups to do.

601
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,200
- The Chinese class at my high school,

602
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,440
one of their field trips was they went

603
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,880
to a Chinese restaurant and helped them make food.

604
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
- Really? - For a while.

605
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Wow.

606
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,320
I think they either, they were like, it was either that they, I think they helped, they

607
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,880
like watched them for like a long time and then like helped them make one type of food

608
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
or something.

609
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah.

610
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
I used to have to do that growing up.

611
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,240
I used to have to go in and help my mom.

612
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,360
Well, that's not, that wasn't for a class though.

613
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,640
That was because you're helping your mother make food, which is actually like a sacred

614
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
and beautiful thing.

615
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
That's a kind of class.

616
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
That is a class, yeah.

617
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,120
I mean, people who help their mom have class.

618
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I'll say that much.

619
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,440
Imagine if you have to go with your teacher, your teacher's like, you guys have to make

620
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,440
food with these people now yeah you have to speak in only Chinese there's like 25

621
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,160
of you or Mandarin that's too many people that's too many kids in a yeah do you

622
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,720
think that the Chinese restaurant they knew that it was coming where they are

623
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:46,280
did just 25 kids show up for you yeah okay I don't know I wish I was in that

624
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,520
class I want to see what goes on back there yeah we had a German class my

625
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,780
German class I'd only took it for two years I missed the I didn't have a

626
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,900
language credit going into college so I had to take a language credit at fucking

627
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,980
Emerson and but before that I took two years of German on your third year you

628
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,700
get to go to this German restaurant in like Lee, New Hampshire or something or

629
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,480
like I was pretty far up and you have to speak German the whole day and if you

630
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,220
don't speak in German you can't eat any of the food. That's easy. So if you fuck up one

631
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,900
time you you had to sit there and watch all your classmates eat like a pretzel

632
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,540
no that seems like almost abuse it yeah well it's German class they're the most

633
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,180
strict people in the world to go could you just not talk you probably could but

634
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,300
you probably I think I think probably would ask you a question

635
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,540
from your trauma from trauma the hell because showing for our trauma for out

636
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,060
was for our trauma about to be she was like a 60 year old woman with a bull

637
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:55,220
cut holy fucking shit and she got mad at me because I didn't learn any other we

638
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,620
would we would do like the we'd have to write two sentences of what we're doing

639
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,940
on the weekend every Friday I bet you were up there doing some Bart Simpson

640
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:10,900
shit I was I'd say it's not for skiing penis is gawning or something like that

641
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:20,260
or something like that mm-hmm inglorious my my penis is is niche sir good no it's

642
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:26,200
not sir good no no did you ever do you ever put up there like inglorious

643
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,420
bastards watch this I think or something so I'm like that we would get extra

644
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,860
credit on tests if we brought in a cultural tidbit

645
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:44,380
swastika outfit of my grandpa's SS uniform. Yeah, somebody brought in, we watched

646
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,620
that clip in Inglorious Bastards of the German 3. Oh nice. Yeah. I guess there is a 3.

647
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,900
I took like French class. I took French in middle school and

648
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,540
high school and that's like a given where it's like every year you'll

649
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,900
either watch Ratatouille or like Tintin and that's like those are the two things

650
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,700
you only ever watch. I guess I don't know what like as like an like you know at

651
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,660
the end of the year. Yeah. And I guess I can't think of what the go-to German

652
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:18,660
thing would be besides Ratatouille in German. Really? Yeah. I just remembered that before Christmas.

653
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:26,700
Before Christmas we watched Ratatouille in German. That's so funny. That's less about the languages and more about the fact that it was a it was a

654
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,540
newer film at the time. Mm-hmm. And it's kind of it's about being worldly.

655
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:36,980
you know I think we had to watch or maybe we watched a clip from deep rest rumble

656
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,660
the tindrum just like this movie it's just like German movie from like 73

657
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,300
we're like a kid decides that he doesn't want to like age past like four so he

658
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,660
throws himself down his stairs sure decision to make it for you he's born as

659
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,620
a baby genius holy throws himself down the stairs but then he it's like a

660
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,020
Benjamin Button, but if he stays the same age is basically what and then he gets drafted in World War two or whatever

661
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:09,320
They drafted a four-year-old child. Well, no he ages mentally, but he stays physically for still why would you put this person on the?

662
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,900
Don't remember the movie that well, I do remember one scene where he eats his babysitter out and he's still a four-year-old

663
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:25,180
Yeah, why is he getting babysat if he's mentally an older person and he's doing why is he and why are you watching an eating?

664
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,260
out movie in class. I think we watched a clip from it because I remember a scene

665
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,780
where a soldier says "Ich liebe die Kartoffel". This is a this is a German

666
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,580
movie. Yeah. Gotcha. So that's the thing yeah like what are you gonna watch in

667
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,540
like German we would watch like all these like short films these German short

668
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,540
films German commercials and then Ratatouille in German.

669
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
It's so funny. I pretty much should watch a Shanghai film.

670
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
It's just like a man in a language on the DVD.

671
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Yeah, it could be any movie.

672
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,540
I mean, it's probably because the French class already had a DVD of Ratatouille across the hall or something.

673
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
Right, just like, "Alright, fuck it, we'll just, whatever."

674
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,540
But I remember we watched this commercial for this supermarket in Germany.

675
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Oh, we also watched, there was this short, this like, you know, the things that are made specifically for like German, like language classes, like the TV shows?

676
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,840
shows. Yeah. Watch this one called Hallo Julia and Christian. No, what it's just

677
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,320
how Germans speak. Her name was Julia. Oh, and this Hallo Julia. Oh, not

678
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,440
Hallelujah. Yeah. Oh, I thought it was Hallelujah in German. There's this

679
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,920
little, there's this kid named Hassan and he was supposed to be representative

680
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,120
of all the big Turkish population in Germany. Is there a big Turkish

681
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,840
population in Germany? Yes, there I those are probably do all those tricks.

682
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,200
they should make a streaming service that just has all of the the language

683
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,360
learning shows, because I would watch the ones where it's like oh this episode he

684
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,480
has to ask to borrow a bicycle from his friend and he has to explain that he

685
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,960
wants to go to the train station. That's the whole episode. Some of those plot

686
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,360
lines are really captivating. My cousin also took German and he remembers

687
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,680
"Hallo Julia" so maybe I'm glad someone else remembers it and I didn't know

688
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,280
there was a possibility that you might be the only one who remembered it. I thought

689
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,560
maybe it was made up for the class. I was in straight Bible study, basically 24 hours. You didn't take a language?

690
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,880
I took Latin. Oh. I had to take Latin. Yeah, which you know what we watched and then my Latin class

691
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,480
went right into my... I'd rather it be Latina class. My Latin class went right into my political science class

692
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,760
which was taught by the same lady, this libertarian lady, so I would go straight from learning Latin

693
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,200
and like watching these like Shakespeare plays that are done in Latin into watching just an hour

694
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,040
of John Stossel videos. It'd just be John Stossel being like "Gay rights should be up to the

695
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,040
states" and that was my political science class.

696
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
Stossel's the one with the big mustache?

697
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah, the one and he got punched in the face by a wrestler at one point I think. I don't

698
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,840
remember which one. He's like a piece of shit.

699
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,760
Yeah, Stossel was on PBS, right?

700
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Yeah.

701
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,880
Yeah, it was Stossel and somebody else.

702
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah, he was like a, you know, he's like a kind of Shapiro style dude from but in

703
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:14,400
the 90s. Yeah, my school had a Latin class too. My school had Latin, French,

704
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,040
Spanish and Chinese and the way it worked is in middle school, in I think

705
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
fifth grade, you would take one, you would take a different language every

706
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,400
quarter and then you would decide which one you wanted to take for the rest.

707
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,840
And it was like, I remember I took French because my mom wanted me to, but

708
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:36,720
the the like it would be like every like they were every quarter. They would try

709
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,600
and convince you to take that language or whatever, and I remember like it's all

710
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,520
like okay french like we'd watch gratitude or whatever spanish. We look

711
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,400
at the show. It's like people are treating stuff and then I remember like

712
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,600
latin was like everyone hated is really boring because there's nothing it's it's

713
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,160
old who cares in the chinese class, the teacher would show his videos of like

714
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,320
buddhist monks getting hit with hammers like chinese people doing like bug

715
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
fighting rings where these two bugs are like

716
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:13,400
that's so did anyone you anyone anyone's mom you knew as a kid ever could like

717
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,280
convert to Buddhism. No, my mom started putting Buddhas around the house,

718
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,400
though that's the kind of I didn't hey, if you don't know someone whose mom

719
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,240
converts to Buddhism, you might be the one you might look at yourself. I that's

720
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,460
Heretical by the way yeah, yeah, she needs to as a Catholic as a strong Catholic

721
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,740
She shouldn't have started looking into bushes. It should it guys fat

722
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,380
He's fat. He's completely

723
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:48,940
Idol mm-hmm about being skinny like John Mulaney, but you can't be fucking fat as a Catholic. Yep. I'll say there's no

724
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,300
Fat leave that that's for the Protestants. Let us handle being fucking giantly

725
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,400
We all saw father stew for that chapeau episode

726
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,880
It's so funny that he just becomes like like they put Mark Wahlberg in a fucking fat suit. Yeah

727
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,020
Did he was really forget about that and then I think about it and it's fire. Yeah, so funny

728
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,160
Shit, what the hell are you getting a phone call? No, my laundry's done. Oh god

729
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:19,840
See I could use that as an alarm there's multiple things the bell could have been an alarm

730
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,220
Yeah, well, you could have told me put it off in 40 minutes. I was in there

731
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,020
Yeah, it would have been easy would have been easy would have been easy and

732
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:33,400
We wouldn't have to rely on technology, which is completely taking over the world. I know I know need to go past week

733
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,160
I noticed technology and AI is starting to take over the earth and I noticed that

734
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,860
Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for society. I think that we need to go in a backwards direction with technology and

735
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,560
Supplies you have funny as shit. Yeah, I did that was fire. That was fire

736
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,680
I think that we need to go completely backwards with our system society

737
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,900
Yeah, and we need to move from let's get rid of the we like it's like tradition

738
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,760
Let's go away from the iPhones away from the computers. No microwaves

739
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,800
Let's move towards more of a floppy disk record player kind of rotary phone rotary phone, you know pay phone

740
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Whatever, let's get rid of the cars. Okay

741
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Again, yeah, here's Roebuck. That's right. Yep. Sears Roebuck pleated khakis

742
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:23,960
Wool and how about I'd completely out of wool animals no wait. What's the material that they say is in a rayon?

743
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,000
That makes your balls ruined. I don't know I think it lasted thorns

744
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,160
Yeah, it might be it might be radio. I think it's a razor razor razor razor wire radioactive razor wire. Yeah

745
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,280
Yeah that I guess they're putting in your underwear underwear. Yeah, it's yeah, that's stronger to

746
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,780
Strange side effect yeah that it causes blood to run down your leg

747
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,320
I kind of believe that I kind of believe that all the things that we wear probably make your balls ruined

748
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,420
I think everything is I think everything is is like that my balls might as well be just fucking like prank balls

749
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,360
Yeah, like the you'd buy it us at some kind of gag shop my penis. They're like silica. Yeah, that's what I mean

750
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,180
They're like really have any use for it. It's so useless

751
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,620
It might as well be like like a removable thumb and a magic you should be able to like like with a like with a dog

752
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,340
I should be able to just tie a rubber band around it and just

753
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:23,140
Yeah, get rid of it ways how they do balls on dog. That's how they do balls in Fight Club. Yeah, really I think

754
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,480
Remember that scene in Fight Club, man. I gotta get what that's when I knew something was up

755
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,420
I'm getting um, you know Fight Club the

756
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:41,140
Do you know about like what kind of inspired all that is that club the thing the cacophony club or the like suicide club in?

757
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,940
San Francisco no, there's this group of people who

758
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I lived in San Francisco. What's his name?

759
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,620
The what's the name of the guy who wrote Fight Club?

760
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,300
Chuck Palahniuk was a part of this thing that it was basically they would do like

761
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,620
They would just walk around and be and just act weird in San Francisco

762
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,820
And they'd like walk around on the top of a building and like walk on the edge and be like whoa look how fucking cool

763
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,260
This is yeah, and yeah

764
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,940
So pretty much makes sense yeah

765
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,720
So like and then he was like I'm gonna take that and make it actually cool and make a book in a movie out of it

766
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,000
But the real thing was like, oh, we're gonna make,

767
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,300
what if we ate a food that tasted like complete shit?

768
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,140
- Yeah, it was a prank group.

769
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,200
- Yeah, it was like a prank group.

770
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,040
- It's kinda like us.

771
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,320
- It's cool that like, back before the internet,

772
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,620
you could just do shit like that.

773
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,160
Like the only thing to really entertain yourself

774
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,400
was like, oh, we're not gonna fill,

775
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,880
we're just gonna do this just for us.

776
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,800
- Yeah, this is 1980s, there's no movies or books.

777
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,360
- We're gonna make a weird salad.

778
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,460
- That's basically what it was.

779
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:46,060
As far as I, listen, I haven't done any reading on this club at all, except maybe the first

780
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:51,060
couple lines of the Wikipedia page. But it seems like they started Burning Man, and so

781
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,740
they started Burning Man because they were like--

782
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
They started Burning Man?

783
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,940
Yeah, they were like, "Can we just go be weird in just a different area?"

784
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Wow.

785
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:00,540
And so they went to the desert in Nevada, and they were like, "This is seriously awesome,

786
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,380
and in 30 years there will be boobs here."

787
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,380
Yeah.

788
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
And so they basically did that.

789
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,180
It's so cool that Burning, like, Hoes corrupted it.

790
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,620
I kind of want to go to Burning Man.

791
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,580
mine if they what here's the thing like tech guys love Burning Man I'm gonna go

792
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,100
to bring man I'm addressed up like you us three dress all the burners dress up

793
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,820
like the ho busters right that's kind of a Ghostbusters they'll up dress up like

794
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:26,260
cops right and then we kill all the women who dress you dress like sluts at

795
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,820
the no I think we're gonna start our a separate a separate festival it's maybe

796
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:37,580
right next to it yeah so you can see it front you can see left we have a giant

797
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,580
effigy of a of a ho. We'll do a leftist one, it's called Burning Ho.

798
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,580
Burning Ho. Burny Man. Burny Man. We'll do a leftist Burning Man. How about we just

799
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,580
bring, how about a festival, right? It's called Burny Mac.

800
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,580
How about Turning Man? Burny Mac Festival. And it's all

801
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:57,580
Burny Mac impersonators on stage, each doing different sets.

802
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,580
I will say for Burning Man, it's cool that they do actually have a Burning Man.

803
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,580
How about Furnace Man? And we get a guy who can light it on fire. Most festivals don't have an

804
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:13,540
Coachella that's a really good and at rolling loud they never roll loud well

805
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:18,180
there's some people in the crowd it's illegal to do that so they don't do it I

806
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:22,260
think they do it because it's in its legal state and Woodstock has nothing to

807
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,900
do with peanuts that's a good point yeah that's burning man they're like we know

808
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,260
we know what you want I watch that Woodstock 99 documentary and I learned

809
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,760
and they had no peanuts there. I got mad. It's crazy how they keep making

810
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,560
Woodstock 99 documentaries. I feel like there have been like four in the past

811
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,560
year. Yeah, and they're all so bad. It's been enough time that everyone would

812
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,060
stock no peanuts.

813
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,060
Sorry.

814
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,060
The Bella.

815
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,760
Oh man, you've made my phone fly.

816
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,960
What the fuck?

817
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
How did you do that?

818
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,860
Do I ring a bell for myself?

819
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,700
(knocking)

820
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,540
- There you go.

821
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,780
- You're making my computer fly.

822
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,060
- His phone's already breaking.

823
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,900
- I'm sorry.

824
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,740
- What were you saying?

825
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,560
- I'm trying to break it more.

826
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,400
- What were you saying about whatever you were saying?

827
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,500
- I don't even know, I'm so mad about my friend

828
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,780
destroying your property.

829
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,620
- It's fucked up, man.

830
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,460
- I didn't destroy it.

831
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,280
- You destroyed my property?

832
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,500
- Look at the back of his phone right now.

833
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,760
- It already was like that earlier.

834
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,340
You complained about that earlier.

835
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,260
- No, you added that crack.

836
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,860
- Yep, you added that one right there.

837
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,900
- No, you're ganging up on me.

838
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,580
I heard Patrick comment on this crack.

839
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,380
- Yeah, that's called democracy, asshole.

840
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,220
- No, it's not.

841
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,220
Wait, no it's not.

842
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,220
That's called corruption.

843
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,300
You know, if you tap the Apple on the back of your phone three times, you can program

844
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
it to do stuff.

845
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
Yeah, I made it go to my camera.

846
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
Really?

847
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
It's two times, I think.

848
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Wait.

849
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
Not three.

850
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Watch this.

851
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,300
What did I do?

852
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
Check this out.

853
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
I think mine is screenshots.

854
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,300
I have to unlock it.

855
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,340
See, I was going to set it to screenshot, but then I was like, I don't want to accidentally

856
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,340
take screenshots.

857
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
Mine is really, there we go.

858
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,340
See?

859
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,340
Whoa, mine doesn't do anything.

860
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
How did you do that?

861
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
You have to go into the settings.

862
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Yeah, you can do that.

863
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I won't be doing that.

864
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,340
It's a little daunting for me.

865
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,140
I mean I can get to the camera way more easily than doing that.

866
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,140
It's not a funny trick.

867
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
Why would you do that?

868
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,140
I'd be like a ghost is haunting my phone.

869
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
Why would they add that?

870
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Why would they add that feature?

871
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,260
I did that and put my phone to sleep.

872
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,260
But you're still tapping.

873
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,260
For people who have like one arm.

874
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,020
For people who can't like, yeah, swipe or have, it's hard for them, it's easier for

875
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,620
them to tap the back of the phone.

876
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,620
To get to one thing?

877
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,140
Yeah, I mean, or like for example, a screenshot if you can't reach the two buttons.

878
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,140
Oh, if you have one finger or something.

879
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,140
You can program it to do different things.

880
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
Oh, yeah, makes sense.

881
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,140
Okay.

882
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Alright, why might I do that?

883
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,140
It doesn't have to be a camera.

884
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,740
also do it for lazy fucking fat guys that's what it's that's what it's used

885
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:38,260
by yeah lazy fat ass yeah if you hit it three times what does it do made

886
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:45,200
everything a little bigger okay okay so then you can do this what it you have to

887
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,640
do this podcast is almost getting too good that's called Apple pay I think

888
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,180
that we need to be tested for performance enhancing drugs yeah yeah or

889
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:58,400
would you submit to a to a urine test Patrick yes and you Cameron sure I won't

890
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,300
be doing it I'll be administering the tests okay well I'll test you after and

891
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,860
I'll administer your test with your mouth yeah well that's how you test it

892
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:14,060
they drank Roger Clemens pee did you get what to test his blood for PEDs to be

893
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:24,460
blood for me they drank is Roger Clemens is a pitcher for the Red Sox then he

894
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,780
left for the Yankees they drank his blood and drank his blood and his pee to test

895
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,140
it for performance-enhancing what is it taste actually was on the Astros when

896
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:39,300
that was tested that what does it taste like PDS PDS tastes like licorice so if

897
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,740
your blood or pee tastes like licorice you've done PDS before in the past mm-hmm

898
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,020
Did you guys ever do you ever have a drug test when you were like in high school or

899
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,760
something? No. You had to do you had to take one of those rehab one of those like

900
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,420
drug test clearing things? I never got I never got drug tested. You never got drug tested?

901
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:01,080
I think I got drug tested like one time. I can't remember. I feel like in my brain I

902
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,300
can't tell the difference. Why did you get a drug test? It was in Boston for some

903
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,340
reason they were like you have to take a drug test and I was like. Were you

904
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:15,120
applying there? Yeah. Oh okay. No I was buying. I thought I was like yeah get this

905
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,860
like RTX 2070 you can't you have to pass a drug test. No but they did it but for

906
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,860
because it's a it's a national company or whatever their policy was that you

907
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,820
can't have marijuana in your system to work at micro center so I just did. That's

908
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:34,340
crazy. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah that's the stupidest shit. They didn't realize I've have

909
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,840
I had a fucking chronic fucking inflammation at the time for two or

910
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,740
three weeks. I did. Yeah. Chronic inflammation in my fucking boring gland.

911
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,840
I was a damn bored and I need to uninflame it by smoking weed. Come on.

912
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,240
Ding that bell. Yes, sir.

913
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,040
Thank you.

914
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,840
I hate chronic illness. I can't stand the shit when somebody has a chronic

915
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,940
illness. I don't believe in chronic illness. I don't believe in in human

916
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,340
trafficking. None of that is real.

917
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,760
I'm serious. I don't believe in any of that.

918
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,520
I think if somebody puts a zip tie around your car, that just means they like your car.

919
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,880
My car's covered in zip ties, okay?

920
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,720
All my car's covered in zip ties.

921
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,040
It's been graffitied on.

922
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,440
I have a target painted on the top.

923
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,400
What if you... here's an idea for everyone who's worried about zip ties on cars for human

924
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,840
trafficking or whatever.

925
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,200
Put the zip tie on the car yourself so that the human trafficker thinks, "Oh, this is

926
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,200
someone else's bad choice."

927
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,440
Also, they're just giving teenagers funny prank ideas.

928
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,600
I have seen people believe this. I'm just going to start putting fucking plastic

929
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,920
bags and everybody. I mean that a lot of a lot of that stuff is fake, but I did

930
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,840
see there is actually one sign that you can tell if so if you've been marked for

931
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,560
human trafficking. All right, Bill. No, I'm see if you if you walk if you're in

932
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,600
the safe, you're in Wal-Mart and you walk out, you're walking out to

933
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,720
your car and you look at your car and you see on your car, you see a man in a

934
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,220
cloak wearing a sign that says slaver around his neck. Usually you should avoid

935
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:08,200
your car and you should call the police. Ladies, here's a quick tip on how to spot

936
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,600
if they're trying to human traffic you. I just walked out to my 2006 Ford Focus in

937
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,080
the Walmart parking lot and sitting in the driver's seat you can see there's a

938
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,080
man in a completely black hoodie. He has an evil smile, has completely red eyes. If

939
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,440
you see this, you need to call the police. Do not get in your car. Yeah. Usually

940
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,280
another way to tell is if you're walking down the street and a man starts chasing

941
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,200
you with a burlap sack that's usually a giant butterfly net I went to my car the

942
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,700
or it's a butterfly net you might have been an escaped ape yeah or that person

943
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,080
could be looking for butterflies you ever you look at your car might be a

944
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,920
butterfly you might be a butterfly you might be a butterfly you leave the walmart you start

945
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,200
walking towards your car in the parking lot you start to start to notice as

946
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,500
as you're walking towards it. It's looking a little bit more to D is as

947
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,660
closer to it and behind it, you can see a guy holding up a big cardboard car.

948
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:08,940
If you notice that your car is within a giant cage and maybe one side of the

949
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:13,660
cage is propped up by a piece of wood, then if you might be a butter, if

950
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:17,040
you're coming out of walmart, okay and you get in your car and then you

951
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,460
realize that you're actually not in your car, you're in the back of a van

952
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,360
your wrists and ankles are tied together.

953
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,620
And they've given you a fake steering wheel.

954
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,240
And then you get out of the car and you're in Thailand.

955
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,320
Do you think you probably are on vacation?

956
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:35,920
Do you think when somebody gets human trafficked like that at a Walmart parking lot, like if

957
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,600
it does happen, do you think they keep the groceries?

958
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,160
I feel like that's a...

959
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,160
That's a tough thing.

960
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,160
You've killed this woman.

961
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,600
That's why they get them from Walmart.

962
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,600
You've killed this woman, you've drank her blood, and then you're like, "Well, there's

963
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,760
there's eggs, there's frozen stuff in here. We can't put it somewhere.

964
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,480
No, it's a bonus because if you, I mean, you put, you grab a woman from

965
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,640
walking on the sidewalk. I mean, sure, you got a new slave, whatever, but you

966
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,560
grab one from Walmart, you got a slave and you got a brand new Blu-ray box set

967
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,840
from the DVD section of Walmart. Also- You ever bought groceries at Walmart?

968
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,600
These guys are- Yeah. You cut into a red onion from Walmart, the middle of that

969
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,560
thing, mold. Why are these the only criminals? I think that might be one red

970
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,480
onion. These are the only criminals- It happened every time I bought a red onion

971
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,940
Walmart. These are the only criminals that aren't telling on themselves on like

972
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:27,300
Instagram live. Everybody else is like, everybody else is like has video of their

973
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,460
guns or like credit cards they've stolen. You never see somebody like going around

974
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,140
they're like check this out y'all just a bunch of women in shackles in a basement.

975
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:41,340
You don't see that dude. How are they so good at keeping the secrets? Yeah we're

976
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,980
posted at Walmart we're about to steal a Debra or a Dennis. Yeah. Like they have

977
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,180
that guy is getting human trafficked. Well, because you see they just have

978
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,080
this it's like a picture and it's a guy holding a red sharpie and he's like you

979
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,900
know what it is and there's like a red X drawn on a car. If you know, you know.

980
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,440
Yeah.

981
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,160
Yeah, actually I mean in the Bible that happens, they're marking doors. That's

982
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,740
true, blood of the lamb. Yeah, well that's a thing and maybe that's it's a

983
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,600
blessing if you have the plastic bag, it means your first born son will be

984
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,340
spared and you'll be passed over. When did all of that human trafficking

985
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,740
stuff started. That was when aunties started getting whatsapp.

986
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,580
That's what cave paintings originally were.

987
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:27,660
If you see an antelope in your cave,

988
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,860
then you need to vacate. You need to go stay with the neighbors.

989
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,620
You need to migrate across the land bridge to America. Yeah, that's why they did it.

990
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,660
I do feel bad for people who do get human traffic though.

991
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,660
Really? Is that true? Because it's very degrading.

992
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,740
It is. It's embarrassing. Yeah. But you don't,

993
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,940
I don't know I don't know anybody who's gotten human trafficked. No, I've never

994
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,780
heard of anybody getting human trafficked, but maybe that's because the

995
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,500
traffickers are so good that they put a decoy. But then all the anytime there's a

996
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,460
missing person, any time there's a missing person there it's always

997
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,700
like it's always like their grandma who's the one who's like yeah they got

998
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,540
human trafficked and they're like I even though they found a skull that has the

999
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,540
exact same proportions as this person. They're wearing the exact same sunglasses.

1000
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:19,260
yeah exactly we're missing yeah same outfit yeah it's in their bed yeah self

1001
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,220
and be healthy even though we've got a body that looks almost exactly like it

1002
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:28,660
was a decoy put I don't like a study or something that talks about like all the

1003
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:33,420
human trafficking shit yes there's a well no there's a guy who is it there

1004
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:39,540
because it feels like what's the name of the governor of Minnesota dude Ron Paul

1005
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:46,300
No, the old-- Oh, Al Franken. No, the fucking-- the one who was crazy, the wrestler man. Jesse Ventura?

1006
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:52,220
Jesse Ventura. He was-- he is a proponent of this theory where this guy wrote

1007
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:57,540
this book that is like the secret epidemic of like missing people and

1008
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:02,140
he purports that there's some kind of like crazy like conspiracy where

1009
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:07,860
like 50,000 people go missing every year or whatever. But the statistic of like

1010
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,540
50,000 people go missing every year is like to be qualified as missing you can

1011
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,460
just be away from nobody saw you for like 24 hours so most of people either

1012
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,260
killed themselves or just show back up yeah I mean people I think people get

1013
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,780
human trafficked a lot but it's not it's not Walmart it's not it's not Walmart

1014
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:28,180
it's not happening it because there's one video I saw where it's like a woman

1015
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,220
is describing her almost getting human trafficked and it's clear that it's just

1016
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,780
like a it's a tick-tock it's one of those ones where they like fucking zoom

1017
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:40,100
in on themselves like yeah oh my god you guys and they like the zoom hard zoom

1018
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,260
onto their own face so she's gonna do it's clear mind yeah she's got like kind

1019
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:50,220
of like a Spielberg Ian it's kind of take on human trafficking and it's like

1020
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:57,240
clear that she's like like as a dude trying PUA tactics yeah because I guess

1021
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,360
the only thing it's a guy different hard monty yeah the only thing different

1022
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,400
between the only difference between I guess like human trafficking tactics and

1023
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:14,900
like PUA stuff is violence. Yeah, yeah, and I would say Romania. Yeah, yeah, and

1024
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:21,040
Andrew Tate. You get sent to, I think that's most human traffic

1025
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,680
stuff you get sent to Eastern Europe and then you get shipped out and then

1026
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:38,680
you're on a reality TV show. Or you're a crypto gambling host. Yeah, chain to the table. You're

1027
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:47,080
playing craps for people. You go directly to stake.com and you hand operate a slot machine.

1028
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,760
Pretty good idea actually. They should be doing, like you know how they have, you know

1029
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,000
that one poster of all the Pink Floyd albums on the women's back, you should do

1030
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,560
that with slot machines so that there's a human slot machine element. That is genius.

1031
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:07,440
I thought you were saying do that with missing people posters. Oh that's a

1032
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,160
good idea. That's also good though. Yeah you should be, I feel like you should have a

1033
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,560
naked photo of somebody if they're missing. No not a naked photo of the

1034
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,280
person but like the Pink Floyd album cover except if they're not

1035
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,280
not album covers, just high profile missing people.

1036
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,520
And you hang that up in a college dorm,

1037
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,120
so then, who's the most, Gen Z, statistically,

1038
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,640
they're the most socially conscious.

1039
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,880
So they're gonna see that in a dorm,

1040
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,160
they're gonna start a movement

1041
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,840
to find all these missing people.

1042
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,920
- Speaking of movement and missing people,

1043
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,600
I heard in Eastern Europe, all their cars

1044
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,360
are like Flintstone cars that are powered

1045
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,640
by women from Walmart.

1046
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,040
- Yes, which by the way, speaking of return to tradition,

1047
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,040
let's go back to those cars.

1048
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,100
rid of these electric cars let's go back to it let's go back to that little red and yellow

1049
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
car.

1050
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,100
I want to return to tradition.

1051
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100
Get rid of that little red and yellow car in your neighborhood.

1052
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,640
Red and yellow car that runs on feet.

1053
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,960
Yeah get rid of this fucking watch on my wrist.

1054
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,960
A dinosaur.

1055
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,880
They should make a big version of that red and yellow car for adults.

1056
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,880
I agree.

1057
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,880
I'm so tired.

1058
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,480
Don't make me yawn man.

1059
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,200
I've been watching this kitten.

1060
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,480
Ding ding ding.

1061
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,760
Yeah the kitten's taking you out.

1062
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,920
He just learned how to climb up the couch.

1063
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,760
- Luckily a cat stays inside.

1064
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,640
A dog has to go, you have to run with a dog.

1065
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,120
You have to go to a place with a dog and go, "Wah!"

1066
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,000
- This cat, I found a stray on the street.

1067
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,080
I took it home, I nursed it back to health,

1068
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,840
and honestly, I wish it stayed sick.

1069
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,360
- Basically, it's basically what me and Cam did with you.

1070
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,320
- I wish he stayed sick.

1071
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,400
He used to stay in one spot of the apartment.

1072
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,040
He would use his litter box, he would eat, that was it.

1073
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,680
now he's too healthy he's running around the whole place.

1074
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,600
He stays up to three in the morning.

1075
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,880
We found Patrick in a plastic box on the side of the street.

1076
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
It was a bin.

1077
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
There was a lid on.

1078
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
Tuffs of hair missing.

1079
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
This kitty.

1080
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,360
It turns out we thought someone had left him.

1081
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,320
Turns out he got stuck in the box himself.

1082
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,200
And I was shaving my head.

1083
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,200
We had to take him to the vet, get him all sorts of shots.

1084
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,760
We had to teach him English.

1085
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,280
They had to mess with his anus a bunch.

1086
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,880
Similar to the cat I found, I had an impacted anal gland.

1087
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,880
Yeah, well they said they actually...

1088
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
We were never able to explain it.

1089
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,600
Yeah, the vet said it wasn't actually an impacted anal gland.

1090
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
It was some...

1091
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
It was some...

1092
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Well, the vet that we took him to.

1093
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,600
Yeah, we took him to a vet.

1094
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,600
Yeah, obviously.

1095
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,600
It's less expensive than a doctor.

1096
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
I had a lot of hair on me.

1097
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,600
It was a lot less expensive.

1098
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,640
But the vet said it was something going on with the anus that he'd never seen before.

1099
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,680
He didn't know what it was called, the problem.

1100
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,760
They said he had avian flu.

1101
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Uh-huh.

1102
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Yep.

1103
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,280
I got it from eating chicken.

1104
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,960
I said he had he had a caterpillar AIDS mm-hmm that's true.

1105
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,240
I mean like that's a what is that what and he said I don't know I don't know

1106
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,080
right now I'm a crazy silly doctor and that's when we ended up going to a

1107
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,840
different vet yeah I went to a different vet yeah because he was making stuff up

1108
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,600
so that you would pay more yeah yeah yeah and he also charged to wipe your

1109
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:07,720
butt mm-hmm yep dude I got a I gotta go I gotta bring that cat I gotta do stuff

1110
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,940
with that cat. What are you gonna do with the cat? I'm gonna make sure he's not...

1111
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,980
Dude, his butthole, I took a photo of him I was like oh that's cute he's laying on

1112
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,580
his belly. I looked at the photo and you can see his butt is just poking out.

1113
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:25,380
You got a slutty cat? Dude, I don't know. You have a hoe cat? I found him on the street in

1114
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,140
front of the office. Yeah. He's about to get hit by cars. That's not very smart of

1115
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:36,220
him. No. So you got an idiot too? He's so dumb. He's so stupid. Phil tries to chase motorcycles. Yeah.

1116
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,660
it's pretty stupid yeah you're not gonna win that fight buddy no you're not gonna

1117
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:43,620
win that race I think he could maybe he's getting fast again think about

1118
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:48,660
think about that like the two fat twins who ride the motorcycles hmm I think if

1119
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,620
you had the two twins yeah me neither what you ever seen that photo to like

01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,300
also wearing overalls and if I just search fat twins on motorcycles do you

01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:14,300
think it'll come up? That's an auto-complete, autocompleted, un-sepia-toned photo.

1124
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,340
The McGuire twins! Yeah. These fat twins are on a fucking motorcycle.

They're on Billy and Benny Lloyd McCrary. Oh these are okay so they're not it's not
