1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,540
- I had two Diet Dr. Peppers this morning.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,940
- We're back to the cable clap.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,660
He's recovered enough that he can clap.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,500
- He's not broken anymore.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,580
- That is so exciting.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,580
- You notice anything different about me, yeah?

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,420
- Pink earphones.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,580
- Oh, you're bald now.

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,340
No, I don't.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,380
- With those pink earphones

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,580
and your natural skin complexion.

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,420
- And I think you definitely have

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,920
- And this isn't a dig or anything mean.

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
- Just go ahead.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,460
- You look like a cartoon pig.

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,780
- Yeah, no, that's not mean.

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,980
- And this isn't a dig or mean or anything either,

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,580
but you smell like shit today.

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,840
(laughing)

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,900
- Juvia, do you wanna unmute?

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
You have anything to say to me today?

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,460
No, he says no.

24
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,300
- He doesn't want to.

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,260
- Okay.

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,860
- Jubio, what's that last thing,

27
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:02,020
what's that recommendation there?

28
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,860
- Recommended on our thing?

29
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,380
- What have you been looking up?

30
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,340
Why is that recommended to you?

31
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,180
- That's what do you--

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,780
- Based on your searches.

33
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,100
- I don't think it is, I think that's just

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,220
a fucking news story.

35
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,140
- Oh, that's just a news story?

36
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,260
- You're acting like the only people

37
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,780
that ever read anything about Hitler

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,500
or like people who are Googling Hitler all day.

39
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,180
- Yeah, and I think that's what Jubio's doing.

40
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,580
- You think he sits on the work computer?

41
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,920
- You think he sits on Caleb's computer?

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,500
- It's also Caleb's computer.

43
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,340
- Yeah.

44
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,180
- He's like, "Yeah, what are you talking about?

45
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,000
"It's just a news story.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
"What are you doing?"

47
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,920
He's not gonna look it up on his own computer.

48
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,580
Then people will get mad at him

49
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,080
when he types in H in Google and that pops up first.

50
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,920
- That's true.

51
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,120
Everybody, South America, oh my God.

52
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,400
- Yep, you're done for again.

53
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,000
- It's fucking over.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
It's over for me. - There must be

55
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
like one of those, you know, like the ghost in the machine

56
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
from that Scooby-Doo movie, the electricity ghost.

57
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,560
- You guys do a two guy thing.

58
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
- Okay.

59
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,060
I still have a hard time turning to the right, so this is tough.

60
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,060
Yeah, you've got a fucked up neck still.

61
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,860
I'm just going to do this.

62
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,860
That is, that must suck so bad.

63
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,760
Can you imagine if you and me just had our own podcast where we just kind of like looked at each other in the eyes like this and talked?

64
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,860
We've done it a few times.

65
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,360
What would we do? They were probably pretty bad, right?

66
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,560
I think we, well, I was audited for Scientology.

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,360
Oh, dude, that was fun.

68
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,860
That was actually a fire ass episode.

69
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah, so.

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,360
- We never did pre though, we never did pre pandemic

71
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,720
or whatever, we never did just us, it was always just me.

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
- Yeah, you and me never just sat down and just talked.

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
- There was only one Mommy's Gone episode

74
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
when Mommy was gone.

75
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,280
- Mommy was not around, Mommy's busy.

76
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,000
- Mommy's got the belt and Mommy's gonna hit us

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
with the belt right now.

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
- It's kinda scary what Mommy's doing.

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,320
- When Mommy gets that belt up, you know I get scared.

80
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,160
- I went to New England this weekend

81
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,080
- Man, I think I miss New England so, so, so much.

82
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,720
- I'm literally, I'm so excited to open.

83
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
- New England is so much better than New York.

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
- I do.

85
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,000
- Yeah, I'm so excited to do that show in Boston.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
- We went to this bar.

87
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,360
- I literally, I need to go back so bad, I miss it.

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,280
I wanna go to the TAM, I wanna recreate that fuckin' video.

89
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
- You have to.

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,760
- Three guys are screamin' the F word.

91
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,000
- We went to this bar, and there was a,

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
it was like, it wasn't even that late,

93
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,240
it was like 11 o'clock, and there was this guy,

94
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,500
We got there is there's a band playing as a pool table

95
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,740
And there's two guys playing pool one of them is like an old guy like you know guys are so old that they just look they

96
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,300
Have like black eyes permanently. Yeah, you know they have like purple around their eyes like stuff

97
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,360
There's really all the throwing up. They do every morning. It's got to be that

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,880
Yeah, just popped blood vessels from like trying to remember a birthday, and then this guy

99
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,720
he's sitting there, and he has like he has a predator like a really nice pool cue and

100
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,600
And he sucks, bro. This old man was fucking terrible. I've never seen a worse pool player,

101
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:51,400
but he was playing against this amazing, like, 35-year-old guy with skin like a wallet, who's

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,840
just like, was the drunkest I've ever seen anybody be. Just like a bar stool, like, New England guy.

103
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,440
And this guy would go down, he would miss a shot, and then he would just start dancing, just like,

104
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,000
"Ooh! Ooh!" Like, right in the old man's face. And they didn't know each other. So he's just

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
this random guy that was playing him.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it was making me...

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It was like a fucking nightmare.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It was like a nightmare where you can't like...

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You get in a fight and your punches go in slow motion.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because it was like, you want this guy to lose so badly.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And the guy that he's playing looks like he'd be a great pool player.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But he's just... The guy was like...

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Choosing to shoot the wrong ball every time.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The old man. He didn't go over and coach him.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm imagining now a nightmare where...

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, I'm playing pool and I'm horrible.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm losing to this guy and he's dancing in my face.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,960
face and it's like this horrible nightmare and right when I think I can't

119
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,000
get any worse I look down on my hands and they're all like arthritic.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
That guy was living an actual fucking nightmare.

121
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,000
He has dementia, he still thinks he's 16 at the bar.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,960
He was like, you know how sad it is when an old guy is like still doesn't

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
really have it together? Yeah. They're like kind of like it's clear that they're

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,480
like ordering food and they're a little nervous or something. Like an old man with social

125
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,360
anxiety. That makes me so sad.

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Dude, it's so fucked.

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,020
It's like, how is he not having it?

128
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,760
Do you know what's even...

129
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
French onions? No.

130
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh, I'm panic ordering. You're fucking 80.

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,500
Same, similar thing. When an old person is like a hoarder, but you can tell they

132
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,880
didn't like become a hoarder because they got old.

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,760
Like they have stuff that's like they've just they've been like that.

134
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,800
They've lived in a house filled with newspaper and beer bottles since they were a

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,280
kid.

136
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,960
Scary.

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,520
Yeah.

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,880
Like that's what they're used to.

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,760
- Yeah, it's not that that's like an old person thing,

140
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,600
it's that they've been doing it for 80 years.

141
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,440
- Yeah.

142
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,520
- The idea of an old person like, yeah,

143
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,340
going to Starbucks and having the person they're with

144
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,320
order for them is like actually making me wanna cry.

145
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,160
- It's horrible.

146
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,240
- It's like the saddest thing I've ever even thought about.

147
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,080
- Oh my God.

148
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
- And just like an 85 year old guy--

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,920
- Doing that but then both of their fingers break.

150
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
- Yeah.

151
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,580
(laughing)

152
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,100
- An 85 year old guy who goes to the movies

153
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,320
and the guy's like, "Enjoy the movie."

154
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
And he says, "You too."

155
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,680
And he's like, "Oh no."

156
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, no.

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,880
Well, that's yours.

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,320
The thing is that old guys--

159
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,680
He's going home, and he's dipping his quill in his inkwell,

160
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,120
and he's drawing a socially awkward penguin on a--

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
That's our crumb.

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
[LAUGHTER]

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
That is our crumb.

164
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,040
[LAUGHTER]

165
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,640
This guy was just like that, bro.

166
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,240
He was like--

167
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Well, yeah, that's what I was going to say.

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,520
He kept stripping over himself, and he

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,920
tied his shoelaces twice because they just came untied.

170
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,920
It's just like old guys like that.

171
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,720
If you were a nerd in the '50s, you're still more--

172
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,520
You stuck with that.

173
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,960
You're like you're like our crumb though. You're like a guy who's just very vindictive

174
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,080
Like very like I fucking hate it. You know, you know how and like, you know how in like UHF

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,580
Weird Al is like the guy and he like forgets us to go out to dinner with his girlfriend

176
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,580
You know that like yeah of trope that like an old guy who does that I feel like usually that's like the old guy

177
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,880
You're like, oh, he's TC now. He's and he doesn't care and it's cool

178
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,760
But an old guy who can achieve being that kind of like forget like somehow I'm imagining

179
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Like an old guy who's forgetful but you can tell it's not dementia at all and that he's just like completely just a fuck up.

180
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Yeah, like imagine Mr. Bean was like on like Medicaid.

181
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
That's scary.

182
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
He is now, fucking old ass bitch.

183
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Yeah, I don't think he's on Medicaid. I don't think he's in American citizenship.

184
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
He's on Medicide!

185
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,760
He's on the NIHA.

186
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,360
That's just a new phenomenon though. I don't think old people are afraid.

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,360
You're in fear of the future where there's going to be old people like that for sure.

188
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Old people ordering at restaurants are so confident.

189
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
Yeah, that's what I mean. That's what's scary.

190
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,480
That's because people with social anxiety back in the 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s used to string

191
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
them up by their feet. Split their throats.

192
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,280
It's the same feeling I have when I used to watch a Larry King interview or whatever,

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,820
and he's 98 years old and all he talks about

194
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
is how scared he is of dying.

195
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,660
It's like, bro, that's not what I want to hear

196
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,500
when I'm a kid.

197
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,440
- No, yeah, it is, you are, I'm feeling a fear

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,100
that I never thought of before.

199
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,120
It really is bothering me to think about an old,

200
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,540
like, the way that I usually think about an old person

201
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,820
being a fuck up is like, oh, he's like a,

202
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,500
he's from a different time.

203
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,140
Like, yeah, he's like, he doesn't get how to interact

204
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,120
with his children.

205
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
- No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,920
- Like my granddad's so much like that.

207
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,960
- Yeah, just, yeah, oh my god.

208
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
It's really terrifying.

209
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Yeah.

210
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
And those are like, and now that I think about it, I think most old people are like that.

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,040
Like no old people have it figured out really.

212
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Yeah.

213
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
They just, yeah.

214
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Well, I mean, I think a good chunk of them do.

215
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,760
But like maybe even my grandpa, now I'm thinking back at like times when he just like said

216
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,920
shit that made no sense and I'm like, oh, maybe he just got so like overwhelmed and kind

217
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,360
of anxious that he just was weird, you know?

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,560
My grandpa, I mean I talked about my grandpa just forgetting my name, but like that, I

219
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
think he's the polar opposite.

220
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Maybe he's also just stupid.

221
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Yeah.

222
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,600
Like this idea of a stupid old person is pretty sad too.

223
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
Yeah.

224
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,280
I think it's the polar opposite guy you're describing, like the old man with social anxiety.

225
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
This is the jock.

226
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
The jock, my grandpa.

227
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
That's what I'm saying.

228
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,380
My grandpa was like, "Ah, Chris, whatever, the fuck."

229
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,240
Every old guy, I think they're the jock.

230
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Yeah, me too.

231
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Just because of the way that their skin looks.

232
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Because jocks usually live longer.

233
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Yeah.

234
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
- They killed themselves.

235
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,080
The jocks lived. - Yeah, they know how

236
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,560
scary the world is. - The jocks lived.

237
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,380
The jocks spread their seed to generations, right?

238
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,240
The jocks are the ones with all the grandkids.

239
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
- Yeah, the nerds never fucked.

240
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,400
- The nerds never got no damn pussy.

241
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,760
- No, they got sent overseas to do codes.

242
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
- Exactly. - Yeah.

243
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,000
- Yeah, they stayed in Vietnam.

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
- Yeah. - 'Cause they got there

245
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
and they were like-- - And they were like,

246
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,960
"Do you guys have anime?" - "Oh my God, wow.

247
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,440
"We should invent anime."

248
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,520
- I know it's the wrong country, don't worry about it.

249
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,760
(laughing)

250
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
The nerds are over there, man.

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,180
- The bears are still in Vietnam.

252
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,520
And you know what the worst part about the nerds in Vietnam

253
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,720
is, is that they're making all these fucking foodie videos.

254
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
- They're like weebs for fucking Vietnam in the 60s.

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,440
They're like, "Oh my God, is that a hole in the ground

256
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,780
"I can live in?

257
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,200
"That's amazing."

258
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Like, crap.

259
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Oh my God.

260
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
- Yeah, they were like that though, I bet.

261
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
- Yeah, there was definitely a lot of people

262
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,200
who probably just were, I think that--

263
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
- There was a lot of soldiers with glasses in Vietnam.

264
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
- Do you guys ever think about,

265
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,400
if you got forced to go into the military,

266
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,840
Would you go MIA?

267
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
Would you go AWOL?

268
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,520
- Dude, I would go AWOL immediately.

269
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,720
- I think I'd also go AWOL.

270
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
- I would probably do surgery on myself

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,080
and remove my hamstrings or something.

272
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,920
- I know somebody who went AWOL.

273
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,000
- What the fuck are you talking, why?

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
- What?

275
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
- Oh, to get out of.

276
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,500
- Yeah.

277
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,340
- But what if they were like--

278
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,320
- 'Cause anything, if I break my leg,

279
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,840
they're gonna be like, "You broke your leg."

280
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
But they're not gonna believe,

281
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm gonna say, "I was born without hamstrings."

282
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,800
- And I just never noticed until today.

283
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,480
- Oh, and by the way, I hurt both the backs

284
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
of my legs recently, so if you see two little stitches,

285
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
- I hit myself on a razor scooter.

286
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,560
- But what if you fuck up, right?

287
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,400
What if you go like Axel from Twisted Metal,

288
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
you put your arms into some wheels--

289
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,680
- Oh yeah, and then they're like,

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,520
"Yeah, you front line!"

291
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,340
- Yeah, yeah.

292
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,600
- "We actually wanna clone you!"

293
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,380
- You actually will now be the prototype

294
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,220
for every other person, right?

295
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,480
- That's true, I guess I would run away from the army

296
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
unless the offer they're making me is that,

297
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,600
"We want you to join the army

298
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,960
"and we're also gonna clone your genome for eternity."

299
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
(laughing)

300
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,560
And you're gonna be, the entire army is gonna be you.

301
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
- Yeah.

302
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,220
- I would do that in a heartbeat.

303
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,480
Most famous guy in the world.

304
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,320
- Do you think we'll ever be at a place where--

305
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,840
at a place where I've been America if you had wheels for our I feel like a turret

306
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,360
on your belly hundred thousand Captain America yeah you'd have a turret in your

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,480
belly that was like a Gatling gun Wow you're rolling down the bar and then we

308
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,720
would we would we would fucking we would we'd go to the bar after we take out the

309
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,560
whole bar everyone's everyone's out because we're just we well we wouldn't

310
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,160
kill them we can't stop shooting your belly gun but we would just just imagine

311
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,880
every time you breathe in and out of shooting a new bullet imagine you go to

312
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
the bar on the base, the military base, and it's just all you.

313
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Damn.

314
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Just all singing Irish drinking songs.

315
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,520
Everyone trying to say I'll buy you the next round.

316
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
Yeah, everything in unison.

317
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,720
I'll buy you the next round.

318
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,160
Do you guys ever think, this is a terrifying concept if you love violence, do you ever

319
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,880
think that all of our wars will be fought in virtual reality?

320
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,440
No.

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,080
No, because you're good. It's like it's like training for that. It's like when you

322
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,880
play with a cat with like a laser pointer, right? They don't feel fulfilled

323
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,880
because they didn't have something they could like sink their teeth into or their

324
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,320
claws and like pretend that they're killing. Because they think it's a lady

325
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,960
bug. Yeah, yeah. It's a bug that they're chasing but it's not. It's just a little

326
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,120
red dot. True. Here's what I'll say and this is a little bit maybe of a history

327
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,120
lesson. But you guys are going to need it. Because wars, the soldiers, I think the soldiers

328
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,000
have always been, those are the stupid guys and they just say, you guys can fight each

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,320
other, whatever, you guys go out there, we'll just send you over there to fight, go play

330
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:00,200
outside. Why do they always send the poor? The real wars, what it's always been, it's

331
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,680
about spies. And the spies are the top level and the spies are going back and forth and

332
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,600
stealing documents and stealing cars and stealing paintings and back and forth.

333
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,040
They're opening up, I guess.

334
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
And that is, and exactly.

335
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
And putting it away.

336
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
My knowledge of spies.

337
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,720
And that is what will move on line. The soldiers, they never mattered. That part of the war

338
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,860
is nothing.

339
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,000
My whole knowledge of spies, everything I know, is that there's a black guy and a white

340
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,440
guy and they're trying to give each other a bomb.

341
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah.

342
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Yeah, yeah. Is that true?

343
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Yeah, I actually had a whole book about that as a kid.

344
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah?

345
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
And some of it was a little gory.

346
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah. Did you ever read those?

347
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Spy vs. Spy?

348
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I read all of the Spy vs. Spy.

349
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
I was obsessed with Spy vs. Spy as a kid.

350
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
I loved Spy vs. Spy in the Mad magazines.

351
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I had the anthology of all the Spy vs. Spy.

352
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
And they had a bunch of...

353
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
They were all funny, first of all.

354
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
But they had the thing where they do guest artists or whatever.

355
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
And there were a bunch that were really funny.

356
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,640
artists or whatever and there were a bunch that were like really gory.

357
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Like really nasty.

358
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Like really detailed.

359
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,360
Rob would do all these really detailed paintings.

360
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,320
Did they ever do like a reverse cowgirl sex thing where you see the spy's cock squeeze

361
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,040
into the other spy's fucking asshole and it stretches butt cheeks apart?

362
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
What are you talking about?

363
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,840
Like this and he's looking back at the camera like yeah and they're fucking.

364
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
No.

365
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,000
The guy who made Spy vs Spy like escaped from Cuba or something.

366
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That makes sense.

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,200
was like I need to make I need to make spot. No. Yeah. He was like he like he

368
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,400
would he hated Castro and he was like I need to make this to show people what

369
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,300
it's like. That's what it was like there.

370
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,200
Just passing bombs back and forth.

371
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,500
I could be completely wrong about that. The last time that I know no, no, no.

372
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,200
You remember learning about that is when I was maybe eight years old. Next

373
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
time you're in a Barnes and Noble and a kid is reading a spy versus spy thing.

374
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
You should walk up and be like, did you know this is based on Cuba?

375
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Well, I remember I remember the anthology having at least at the very

376
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,380
least they talked about Castro in the like in the like intro or whatever and

377
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,360
where there was something about how he hated Castro. Was Spy vs Spy, was that all in

378
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,920
Mad Magazine? Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was? Yeah. Man that was one fucking crazy

379
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,440
magazine. I miss that so much. I miss getting them for Easter. I'd

380
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,880
never got them. You were never alive at a time when Mad Magazine was like a big

381
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,760
thing. It wasn't a big thing but they made it. I know they made it but it was

382
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,340
Terrible when we had when I was a kid it was good because I was a kid and I didn't know that was bad

383
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:33,200
No, I mean that's like like I still you got to see that your first fold in the way

384
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,060
Okay, but when you be a little pissed off if like a 14 year old now is like I love Smosh

385
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,660
No, yeah, you'd be a little bit like you don't know it would be we don't know so I had my dad

386
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,580
That's all that's videos. That's videos from but if they were saying but but they were saying I love Smosh

387
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,840
I love the fucking when they I love the girls in Smosh. Oh, yeah, okay good point

388
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,820
Yeah, the Mad Magazine we grew up with was bullshit. You know, it's some good

389
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,180
I have my my about Obama dad had they used to they had they put a lot of the Mad Magazine stuff into just paperbacks

390
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,260
Yeah, like collect stuff and he had a bunch of old ones of those

391
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,500
So I would always read those and those were fire

392
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,320
Do you guys sometimes feel like you were half raised in the 2000s and half raised in the 1980s?

393
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Yes a little bit because of your media

394
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,480
I tasted cuz I was walking around in my life, and I was people I was going at school saying yeah

395
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
My favorite movies you know Mel Brooks

396
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,580
Yeah, Brooks movie my favorite movie is the Mel Brooks film yeah

397
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,700
And I was like my favorite movie is you do the movie you I remember I said to somebody I said

398
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,500
I love young Frankenstein. They said I was at a rapper. Oh

399
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,420
Dude, I oughta fucking know it's the most terrifying movie ever made. Yeah, it's actually a really funny

400
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,960
You wouldn't be able to watch it alone.

401
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,840
It's the scariest comedy ever made.

402
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,680
So.

403
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,900
I did, I watched a lot of TV Land as a kid.

404
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,000
So I watched a lot of like different strokes

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,900
and like good times.

406
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,580
And then I think when I was like seven or eight years old,

407
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,820
I called something dino-mite to one of my uncles

408
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,740
and they were like, what the fuck are you?

409
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,820
'Cause you said dino-mite?

410
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,060
Like Jimmy JJ Walker.

411
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,860
Yeah, well of course, you should say dino-mite.

412
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,100
I think I should bring that back.

413
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,940
I think.

414
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
That's cool.

415
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,540
I think that what I should do is just watch Good Times again, just say everything that

416
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,380
they're saying. I think I should start calling stuff "Jive."

417
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,700
Yeah, I think you could do that.

418
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,060
I'd do that right now, but with YouTube.

419
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,460
You call YouTube videos "Jive"?

420
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,780
No, I watch YouTube and I say everything they say.

421
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:31,220
I do kind of do that. Yeah, I've had to stop. It's so easy to pick up on just funny words

422
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,940
from really stupid people.

423
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,860
Yeah. "Fact Not Fiction Playboy."

424
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,340
What's that from?

425
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
Dan Quinn.

426
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:42,780
Oh yeah. That's definitely in the upper half of words that you can take from Dan Quinn for sure.

427
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
Yeah.

428
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
Some things that you don't want to take from Dan Quinn.

429
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
There's one about a guy in the NFL.

430
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,780
Yeah, that's a bad idea to take him.

431
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,780
I was at dinner with Alex and Joe last night and Alex quoted it.

432
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,780
This guy's going on a double date.

433
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Name dropper.

434
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,780
Alex quoted it to me and Joe asked me why I was laughing and what it was from and then I just showed him that full

435
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,320
the Kim Dotcom video while the waiter was like pouring water.

436
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Dude, it's always the worst when you go out to a restaurant and the waiter can hear everything.

437
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Yeah.

438
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,500
You know, and you're like, "Oh man, I wanted to talk about porn."

439
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,860
I wanted to be silly and talk about poop.

440
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Silly things.

441
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Uh-huh.

442
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,860
I was at the gym a couple days ago and I was watching Fox News on TV.

443
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,220
Found that.

444
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,260
The Fox News with the sound off.

445
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,500
And I don't know if you guys saw anything with this.

446
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,980
I have no idea what actually the story is, but Fox, I just want to do a quick kudos and

447
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,220
a shout out to Fox News because they landed, I think, literally the story that they couldn't

448
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,780
have dreamed of in a million years.

449
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,140
The best, most Fox News story I've ever seen.

450
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
I feel really excited.

451
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Go ahead and tell me.

452
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,820
I know, I just want to give them a shout out.

453
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,980
I looked up at the TV when I was running on the treadmill and the headline that they had,

454
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:06,820
said, "prosecutor suspended from court case after misgendering child molester."

455
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:13,580
Wow. Isn't that incredible? Wow, that is incredible. I mean, you guys hate the player, but you've

456
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,020
got to respect the hustle. That is pretty incredible that they landed that one. Oh my

457
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,300
god. That is pretty amazing, man. And I'm truly amazed. I couldn't have dreamed of getting

458
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,740
that. It's so funny. The prosecutor was suspended. They were prosecuting a child molester and

459
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,020
They suspended him from the case.

460
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:36,620
They could, like, if you were in the writer, if you're like pitching the stories to Fox

461
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,300
News and you told them that, they would be like, "No, that's not believable.

462
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
That wouldn't fucking work."

463
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,060
And then you're like, "No, look, I have the proof."

464
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,420
That's Facebook comment fodder for like 20 years.

465
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Oh my God.

466
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
That's another.

467
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,100
That is the biggest WB we knew.

468
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,620
My uncles are going to have a fucking aneurysm over that.

469
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
That is pretty incredible.

470
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,300
It's so crazy.

471
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,540
I've been when I when we've been on the road. I've been just hotels always the only

472
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,000
News thing they have about hotels the only news thing they have is Fox Drake

473
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,540
I'll think I'm Drake

474
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Right now you think you think I'm dressed like Drake in any way he's Drake. Why are you making that face?

475
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,240
- I went to, anytime I'm in a hotel,

476
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,900
I just end up watching Tucker.

477
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,180
And Tucker had the best news story I've ever seen

478
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,840
in my life the other night.

479
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,740
His news story was,

480
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,240
of course liberals want to wear masks.

481
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,740
They're not very good looking.

482
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,180
(laughing)

483
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,740
And I was like, okay,

484
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,780
that is the most incredible thing I've ever seen.

485
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,500
That's the funniest thing.

486
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,660
And that's, by the way, that's on a channel,

487
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,860
it's called The News.

488
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
- Yeah.

489
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Like liberal women are so ugly they have to wear masks.

490
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,540
That is so fucking funny bro.

491
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,940
- On one, they've been firing on all sorts of people.

492
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,900
- Have you seen what's going on with Hannity?

493
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,500
- No, I mean was he just slammed food as always?

494
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,460
- No, he's literally like trying to look like Trump.

495
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,620
It's so funny.

496
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,500
- He's always had a bit of a--

497
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,780
- No, he's like getting, like he stopped dyeing his hair.

498
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,180
He's getting like Trump orange.

499
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,580
He's like putting on like Trump tanner

500
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,260
just to like look more like him so that like he thinks that like that's the thing.

501
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,540
GBO just googled Sean Hannity today and I do the same thing but it's so funny to google

502
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,860
a celebrity's name and then today.

503
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
Here he is today.

504
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,700
Dude he looked like Stephen Colbert back then.

505
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Everybody did.

506
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,460
Oh my god that must be why the rapport was so believable.

507
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,580
So fucking satirical.

508
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,340
I have a picture of it.

509
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,500
I was gonna make it my phone background.

510
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,140
Is it Hannity or Bill O'Reilly where old Killa Cam went on and said you mad?

511
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
You mad Bill O'Reilly.

512
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,180
Bill O'Reilly, okay. Wow, okay yeah, that looks very...

513
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,180
Oh yeah.

514
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,180
He looks just like Trump, yeah.

515
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,180
He does.

516
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm gonna punch in on that real, right quick.

517
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:07,500
I don't think he needs to. I think that people believe you. People believe that that's Trump.

518
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,220
It really just looks just like him.

519
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

520
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,620
But yeah, Fox News, it's cool that they are... Nobody seems to really care anymore, but for

521
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,980
For a while, people were so mad about Fox News.

522
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,380
I think eventually, though.

523
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,820
They're pretty incredible.

524
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,660
Now I'm watching them pretty much every day now.

525
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,220
And they are consistently--

526
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,580
China and Russia are teaming up.

527
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Oh, today, COVID was leaked from a lab.

528
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,220
They said that it's official.

529
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,720
OK.

530
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,580
But that's true.

531
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,100
Amazing.

532
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,340
There goes our monetization.

533
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,980
They often talk about families being murdered.

534
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,540
And they really are always just--

535
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,040
Oh, it's--

536
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,380
--hitting it.

537
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,180
- Yeah, they're hitting every single mark.

538
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,620
But do you remember Tommy Lahren?

539
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,020
- Yeah. - Oh yeah, I just

540
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,060
remembered her. - Ooh, the fuck,

541
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,940
not a damn soul is talking about her right now.

542
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,300
She was like a huge threat for a while.

543
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,060
- I thought her name was Tommy Lahren.

544
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,460
- I think it is. - Probably.

545
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,540
- Tommy Lahren. - But she's going by

546
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,060
Tommy Lahren so that doesn't sound gay and French.

547
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,660
- I always thought it was Tommy Lahren too.

548
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,540
- Now that it's all over, bro, she was kinda busted.

549
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,460
- He was, everybody was like, oh it's so dangerous

550
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:22,980
'cause she's like, if a conservative guy

551
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,380
was in a hot lady's body, he's like,

552
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,220
I don't know about a hot lady.

553
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,540
- Well, what I would do is I look at her

554
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,500
and I just see her and I'm like, damn, she's kinda hot,

555
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,420
and then I'm like, engage ideology glasses.

556
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,820
- That's right. - Ew!

557
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,020
- That's right. - Disgusting.

558
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,060
- She got fired, I was looking it up,

559
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,260
she got fired from the Blaze, which is like that,

560
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,780
I think the Daily Wire, whatever the fuck it is.

561
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,060
- That's Glenn-- - Oh yeah, Glenn Beck.

562
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,900
- Glenn Beck's thing.

563
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,720
- Glenn Beck's thing.

564
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,620
She got fired from Glenn Beck's thing for being pro-life.

565
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,460
- Wow.

566
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,300
- Or pro-choice.

567
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,120
- Yeah.

568
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,960
- Oh, she's pro-choice?

569
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,900
- Because she was a slut!

570
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,180
- Wait, she was pro-choice.

571
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,020
- Yeah.

572
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,700
- She said like, yeah, women should have abortions.

573
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,740
- Maybe she's not so bad.

574
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,580
- Yeah.

575
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,400
- Whoa, the ideology.

576
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,940
- That's why Trevor Noah was going on friggin' dates with her.

577
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,340
- Was he beating her up?

578
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
- That's what I remember.

579
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,020
- He was beating those cheeks?

580
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,840
- Oh my God.

581
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,180
- Dude, Trevor Noah.

582
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,420
- Imagine them creating the craziest TV show of all time.

583
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,860
- Trevor Noah's kind of legendary.

584
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,060
He's kind of legendary for that.

585
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,180
Kind of legendary status.

586
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,740
He dated Dua Lipa too.

587
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,420
Did he?

588
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,220
Yeah, remember that?

589
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,820
Dude, he fucked Tomi Lahren and Dua Lipa?

590
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,900
Wow.

591
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,400
Wow.

592
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,620
That's pretty incredible.

593
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,020
He's not funny, but--

594
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,520
Whoa!

595
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,020
Whoa!

596
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,820
Hold on, man.

597
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,320
Hold on.

598
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,140
Not funny, but hey.

599
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,300
Listen, if you're watching this, or if anybody

600
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,700
who's a part of the Hollywood celebrity group

601
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,460
is watching this--

602
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,100
And all that Fox News stuff, we are not.

603
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,860
We like him.

604
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,740
It's an ironic thing.

605
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,540
- Fox News is-- - It's an ironic thing.

606
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,220
- Fox News is not very good. - Not ironic.

607
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,580
- We like-- - Not the country,

608
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,380
it's ironic. - The oatmeal.

609
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,700
- We like the oatmeal. (laughs)

610
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,020
- What's that, is that a thing?

611
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,260
- We like-- - Sam Cedar.

612
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,100
- What is it? - Song Exploder.

613
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,260
(laughing)

614
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,060
- No, we like cyanide and happiness.

615
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,100
- Yeah. (laughing)

616
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,340
- That's where we get our stuff.

617
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,820
XKCD, that's our stuff.

618
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,380
That's where we get all our news from, not Fox News.

619
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
No, we don't read.

620
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,820
We're saying when we say Fox News

621
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,740
fucking rocks.

622
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,140
Yeah.

623
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,000
We're saying it also a bit of

624
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,460
a doomer ironic.

625
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,680
We also do not.

626
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,460
We don't look we don't like

627
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,780
Western centric news.

628
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,720
So we usually we do People's Daily

629
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,420
China News from Africa.

630
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,500
Al Jazeera.

631
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,020
Al Jazeera. This type of stuff.

632
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,900
We know we don't watch.

633
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,180
That's the guy that comes from over

634
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,980
the guy in my street.

635
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,740
I talk to Al Jazeera.

636
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,780
Al Jazeera.

637
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Cool.

638
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,540
And he told me Covid was created in

639
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,260
a lab.

640
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,820
- Yeah, well apparently it's official now.

641
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,540
- And he said that there's a prosecutor.

642
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,380
- Why do people care?

643
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,220
Why were people so hesitant to be like,

644
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,540
"No, it wasn't created in a lab."

645
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,420
It's like, who cares?

646
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
- Yeah. - Probably.

647
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,820
- I don't give a fuck.

648
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,660
- If that was created in a lab.

649
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,820
- It's way scarier if it actually came from a bat,

650
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,860
that's way scarier.

651
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,300
- Oh yeah. - Yeah.

652
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,140
- If it came from, what was it?

653
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,300
- That's true. - What was it that the

654
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,380
people were like, "Oh, people are eating bat soup and stuff."

655
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,500
- Yeah, but that just also looks kinda delicious.

656
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,460
- Yeah. - That looks like

657
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,300
one of those, the bat soup thing?

658
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,620
That's like a once a year meal.

659
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,860
- Actually, that is maybe the scariest thing in the world,

660
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,580
that you could be like, I'm gonna eat this,

661
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,260
I'm gonna, okay, they have a crazy thing on the menu,

662
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,940
I'm gonna try it, I'm gonna do it one time,

663
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,740
I'm gonna have bat soup, how bad could it be?

664
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,740
And you kill millions of people.

665
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,380
- That's literally what you say, you say out loud,

666
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,540
bat soup, how bad could it be?

667
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,380
Yeah, no, that is--

668
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,780
- Yeah, me, going to a restaurant,

669
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,460
we're like, yeah, we serve a kangaroo burger,

670
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,820
and you're like, ooh, interesting.

671
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,980
- Five million people are dead.

672
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
- I've never had bison before.

673
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,380
It's just an animal, it's not that crazy to bat.

674
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,900
- And I know this restaurant is taking

675
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,380
the appropriate safety precautions.

676
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,060
They're not just throwing all the--

677
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,660
- I never really processed that shit.

678
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,900
- Yeah, that is way more terrifying.

679
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,860
That's also a story nobody could ever believe that.

680
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,700
Of course that's not what happened.

681
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,180
- Eating the Domino's pizza out of your fridge

682
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,420
after six days, I mean, I really shouldn't,

683
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,180
but I'm really hungry.

684
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,180
destroy the world.

685
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,700
Just literally, just fucking

686
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,560
Molotov cocktails being thrown

687
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,620
into windows, right?

688
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,820
Families just being like, like

689
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,080
just X-ing out members of families

690
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
on the Christmas cards.

691
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,260
Because you were like, you're like,

692
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,880
do pepperonis go bad?

693
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,980
Wait, I don't think so, right?

694
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,540
You're like a ghoul.

695
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,480
Half the people that you know in

696
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,700
your life now have just like no stomach.

697
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Oh my god.

698
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Yeah.

699
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Yeah.

700
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,500
Of course it was just some guy in a lab was like, "I'll try."

701
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
"I'll try."

702
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
"I spilled this."

703
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,060
Yeah, just doing Powerpuff Girls and just mixing up the ratio.

704
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah, I just forgot to change clothes before I went home.

705
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Yeah, exactly.

706
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
That's it.

707
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Yeah.

708
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Yeah, there's no, I mean, it wasn't bats though.

709
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
People were like, "No, it's pangolins."

710
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
And I was like, "Okay, new animal to know about."

711
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
Pangolins are the ones with the big claws.

712
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Yeah.

713
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,040
Scales yeah, they are like one of the coolest looking art var animals. It's not an art work. You're more

714
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,820
It's like an armadillo or art work. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's an armadillo art bark

715
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,060
That was what that was an animal art bark. That's like my little brother used to only he called it an avocado

716
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,580
Couldn't say V's weirdest fucking

717
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,640
Speech impediment I've ever seen what is a pangolin

718
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,860
These animals are sometimes named the scaly and okay. I don't like it says another another notable. Okay, nevermind

719
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,500
I thought it said noble ant eating mammal.

720
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,340
- I don't like-- - It'd be noble.

721
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,100
- I don't like in-- - Eating ants are noble.

722
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,900
- Documentaries where they call an animal noble.

723
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,180
- I call every animal noble. - I like it.

724
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,380
- I don't like that. - I love it.

725
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,060
- What is the animal doing that's impressive at all?

726
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,660
- Look at that thing.

727
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,140
- This thing probably eats its own shit, man.

728
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,820
- If that's what fucking COVID came from--

729
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,180
- Then it beat us. - Isn't it crazy

730
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,660
that just diseases in general, they just come from animals?

731
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,780
- Yeah. - And then they just

732
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,580
make that leap, that's pretty scary.

733
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,900
That's what I'm pretty-- - Yeah.

734
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,480
- I've been recently very, very afraid of mad cow disease.

735
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
Mad cow disease is scary,

736
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,440
'cause it just pops up for no reason

737
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,620
in 250 people a year, and you have one month to live.

738
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,460
- Yeah. - Scary.

739
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,280
- One month to live?

740
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,680
- And here's the symptoms.

741
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,640
- No cure for it?

742
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,160
- No cure, here's the symptoms.

743
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
- Now you're getting me scared.

744
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
- Feeling crazy.

745
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,960
- Headaches, check.

746
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
I get headaches.

747
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,920
And losing your memory, check.

748
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,760
- Oh shit.

749
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,040
- I forget shit all the time.

750
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,960
- Yeah, I get kinda worried about

751
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,560
maybe I'll accidentally eat human flesh

752
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,600
and get like a prion disease or something.

753
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
- Yeah, the prion thing.

754
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,760
- Kuru or something.

755
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,520
- Yeah, so Mad Cow is prions.

756
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,600
I still don't really know what prions are.

757
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,560
I said it to somebody last night

758
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,680
and they were like, is that Scientology?

759
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,360
I was like, no, but I get how you could think that.

760
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
It does sound like a fake thing.

761
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,760
But it's like something that if you get too much in your brain.

762
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,400
- It's in brains too, I think.

763
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,040
Like if you eat, that's what you get prion disease if you,

764
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,320
I think, maybe not.

765
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,160
- But if you get too many prions.

766
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
- Well, I think you can get prion disease

767
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,480
from eating brain too, at least.

768
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,720
- That's P-R-I-Y-O-N-N-E-S.

769
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,880
- P-R-I-O-N.

770
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,600
- Damn, what am I thinking of?

771
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,520
- Wait, say it again.

772
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,960
- P-R-I-Y-O-N-N-E-S.

773
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,280
- That's a name.

774
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,120
- Prioness.

775
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,960
- Prioness?

776
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,780
- Prioness.

777
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,000
- Yeah, or like princess.

778
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,880
- What am I thinking of?

779
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,960
- All right, guys, I completely forgot

780
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,600
that we have an amazingly disgusting--

781
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,840
- Oh, speaking of eating.

782
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,880
Speaking of eating stuff until you turn it to a crazy thing.

783
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,800
- That was a good segue.

784
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,000
You got it today.

785
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,440
- Good job!

786
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,280
- Whoa!

787
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,120
- Wow!

788
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,940
- I'm pretty impressed.

789
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,920
That might be your first one ever.

790
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,880
- That's the first time I've ever done a good segue.

791
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
- That was pretty good.

792
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,320
- He has too much headroom in that shot.

793
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,580
(laughing)

794
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,740
- Yo, all right.

795
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,120
Let's get into it.

796
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,000
Today, we're doing a website.

797
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Should I say the name of the website?

798
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,240
- No.

799
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
- Yeah.

800
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
- It'll be in the slides.

801
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,880
- It's a website where there's a feeders forum

802
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,720
for people who--

803
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,520
- For people who like to eat sexually.

804
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,960
- Yeah. - And be fat sexually.

805
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,600
- Yeah, you may think that you like eating,

806
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,840
but I promise you don't like it as much as these people.

807
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,760
- And if you do, you should not watch this episode at work

808
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
'cause you might get a bonger.

809
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,360
- Also, yeah, I was thinking,

810
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,000
should we put a content warning on this episode or something?

811
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,640
Be like, hey, do you hate disgusting food eating?

812
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,960
- My stuff isn't that, I maybe have a few that are kind of

813
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,920
really nasty. - It's not as nasty as diapers.

814
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,040
- No, it's definitely not as bad as diapers.

815
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,280
- It's not as bad as diaper talk.

816
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,960
- If we combined the two, that could be great.

817
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,780
- I don't like that, which I think there is a bit

818
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,520
of an overlap, I'm gonna go with that.

819
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,560
- So, to get into this website.

820
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,280
- Yeah, it's like a forum, but it's kind of like a forum.

821
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Oh, and also, I want a shout out to a Twitter user

822
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,800
at Neurotard who sent this website to me.

823
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,120
Thank you, this is all for you.

824
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,780
- Don't agree with your username,

825
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,000
I think that is not okay to say.

826
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
- What's wrong with it?

827
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,960
- But thank you for sending it.

828
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,880
That's his name.

829
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,400
Yeah, that's his name.

830
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,040
Thank you for sending us that website.

831
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,860
But--

832
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,700
It's his name, I think he's named Jack.

833
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,700
It's a forum, but it's more like a social media feed

834
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,080
than a forum, which I didn't know of.

835
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,200
Yeah, feed is the operative word here.

836
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,760
It's basically a Facebook clone for people

837
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
who wanna get as fat as humanly possible.

838
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,160
That's crazy.

839
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,480
You might hear that and say, wait, you mean Facebook?

840
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,320
Oh shit.

841
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,200
Come on.

842
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
- That took--

843
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,840
- You have to make eye contact when you cheers

844
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
or it's bad luck.

845
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,520
- Let's dive in.

846
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,560
- All right, let's dive in here.

847
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,280
Also, I'm still getting into themes on PowerPoint.

848
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,080
I think you guys should look them up before--

849
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,220
- I really like, wait, okay,

850
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,120
so tell me about these themes, man,

851
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,400
because these themes--

852
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,520
- I looked up food theme.

853
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,640
- Wow.

854
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,440
- And look at that, look at that.

855
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,960
Comes with a preset background

856
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,120
of what I think is Korean barbecue or something.

857
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,040
- This is basically Incredi-Bad.

858
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,240
That is to say funny and original.

859
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,880
- First thing, first thing, well you guys,

860
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,120
I'm guessing that you guys used your computers to do this,

861
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,960
to look this up.

862
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,040
- No, I did it in my brain.

863
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,360
- You did it in your brain?

864
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,200
- I did it on an abacus.

865
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,000
- I just imagined everything.

866
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,720
- No, I'm just saying, I used the mobile app

867
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,440
that they have, the proprietary mobile app on Groico.

868
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,280
- Oh, Grocio.

869
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,560
- Grocio asked, as soon as I downloaded it,

870
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,160
it asked me to track my activity

871
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,400
across other companies' apps and websites.

872
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,240
- And you pressed a lot.

873
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,640
- And obviously I pressed allow.

874
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,680
They also asked for my location.

875
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,520
- Okay.

876
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,480
- So that they could get my approximate location.

877
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,760
- You do have to put your location in.

878
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,600
- Yeah, you do.

879
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,420
- Which is kind of weird.

880
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,280
- Yeah, I had to use this while I had to look this up.

881
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
I had to prepare for this episode

882
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
while I was moving my apartment.

883
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,120
So I had to use the app the whole time

884
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,760
and it tracked me the entire time.

885
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,720
So I was jumping all over the fucking place.

886
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
- It thought that you were going just kitchen to kitchen.

887
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,480
Just fucking slapping down croissants.

888
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
- Yeah, so this first thing here

889
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,160
is the first post that I saw.

890
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,720
Oh, this is my account.

891
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,560
Okay.

892
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,400
It's feedme, @feedmefoodboy.

893
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,200
Very, very funny.

894
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,960
And this is my profile picture.

895
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
Yeah.

896
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,640
(laughing)

897
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,940
Okay, yeah, I bet.

898
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,440
You got a lot of messages.

899
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,320
Yeah, I have a feeling.

900
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,560
I had a feeling that we were all gonna have

901
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,280
a pretty similar idea today.

902
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,120
Yeah?

903
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,240
I didn't make my profile.

904
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,080
No?

905
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,000
No, I figured that someone else was gonna do this,

906
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,440
but they like fat.

907
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,080
All right, well, I made my first post.

908
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,020
Feel so fat after deluxe cheeseburgers.

909
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,560
Wait, so on your app, it says like and comment.

910
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah.

911
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720
Because that's not how it is on the computer.

912
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,360
Oh.

913
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,880
I can't wait--

914
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,720
No, it's way better.

915
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,520
I can't wait to see what it's called when

916
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,920
we dive into your guys' stuff.

917
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,240
Mine says like and comment.

918
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,740
Really?

919
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,680
Yeah, what does yours say?

920
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,400
I guess we'll see.

921
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,800
All right, we'll see.

922
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,960
Wait, what do you mean-- what?

923
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,600
Mine said like and comment, I think.

924
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,920
Are we on a different website?

925
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,420
Maybe.

926
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,720
On Grommer?

927
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,200
Yeah, mine said like and comment.

928
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,480
All right, well, yeah, we'll get to it.

929
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Nears, feed me food more.

930
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,240
Feel so fat after deluxe cheeseburgers.

931
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,160
These are the kind of posts that you see.

932
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,380
Pounds of cake.

933
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,260
This is not directly referencing anyone,

934
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,720
but some of y'all need therapy.

935
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,600
- Damn, that's cold.

936
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,440
- A lot of infighting,

937
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,600
and I'm worried that they're talking about me.

938
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,440
- Probably.

939
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,560
- Yeah.

940
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,320
- Oh well. - That wouldn't surprise me.

941
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,640
- Every time my fat belly breaks something,

942
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
it brings me great delight.

943
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,120
Today I broke a ladder instantly when I stepped on it.

944
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,520
- Instantly. - That's what I've noticed.

945
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah, there's so many,

946
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
a lot of people on here,

947
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,000
their specific fetish about being fat is breaking stuff.

948
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,040
Who has cool cuz it's just ultimately a power fantasy. Yeah. Yeah, but also like what is that guy doing where he needs to get on a ladder?

949
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,600
painting

950
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,520
That's what it is get to the top of the fridge where you have the dog treats and you've run out of food in your house

951
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I like this

952
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,720
This just this boils the whole website down to its essentials. Yeah big fat belly eaten again bear cub 94

953
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,840
He's not that old for a belly that big no three more years. I could have a belly like that. Yeah, that's what I'm learning

954
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,320
Finding size fucking girl

955
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:06,600
I just tried the adventure fools or whatever they are and I'm already gonna go for another box and some thin mints probably gonna get

956
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,440
Some tagalongs too and those more ones fuck. I'm gonna buy a ton

957
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,320
Dude, if you buy Girl Scout cookies, and you eat them something's wrong with you, man

958
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,080
You you eat you eat one and you give them to somebody else

959
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,600
What? If you eat a whole box of Girl Scout cookies, I'm just anti, I've become very anti

960
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,760
sweets and cookies this year. I don't want cookies. You've completely lost the plot.

961
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,920
You think I've lost the plot, mate? You've completely lost the plot. You're acting strange.

962
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:40,680
You're acting, you're a bit daft. I only eat butter and meat. You have a tapeworm in you

963
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,680
that is probably eaten so good. You want a little, yeah you want a little one in you?

964
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,920
I don't want your tapeworm in there.

965
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
Whatever, bitch.

966
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,640
I don't want your tapeworm.

967
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,720
You want it?

968
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,840
The amount of C4 energy that that tapeworm has at creatine--

969
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,480
What's this?

970
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,600
That tapeworm, that is probably the--

971
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,480
It's super creatine.

972
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,200
It's swimming around in circles around in there.

973
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,240
You have bang energy in that or something.

974
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't believe that there's actual coffee in there.

975
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,920
I switched to coffee.

976
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,400
I've realized recently that caffeine is the most

977
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,160
fucked up extreme drug.

978
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,660
Yeah.

979
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,160
And it'll make you really scared of your own house.

980
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah, me too.

981
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,920
Continue.

982
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,600
Yeah, it's pretty scary puts a small mouse and crushes it in one hand in front of you. Are you afraid?

983
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,440
Do you have fear in your life eats the mouse that happened and there's nothing you can do about it shoves you

984
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,640
Fuck would like this one person likes this is a post from the blob

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,160
I'm imagining I'm sticking a tape measure into it.

994
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,000

1003
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,200
- I'd love to see one of those YouTube videos

1004
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120

1005
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,960

1007
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,160
This guy I really like.

1008
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,000

- The big fat greedy boss?

1014
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,560
That's good.

1015
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,160
- It's times like this you all have to suffer, my boy.

1016
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,120
Takes a bite of hoagie.

1017
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,040
You'll see when revenue is down, we have--

- Oh.

1020
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,800
We all have to do with less.

1021
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,760
I'm afraid there just isn't enough to go around.

1022
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,280
- Wow, the big, fat, greedy boss.

1023
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,680

He's pretty skinny.

1032
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,720
- Imagine getting that username on this website.

1033
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,560
- I know, oh man.

1034
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,380
- Yeah, that's pretty amazing.

1035
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,920
- Probably have to pay like $500

1036
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,600
Yeah, buy it from somebody buying it from somebody's

1037
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm gonna make a hundred accounts on here called like ice cream eater burger

1038
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,840
Making an account called hamburger

1039
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:56,200
You know, this is the bio being like you could buy this can be your username for $10,000 metabolism

1040
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:03,320
Yes, I'm gonna eat a tub of ice cream, but not sure if it's due down to boredom or horny

1041
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,960
Miss or both do you think these people just have a wire crossed in their head that confuses hunger in their penis?

1042
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,200
You know what it is what and I'll have a whole section on this in my slides, okay?

1043
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,860
But I think literally I think 75% of them got got this way from watching Willy Wonka. Yeah, no

1044
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:27,520
Yeah, I would know but this I have empirical yeah, we'll get to that. Okay this next person here. Oh, what's this one?

1045
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
What did it okay?

1046
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,620
Future chub any feeder wants to force tons of food and gallons of soda in my gut swelling it to dangerous state and shape and

1047
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:43,160
Making me almost a pop feeling of total overfeeding and tons of pain on my gut will make me pre come on it

1048
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Like it's a broken water

1049
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:53,980
The descriptions that they have on this website are pretty fucking crazy, and I don't remember if it's the next slide where somebody oh

1050
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,080
That's this one

1051
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,460
I love to be blackmailed to get fat

1052
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:06,080
trying to eat food for like four or five people delivered to me and having to record all my eating to not publish my cakes and

1053
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:12,480
Say, but I doubt it could happen a hot jocks. Give me food more comment. Oh interesting. Oh, they said oh

1054
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,200
Well you that's you that's you. Yeah, it's your account. You said you made that account

1055
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,600
That is I did. I thought maybe I cropped the screenshot. No, no you did not

1056
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,780
This next one oh

1057
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:33,680
My god little Susie fell down the well do something cracks a glow stick and throws it down the well thwack ow

1058
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,360
She's alive. You know what somebody is on here doing weird Twitter style line break jokes could have been

1059
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,640
Could have eaten her could have been worse could have been a lot worse a lot worse. He could have

1060
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,860
This is just a screenshot of yeah, I didn't really I didn't really have time to organize all my all my slides

1061
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,420
But I just wanted to show

1062
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,800
That this person just linked to YouTube. Yeah an amazing post

1063
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,260
Yeah, this is the same person these are I think all these next slides are from the same person who's who's?

1064
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,380
Trying their hand at these like line break style jokes here

1065
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:16,080
Gives you a comically oversized question mark to give to a friend when they say something that makes you go

1066
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,880
The fuck are you talking about and no you can't use it on me damn

1067
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,360
I would like to gift you a comically oversized question I with the way my brain works

1068
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,320
I know I'd be getting that thing a lot. Yeah for sure for sure for sure for show for show my new catchphrase

1069
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:37,640
This next one here takes an overdose level of laxatives and stands in the elevator for 12 hours with an unending

1070
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,240
unresponsive smile evil smile

1071
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,920
It's the most important

1072
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,180
- It's like that movie Devil.

1073
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,920
(laughing)

1074
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,840
- Yeah, but he just starts shitting.

1075
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,640
- Yeah, just a fountain of dookie.

1076
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,480
- Devil dick.

1077
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,300
- Yeah.

1078
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,140
- Dang.

1079
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,980
- Oh wow.

1080
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,760
- 'Cause it smells straight up like sulfur in there.

1081
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,600
- Wow.

1082
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,420
Next one here, same guy.

1083
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,200
Pizza slices are legally considered the Italian ninja star.

1084
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,820
I defy you to challenge me.

1085
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,980
Oh, I eat of the food.

1086
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,240
Oh, I become the 700 pounds that come on a guy's chest.

1087
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,520
(laughing)

1088
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,740
- That would be a pretty funny account on here.

1089
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:18,660
I have to add Italian Elon Musk. Yeah, that would be some that would be fucking dope. That would be fucking amazeball

1090
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,380
I think maybe after this we change all of our we change one of our accounts into that

1091
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,780
That's the next same guy

1092
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Me as a mafia boss

1093
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,660
Kind of in the same like straight like yeah, like that makes sense

1094
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,740
They're like mafia bosses starts punching the table very passionately. I want him dead. I want his family buried

1095
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:43,580
I want his house plants dead. I want his house burned to the ground. I want to spit on the ashes

1096
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:49,980
Can you read you said buried and it says dead? Yeah, you really can't read it. Oh, I can't read from here

1097
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,100
I don't have my I wasn't gonna say anything, but you've done that for every one of them. Yeah, what's going on with you today?

1098
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,860
You okay? No, you've been misreading everything literally stepped on my glasses while I was moving nerd Velma status

1099
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,000
Me if you ever pass away in front of me

1100
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,440
I promise I'll bury you in your native land of China other guy wait what me?

1101
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,020
Closes their eyes with two fingers these aren't even about feeding, bro

1102
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,940
Why did you even put these in here because I wanted to show you that isn't that the users of this website are actually?

1103
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,940
fucking comedy gods

1104
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,020
Okay, what's what would you say the joke is there? Oh? Well? Here's okay now?

1105
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:31,800
We're back in the good stuff girl scout cookies are here America. Don't be fat also don't miss our national big

1106
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Oh, a political joke.

1107
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Another joke.

1108
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
A political joke.

1109
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Yeah, they're pretty smart.

1110
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,800
And then this, I think this is the last slide here.

1111
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,800
"I don't usually post so frequently, i.e. twice within five to six hours, but this is a required post.

1112
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Finally, someone is pointing it out.

1113
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,800
Some 23% of Fortune 500 corporations claim to engage with the Sustainable Development Goals framework,

1114
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,800
yet a peer-reviewed study found that a measly 0.2% have developed concrete methods and tools

1115
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
to evaluate their progress toward relevant SDGs.

1116
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,280
Is that an S or a five?

1117
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,120
- That's an S.

1118
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,960
- Okay.

1119
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,120
Only 29% of almost 12,000 Fortune 500,

1120
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Fortune 100 board directors had relevant ESG credentials.

1121
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,720
According, look I'm not gonna read the whole thing,

1122
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,760
but somebody, somebody went on here

1123
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,160
to get on their damn soapbox.

1124
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,000
- You can't read.

1125
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,040
- No, I can't read without my glasses.

1126
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,240
- The TV's too far away.

1127
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,080
- The glass--

1128
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,360
- It's too far away.

1129
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,860
- I'm nearsighted, I can't fucking see that shit.

1130
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,480
- I can't believe I'm learning today

1131
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,580
that my friend can't read a lick of English.

1132
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,480
Oh, that's okay.

1133
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,320
Well, good job, Pap.

1134
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,400
We'll go over to my slides.

1135
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,920
It's very interesting that, well, I'll get to this.

1136
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,760
Okay, so--

1137
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,600
- Okay, so you went on Phoebe.

1138
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,280
- So listen, so I tried to sign up for Grommer, right?

1139
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,920
But for whatever reason, I didn't get the verification code.

1140
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,560
You have to do a text and an email verification.

1141
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,280
And my verification code wouldn't come through.

1142
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,800
It kept getting stuck in a spam filter or something.

1143
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,360
So I just tried their kind of sister site,

1144
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,720
which is called Phoebe,

1145
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,840
which I guess I found out that Grommer

1146
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,320
is mostly for gay feeding.

1147
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,160
- Oh!

1148
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,240
- And Phoebe is basically the straights version.

1149
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,080
- Okay.

1150
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,760
- It's a social networking community for feeders,

1151
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,920
feedies, fat admirers,

1152
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,240
where a quirky bunch of men and women

1153
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,320
who love words like curvy.

1154
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,260
It was designed with the needs

1155
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,520
of heterosexual feederism community in mind,

1156
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,900
though we remain open to all people of all orientations.

1157
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,660
So I went in there, I got in there,

1158
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,860
and I made an account.

1159
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,700
(laughing)

1160
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,340
Patrick Doran, NYC.

1161
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,220
(laughing)

1162
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,380
- We did the same fucking thing.

1163
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,580
- Well, but I said your name and location.

1164
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,500
- Yeah, yeah.

1165
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Well, I gave them, I was stupid,

1166
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,780
I gave them my location.

1167
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,700
- Yeah, yeah.

1168
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,300
- I gave them app tracking.

1169
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,500
- I did Patrick Doran, NYC, and I made some,

1170
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,900
(laughing)

1171
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,500
- I joined and said, "What are some good foods

1172
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,340
"to get started with?"

1173
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,780
Henry Co. already liked it.

1174
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,660
- You didn't even post a photo of me?

1175
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,620
- I thought that that would be a little much, you know?

1176
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,460
Yeah.

1177
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,820
And also, I didn't have any photos of you on my phone,

1178
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,020
as surprising as that sounds.

1179
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:07,860
- Wow.

1180
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,680
- Yeah, not a single one.

1181
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,520
- That's messed up.

1182
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,360
- 'Cause I'm a fake ass friend.

1183
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,180
- You are fake.

1184
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,020
I have so many photos of you eating.

1185
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,320
- So Phoebe was kind of a little bit different

1186
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,540
than the Grommer stuff, right?

1187
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,500
- The interface looks exactly the same.

1188
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,580
- Yeah, but some of the user base is different.

1189
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,420
- It looks like they might have taken

1190
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,580
the exact same site template.

1191
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,620
They must have Googled it.

1192
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,120
It's also--

1193
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,380
Feeder website template.

1194
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,620
No, it's also Grokyo.

1195
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,540
It's the same company.

1196
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,300
Oh, OK.

1197
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:28,800
Yeah.

1198
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,580
So you probably had it on that app as well.

1199
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,660
Yeah.

1200
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,260
This is Fat420Queen says, I'm a pig.

1201
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,620
And Fat Man Walking says, message me.

1202
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,700
Oh, it's also liked by the Fat Gentleman.

1203
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,020
And make me gay.

1204
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,140
Just pay attention to the people who like these posts.

1205
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,780
Some incredible names on there.

1206
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,820
Fat420Pig, this is all of her--

1207
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,380
basically all of her posts here.

1208
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,820
I wanna eat food.

1209
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,460
Who wanna rub my belly while I eat?

1210
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,300
Time to eat.

1211
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,100
And these were all like on the same day.

1212
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,000
Pretty amazing.

1213
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,820
Make her bigger is a really good name.

1214
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,220
- Chubby nerd.

1215
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,900
- Yeah, big fatty bear, Koda.

1216
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,260
What else?

1217
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,620
Fat future.

1218
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,740
Does anyone just wanna trap me in their house

1219
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,980
and turn me into their very own fat toy?

1220
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,820
I promise I'm very easy to capture.

1221
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,060
- Fat future.

1222
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,900
- And there was a couple of comments there.

1223
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,700
- Fat future food gang, eat 'em all.

1224
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,140
- There was a comment there, but it got cropped out.

1225
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,900
It looked like somebody, can't really read it.

1226
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,740
- Yeah, I can't read it either.

1227
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,180
- Yeah, but it says something about me.

1228
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,180
- Yeah, okay.

1229
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,260
- I don't know who commented that.

1230
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,380
- Yeah, who knows.

1231
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,740
- She likes her belly is one of the--

1232
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,020
- Foodie Fairy. - She likes her belly.

1233
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,220
- This is from Foodie Fairy.

1234
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,380
So, I woke up to two baked potatoes sitting on the oven.

1235
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,820
Everybody appears to be asleep.

1236
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,020
I want to eat 'em so bad, should I?

1237
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,380
People are saying, do it, yes, put all the toppings.

1238
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,460
But then Mormon Tempest says, yes,

1239
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,460
but I'm sure there's more context to consider.

1240
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,300
(laughing)

1241
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,020
- We have to look at both sides of this.

1242
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,260
- I'm pretty certain there's more to this story.

1243
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,740
All right, what else?

1244
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,020
- You have a gas leak in your house

1245
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,700
and you forget that you've been making yourself

1246
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,580
baked potatoes every night.

1247
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,220
- This is, I've been, then I started looking

1248
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,700
at some of the profiles, so I found this guy.

1249
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,740
This is Fatty Fatty, right?

1250
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,580
28 years old, six feet tall, 366 pounds.

1251
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,980
This is a big, big guy.

1252
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,940
- I didn't put any of these screenshots in my slides,

1253
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,140
but the best part of this is that

1254
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,300
if you go to someone's profile,

1255
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,540
that shows you exactly how tall they are

1256
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,380
and how much they weigh.

1257
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,380
And there's some incredible combinations.

1258
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,100
- You can only check two per day,

1259
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,100
so I didn't get a screenshot,

1260
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,900
but you can check people's weight history in a chart.

1261
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,520
- Well, I also didn't put this in,

1262
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,500
but on Grommer, if you scroll through people's feeds,

1263
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,360
it posts updates like a Facebook feed,

1264
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,980
where it says like, this guy gained five pounds today.

1265
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,460
And everyone comments, it's like, nice, getting close to 400.

1266
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,740
- Yeah, it does the same thing here.

1267
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,980
But I found this guy fatty fatty, and I really liked him,

1268
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,420
so I sent him a flirt on the actions

1269
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,520

1275
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,780
someone who enjoys long walks to the buffet which is kind of a good yo mama

1276
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:26,300
joke yeah that is good he he posts stuff like I'm really sad now I gave $50 to

1277
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,380

1278
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,340

1279
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
blob applications.

1280
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,340
(laughter)

1281
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,340
Blob applications.

1282
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,340
I have an idea, and if

1283
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,340
any feedie wants to do it, shoot me a message.

1284
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,340
You go to the drive-thru and I give you about $50-$75.

1285
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,340
You go up and order one large meal.

1286
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
After you finish it, you order another large meal, etc.

1287
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,340
until you can't fit another

1288
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,340
ounce inside your belly. Plus, everyone

1289
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,340
working there will definitely think you're a huge fatty.

1290
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,340
(laughter)

1291
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,340
And then this guy had an amazing name. Opiate of

1292
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,340
the Massive. Wow. Tell me

1293
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,080
That is not a fucking sick man.

1294
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,320
That is incredible.

1295
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,580
He's been on here for six years.

1296
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,860
Let's take a look at some of his posts.

1297
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,740
He's in Philly.

1298
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,140
Let's explore the dying malls

1299
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,680
and take notes on the empty temples

1300
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,820
of a dying consumerist god together.

1301
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,940
Oh, like by Topanga.

1302
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,620
This guy is sick, dude.

1303
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,460
That is sick.

1304
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,060
That's crazy. This guy's fucking ill.

1305
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,100
I really like his post.

1306
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,420
I'm sure he's also pretty ill

1307
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,740
if you don't know this much. Yeah, definitely.

1308
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,420
Another 2023 resolution.

1309
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,460
He has some feelings about the community.

1310
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,700
Okay. Being more forthcoming

1311
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,900
about liking someone and wanting to make out with them

1312
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,900
and make them unrecognizably fat, among other things, edited."

1313
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,900
(laughing)

1314
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,020
And then he also says, "I don't care if you're trying

1315
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,800
to hit on a guy, a gal, or a non-binary pal.

1316
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,560
Don't let your very first fucking message

1317
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,400
to a complete stranger be a compliment about their anatomy

1318
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,220
and your desire to touch it."

1319
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,020
And Bay says, "Or about a belly button survey."

1320
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,260
(laughing)

1321
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,780
- That's what most of my first messages to people are like.

1322
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,620
- Yeah, what do you like to--

1323
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,460
- I have a survey about your belly button.

1324
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,660
- Be in a belly button survey?

1325
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,460
- I'm from the--

1326
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,300
- I'm from the US Census.

1327
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,180
- You have a belly button survey?

1328
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,540
- That was the word I was looking for.

1329
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,380
- Okay, the master says--

1330
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,060
- Sense the sticker has a pen, it's just like--

1331
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,500
- It sticks it in the belly button.

1332
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,980
- Ah, sniffs it.

1333
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,340
- He says, "Reserving an entire section of the buffet

1334
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,700
"so it's just you and me, so no one is any the wiser

1335
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,720
"about me stuffing you until you can't move

1336
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,300
"and rubbing your belly to make more room

1337
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,540
"until it's time to leave and I have to wheel you out."

1338
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,180
And Patrick Doerr at NYC says, "Would love that."

1339
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,780
- Wow. - It's kind of interesting.

1340
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,140
- Those words there kind of, it kind of sounds like,

1341
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,300
it sounds like lyrics.

1342
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,060
- You could maybe turn this into a song.

1343
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,300
- Yeah, you could.

1344
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,760
And then I found this guy, NYC Locale, right?

1345
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,340
So he seems pretty cool.

1346
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,140
He's in Irvington, New York.

1347
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,780
He's 22 years old, five feet tall.

1348
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,380
And if you notice, he doesn't seem very fat.

1349
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,900
So what could he be doing on this here feeder forum?

1350
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,180
- Maybe he's trying to gain.

1351
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,540
- Well, I think that-- - Or he could be

1352
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,380
trying to gain muscle.

1353
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,460
- I think you might be surprised.

1354
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,340
Here's his first post.

1355
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,180
He's joined Phoebe.

1356
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,460
Been a minute since I've been on Phoebe.

1357
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,540
Hit me up, New York locals.

1358
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,340
Gassy women are way too underappreciated.

1359
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,380
So let's look at some of his other posts.

1360
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,300
Any gassy women wanna talk?

1361
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,700
Do any women like to fart but don't have the fetish?

1362
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:09,700
That one was edited.

1363
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,300
Does anyone know how I can make a feety bloated and gassy?

1364
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,500
I know the basics but not sure what else works.

1365
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Big Beautiful Belly 18 says lots of soda

1366
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,500
and he says thanks.

1367
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,900
- For me it's lots of garlic.

1368
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:24,380
- Do any women like air inflation?

1369
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,340
I do but I don't do it IRL, LOL.

1370
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,340
And then so.

1371
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,900
(laughing)

1372
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,660
I finally got into Grommer.

1373
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,920
(laughing)

1374
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,620
And made a new account.

1375
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,740
This is Cameron Pear.

1376
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,020
(laughing)

1377
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,980
24 years old, New York.

1378
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,500
Identify as gainer, gender other,

1379
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,460
interested in men, looking for asexual relationships,

1380
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,700
languages, English and Vietnamese.

1381
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,740
In the process of rapidly gaining weight.

1382
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,020
We've been talking about this.

1383
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:01,260
You're rapidly putting on humongous pounds.

1384
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,380
And I made some friends pretty fast

1385
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,540
just by posting that photo.

1386
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
I got a message from NYC Encourager.

1387
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,260
Great photo, hair, and shirt, Cameron.

1388
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,700
Let's meet up, cheers.

1389
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,020
- This guy's gonna be so mad.

1390
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,860
I cut my hair, he's gonna fucking kill me.

1391
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:13,700
- Oh yeah, dude.

1392
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,540
- If he finds out I don't have that hair anymore.

1393
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,380
- He's gonna see you and he's gonna take you down.

1394
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,900
- What if he's a hair gainer too?

1395
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,280
And I'm not even wearing that shirt.

1396
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,120
- What if he's a hair gainer?

1397
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,140
- You're endangering my life.

1398
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,980
- And then I guess I--

1399
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,260
- No, no, no, you're gonna be fine.

1400
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,100
- I missed--

1401
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,220
- The bullets will ricochet off of you.

1402
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,180
I must have lost the screenshot this morning

1403
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,000
'cause I couldn't find it,

1404
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,980
but I did find one where the guy was like,

1405
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,860
I just had, it was this other account that I found

1406
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:34,780
and he had this one post that was like,

1407
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,260
just had the most amazing experience of my life.

1408
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,100
I made myself completely jizz to completion

1409
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,460
just by jiggling my belly fat in the shower.

1410
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,700
(laughing)

1411
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,980
And every comment was like, congratulations,

1412
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,580
congratulations, congrats.

1413
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,740
- That's the best part is everyone knows what's up on here.

1414
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,580
- Yeah.

1415
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,340
- Everyone, well like not that everyone knows what's up,

1416
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,740
but like everybody who posts something,

1417
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,140
the only comments are always like,

1418
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,700
"Great, it's no one even asking any clarifying."

1419
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,540
Everyone knows everything about it.

1420
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,420
- That's why I was pretty surprised that one person

1421
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,020
even wanted context for the potatoes thing,

1422
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,420
'cause they weren't just blindly like,

1423
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,780
"Yeah, eat every piece of food around you

1424
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,740
"like you're in an RPG."

1425
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,780
They were like, "Yeah, there might be some context

1426
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,620
"needed for the potatoes."

1427
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1428
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,360
Alright, so now I have my slides that Jubio really rudely put a title slide on for no reason.

1429
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,240
This is massively aggressive.

1430
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,240
I don't know why he did that.

1431
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
He keeps doing that.

1432
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,920
He keeps adding this fucking title thing and it's pissing me off.

1433
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
It's disrespectful.

1434
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,920
It looks horrible.

1435
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,920
Look at the theme of it.

1436
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
It's fucking terrible.

1437
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
What are you going to put on here?

1438
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Swastika, you fucker?

1439
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Oh, that's great.

1440
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,920
Yeah, thanks a lot.

1441
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Your slides look great.

1442
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Alright, now stop clicking.

1443
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,060
Alright, now here are mine.

1444
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:46,600
So first of all, this is from Fatsdagram.

1445
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,200
This is the first post I found.

1446
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,200
sat next to a beer belly guy at a Berlin nail screening

1447
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,920
couldn't focus on the movie the whole time lol

1448
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,880
Berlin nail, I don't know if you guys know, that's like the Berlin film festival

1449
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,640
that's like how they play, it's like a prestigious film festival

1450
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,360
yeah so he was he was sitting and he was watching, he was

1451
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,640
seeing like uh... uh... fuckin

1452
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,140
whatever movie

1453
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,600
what's the movie that Jubio likes?

1454
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,200
that's about, sure, Tar

1455
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,160
and he just, he's just

1456
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,800
the entire time looking at the guy who's next to him

1457
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,960
with a belly

1458
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,640
uh...

1459
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,000
Coleman 2021. Anyone who wants to poop on me? And what you'll notice here also, on Grommer,

1460
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,600
they're not likes. They're called noms.

1461
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,040
I didn't even notice that, dude.

1462
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,280
And it says these people nom things.

1463
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,080
Oh my God.

1464
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,480
It says like fat belly guy one, two, three noms this.

1465
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,480
That must be short for nominate.

1466
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah.

1467
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,080
For an award.

1468
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,400
For an award.

1469
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,960
Every click is a nomination for an award.

1470
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,840
Let's see what else you have here.

1471
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:46,040
Okay. So this is where your theory kind of comes in.

1472
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,520
is this guy says garbage can 18 says wish I could turn into a blue yeah garbage

1473
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,060
can 18 was making me laugh so hard garbage can which you gotta hope he's

1474
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,660
not five years old that'd be bad news but I found yeah I found a bunch of

1475
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,780
blue blueberry is one of the is ever I've so this the other thing on this

1476
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:12,140
website you can only do one search per day yeah so I've been on here for days

1477
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:16,020
on it well unless you get the premium which I did not get the only nine bucks

1478
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,320
I really thought about it. Yeah, I also thought about it, but I was like I can just log on to this every day for five days and that's okay.

1479
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:27,720
Yeah, and the first search I did well before I realized there was a limit the one of the top hashtags are like trending searches every day is

1480
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,820
blueberry

1481
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,300
If they people just search blueberry they can log on here and they search blueberry and they look at all the posts

1482
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:40,880
Squishy bum boy says I'm in such a blueberry mood. Someone turned me into a blueberry right now. Oh my god

1483
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,300
Wonka93 says, "The most unrealistic thing about Willy Wonka is that he isn't fat.

1484
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:51,580
If I were in that factory, I'd be so round. Hell, I'd probably greet my guests just permanently as a blueberry."

1485
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
He'd just roll out as a blueberry, bro?

1486
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,700
Wonka93.

1487
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,460
Yeah, these are friends of Wonka.

1488
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:01,180
Fatten me to death, PA. I'm feeling like a blueberry right now.

1489
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,260
Fatten me to death.

1490
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,260
It'll be, he's on here a bunch. You'll see a bunch of him.

1491
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,260
Fatten me to death, PA.

1492
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,220
Fatten me to death.

1493
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:08,940
Wow.

1494
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,500
The devil.

1495
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,500
I

1496
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:20,300
Need a mr. Walk a top hat to wear well no piece of blueberry bread gulps me down

1497
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,060
Wow

1498
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,940
Holy fuck

1499
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:34,940
I need to look like Willy Wonka. I gotta say you don't see any shit like this over on Phoebe man

1500
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,940
No, no, this is way better than Phoebe

1501
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,740
(laughing)

1502
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,260
- Big bellied boy, tired, this guy doesn't really care

1503
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,460
that much, tired and exhausted, just wanna be a balloon

1504
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,540
or blueberry or whatever.

1505
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,380
- Doesn't give a fuck.

1506
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,460
- He's just a balloon or a blueberry.

1507
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,500
- You know what, I wanna be a blueberry,

1508
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,020
but if I, look, if you can make me a gobstopper,

1509
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,860
that's cool.

1510
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,980
- I'll take whatever, I'm not too pressed about it.

1511
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,100
- Schnozberry, call me a schnozberry.

1512
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,340
- Pokemon gainer.

1513
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,940
(laughing)

1514
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,740
Here's something that I learned.

1515
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:06,300
- What?

1516
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,400
The amount of fat people in Houston is amazing.

1517
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,800
So many big round-bellied civilians, too.

1518
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,040
So these feeders called non-feeders civilians.

1519
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,880
- Whoa, wow. - That is so sick.

1520
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,260
- I saw a bunch of that.

1521
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,100
- Really? - Yeah.

1522
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,440
- They call 'em civvies.

1523
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,100
- Civilians, yeah. - Wow, dude.

1524
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,940
- Very, very exciting to learn that.

1525
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,900
- Do you think they have, like, you know,

1526
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,800
when military guys have gear that they make,

1527
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,360
like shirts and stuff, that say, like,

1528
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,200
proud infidel or whatever?

1529
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,600
- Do you know what else they have

1530
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,440
that I wasn't able to find? - You think they have

1531
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,840
like a black rival copy?

1532
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,680
- I didn't have enough days to search this.

1533
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,640
- An archival copy. (laughs)

1534
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,640
- They also have a cruise that they all go on a cruise ship.

1535
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,280
- Dude, that is a dangerous, dangerous cruise ship.

1536
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,040
- And people will post and be like,

1537
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:46,880
"Is the cruise any good?

1538
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,720
"Should I go?"

1539
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,440
People will be like, "Yeah, you gotta go."

1540
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,480
- Wow.

1541
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,080
- Do they fuck?

1542
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:52,920
- Well, that's the problem.

1543
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,000
- Oh yeah, they have to really carefully distribute

1544
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,480
their bedrooms on the cruise ship.

1545
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,320
- So they just--

1546
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,600
- It's another Titanic situation.

1547
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,960
- Full wall-e this whole thing, yeah.

1548
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,800
That's amazing.

1549
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,120
- Here's another Pokemon Gator.

1550
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,080
Tonight's Last of Us wrecked me.

1551
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,920
- Wow.

1552
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:08,300
- Yeah, so they're keeping up with--

1553
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,880
- With all the big prestige TV shows.

1554
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,320
- Heavy fart load.

1555
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,540
So, sorry about this one in advance.

1556
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,080
Wish I had a lazy farting homebody gainer buddy

1557
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,360
to spend the day baking, baking, and baking with,

1558
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,120
smoking up and then baking our turds and butts for days

1559
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,720
to see who can grow the biggest toilet clogger

1560
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,120
and lay the stinkiest pre-poop farts.

1561
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,120
We would also be making heavy, fattening,

1562
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,720
constipating baked goods,

1563
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,720
never leaving the house as we fart and fap

1564
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,020
our lives away at all.

1565
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,860
- Oh my god.

1566
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,180
- So eating a bunch.

1567
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:39,920
- Baking our turds in our butts.

1568
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,700
- Eating a bunch so that you like,

1569
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,220
so like it's the oven.

1570
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,260
- But can I direct your attention

1571
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,820
to the most incredible part of this post?

1572
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,660
- Yeah.

1573
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,620
- Baking, baking, and baking.

1574
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,460
- Yeah.

1575
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,940
- We're talking about making baked goods

1576
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,580
to bake farts in their bellies

1577
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,300
and then smoking weed and baking.

1578
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,140
- God damn.

1579
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:58,540
- Instead of wake and bake, it's bake, bake, and bake.

1580
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:01,340
- That's like those sentences that you see on Wikipedia

1581
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,180
that's like, oh yeah, it's all one word,

1582
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:06,100
- The Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, yeah.

1583
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,460
Baking, baking, and baking.

1584
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,300
So yeah.

1585
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,660
- Wow.

1586
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,760
- Pretty crazy, right?

1587
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,780
Let's keep going though.

1588
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,540
Heavy fart load again, I'm sorry.

1589
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,380
I'm sorry.

1590
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,580
Is there a world poop size?

1591
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,320
(laughing)

1592
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,140
I've been baking a massive grogan in my poop chute

1593
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,060
for over a week and I can barely leave bed,

1594
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,260
farting constantly as the turd festers

1595
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,580
and generates fart gas.

1596
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,320
Feels amazing as the farts leak out

1597
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,420
around the enormous rock hard blockage.

1598
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,340
Anyone else have a log size fetish?

1599
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,740
- Art Grogan's the fucking,

1600
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,140
the aliens from Mass Effect, the big leg?

1601
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,460
- I don't know, I never played Mass Effect.

1602
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,900
- Wait, this guy hasn't taken a shit in a week?

1603
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,020
- Yeah, he's baking a Grogan.

1604
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,820
- Holy fuck, man.

1605
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,220
- I swear to God.

1606
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,500
- Let's see, I think, yeah.

1607
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,180
And then there's a comment on there from This Big Stomach.

1608
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,340
Did you know there was a man that had a genetic condition

1609
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,140
which made it so that he couldn't poop at all

1610
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,340
and he ballooned so much, I think he was known as a human balloon.

1611
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,740
No, it's Krogan.

1612
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,420
Krogan.

1613
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:07,980
Yeah.

1614
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,260
I don't know what a Krogan is.

1615
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:13,500
Well, Krogan's are like--

1616
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,020
Careful now.

1617
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:15,220
What they look like--

1618
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,300
Are you going to start just talking about that?

1619
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,340
If you grew a turd that looks like this--

1620
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,020
Oh, wait.

1621
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,940
Oh, they're the frog guys.

1622
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:22,580
Yeah, OK.

1623
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,820
That would be pretty crazy.

1624
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,980
Yeah, that would be amazing.

1625
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,140
They kind of look like that when they first come out.

1626
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:27,640
Yeah.

1627
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:31,060
[LAUGHTER]

1628
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,220
Big belly 13 just says poop.

1629
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,980
That is an amazing, amazing post.

1630
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,820
[LAUGHTER]

1631
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:37,820
Picture.

1632
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,320
Poop.

1633
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,500
Poop.

1634
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,460
He's got one of those bellies, the fronts,

1635
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,820
that looks like a guy's face.

1636
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,860
Yeah, he's got a talker.

1637
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,620
Yeah.

1638
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,900
Yeah, he's got a big time talker.

1639
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,940
Yeah, I could have a conversation with that

1640
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,340
if I was tired enough.

1641
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,380
And you know he's making us like, poop.

1642
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:53,980
Poop.

1643
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,100
Yeah, he looks like he's halfway through the O's.

1644
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,980
He's doing the Ace Ventura butt talking with his belly.

1645
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,740
Yeah.

1646
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:03,020
Fatten me to death PA is back here.

1647
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,540
Anyone out here good with computers?

1648
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,800
Having a few issues.

1649
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,640
I need a manual.

1650
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,360
Tie me to the bed, put a feeding tube in me,

1651
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,860
turn it on and never turn it off.

1652
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,780
- He's so needy, this guy.

1653
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,740
He needs people to fix his computer,

1654
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:14,580
turn him into a--

1655
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,980
- Oh, fatten me all the way to death.

1656
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,500
- Fatten me, fatten me to death,

1657
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,620
but first, can you fix my computer?

1658
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,300
I don't know how to connect my printer.

1659
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,380
- Chubby Beer Belly says,

1660
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,740
"Mews was phenomenal last night."

1661
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,580
- People can't see, he has a slice of pizza

1662
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,700
hidden under his tit.

1663
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,580
- Oh my God.

1664
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,820
- That is unreal.

1665
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:33,260
- Yeah, that's a photo of him at the Muse concert.

1666
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,220
Fat me to death, either I'm pregnant,

1667
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,340
have a parasite in me, or I'm eating too much.

1668
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,500
Can't figure it out yet.

1669
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,540
- I'm guessing parasite.

1670
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,940
- Not sure which it could be.

1671
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,420
Keep the food coming says,

1672
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,780
does anyone else have a physical ick that you dislike?

1673
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:49,900
For me, it's mullets.

1674
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,580
I don't get them and I very rarely

1675
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,020
see people look good with them.

1676
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,020
Here's some people's icks on Grommer.

1677
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,820
Nose rings.

1678
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,660
Beards.

1679
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:59,620
- Okay.

1680
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,140
- Wearing unnatural colored contacts unironically.

1681
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:02,980
- Wow.

1682
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,260
- Okay, that one, actually I do agree with that.

1683
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,280
- Yeah, that one I do agree with that too.

1684
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,380
- And the mullets actually too.

1685
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,460
- Yeah, actually all these are pretty--

1686
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,020
- Yeah, actually they're all pretty disgusting.

1687
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,980
Lil One says, "The inner battle of wanting to be the biggest

1688
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,660
or making him the biggest."

1689
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
So this is kind of shows that it's like a power,

1690
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,940
it can be a power struggle.

1691
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,580
- This is a flex, sort of flex,

1692
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,620
but could be a feety, could be a feeder, right?

1693
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,740
He does both.

1694
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,580
Wow.

1695
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,420
- But it's also like, you know,

1696
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,620
It's like something where you imagine like, oh my God,

1697
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,420
what if my spouse got famous and they left me behind?

1698
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,380
It's like, what if my boyfriend, he grew to 700 pounds

1699
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,860
and I'm stuck back at 400?

1700
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:37,700
True.

1701
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,520
It's hard.

1702
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,620
That's, you know, hard for us 'cause we're all dating.

1703
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,420
Maybe we're trying to be all celebrities.

1704
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,260
Exactly.

1705
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,300
So I'm just saying the celebrity lifestyle is pretty similar

1706
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,220
to the feeder lifestyle.

1707
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,260
I just wanted to point that out.

1708
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,740
That we're not all that different.

1709
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,500
As soon as I get my celebrity feeder stuff,

1710
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,380
she is not coming with me.

1711
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,780
Oh no, I'm dropping her.

1712
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,780
Uh-huh, no, they're going to pick me up in a forklift to take me out of that house.

1713
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:06,780
Thomas the Twunk Engine, "DMing my first D&D campaign today, hoping for the best."

1714
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,180
That Patches? Good for them.

1715
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:10,980
It kind of does look like Patches' body, a little bit.

1716
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,580
Oh, we'll never know.

1717
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:17,180
"Why am I still meal prepping when some scientist could be turning me into a growing test subject?"

1718
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,980
Okay, definitely Patches. He's talking about nerd stuff now.

1719
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:24,980
That's just such a funny, what does that have to do with meal prepping?

1720
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:30,980
Here's someone's bio, and this is what I'm talking about people who are breakers, they like to break stuff.

1721
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,980
These are a few of my favorite experiences.

1722
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,980
Being told I'm too fat to top because "my back can't handle the weight of your belly."

1723
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:39,980
Hearing a reinforced stool creak under your weight.

1724
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,980
Unable to access the attic due to low capacity LADAR.

1725
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,980
Being unable to reach up because your shirt will become untucked.

1726
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:49,980
"Hearing the sigh from a fellow plane passenger as they sit down next to you."

1727
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,980
"Being unable to recline a movie theater chair because your thigh won't let off the up button."

1728
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,980
"Pretending to be too cool for school because spirit clothes don't come in your size."

1729
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:00,980
"Being called plump by a partner as they lose interest from your gains."

1730
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,980
"Wondering if the barber's chair will hold your weight."

1731
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,980
"Choosing a booth because that chair looks flimsy."

1732
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,980
"Choosing a table because that booth looks too narrow."

1733
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,980
"Choosing to eat at all times whenever you can and all you can."

1734
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,980
It did seem a little... when I was reading all this shit, it does seem like a little bit of an appealing lifestyle.

1735
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,980
lifestyle. Oh, absolutely. You literally are just what you want. You're like a sim.

1736
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:22,480
Like you're so aware of your meter just like ice cream every day.

1737
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,880
Descending like it's amazing. You're Godzilla. You get to make you like,

1738
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,980
like all those like foods that they make on like the subway ads that are like

1739
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,480
stupid as shit where it's like, oh, we're going to put like,

1740
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,380
we're gonna make an egg tornado with like whipped cream on it.

1741
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,980
That is your breakfast, lunch and dinner. Sounds fucking dope.

1742
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,420
- It does sound incredible.

1743
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,260
Never enough, what's the craziest thing you've done to gain?

1744
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,040
Enrolled in a two year degree program,

1745
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,460
knowing when I finish I'll get a raise

1746
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,780
that will 100% go towards food.

1747
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,620
- Wow.

1748
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:58,200
- Shotha says, I think that they should make bathroom scales

1749
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,020
which speak your weight at 80 plus decibels for gainers,

1750
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,660
which is a cool invention idea.

1751
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,140
And 80 decibels, it can damage your hearing

1752
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,540
if you're exposed to it for too long.

1753
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:09,260
It's about the level of a busy downtown street.

1754
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,960
So it's because you can't see the thing.

1755
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,460
Yeah.

1756
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:11,960
Yeah.

1757
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,220
So you would have it just yell so loudly.

1758
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,840
I looked at 80 plus decibels literally

1759
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,220
is the threshold for ear damage.

1760
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,640
That's exactly where it is.

1761
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,700
Imagine you live next door to a gainer

1762
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,440
in a house with paper thin walls,

1763
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,820
and they have that fucking scale.

1764
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,520
And you're just eating breakfast one day,

1765
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,020
and you hear just like, 455 pounds.

1766
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,500
[LAUGHTER]

1767
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,820
And then 10 minutes later, you hear, 455 pounds.

1768
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,060
(laughter)

1769
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:43,660
- Yeah, they just hear a guy just come.

1770
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:49,140
- You weigh 480 pounds.

1771
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:51,400
(laughter)

1772
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,100
- This next thing, I discovered a thing

1773
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:00,300
that I did not even consider could be part of this website.

1774
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,940
And this is the craziest thing to me.

1775
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,300
- Here's a one pound coach.

1776
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,420
We all have those sometimes.

1777
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,420
You gotta be a gainer to have one of those.

1778
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,420
Probably the bigger you are, the more, the bigger your nut is.

1779
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,420
Yeah, that's right. 100%.

1780
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,420
No, it's because when he's shitting, when he's jizzing.

1781
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,420
Oh, he's shitting as he's jizzing.

1782
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:22,420
That's gross. That's not fair.

1783
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,420
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1784
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:26,420
He's standing on the bathroom floor.

1785
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,420
That was funny to me.

1786
01:08:28,420 --> 01:08:30,420
Let me read you guys this new corner of the website.

1787
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,420
This is from Jbellylover.

1788
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,920
Preds, which is short for predators, want to vor me?

1789
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,260
Turn me into a pole of meaty sludge digesting in your gut and then turn me into shit in

1790
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,260
your toilet.

1791
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,260
Might even have a few trophies you can take.

1792
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,260
#vor

1793
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:47,660
And I know you guys are wondering what that guy's profile picture is.

1794
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,660
Yes.

1795
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:56,400
It's a centaur that's standing on his hind legs and he's really fat, but only the horse

1796
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,900
belly is fat and the human body is really buff.

1797
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
Wow.

1798
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,900
How does that make any sense?

1799
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:03,660
- Yeah, that is really good.

1800
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:07,660
- If they both be fat, would it be a fat horse?

1801
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,580
Why is the body so buff?

1802
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,500
- Really funny.

1803
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,060
(laughing)

1804
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,340
Yeah, I really liked this picture a lot.

1805
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,180
That is really good.

1806
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:17,300
- If it was no fucking sense.

1807
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,500
- Yeah, I don't know, standing up like that.

1808
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,340
- If they say, why would the horse belly get fat?

1809
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:26,260
And not the, why wouldn't the whole guy be fat?

1810
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,140
- Twink99 says, "Pray, come on out,

1811
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,100
or come out, come out, wherever you are."

1812
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,100
and then tasty snack boy says sounds like a trap. Oh my God.

1813
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,100
Leprechaun like this.

1814
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,900
Damn. No, he nommed this. I am your prey. Noms this.

1815
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,900
Okay.

1816
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,900
Yeah, but it sounds like a trap. I'll stay hidden was really

1817
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,900
making me laugh.

1818
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:51,800
Swallow me whole says are there any Preds out there that feel

1819
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,500
like slowly and brutally mulching up a prey and their hairy

1820
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,800
guts were no one but you can hear my whimpers or see my

1821
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,100
struggles colon Pete.

1822
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,340
Dude, it's crazy.

1823
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:01,460
I'm just sticking your tongue out.

1824
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,300
I'm goofy.

1825
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,460
I wanna be eaten alive.

1826
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,100
(laughing)

1827
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,580
Satisfied Belch says,

1828
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,540
"The urge to sneak up behind an unsuspecting prey boy

1829
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,460
and swallow him down in front of his friends

1830
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:13,740
and family is growing."

1831
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:14,580
Oh my God.

1832
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,580
Satisfied Belch.

1833
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,660
Satisfied Belch.

1834
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,620
I don't wanna nom that.

1835
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,460
I would not nom that.

1836
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:19,780
No, I would not nom that.

1837
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,940
A prey boy.

1838
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,280
You like prey boys.

1839
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,120
Me?

1840
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,940
Yeah.

1841
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,540
I think I probably am a prey boy.

1842
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,380
Yeah, you kinda are a prey boy.

1843
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,200
This is like the crate.

1844
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,040
I didn't know this was my--

1845
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,720
- I'm like one of those perfectly smooth Japanese cakes

1846
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,960
that people like so much.

1847
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,160
I'm like that to it.

1848
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,400
Yeah, I'm like that, right?

1849
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,940
I just have nothing on me.

1850
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:42,280
- Zach Autumn Runner said, "It's too hot.

1851
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,800
"Can I put you in the freezer for a bit

1852
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,880
"and then lick you like an ice lolly?"

1853
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,600
- This is like, I can get behind the guys

1854
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,880
who are just like feeders, the guys who are just like,

1855
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,360
oh, I wanna be the biggest, fucking fattest candy in the world.

1856
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,920
- You think it's wrong to freeze someone

1857
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,320
and lick them like a nice lolly.

1858
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,760
You think that's wrong?

1859
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,180
This is their lifestyle.

1860
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,520
This is their sexuality.

1861
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,000
Who are you to judge?

1862
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,840
- You know what?

1863
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,680
You made a good point.

1864
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,500
- You're like J.K. Rowling.

1865
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,440
- You know what, yeah, you know what?

1866
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,880
I'm being a firf.

1867
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,720
- Yeah, you are.

1868
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,400
- I'm being a fucking firf.

1869
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,880
- And now we're gonna end here with some nice motivation

1870
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,720
from Shota.

1871
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,160
I just have a few messages from him

1872
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,000
that kind of, this can send us off

1873
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,040
into the rest of the week and we'll feel good

1874
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,880
and we'll be happy and we'll have some mantras

1875
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,720
we can repeat to ourselves.

1876
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,540
- This is what I need right now.

1877
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,820
And this is from Shota.

1878
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,940
First one, "Dreams can come true.

1879
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,060
It depends on how much you want them to come true."

1880
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,260
- Aw. - Oh, that's nice.

1881
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,100
- Yeah. - That is sweet.

1882
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,460
- Second one, "Thank you for the encouraging comment

1883
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,300
on my photo.

1884
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,740
I'll always have room in my belly for you."

1885
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,660
- Aw, Shota.

1886
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,300
- I'm gonna start using that for you guys.

1887
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,140
I always have room in my belly for you too.

1888
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,260
- And now the last one, "Let's bring this energy

1889
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,520
into the rest of the week, guys.

1890
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,180
Come to New Zealand, I love you."

1891
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,420
(laughing)

1892
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:51,860
And that's all I got. - Wow, yeah.

1893
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:54,340
- Dude, that was an amazing, Shota, we--

1894
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,840
This is definitely--

1895
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,700
I'd like to talk to Shotha again sometime soon.

1896
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,260
In turn--

1897
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,300
He's a good guy.

1898
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:02,380
And we've studied the diaper people.

1899
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,340
Yes.

1900
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,300
What else have we looked up?

1901
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,620
Just other weird things.

1902
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,100
Other weird--

1903
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:07,900
Mostly weird stuff.

1904
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:10,740
I think this community seems like--

1905
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:11,460
They seem nice.

1906
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:15,020
They seem very nice, and they seem very loving to each other.

1907
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,060
And they just want--

1908
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,300
I'll say I don't like the guys who

1909
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,300
want to eat meaty sludges of other guys.

1910
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,420
Yeah, I don't think that those guys--

1911
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,140
I mean, guys like Shotha--

1912
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,340
- He's nice though, he doesn't--

1913
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,660
- He doesn't respect them.

1914
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:28,140
- Yeah, these guys are great.

1915
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,580
I don't like the people who call themselves predators

1916
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,420
and they want to--

1917
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,260
- Definitely bad luck.

1918
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,940
- They wanna sneak up behind somebody

1919
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:35,780
and eat them like a cobra. - That's probably why

1920
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,620
they say prance.

1921
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:37,440
- Yeah.

1922
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,340
- They don't say, my sexual thing is I'm a predator.

1923
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:41,180
(laughing)

1924
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:42,700
They know I'm a prane.

1925
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:43,580
No, you don't understand.

1926
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,100
I'm not like a sexual assaulter or anything.

1927
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:46,420
I just like to eat guys.

1928
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,260
(laughing)

1929
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,080
- No, I just like to--

1930
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:48,920
- I like to eat them and digest them.

1931
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,760
- I like to eat them and digest them.

1932
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,940
- In front of their friends and family.

1933
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,780
- No, it's gonna be--

1934
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,780
I'm not a predator.

1935
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,340
I'm gonna unhinge my jaw like a cobra.

1936
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:02,300
I don't ghost women, I just eat guys.

1937
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:06,960
