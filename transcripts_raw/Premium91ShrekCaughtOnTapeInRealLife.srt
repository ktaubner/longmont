So Waffle House.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Waffle House.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:23,800
I went to Waffle House before this, so, you know, I had coffee, but I also had hash browns and toasted eggs and bacon and waffle, so...

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Yeah, I would say Waffle...

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,100
It's kind of like more than counteracts the coffee.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,460
Yeah, waffle does have whatever the opposite of caffeine is.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,340
Yeah, waffine.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,500
You know, it has waffine in it.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,300
I think it's identical.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,420
There's like warine, taurine, and waffine.

14
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,380
Waffine, yeah.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,700
Waffine's the one that makes you laugh like the Joker.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,740
Oh, I hate waffine.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:43,980
Yeah.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,620
I hate when I accidentally drink something.

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,700
I ate too much.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,500
I ate too much.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,820
And I go, "Does this have any, does this happen to have waffine in it?"

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,740
Well, that's why it's in, you know, it's in cream pies,

23
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,860
Which is why when you get hit in the face with one, oh, that's why them damn clowns are so damn funny

24
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,340
seltzer water

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah, and a certain kind of flower that is a little tiny hole in the in the middle of it

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,520
That's great you're lucky to have you ever been to Waffle House before today? Yes, my second time at Waffle House. Oh

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,460
God, dude. Yeah, and it's one of those things where people from the south will be like there's nothing like it and I'm like well

28
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,580
Well, it's just a diner chain. I think there's a lot of stuff like it, but I'm willing to

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,620
drink the Kool-Aid. I think it's pretty awesome.

30
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,620
The thing is about Waffle House is it's like getting, you know, in a driving game like

31
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:46,260
Need for Speed, when you hit a floating nitrous bottle, it's that but just for drunk driving

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,420
home from Waffle House.

33
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Absolutely.

34
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,220
As soon as you eat the Waffle House, it powers you up. You drive as if you're somehow more

35
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,020
than sober no matter how much you drink. It's really, it's an incredible magic.

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,980
Yeah. It's also, it is insanely cheap.

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,060
Oh yeah, dude. The Grand Slam?

38
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,700
No, All Star Breakfast.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:16,220
Yeah, All Star. Yeah. I feel like all the fast food is expensive now, right? Am I right?

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,540
All this damn fast food is so damn expensive now.

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,580
That's so true.

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,060
Dude, speaking of Denny's, when I was in Bakersfield, California, I went to a Denny's with a full

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,500
bar in the back.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,860
And not like the kitchen had a bar, but you walk down a long hallway to a completely empty

45
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,460
bar where the bartender told me that it was empty.

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,300
It was empty, yeah.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,220
The bartender told me there hadn't been anyone in the bar in three weeks and he had just been

48
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,220
like a year a year amount.

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
In 25 years.

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,340
And he walked into the bar from the side.

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,220
And then he aged really fast in front of me and his jaw fell off.

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,900
And he went "he he he" and spiraled away out the window.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,500
And then I stayed and I kept drinking and eating.

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,580
But it was like the most insane shit.

55
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,700
Bakersfield is like a magical place.

56
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,660
They have the corn sign and I looked it up, it's one of the only three Denny's bars in

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
the country.

58
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,660
Wow, what are the other ones?

59
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
I don't know.

60
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Let me guess.

61
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Arkansas?

62
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
And Hawaii?

63
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
Hawaii, they definitely would have one.

64
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
Those people in Hawaii?

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,660
Those, I mean,

66
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,660
those day drinking pieces of shit in Hawaii?

67
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
They're surfing all day instead of working.

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Yeah, just sipping Kahlúa

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
in Malibu out of the bottle,

70
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
not mixing it with anything.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Yeah, I think that's a good one.

72
00:03:44,660 --> 00:04:08,060
a

73
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,900
to be in one of those but at least go to Alaska and get some like oil stuff done or something.

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,060
Yeah that's why Obama was such a bad president. You're slacking on the clock right now pal.

75
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,620
Because Obama sat down in the Oval Office and he was like uh uh surf's up and they're like no sir

76
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,660
you have to sign bills and and write laws and give speeches. He's like I don't understand I've been

77
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,940
I've only ever vacationed I am from Hawaii. Yes thank you very much. Yeah. Just an embarrassing

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:48,380
place to be from. Yeah, horrible. I would say ugly, ugly landscape. Would you say that Hawaii

79
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,040
and Boston are the most opposite states in America? I will, you know, I wouldn't probably

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,220
write state. So Boston is a state. Yeah. Most opposite places. I mean, I would say that

81
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,860
Massachusetts has more beautiful beaches than Hawaii. And if you ever been to that's undeniable

82
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:23,580
to

83
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:29,620
Just rocks didn't have McDonald's wrappers and people who look like you

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,860
That's like me what a beat should be

85
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,220
I know I'd rather be be looking at like pedophiles mansions in Manchester by the sea then living in doodle god in real life

86
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:48,680
What the fuck is that dude, I don't want to live I mean

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,560
Come on, what do I want to I want to live in the fucking grumble volcano from Mario Kart. Fuck. No

88
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,820
Fuck. No, dude. I want to live in a place

89
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,900
I want to live in the midst of the movie and know that behind the midst there is a beach somewhere exactly

90
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,720
Yeah, I want to see like like a hundred clones of

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,060
Kathy Bates from misery just walking walking along the beach behind me. Yeah, I don't want to

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,060
Like in Hawaii you sit on the beach and all the monsters for my singing monsters come up and start singing to you

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,740
Yeah, leave me alone

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,780
Yeah, I mean, what is this damn island Hotel Transylvania?

95
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,620
When I was fucking kooky characters when I was on the

96
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,100
Hotel Transylvania a lot. Why he's exactly like Hotel Transylvania, dude

97
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,720
Hawaiian Transylvania, maybe the most similar States. That's true. Yeah. Yeah

98
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,860
When I was on the the plane here, they had it, you know, they have like like you can play games on like the seat back

99
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,820
Monitor, that's always the first thing

100
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,000
I look I look at when I get on a plane that has like a seat back TV is I look yeah games because it's all

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,540
They always got some good ass games and they had bird versus a turd. Oh

102
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,020
man, do you ever played bird versus

103
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,220
No, is it do you shoot the birds into the other birds? Nope?

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,420
Shit, what do you do? It's the worst game of all time

105
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,020
It's like a math game

106
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,980
Level thing where like you is a bird like it takes turns moving on the board and you have to draw a line around it

107
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,640
To stop it from escaping

108
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,140
That sounds awful last time on my flight back from California. I played on the back of the head rest

109
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,620
I played bejeweled - and I played the time trial version. So I was like playing really hard

110
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,680
It's like fucking pounding that fucking screen and then like 20 minutes in the lady

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,720
It was sitting on the seat turn around. She was like, can you stop?

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,660
and I was like

113
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,540
I'm so sorry, but I got so into bejeweled that I

114
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,780
I was like, oh, yeah, I was playing all the games. I was like, oh this one's called like fruit attack

115
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,860
This looks cool. Like this is probably like a fruit ninja game, right? Cuz yeah, and no it was it was bubble bobble

116
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
but with fruits.

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,100
I was like, "Oh, this sucks."

118
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
But this game, Blitz Blast, this looks pretty good.

119
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
I guess I should play this.

120
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,620
And it was Bubble Bobble, but with explosions.

121
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,140
Oh my God, dude.

122
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,380
At least I had the name brand games on my shit.

123
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,380
Tetris.

124
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,220
I mean, they had it down to a science to make you expect one app when you click on it and

125
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,020
you get Bird vs. Bird being a cool math game.

126
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,140
And then Fruit Slice or whatever.

127
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,720
I remember before phones were like high, like, like had like any sort of computing power,

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,460
you would download like modern warfare mobile, and it would just be like a version of Yahtzee

129
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,500
with like guns as the different side of the die.

130
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,820
The modern warfare mobile right now, he was playing and showing me, and you don't, all

131
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,140
you do is you just put your, you move your finger to move the like view.

132
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,500
There's no like fire but it just shoots automatically when you're, you're crosshairs over somebody.

133
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,300
My God, really run around and point at them and it just kills

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,700
them instantly and like everybody still lose like it's all just

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,500
like kids so they can't do it.

136
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,600
You just running around is tapping people.

137
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
There's dying.

138
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,600
It's like damn if only the only warzone was like this.

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,300
I'll be the champion of the world.

140
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,100
I'd be the king if all it was was pointing at things that I

141
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,900
wanted dead.

142
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Absolutely life was like this.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
I've only I'd be the king.

144
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,300
Well, that'd be tough because you know, there's some things

145
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,600
I point out that I don't want dead.

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,340
Like for example, if I'm ordering off the menu, I want, I don't want it.

147
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,560
I don't want to destroy the hamburger.

148
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,840
I mean, I want to destroy the hamburger, but with my mouth.

149
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,540
Yeah.

150
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,740
I don't want to fucking just kill the turkey stuffing sandwich at red Robin.

151
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,560
No, I want to, I want to, I want to eat that shit.

152
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,620
Absolutely.

153
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,320
Yeah.

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,140
I have been, um, I just found out right before we started recording

155
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,840
that I have, I have been hacked.

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Yo, my, my Facebook and Instagram accounts have been permanently

157
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,200
disabled because I was I was hacked by somewhere, somebody in China.

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,560
Somebody was trying to hack my Instagram literally every day for like a month

159
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,740
and then I just changed my I just switched the words around in my

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,860
Instagram name and it just stopped. Learned my mistake. I got every day I

161
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,240
would open Google Chrome and it would say warning you have 400

162
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,160
uh compromised passwords and I just go that's probably probably fine right and

163
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,520
this person whoever whoever hacked me set up a two-factor authentication so I can't even like

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,960
I can't even like get back into the accounts they're just gone forever oh oh my god so many

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,720
fucking so many so many Facebook events lost no the worst comedy shows of all time dude

166
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,840
Fuck. Yeah, so many poster tags that are broken now forever.

167
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,400
No.

168
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,000
We're gonna look at it and be like, "Who's this guy with three hairs on his head?"

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
I don't have three hairs like Charlie Brown.

170
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
I guess it's, I guess he's Chinese. This is weird.

171
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
No. No.

172
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,600
I guess his name is Free Ray Bans Beijing.

173
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,400
I was worried. I was worried when I first found out because I got something that was like,

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
"Your account may have been compromised." And then by the time that I tried to log in,

175
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
They'd already suspended it, but I was really worried for a second that

176
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,660
Whoever cuz you know what those people always do is they just like mass message everybody?

177
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah, so I was just like was imagining my mom getting like a message from me. That's like hey horny want to fuck me and

178
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,000
I was like

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
What if she says yes, dude? No

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,240
Yeah, it is so it's never I've never been hacked like that

181
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,700
But it is so humiliating like I feel so bad for like a person like in high school like someone

182
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,020
I maybe talked to like once or twice and then it sends a link

183
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,800
It's like what you posted these sexual pictures of me with a link and then they have to like a day later be like, I'm sorry

184
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Yeah, oh man

185
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,440
Can you imagine having to do that to like or or the people that people?

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,520
You make the you make the post just so you don't have to do all the all the specific messaging

187
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,920
you just make the post on your page.

188
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,120
It's like, I'm sorry for my post the last few days.

189
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
I was actually hacked.

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,520
I do not like diarrhea.

191
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,520
I think that it smells and it is brown.

192
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,520
So disregard all messages and posts.

193
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,620
What diarrhea is actually delicious bit me.

194
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,020
I got that from someone I would click right away that diarrhea

195
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,820
as covid cure in India.

196
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
Click here now.

197
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Meet Hot Diarrhea.

198
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,820
[Laughs]

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,820
I got a bunch, cause I joined a bunch of random Facebook groups that are all about like, you know,

200
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,820
extinct empire, conspiracy theory, stuff like that.

201
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,820
So I get put on a lot of lists where like a page will just auto-tag me and stuff.

202
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Like, yeah, like not even someone on my friends list, but it's like a page that's called like,

203
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Crazy Pictures. It'll be like, "Crazy Pictures tagged you in a post."

204
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,420
And it'll be like the new 18 plus video that's sweeping the nation. It's like me and like

205
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:13,420
people and it's like this better not show up on like my family members timeline like Cameron was

206
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,820
Did I miss all that I miss like

207
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:25,740
Find those groups and then just watch like videos that we would find all those videos of people claiming the Statue of Liberty moved

208
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,620
Yeah, and like some of them would just be like camera shake and one of them would be like they're like a CGI breakdancing

209
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,180
The coolest shit ever. I the new wave I've been on for Facebook groups

210
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,740
Is there people who believe in and I don't know the details of this?

211
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,460
I haven't I haven't like done any research

212
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,660
So, you know if I'm wrong you can yell at me and Twitter DMS or whatever

213
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,020
They believe in the Tartarian Empire

214
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,700
Which was like a technologically advanced empire that used to exist and I think was wiped out by like a flood of mud or something

215
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:22,700
and

216
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
So fucking press it then, what are you doing?

217
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,340
Like like an ancient like like

218
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,620
Technologically advanced like alien utopia and they're like and this window will look like a play button

219
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,300
So that we are quite advanced

220
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,060
Yeah, I I need to look into what the details of that that one is because um

221
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,340
There's a lot of groups about it and they're very fun to look at

222
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,600
Dude, i've been thinking about doing some ancient exploring recently some indiana jones shit. Oh, absolutely

223
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,440
I was watching some.

224
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,140
I was watching like one of those movies recently.

225
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,380
I can't remember which one.

226
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,340
And I was just thinking myself.

227
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,640
I was like the like pay off.

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,940
Oh, some shitty like horror movie called like as as above.

229
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,540
So below. Oh, yeah, that movie.

230
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,280
Yeah. So I was watching it and I was like,

231
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,240
these people were just getting fucking murdered.

232
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,840
Yeah. And like destroyed. It was horrible.

233
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,780
And then I was like, why don't you just like just why don't you get a normal job?

234
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,660
Yeah, like why do these people like Indiana Jones?

235
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:32,180
Like why what is so worth it like Indiana Jones is not rich every movie. He's fucking it starts off

236
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,600
He's teaching a class like why is he still like?

237
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,820
Jumping in front of arrows and like dodging laser beams to get like a golden head

238
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,620
Like just fucking working it at a normal job

239
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,580
You're gonna stay be a teacher if you're gonna be a teacher be a teacher

240
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,260
Yeah, just be a teacher. You'd be probably like the best teacher ever, you know?

241
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,820
Like you can fuck your students normally if that's really what you want to do in DnF.

242
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Yeah, you're not gonna like...

243
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
They're not that impressed that you got like...

244
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,100
You're not gonna get more pussy because you like brought back some like fucking...

245
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,900
That is definitely...

246
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Some old guitar, you know?

247
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,620
That's why you're still...

248
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,740
They're not gonna be doing it though, right? Like you can tell.

249
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,780
I have to suck your cock now.

250
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,380
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's a good point. He goes...

251
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,860
The bitch who has the "fuck me" written on her eyes or whatever,

252
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:26,260
He says like come to my office after class and then she walks in and he just like opens up like his like trophy case of all of his like ancient shit.

253
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,760
Yeah and she wasn't gonna fucking before but now she's seriously gonna fucking slurp him up.

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,560
The funny thing about that movie as as above so below that I remember is like it's about like the like.

255
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,720
like indiana jones explorers who like go into like the catacombs and like find hell or whatever

256
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,760
and the like writers of it clearly just ran out of ideas for like um indiana jones stuff because

257
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,880
it starts and they're like oh we have to like sneak through this tunnel and find this entrance

258
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,360
and escape from this cult and then like the rest of like like and add the hour that's left in the

259
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,160
movie is just like the roof of the cave just collapses six different times because they

260
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Think of like another trap.

261
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,560
There's like, oh, if you don't solve this puzzle, the roof will fall down.

262
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,260
And it just happens over and over and over.

263
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,160
Also, that is a great movie because it it it posits the idea that hell is

264
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
about 80 feet underground.

265
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,560
If you dig down 80 feet you get down.

266
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,160
So yeah people I remember people being like, oh, this is like a cool

267
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,860
depiction of hell, but they get to hell and I think like the first thing

268
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,760
they see is that there's in like underground.

269
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,760
There's like a car that's on fire and like that.

270
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
You think that's what's in hell like a scary car.

271
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,760
You could see if a car crashes on the highway.

272
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,760
You could see that you don't have to go to hell to see a car.

273
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,060
It's on.

274
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,360
Also, I guess it would make sense that hell was in in Paris like

275
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,660
France because it would just be like easy like hell is mostly

276
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,060
French people like so they just have an easier kind of shorter

277
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,960
walk to hell once they die.

278
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,260
Cuz yeah that that is a I would say it's a uniquely bad depiction

279
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,300
of hell because it's mostly just like everybody sees like one one weird thing that happened

280
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,860
to them a version of it in the in hell.

281
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,620
Yeah, and then they crawl out of a manhole at the end.

282
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,780
It's a very great story.

283
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,740
Sorry for the spoilers everybody, but I don't care.

284
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,100
I'll freaking yeah, you hear that damn you should give a shit.

285
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm savage as hell.

286
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah, it is funny.

287
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
The hell will be like you see one scary thing.

288
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:30,940
Yeah, the worst eternal punishment is your your underground and you see a scary stuff.

289
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,300
Yeah, yeah. Remember that time that you stubbed your toe really bad?

290
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,500
What if it happened again in hell?

291
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,740
Yeah, that is one of those movies though that every

292
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:50,300
horror nerd loves that movie because it's such an ingenious concept.

293
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,020
What if hell was the world but upside down?

294
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,740
You're in it, so it's right side up.

295
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:06,580
That would be scarier. If you were just if you got to hell and you started on the ground and then just fell up

296
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,920
That would be actually pretty scary. Yeah, that's like a way more terrifying idea than just like you don't know that

297
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,980
It's upside down until you leave. Yeah

298
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,700
Yeah, they have no idea

299
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:27,100
It was upside down the whole holy shit. That's insane. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool

300
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:34,580
I did I did LSD this past week nice and I I learned.

301
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,780
I learned a lot you know to learn I learned that.

302
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,280
That's a sponge bob is very scary to watch on LSD.

303
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,580
I just sat there and I was about the whole time yeah I mean that's squidward fellow he.

304
00:19:51,180 --> 00:20:02,080
Yes it or a yeah there is pointed when i was really peaking where and this is terrifying where sponge bob looked almost orange.

305
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:12,220
Which is really that was kind of reality bending for a shirt while you are looking at mr crabs.

306
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,080
'Cause Mr. He's the orange one.

307
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,720
It's fun.

308
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm saying with SpongeBob.

309
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,360
Yeah, he says, oh,

310
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,840
when I was peeking on as it was crazy,

311
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,880
SpongeBob was red and he was saying our money, money, money.

312
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,360
And I just turned to my entire family said, that's SpongeBob.

313
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,480
I I definitely wouldn't recommend watching a children's show

314
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,800
with your entire extended family.

315
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,560
Well, it seems like a recipe for a bad time to me.

316
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
It was actually a pretty good time because in the end I did just get to watch Spongebob.

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,400
Spongebob's nice. It's a good thing.

318
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah, it was fun, but we did also, and I wasn't choosing, we did also only watch the scary

319
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,000
episodes of Spongebob about like time and like all that shit. So that wasn't great,

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,160
you know, like the one where he's in the time machine and then he goes into the white void.

321
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,520
I watched that episode. I had a Spongebob DVD that had like a few episodes. I think it only

322
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,960
had like four episodes on it or something. Um, and that was one of them and then the ripped pants was

323
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,040
on there too. I just watched those two like over and over and over. If I had watched ripped pants

324
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,400
while just high out of my mind, I think I would have had what do they call an ego death.

325
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,720
Yeah. Yeah. That one's good. Also, I sing the song in it. Spongebob style. I ripped my pants on the

326
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,040
the beach that very day. So that would have been pretty terrifying.

327
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,560
Did you pretend to drown too? Like Spongebob?

328
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,720
Yeah, yeah I did. In the sand. Yeah. I pretended to drown.

329
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Yeah, I don't believe you, but that's okay.

330
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Whatever man, you don't have to believe me.

331
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,720
I don't have to believe you.

332
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,720
What can I do now to try to stop myself from being hacked ever again?

333
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,680
What kind of security measures do you need to put in place?

334
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:08,760
Just if you see notice yourself getting hacked just switch the words around and it stops. That's my funny. Does that work for you?

335
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,580
Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't think I don't think they care about my account. I think they just were like, oh, here's we're

336
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:20,600
Putting a username on a giant list and we're gonna just like brute force it every day because I was just getting a like an email

337
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
every day that was like

338
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,240
This you somebody's trying to log into your account

339
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,640
So, I don't know. I don't know if they're so stupid. They just couldn't find

340
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:38,680
You know, I don't know maybe that works maybe I don't know also I mean two-factor authentication

341
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:44,240
I think is the thing you have to do trying to think of what might what the perfect password is for my perfect password

342
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,480
It's very the thing is it's has it's very short because nobody ever get everyone has long dress where it's nowadays

343
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,120
Yeah, I'll guess in long stuff. My password is just like for example, if it was just one two, three

344
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,340
No one's ever getting in. I mean 3 2 1 might be how about here here. How about 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 1 is too easy

345
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,740
Cuz that's what I think I'd be when I'm one it went three trying to hack. They say 3 2 1 I'm in

346
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:14,140
Yeah, they're saying it out loud 3 2 1 time to try wait a minute let's try 3 2 1

347
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,640
That's why I think 3 1 2 might be the perfect password

348
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,700
That's a one three two really good password or two one three any or two any version of that

349
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,760
I think might be insanely strong because nobody said no no self-respecting hacker who knows how to count

350
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,440
It goes okay one three two. I'm in two one three. I'm in yeah exactly

351
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,840
You know and I'm gonna actually throw you a curveball here. That might be even better. Okay about

352
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,400
three two four

353
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,480
But the hacker would be able to say that because that's just illogical

354
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,060
What about six six six because they might get scared when they're typing it in

355
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:58,920
That might be pretty good might be good. Yeah. Yeah, I could work. The thing is nowadays all these damn password

356
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,640
companies they need you to put in a an emoji and

357
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,920
And a color yeah a color your favorite food your favorite food and a fucking and a and a photo of yourself

358
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:19,560
run through the "Tunify me" application and that all has to be part of your password

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,560
or else you try to enter it and it says "no you're gonna need one of these 50 things"

360
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Yeah, your password is too pathetic, that's what they say too.

361
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
It's like, I know what I'm doing.

362
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Hackers can easily get a picture, a tunified picture of me. It's public record.

363
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah, this isn't adding any more safety, like I'm not safer with my password because I added a question mark

364
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,840
at the end and just made myself sound like a pussy when I read my password out loud.

365
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
You know?

366
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,840
Yeah.

367
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
You know?

368
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Caleb is awesome?

369
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Like that's not a good password.

370
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
That's also what hackers do.

371
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Caleb is awesome is a good password.

372
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,200
Whenever hackers try a password, they immediately, if it doesn't work, they just try it again

373
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,920
with a question mark at the end.

374
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,160
Yeah, just to, and also, it mostly works.

375
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,200
Usually.

376
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,240
An exclamation point, I'm never that excited about the password.

377
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah.

378
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
You know?

379
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
A one.

380
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,520
really good password is for everyone out there to use is

381
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:21,000
hello 111 exclamation point cuz that that's easy to remember.

382
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,320
Yeah, you need your if your friend needs to log into your

383
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,920
Netflix or your Hulu or your Bank of America. That's easy for

384
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,720
them to do to remember how to do it exactly everybody. I do

385
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,200
think everyone should just have there should just be no

386
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,720
passwords. I think that honor system honor system. Yeah.

387
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:45,800
Cuz like these baddies these bad naughty's they are they're fucking no goods. He's nasty. No gooders. They're fucking

388
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:53,240
Logging on, you know, but it because they know my password safe. I'm gonna fucking hacker exactly

389
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,040
They're you get passwords if you had to look

390
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,720
Oh, here's what it is

391
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,680
If you had to log into a specific app to hack things that told everybody your name

392
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,880
I bet you a lot less hackers would happen in the world. We should if

393
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,320
We should have it so when a hacker moves into the neighborhood they have to go introduce themselves

394
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,280
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I'm required by like tell you me. I'm a hacker. I'm a hacker

395
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,480
Can I see your phone or your microwave? Yeah, do you mind if I look at your doorbell? I?

396
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,820
Just like to take a look at your ring. I could never hack your doorbell

397
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,560
Come on, I don't even know how to do that. I'm not that good of a hacker. Come on. I'm your doorbell

398
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:40,840
I hate when I get an alert from my ring doorbell. It says alert hacker is trying to hack doorbell and I look and it's a guy and his fingers are typing

399
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,600
Just tapping them

400
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,560
And I have to go I have to counter hack with my alexa I say

401
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Alexa, let's begin hacking. Yeah, one zero one one one zero one one one one one. You know, that's what it could be is that

402
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,280
We could make it really easy to hack everything

403
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,440
And then everybody would stop hacking because like, you know, if a hacker hacked me, I'd hack them back. It's easy

404
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,040
That's a good point. Yeah, it's like it would be like it would be like it'd be like nuclear weapons

405
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,320
Which is a really good situation, I think to have it should be like like like, you know, all those all that shit

406
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,720
It's like well learn to code. It should be learned to hack. I feel like hacking is much more

407
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,480
Useful because you'll to have coding and hacking is completely different coding is lame hacking is cool

408
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,520
So also the thing about hacking is like, you know, with coding, it's like, oh, I have no money.

409
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,160
Oh, I have to learn how to code to get a job and then get money.

410
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,480
Exactly.

411
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,560
With hacking, it's like, oh, I have no money. Here, let me learn to hack and then hack a

412
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,080
bunch of money away. That's one step removed. It's easier.

413
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,360
Right. I mean, and just look at, yeah, a coder, you know, they're like, okay, I'm going to create

414
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,000
a website where when you scroll, the menu bar stays in one place. I mean, that's not creative.

415
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,920
Everyone's doing that. A hacker says, I'm going to take that same website and I'm going to put

416
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,420
put a picture of my bare ass right in the middle of it, whether you like it or not.

417
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,020
And that's real creativity.

418
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:05,100
You know, a web designer wouldn't think to do something like that.

419
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,620
Well cause also, so if you were a hacker, what would your calling card be?

420
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,020
Probably I would say you've been hacked by Cameron.

421
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,220
Could be one idea, but I'll keep brainstorming because I know you didn't have much of a reaction

422
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
to that.

423
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I was expecting more of a cast.

424
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,220
You've been hacked by... wait, can you say it again?

425
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,300
Say it like you're making a robot voice.

426
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
You've been hacked by Cameron.

427
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:32,380
No, see that that would be scary to see that actually did get a really good reaction. What about okay?

428
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,140
I've actually got a new idea. What about virus engaged?

429
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:46,140
That might be pretty scary - yeah or like welcome to the matrix bitch could be one I think getting a bunch of I

430
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:53,740
Think the nice thing about like most people is you could just make them download a picture that says like like yeah

431
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,000
Virus downloaded or something and that would be enough for them to did just like their computer their computer in the trash, you know

432
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,300
Yeah, kind of a mental virus. It's like morgulons. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Oh shit brain worm. I

433
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,720
Can't believe I forgot to tell you this about that Denny's

434
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,180
No, no, it has nothing to do with that even a little bit

435
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,040
but I

436
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I did see a waiter named Shrek.

437
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,040
S-C-H-R-E-C-K.

438
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Shrek.

439
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Shrek.

440
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:48,040
And before you ask, he didn't look a lot like Shrek to be honest.

441
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,520
Yeah, no, he just looked like a guy but his name his name was Shrek

442
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,000
dude, you know that guy that guy that guy applied to like a bunch of different jobs and

443
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,600
He was like he applied to a bunch of jobs that didn't require you to wear name tags and none of them accepted

444
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:14,840
And then the ones with name tags only accepted him because they were like this would be like a feature the restaurant

445
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,680
You know, it could be like our mascot. Yeah. Well what he should have done because this is in

446
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,480
California he should have tried to get a job at Universal Studios as a Shrek walkabout character, right?

447
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,360
And then when somebody was some little kid walks up to him and kicks his leg and says you're not really Shrek

448
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,920
He takes off the helmet and they don't know who he is because

449
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,160
No, what do you think now and then says? Oh, yeah, my name is Shrek you guys

450
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,360
I forgot that you guys wouldn't know that I guess I'm not a guy the guy who played knows for a to his name Shrek

451
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,240
Is that true? Yeah, it's a piece of true max Shrek. Oh

452
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,040
Okay last name though. So yeah, but I mean I like his friend. Oh if your name was max Shrek

453
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
I feel like people would call you Shrek

454
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,720
Yeah. Yeah, my name was Caleb Superman. I would hope that you would call me

455
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,820
Superman I was I was double-check when I before I said that is double check in and make sure I remembered it

456
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,880
Right and I searched max Shrek and it has the like people also ask thing on Google and here are the questions

457
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,400
I think the questions are it was max Shrek a method actor. What is the meaning of nosferatu is nosferatu scary? I

458
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Don't think nosferatu is very scary any they didn't figure out how to make a scary movie until like the exorcist

459
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,520
Yeah, I think

460
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,580
Hmm, I think he's I think he's scary looking. I mean, he's like ugly but like that's not scary to me

461
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,060
I think he's scary. I think he's one of the scariest guys in the world. You're just lying me

462
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:54,560
You're just me trying to make a point you have no you're not you do not think knows for us

463
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,220
Have you seen if you saw nose for ought to right now you'd say oh, he's a swimmer. He has more fans

464
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,820
And I wouldn't say that I would say that you were out to you

465
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,780
Well, that might be your first thought but then you'd say Nosferatu, obviously not a real guy.

466
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,700
So that guy who looks like Nosferatu has to have Marfan syndrome.

467
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,380
He's a real guy. He's based on a real guy named Max Nosferatu.

468
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,300
You're just making shit up now.

469
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,580
I'm not making that up. I'm reading it off the Wikipedia page right now.

470
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,380
There was another guy who worked at that Denny's whose name was Nosferatu.

471
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,620
Nosferatu. That would be a really good last name.

472
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,940
Well, I will say that I think Shrek is the of all fictional characters.

473
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,060
I think Shrek is the least likely like like the most unexpected actual name I've ever seen.

474
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,100
Probably.

475
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,620
Like I could not think of another fictional character.

476
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,940
Wait, I have to go real quick.

477
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,500
Okay.

478
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,260
My groceries are here. Give me two seconds.

479
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,140
I'm gonna keep recording.

480
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,740
All right, I'm back.

481
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,060
All right.

482
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,740
Got my LaCroix in the mail.

483
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,060
Yeah.

484
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:04,340
while you were gone I was uh I was googling Tartarian Empire mud flood just to see just

485
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:11,860
to get a surface level idea of what this is and the first the first article about is from Bloomberg

486
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,500
about the conspiracy theory and the second one is from is from the Crimsonian the voice of Dover

487
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:26,660
High School. So this is the two sources. High school newspaper article about about the Tartarian

488
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,340
Mud Flood and it says at the bottom, "Please note that the opinion expressed in this article

489
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,620
are not representative of Dover City Schools Staff Administration or Board of Education."

490
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:45,660
They should put more like, so like op-eds, you can say whatever you want in an op-ed,

491
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
right?

492
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,260
They should let more like just completely crazy people write op-eds in New York Times and

493
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,340
Washington Post and shit.

494
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,340
You know?

495
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,900
I feel like they should let Shrek do it.

496
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I bet he has some wild opinions.

497
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Shrek?

498
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,900
I mean...

499
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,380
Oh the other thing about Shrek is that this guy...

500
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,820
I'm sorry to be stuck on Shrek.

501
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:12,380
This guy was probably like mid-30s and so I was like, "Okay, so that means that he was

502
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,620
around middle school when the first Shrek movie came out."

503
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
Right, yeah.

504
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:23,500
I was just imagining his first day back, his first day at school, and his best friend comes

505
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,740
up to him, like right as he enters and he's like, "Hey, did you see the news?

506
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,260
I'm so sorry.

507
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,900
I can't be friends with you anymore."

508
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:40,700
Yeah, I'm sure also because like, yeah, he probably went to see a movie and the trailer

509
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
was like, "Before."

510
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Yeah, exactly.

511
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,020
Yeah exactly, it was like this summer this green monster's making fairy tale land, he's

512
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,340
a bitch or whatever and he's sitting in the sea like oh this looks great.

513
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,540
Coming in 2001, Shrek.

514
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Shrek.

515
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,740
Farting mud stink over.

516
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:08,820
Yeah, yeah, he farts in mud and he fucks a log and he's like oh this looks funny as hell.

517
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,420
best friends a black donkey and he and they're both stupid as shit.

518
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,060
Oh my god they're ugly too.

519
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
Awesome.

520
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,780
And he turns into a prince and it's funny because he's so ugly normally.

521
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,260
He kidnaps a girl and tries to fuck her.

522
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,220
This guy's seriously fucking weird as hell.

523
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,700
I wonder what this movie's called.

524
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,980
His ears were like fucking disgusting.

525
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,740
He's so fucking ugly that his wife caught it.

526
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:46,080
also turned ugly. His skin looks like green salami and he smells like it too. He's so

527
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,940
gross. He pulls a candle out of his ass because there's so much wax in it. And he's fat. He's

528
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,780
fat because he eats bugs like they're candy. Yeah. He's like Timon and Pumbaa and the Mucinex

529
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,620
monster all mixed together. If he was real and in middle school he would be bullied for

530
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,500
this if you knew a guy who's named after this fat piece of shit you should kill

531
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:17,100

We're gonna make a special he's gonna be the face of our brand

544
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:31,360
I bet you can't wait to wait to play Shrek all-stars brawl on Game Boy Advance with your

545
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:37,780
Cuz in you can beat you just like you've always wanted to you can beat this shit out of Shrek

546
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,500
Fuck Shrek and fuck this kid

547
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,820
the guy who's talking in

548
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,460
Like we actually used motion capture to make Shrek move exactly like the kid

549
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Yeah, and then it's like

550
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:00,340
His farts were actually designed from Shrek's real-life parts that we captured in the classroom

551
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:06,180
Cut to the kid Shrek in a bathtub just farting so hard it makes

552
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:14,300
Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction

553
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,940
We found the nastiest little fucker in Texarkana

554
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,420
And we turned him into a green fucking monster and we passed a law

555
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,680
Federal law that means that he specifically can never change his name

556
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:37,740
We followed this little fucker around and fed him bugs he only got fat and green from being sick

557
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:44,940
Director sitting on a chair is like so basically we started by finding just the worst most stinky green kid we could find

558
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,940
And we patented every part of Shrek's character on the child.

559
00:38:48,940 --> 00:39:02,940
We actually, we forced him to live in a hut for several months and we put a psychic driving helmet on his head and actually forced him to listen to a Scottish accent for months until he developed one.

560
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Oh fuck dude. We squeezed his ears until they looked weird.

561
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,180
(laughing)

562
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,020
- Yeah.

563
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,900
- See that's what that brown disgusting outfit.

564
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,940
- I think if that was me,

565
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,820
I would just get plastic surgery to look like Shrek.

566
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,660
- Yeah.

567
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,500
- You know?

568
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,320
- Yeah.

569
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,660
- 'Cause then if people, you know,

570
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,980
you obviously, you look like Shrek.

571
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,180
You're walking around fucking Shrek'd up.

572
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,300
- And then someone comes up to you.

573
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,820
- And they're like, well, you just like,

574
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,420
this isn't that cool 'cause you just like paid

575
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:36,320
to like have all this shit to look and be Shrek.

576
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,580
And then you show them your birth certificate

577
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,700
And they go, Oh my God, I'm rethinking all of that.

578
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,540
Well, the Shrek movie, it also, it was an innovative motion

579
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,960
capture technology where they actually, every character in

580
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,540
that movie was based off of a real person.

581
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,160
So they had, they had Fiona, the beautiful princess, they had Eddie

582
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,500
Murphy, the donkey, you know, um, they had, and then they had Shrek.

583
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:00,840
Yeah.

584
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,740
Yeah.

585
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,540
And they basically, they, they would, uh, what they did is they

586
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,420
convince the kid that there was a they sent the kid to a slumber

587
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,060
party, which was the slumber party was actually all producers

588
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,660
of the movie and they played a game in the movie called or in

589
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,540
the the slumber party called who can have the most tennis balls

590
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,900
duct taped to their body and then they they just basically

591
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,660
recorded that and the kid is so stupid. I mean Shrek come on

592
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,700
and he's like, oh okay. Yeah. I'd love to play that game and

593
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,940
they were like. Oh yeah and then the second part of the game is

594
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,580
you have to like pretend you're picking up something heavy and

595
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,880
And then you have to do a hug and then you have to run for your life.

596
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,680
Yeah, they had hidden cameras all over the slumber party that got it.

597
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,380
On every piece of that now pretend signing this release form with a

598
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:50,480
real pen now pretend you're kissing your mom.

599
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,780
They motion captured him signing the release form to there just like

600
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,080
and now pretend you're writing your name and then they use that

601
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,580
technology to actually digitally add a signature.

602
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,740
yeah the worst part is that they get the game

603
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,940
the shrek logo

604
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,800
believe me and they also

605
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,280
they motion captured it his own mom to be fiona

606
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,020
just to make it even more better

607
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,400
company came out

608
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,620
uh...

609
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,000
a fun fact when they film that scene in the hot tub

610
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
that was a mud those poop

611
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,940
and it is a good

612
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,340
because and here's a very much like how they use the back back in black and

613
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,120
white movies he used to use like chocolate syrup for blood.

614
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,720
Poop has a better consistency for the screen than mud does.

615
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,580
So you know, you gotta take it to the team and send this poop kid.

616
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:45,000
And then Shrek got put into witness protection because he wanted, he was, everybody wanted

617
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,440
to kill him.

618
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,860
And they sent him to, they sent him to, to Bakersfield, California where he works at a

619
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Denny's now.

620
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah, the only one of the only three Denny's with a bar.

621
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,840
That was that was they were like we're gonna send you to work at this this high-profile bar

622
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,840
There's only three in the country

623
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:12,440
Yeah, and they again these legally not allowed to change his name so he keeps a Shrek name check but

624
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Everyone's on the walk by a table cuz he's busting dishes and a kid will will a burp up a Pepsi

625
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,760
And then his dad will say, Hey, better out than in.

626
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,480
I always say, and then Shrek's eyes just go completely black.

627
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:33,360
Yeah. Uh, we're sending you to, I mean, a luxurious new placement,

628
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,640
you know, this, the city we're sending you to it's industry rich. I mean,

629
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,200
I don't want to, I don't want to put any ideas in your head, but like oil.

630
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,720
So I'm just thinking like Dubai, Dubai,

631
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,560
any direction you look buildings as far as you can see.

632
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,560
Oh my God, I'm going to Dubai.

633
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm so excited.

634
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,200
I'm going to get gold out of a vending machine.

635
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,480
And there's a Korn Street sign too.

636
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,840
And then he's like, well that's an interesting feature in Dubai.

637
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,440
I didn't realize that they were such fans of Korn.

638
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Well, gee mister, where am I headed?

639
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,900
Well, Shrek, we're putting you in Bakersfield.

640
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,160
That is the best place for a guy named Shrek to live, I think.

641
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:23,040
And at first he's like a little hopeful. He's like, Bakersfield, Haiti? No, no, you wish

642
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,960
Buster. Bakersfield, California.

643
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,340
Yeah, and we're giving you two choices of jobs. You can either be a bartender at Denny's

644
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:37,680
or you can taste the oil that comes out of the Derrick's to make sure it's good.

645
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,680
I'll take the oil job. Actually, that position was just filled

646
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,280
after I told you.

647
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,980
Unfortunately donkey took that one.

648
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,380
It's all the Bakersfield.

649
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,780
Bakersfield is a perfect city, man.

650
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,080
It's just like it's geographically.

651
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,080
It's like the fucking biggest city in the world.

652
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,480
Like there's you it's impossible to leave yet to drive through.

653
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,480
It takes like three hours and it is all just oil.

654
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,260
Derrick's just pumping up and down. Yeah, it's so cool. I recently got to see the

655
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,400
Gorgeous skyline of Gary, Indiana. Oh

656
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,360
No, oh my god, dude. Yeah. Yeah very at some point very fun. Look at it not be in

657
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:30,480
Ditties are so gracious and and gorgeous that at some point you have to refer to them as she as if they are a boat

658
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,960
Absolutely, and I think Gary, Indiana and Bakersfield. I mean those those girls those pretty girls can sing

659
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
You know what I'm saying?

660
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
Yep.

661
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,960
Every night, I mean, just the people are howling at the moon because they're so excited to

662
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,960
be there.

663
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
You know?

664
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Yeah, absolutely.

665
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,920
I crushed my foot with an ATM!

666
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,960
Howling beautiful siren songs.

667
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,120
Yeah, those are, I mean, if they're not sister cities, they should be.

668
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,760
Yeah, twin cities.

669
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,440
And you know what I would do to two twin girls.

670
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,640
Oh my god, what would you do?

671
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,400
live in both of them at different times.

672
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
Yep.

673
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,400
Or at the same time if I was brave.

674
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:17,080
Yeah, if I was mega rich, I would have one house, Dunkin Donuts front property in Gary

675
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,280
Indiana, you know, wake up every morning, look out on my beautiful view of the wall

676
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,680
of the Dunkin Donuts right in front of my apartment.

677
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:33,480
And then I would have an underground bunker in Bakersfield, California, where the tubes

678
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,960
of the oil lines, they were sucking the oil straight from under my apartment, through my

679
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,480
apartment, and those were the support beams of the entire building, and then up to the

680
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
surface.

681
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,280
I would live as a mole man.

682
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,080
And that would be kind of my vacation home, you know?

683
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,200
Although both of them could be considered vacation homes.

684
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,360
And then in the winter, I guess I Airbnb one.

685
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,360
Yeah.

686
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,480
I mean, if I was mega rich, I'm talking a house in Baco.

687
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,880
I'm talking a house in Gary, Indiana.

688
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,000
I mean, I'm talking a house in Lowell, a house in Des Moines.

689
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,200
I mean, I have a house in Poop Town.

690
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Oh, Boise.

691
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,800
Yeah, Boise and Poop Town.

692
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
Poop Town.

693
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,840
I mean, really beautiful in the winter.

694
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,720
I really thought that the Brooklyn Nets were going to move to Poop Town.

695
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,720
I really thought that was coming, but you know, they aren't so lucky.

696
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,280
You know, Poop Town hasn't won, do you know that they haven't won a major sports championship

697
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,280
in Poop Town?

698
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:37,620
That is insane reverse the years. I don't think ever you know, because they don't because the because poop town isn't real

699
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,360
And don't have a single

700
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,200
Sports championship in a major sport at least you know, I don't know about double-a titles

701
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,360
You know

702
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,000
Yeah, I heard they have a really good ping-pong team. I

703
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,160
Would love to do a tour of all of those kinds of cities. I that would be so sick, dude

704
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,520
Gary, Indiana, Bakersfield, Baton Rouge.

705
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Yeah.

706
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,880
Um, uh, what's, what's the one in Texas?

707
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,880
It's like that.

708
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,880
I don't know.

709
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,200
I feel like Fort Worth kind of sucks, but it's not like that kind of, I'm sure a ton of people

710
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,360
will tell us all the cities that suck after this comes out.

711
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:21,400
I'm sure we, um, more people than we want to will tell us which ones are good and bad.

712
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,520
I mean, if you ask me, only good cities, Boston.

713
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,520
I mean, only good.

714
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,520
Cheers to that brother.

715
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,520
Right.

716
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,000
Dude, I just got, I will say there's nothing more exciting than getting LaCroix in the

717
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
mail.

718
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Yeah.

719
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And just fucking, oh dude.

720
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Because also, they don't put that in another box.

721
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,240
There's no wondering what it is.

722
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,140
It arrives, you know?

723
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,520
It's LaCroix.

724
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,840
It's not in a cardboard fucking whatever.

725
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,080
It's cheap as shit if you buy it online.

726
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,080
I don't know that I've ever had.

727
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,080
And you just pop it open.

728
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,440
I think I might have had LaCroix like once or twice in my life, but I can't even remember

729
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,180
what it tastes like.

730
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,180
Is it just water?

731
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,980
Is it one of those things where people make a tweet that's like, it's like water, but

732
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,220
you smell a fruit when you drink it?

733
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,900
Well, this one's key lime flavored, tastes damn near a key lime pie.

734
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,340
Plus, there's two satisfactions to the act of drinking La Croix.

735
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,420
Number one is drinking it.

736
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,660
It's just enjoyable.

737
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,140
Number two is walking up to both the recycling bin and the trash bin right next to each other

738
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,300
and consciously throwing it in the trash can.

739
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:42,300
just

740
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,260
recycling into the trash at the end of the day. So I mean,

741
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,660
I don't want to be the idiot who's making extra work for the workers.

742
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,700
Well,

743
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,940
my big thing is if I walk outside and if it's too hot,

744
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,220
I throw it in the recycling. If it's too cold, I throw it in the trash.

745
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,580
And then it kind of, I do that enough that in the months of like, you know,

746
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,180
like September to November, it's usually pretty cool.

747
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:06,740
And then I guess I overdo it a little bit and it gets cold again.

748
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,180
Right. I, well in my, the system I use in my apartment, I have,

749
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,340
I have a blue bin and a brown bin, okay?

750
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,900
And the blue bin is recycling and some trash,

751
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,540
and the brown bin is trash and some recycling.

752
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,420
- That's a really good system.

753
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,940
Yeah, 'cause I don't know if you've seen Toy Story 3,

754
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,460
but they use a magnet to suck all the toys out anyway.

755
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,300
- Exactly, yeah.

756
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,100
- So it's not a big deal, you know?

757
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,280
- Plus I'm not colorblind,

758
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,020
but I like to pretend I am when I'm throwing away trash.

759
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:44,340
I don't even know if colorblind people have a problem with blue and brown, but I do.

760
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:48,180
Did you know that like 1 in 10 men are colorblind?

761
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,340
Is that true?

762
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,340
Yeah.

763
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,340
Like some level of colorblindness.

764
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,140
That's one of the, I don't think I only know like one colorblind person.

765
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,540
I wouldn't, if I was colorblind, I'm not, but if I was, I don't think I would admit

766
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,540
it.

767
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,300
I think a lot of people don't even know they're colorblind.

768
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,620
I think it's humiliating to be colorblind.

769
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,420
Yeah, it's embarrassing, dude.

770
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,420
Yeah.

771
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,940
Oh, I can't, I can't tell the difference between, like, imagine playing chess.

772
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,380
Yeah, I mean, well, this is do people to imagine playing chess on a pink and green chessboard

773
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:20,260
Do colorblind people genuinely have to memorize the position of the red and green light on a traffic light?

774
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:24,440
It was like if I pulled if I suddenly became like if I became colorblind tomorrow

775
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,420
And I was at a traffic light and I couldn't tell like if all the lights didn't have color

776
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,540
Yeah, I don't know. I don't be able to do it

777
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,120
Well, you could also like I know the middle ones got to be yellow, right?

778
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Well, the middle one has to be yellow.

779
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,120
But also, I feel like as long as you're at somewhat of a crowded intersection,

780
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,120
as long as nobody's running the light, you can kind of look around

781
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,120
and look around at everybody, like, both feet, one foot on each,

782
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,120
either the gas pedal and the brake, and then you look around and you say,

783
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,120
"Oh yeah, we're all stopping, yeah, we all know it's red.

784
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Yeah, we're just gonna stop, it's a stop sign light.

785
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,120
We're all gonna stop."

786
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,080
Stop sign or a go sign. I would have a lot of trouble. Yeah

787
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:13,420
Yeah, it's listen. It's gray light. Okay, we stop at the gray light. Everybody knows that we go at the gray light

788
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,280
It's just how it is

789
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,240
Everyone knows our rules of driving and that's why I'm stopping with all you guys if you're convertible down

790
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:28,920
Yeah, okay, oh yeah yet another gray light for me to stop at yeah, I know what to do I'm a great driver

791
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,920
Okay, but here's the thing what if what if it's one of the ones with the arrows?

792
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,200
Because those turn green and red right no they don't

793
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,680
Yeah, they turn green they do turn green and red is there one where the arrow can be green or red in the same spot

794
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,200
It can there's one where it can be green red and there's one with a hundred lights

795
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,920
And it can be a million different colors, and you don't know what any of them mean

796
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,320
Is there one that's like a Christmas tree is that what you're asking is there one is there a Christmas tree I?

797
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,140
Think that might be a more efficient way to do stoplights, right?

798
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,620
I think a more efficient way to do stoplights is if we listen

799
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:09,460
This is how we this solves the economy this solves traffic just put a guy at every intersection

800
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,380
Every single one he tells everybody go then you know if you're in a big hurry you say hey, man

801
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,820
It's like taking a really long time

802
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,620
I got to go pee really bad and that guy over there. I can tell just looking at him

803
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,660
He doesn't have to go pee. I mean no guy who?

804
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,740
Would have to go pee would be sitting that still and the guy would be like that's actually

805
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,820
Holy shit, that's actually such a good idea is like a like a lot

806
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,020
You know

807
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,500
Sometimes you'll be sitting at a stoplight for like two or three minutes

808
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,260
Like you should be able to plead your case for why you should be able to to just run the light

809
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,860
Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying. There's okay, and if you don't you know, whatever if you don't want it

810
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:52,640
I mean, I know the government hates giving freaking people jobs nowadays, you know, that's all they all they're trying to keep us down

811
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,400
So if you don't employ a crossing guard or a traffic light guard or whatever kind of guard that is Coast Guard

812
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,320
I don't know whatever the hell

813
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,800
You can just make an app. Okay, and I can type it

814
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:07,120
I can yeah, I can put to the green light and I can type into the app. I'm actually not in such a hurry today

815
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,880
So I'll just wait at this green light and let the other person go you press send

816
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:18,240
Someone in like a call center or something. They read your your request about 28 to 30 minutes later. They approve it and

817
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,280
You're allowed to wait a little extra time

818
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,900
To let the other person go absolutely and eventually, you know - because you know, that still involves government hiring people

819
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,760
They could have it be an AI system, right?

820
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:37,400
Where you text of basically a robot but then if the smart people I guess would start texting them kind of robot

821
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,320
Excuses for why you have to because they could relate to that a little easier. Uh-huh, you know

822
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:46,820
I have to get it. It could also just be the president's job. They don't have to hire anyone then

823
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,940
My cuz everybody always says I am off to the president a little bit

824
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:55,480
Oh, the president doesn't do anything. All they do is fucking play golf and watch TV

825
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Okay, well then give him this job, you know, exactly make him into a traffic light judge. Yeah, they sit there

826
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,480
Maybe maybe it can just be on every other judge also has to do that

827
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,540
So they in the middle of their trial that they're judging over they get a ping on their phone

828
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,920
They have to look and they have to judge like okay. This guy is

829
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,280
is having a baby but the other person

830
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,760
at the light is having

831
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,520
to babies

832
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,960
you know what

833
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,640
what was the judgment here yeah they have to order it also screen swerve around

834
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,440
each other that could be an option

835
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,560
and then they get the notification on their phone

836
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,520
and it tells and it reroutes them on google maps to see what around

837
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,360
exactly it's a perfect okie over a thing around each other and children turned

838
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,480
fifteen degrees to the right it says

839
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,880
yet could also be like

840
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,040
Circa go around each other in a circle. So it looks really cool from a satellite because

841
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,920
They're doing traffic pictures right now both of you

842
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,760
Yeah, because also it's it's easier for them to film stuff like that

843
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,760
It could be good for fast and furious the directors wouldn't have to wall anything off

844
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,280
They just send to people's traffic apps. Okay crash your car now

845
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,960
Yeah, that's the future of government subsidies for film

846
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:16,400
Yeah, is that we will start having just random cars random teslas will be hijacked to do that's what they're gonna if we get self-driving cars

847
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,680
That's what they're gonna do. You're gonna yeah, you're gonna be like you're testing

848
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,560
Lock up the controls and be like oh you are now on set for fast and furious 23

849
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,760
And you yeah, so i'm required to flip this car over and launch it into space

850
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:37,360
Dude I I rode in a tesla for the first time ever and it was uh, and it was a lift a lift picked me up

851
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,360
An $8 lift from the movie theater to my hotel was in a Tesla and then the lady

852
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:49,360
told me that they were filming she this is in LA she was like I was like oh yeah

853
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,360
like I'm a comedian she started asking me about shit and she was like oh oh you do

854
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,400
you do movies and television and I was like not really like all movies and

855
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,000
television recently Dave they come to my house and they are filming pornography in

856
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,320
my house. I was like, what? She's like, Oh yes. And one,

857
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,760
one man he comes in and I think he is so handsome.

858
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,480
And my, and my, my daughter, she comes up to me and she says,

859
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,400
he is almost as famous as Justin Bieber.

860
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,680
So I, that was like, you're one of the only experience I've ever been in a Tesla.

861
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,000
You're a guy who tells people in an Uber or Lyft that you're a comedian.

862
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,120
I didn't say it to me. I just said that. I was like, I was like,

863
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,220
I do like I was somebody I see like, oh, what do you do?

864
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:40,020
I was like, I you know, I just do stuff.

865
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,020
I gotta say with your chest hang out a little bit.

866
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,120
Yes, with your chest.

867
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,120
I although I did my dad's friend while I was on vacation.

868
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,320
He was like, so I hear you have a podcast.

869
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,220
What's it called?

870
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,620
And I just said I'm not allowed to tell you.

871
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,020
Yeah, and then let me think it's not that I can't have like

872
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,520
a bit embarrassed, but I just don't want if you tell a Lyft

873
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,620
driver, they're comedian.

874
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,720
They assume that you've seen whatever stand-up special that

875
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,520
Is the only one they've seen in their life. They're like, oh, oh my god

876
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:11,080
They're like have you ever seen like this jeff foxworthy routine and they talk that's actually 30 minutes

877
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,080
That's actually why i like doing it is because with like taxi drivers

878
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:22,120
The the if they ask you what your occupation is the crazier thing that the craziest thing you can say pulls out

879
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,920
To them it like makes them think that it's okay to say whatever they want. That's true

880
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,520
Yeah, they will they do start saying they do start saying insane stuff. Yeah

881
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,340
So like maybe like I think the best move is like if somebody is like,

882
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,840
hey, like, what do you like?

883
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
What do you do for a living?

884
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,740
And you're just like I'm an evil clown like they first of all,

885
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,540
they'll just believe you because like, oh, yeah, I tried to kill a kid

886
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,540
once actually.

887
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,240
Yeah, exactly.

888
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,740
Yeah, like they'll just say anything, you know, and she was one of

889
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,140
these people who like that who like won't like let you roll down

890
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,440
the windows unless you talk to her, you know, so like I really was

891
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,240
trying to get a lot out of her. And I got that she's a she is a has a

892
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,840
pornographer's house and a famous famous pornographer came there. I don't want I

893
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,600
don't mind the Lyft driver I don't mind talking to Lyft driver but they better

894
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,880
be talking telling me about their life story. They better be telling me a whole

895
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,160
lot of interesting stuff. I'm gonna tell even one detail about my life. A hundred

896
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,960
percent dude. I better hear the early years, the middle years, the now years

897
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:34,820
before I'm getting to anything. Yeah I need to ask them more shit. I had a guy

898
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,440
one time in Providence tell me that he was he he was like there the people

899
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,740
there the he always he was like a just tell me about like the cops and he was

900
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,400
like yeah if you like if you like steal like a like a power bar the cops will

901
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,320
take you to the train tracks and beat you to death and then he just started

902
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,080
talking about how much he wanted to fuck like girls.

903
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,000
And he was like, yeah, like he was like, yeah, dude,

904
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,720
like I want to fuck like a 20 year old girl.

905
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,920
And we were like, oh yeah, man,

906
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,480
how about a 19 year old girl?

907
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,120
And he's like, oh yeah, dude, that's even better.

908
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
And we were like, oh yeah, how about an 18 year old girl?

909
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,840
And he was like, oh yeah, that's seriously good.

910
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,600
- The Uber driver I had when I was going to Chicago

911
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,000
to the airport, I was in an Uber and the guy was like,

912
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,840
oh, where are you headed?

913
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,440
I was like, oh, I'm going to Chicago to visit some friends.

914
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,720
And he was like, I went to Chicago once.

915
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,760
It's a beautiful city.

916
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,820
It has an incredibly high homicide rate.

917
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,280
Which is what he said to me immediately.

918
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,880
I was like, nice man.

919
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,120
- Damn dude.

920
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,960
- Yeah.

921
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,640
- That's a, I think as an Uber driver,

922
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,360
you do have to have some facts like that,

923
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,120
no matter what somebody says.

924
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,840
- I think he was trying to find out if I was racist or not.

925
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,360
So to see if he could say racist stuff to me.

926
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,680
- Why do they always,

927
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,000
these guys have to know other racist people.

928
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Just have that conversation with them.

929
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yeah, you don't need to do like, "When is the narwhal baking?"

930
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You're not, why are you trying to kite me into that?

931
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yeah, like, why are you trying to like, get me to like, talk to you about, you know, like,

932
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and also they're like so, they start so subtle, you know?

933
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah, and so you start out agreeing with them, because you're like, "Oh, you're just trying to make conversation,"

934
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and then they hit you with something, something crazy, and you've already, you got, you got lulled into it.

935
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, they'll still always start,

936
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
"I don't know, man, I don't know."

937
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,400
Yeah, cuz they'll always be like, I'm in the fucking the

938
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,960
Seriously some bad traffic today. You'll be like, oh, yeah, man. They're like, you notice what kind of people are in those cars

939
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:34,760
Yeah

940
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:41,280
And then you look around and it's all like the same looking Hawaiian guy wearing like

941
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,680
coconut bra

942
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,040
And you look at him and you're like, you know what?

943
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:51,160
Now that I think about it, there is a lot of big Hawaiian guys driving cars today.

944
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
Yeah.

945
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Okay.

946
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
All right.

947
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Okay.

948
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,520
Shrek, if you're listening, please get in contact with me.

949
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,520
Yep.
