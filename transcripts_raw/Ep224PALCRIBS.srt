Podcast about list. This ain't your grandma's podcast.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey douchebag, suck my twat.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And, I said, "Hey douchebag, quit being a f*cking twat."

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome to Douche FM. You're listening to three biggest twats in the civic brain.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Uh, you know what? I think I'm a douche.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who thinks there's a douchebag present?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Do you guys think twat is better or dash?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ow, I hit my douchebag.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I was douching for about an hour and it didn't even come out clear.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And your mom's a douchebag, douchebag.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, and I said, "Your mom's a douchebag, douchebag."

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My twat was too small to have sex.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Should we just make it a rule that we start every episode by one of us going

14
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
"Woo!" or "Uh-huh!"

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
That's how you go.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
We used to start, I used to just sing.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I've been practicing my singing a lot lately.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, you can't say something like that and not prove yourself.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You have your song, your famous song.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So go ahead, sing your song. What do you got?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Twinkle, twinkle little star

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
terrible. You are an awful singer. That is- I'd like to see you do better then. Yeah.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,120
Twinkle twinkle little star. No. What I wonder what you are. You didn't even get the words right.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:46,240
When you're up there in the sky you make me feel so right all summer long.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,760
Twinkle twinkle little star. You are getting worse every time dude. I'm doing

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,640
well the thing I am a... I don't know what happened but I'm legit crying. He's crying.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay first of all I made him cry with my music. Second of all I'm a chameleon. I

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,960
sing whatever style I want. That was... Twinkle twinkle little star. Oh my god

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,360
and he's a rapping star. Twinkle twinkle little star. That's like kind of a kid

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,680
rock style. Exactly. Any style. Yeah. Give me a style. Classical.

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,480
Fuck you! That ain't cl-- this is classical if you're doing a classical version.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,160
That's a conductor. That's not music. That's a type of hand singing.

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,080
The conductor is the musician. No, he's got a lady at the concerts now that's doing the fucking

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,880
hand singing. Oh, yes. You mean an interpreter for sign language? I don't know what the hell

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,240
you're talking about. Interpreting. That's the hand singing. It's hand singing. No it's not.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,960
Then okay. She's singing with her hands. What the fuck are they doing? They're doing that.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,440
Here's the thing man. Why, how many deaf people go into concerts and they're like,

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,960
yeah. You know what I'm saying? Probably enough. Yeah. You think a lot? I think a good amount.

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,360
There must be some if they're spending money on a hand singer. I guess you're right but like

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,720
what how, I just, I guess I'm just curious at what point. Well they're just like you and me.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,480
They just can't hear a fuck. Oh, I guess they're not like you. But what we can hear is the that's I think the hand singers

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,520
For people who come with your plugs. Yeah, that's true

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,120
I don't want to damage my hearing but I want to understand what I'm saying

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah, I fucking love like I was at a I was at a show on Sunday

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,480
There was like there's a car like deer doing a comedy show, but they need those guys at stand-up shows. Yeah. Yeah

46
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
We need somebody we need a sign language

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,240
Like the whenever they sell like earplugs at the bar. It's like a music venue. That's yeah comedy

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,140
Yeah, so it's my favorite thing to do is just go up to the bartender and ask for the earplugs. Yeah favorite thing

49
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,140
It's so funny. Oh

50
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,160
Yes, I just connected the two things yours at first

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
I thought you're just for saying you like to bite your plugs

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, it's funnier than anything they would say on stage yeah, I wear I'd probably wear them when you're up there no you bombing

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,940
Go up there. I'm that much anymore you go up there, and you just eat shit. I said that much anymore

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:11,400
it's being humble being honest okay pretty often but not that much anymore

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,120
there we go I like that that's yeah you know type of honesty you get on this

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,640

- I was so embarrassed, dude.

103
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,780
- It's raining out, you go to an Irish restaurant

104
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,020
to get a shepherd's pie, you eat it by yourself.

105
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,180
- That's exactly what I did.

106
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,220
How did you know?

107
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,740
- I've done that a few times.

108
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,460
- That's how you, if you bomb real bad,

109
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,300
you go eat a full shepherd's pie.

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,120
- This is if anything bad happens.

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,980
- I eat a full shepherd's pie, six glasses of Guinness.

112
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
And then I throw it all up. - Well, that's like

113
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,380
a two glass of it all up.

114
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,900
- 'Cause I have bulimia.

115
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,440
- How do, people pretend that,

116
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,740
people pretend that Guinness is like a tough guy beer.

117
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,740
like 60 calories. It's cuz it's so dark. Yeah it is dark. It's a beer that has like

118
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,420
actual flavor in it so that's why people are like yeah you know. Irish. It's actually the

119
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,820
flavor beer. I'm sipping, I'm drinking a beer slowly because I'm actually in

120
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
control, the alcohol doesn't control me. It comes out of the same fucking thing that the

121
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,700
nitro cold brew at Starbucks comes out of. There's nothing like cool about it.

122
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,980
I don't think I like, you know what, I don't like Guinness that much. Really? Yeah.

123
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,420
crucified yeah I like it with a like a dinner you know I don't care for it's too

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,940
dark yeah what do I want to do I want to look down and think I'm drinking oil

125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,480
speaking yeah if I can't taste it this week a novelty over a glass again I wait

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,580
so if I want so I want to be aware if I have it in a big oil drum I think it's

127
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,060
oil I don't think so I don't want that especially when the drum is closed I

128
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,220
really are as like this weekend that tasted like coffee when after I told you

129
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,500
guys about this. Me and Noah were looking for like apartments and I accidentally

130
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,220
broke into someone's house. Did you just think that they were showing the apartment?

131
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,300
I heard you say you and Noah both said like yeah we

132
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,620
walked into somebody's house but what happened? Yeah, tell the story.

133
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:08,180
We're on the house hunt and I looked at this

134
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,220
website it said like open house this like Sunday the 8th 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. mm-hmm

135
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,820
and I was like oh okay so that must just be like like you can just go in you know

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,820
whatever there's gonna be a realtor there whatever you get the the spiral

137
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,300
sandwich exactly yeah so I we like open the we just buzz the place and we're

138
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,580
just like oh all right we'll just like that probably makes sense the realtor's

139
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,100
probably just like sitting in there waiting fucking people to show up yeah

140
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Probably be like six people in here.

141
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,900
Just talking, walking around asking like, "Oh, what kind of,

142
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,820
does it get optimum or does it get five?"

143
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,300
And then, so we go in, go up like three stairs.

144
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,100
We're like, "Oh yeah, this moving in here will be a bitch.

145
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,300
It's like a three, four walk."

146
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,260
They went up three stairs.

147
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah, I know.

148
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,420
Literally, I was like, "I'm not going to say it."

149
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,140
Really?

150
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,380
Okay.

151
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,260
That's too stupid.

152
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,580
I'm not going to interrupt for that.

153
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,020
Jesus Christ.

154
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,980
The hallway was narrow.

155
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,380
I meant like, I meant that the hallway is narrow, whatever.

156
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,580
and then uh getting the fuck you remember like i almost like trying to move into my

157
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,020
current place like we almost got my neck split by the fucking next couch you were did not almost

158
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,900
ask joe like me and joe almost died six or whatever the laser was cutting down and it went like that

159
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:30,460
on my neck and it's a 20 000 pound couch yeah yeah bad purchase um so we need a new couch we opened

160
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,580
the door to the place and there's like a guy on his phone with his friend just like cooking like a big

161
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,260
sundae dinner and like the kitchen is like right at the door so I like poked my head and I was like

162
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,700
hello he's like what what's going on I was like is this the open house he said no boss that's not

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:10:00,220
here and then just shut the door on me and I was like oh shit oh wait no it's 3L oh my god 3L so

164
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,720
So then I open up 3L. It also unlocked, but it...

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
What the fuck is this apartment building? Everybody's got an unlocked door?

166
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,220
It's also unlocked, but it has like...

167
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,720
There... It's still fully, like...

168
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I love when my door unlocks.

169
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
There's underwear on the person's table and shit.

170
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,220
Like, it was like, there is not an open house here.

171
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,220
I don't know, 'cause it's the right address. I went into the correct place.

172
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,220
But who fucking buzzed me in?

173
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,220
How did I get into this building? It's one of those ones that has like the...

174
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,620
I think most people, if somebody buzzes your number, they just click the yes thing.

175
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Well you shouldn't do that.

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,620
Yeah.

177
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
Cause that's how you get traffic.

178
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,380
That's how you get a guy like Patrick in the house.

179
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,260
And I wanted to eat that guy's Sunday dinner so bad.

180
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,220
You should have just pretended, were you wearing this?

181
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,100
You should have pretended you were like a mechanic or something.

182
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,580
Yeah, I'm here to fix your dinner.

183
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,500
And then you unlock their window.

184
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,980
I'm a personal guy, I'm here to fix your plate.

185
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,060
There's been a leak reported in your dinner and I need to seal it up.

186
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,260
I'm the poison checker. I came here to check your food for poison.

187
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,360
I heard you're making a big Sunday dinner.

188
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,120
I'm from the city. Do you have a license to cook something that fucking delicious?

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,700
Can I see your Sunday gravy license, please?

190
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,940
I need to test your ragu. Was the guy not happy that you broke into his apartment and looked right at him?

191
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
No. And said, "Your house is open."

192
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,980
Well, why is his door unlocked? It was open. It was open. It is technically an open house, man.

193
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,060
I could have

195
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,120
uh... claimed prima nocte

196
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:35,120
is that the one no manifest destiny not the whole guys fucking wife

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,100
i think it that that's a shit set

198
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,280
and i'm here to do pretty much

199
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,720
uh... is the prima nocte time

200
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,520
so you you not you don't want to do it

201
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,940
uh... so what he has been showing that there is a fucking got that mixed up

202
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm gonna go freshen up in the bathroom while you finish your supper.

203
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,080
It's also so funny to be like a not like, this is a prima nocte, the thing is like the

204
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,320
king can do that, right?

205
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Or whatever.

206
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah.

207
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,360
Like just like a random guy, because it's like, yeah, I'm too prima nocte.

208
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
I basically just read about prima nocte.

209
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,600
You don't know this, but I'm the king of this building.

210
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,640
I was just elected your king.

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,360
You got to let me in.

212
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
You should have voted.

213
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Yeah.

214
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Yeah.

215
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
You should have voted, man.

216
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,080
Homeowners association, we meet like three times a week.

217
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,400
And I mean, and also, I mean, while I'm here, I would love that you're tithe.

218
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah.

219
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,200
- You have to tie it, and give me your 10%.

220
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,480
I'll take 10% of that meal.

221
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,920
- 10% of that meal and all your furniture.

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
- If you don't mind me asking,

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,600
what's the deal on your dowry?

224
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
- Yeah, I would walk in, yeah, I'd walk in

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,040
and I would just take books and stuff off their shelves.

226
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,360
I'd be like, oh, and I want this painting.

227
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm not gonna take your money.

228
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm not that kind of king.

229
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,400
- I'm just gonna take your wife.

230
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
- I'm not gonna take your wife

231
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,400
and a few tasteful pieces of decor.

232
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,840
- Hey, shut up, I'm just doing prima nocte.

233
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,400
- I'm gonna look through your DVDs and see what's good.

234
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah, you don't want me to put sanctions on you, do you?

235
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
Because I'm not opposed to it.

236
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
Do you have DVDs or do you have Blu-rays?

237
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
I have both.

238
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
I don't have any physical media.

239
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,280
I was asking this guy.

240
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, you're still talking to this guy.

241
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,120
Okay, well, I was gonna tell him the guy.

242
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I have both.

243
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
Oh, yeah, that works.

244
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,980
Yeah.

245
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,920
Yeah, I am not looking forward

246
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,200
to trying to find a new apartment here.

247
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
'Cause the one thing I do love

248
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,560
about looking for apartments here,

249
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,320
you're not, it's not x-ray.

250
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,520
How many times do we have to go over this?

251
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,360
You can't, you will not--

252
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,200
- Let me try though.

253
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,020
- No matter how many times you put--

254
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,860
- We know this way, Caleb.

255
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,680
- I have a green shirt on and it's green screened out.

256
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,320
No matter how many times you put your hand behind my--

257
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,880
- Oh, my hand is disappearing behind it.

258
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,000
Wait, go back to the other camera.

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,680
- You will not see your hand behind my body.

260
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,280
- Go back to the other camera.

261
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,120
- You are so stupid.

262
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
- No, the other one.

263
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,160
The third one.

264
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,980
- Wait, no, the other one.

265
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,820
Yeah, this one.

266
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,160
- My hand is disappearing behind him.

267
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,600
No, not this one.

268
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,760
No, okay, go back to the other one.

269
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
No, the other one.

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,440
- This is not good radio.

271
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,240
horrible because you won't switch to the one I want. You're giving up. I love when

272
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,280
you're looking... I've been looking at some apartments just casually, you know. I think

273
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,200
I'm a month to month, so I can move whenever. But I love when the real estate company comes

274
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,400
in to take the nice real estate photos and whoever lives there is clearly a piece of shit drug addict

275
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,640
and didn't clean anything. So it's like this beautiful big panoramic picture, but there's

276
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,440
a box of doughnuts and shit open, there's pizza everywhere.

277
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Yeah, there's a pink couch there.

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
They're all running around.

279
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I hate that, dude.

280
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
When it's a photo of the living room couch

281
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
for a new apartment.

282
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
And Bart's there.

283
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
It starts off as a single cell organism

284
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
that goes through all of evolution and then all of a sudden

285
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
they're sitting on the couch.

286
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
If I were a realtor, I would take the pictures

287
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I would photoshop Bart in.

288
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
That'd be funny.

289
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,860
That would be the funny realtor.

290
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,400
This could be an apartment for a Bart.

291
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,240
Mm-hmm.

292
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,200
You could say, or Bart for scale.

293
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,040
Yeah.

294
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,860
You know?

295
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,700
Make him this big?

296
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
(laughing)

297
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,360
Yeah, he's a big--

298
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
This place is huge!

299
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,380
He's a centimeter tall.

300
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,400
Bart for scale.

301
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,680
'Cause nobody knows how big Bart is.

302
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,120
So if a place is really small,

304
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,980
you put Bart, pretend he's like five something, right?

305
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,740
And you like, or you put him like that kind of scale,

306
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,360
even though it's a six foot ceiling.

307
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah.

308
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
And then all of a sudden,

309
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,860
you're selling it.

310
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Bart is 6'2". No he's not. He's 6'2" on the show. They're all giants on the show.

311
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,940
They're fucking not. Speaking of ceilings, my landlord has not fixed, there's three

312
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,100
holes in my ceiling from water damage. Bullet holes! He's ignoring my calls.

313
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,380
So Rupert, if you're listening, something very bad is gonna happen to you.

314
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:36,300
Allegedly. Allegedly? You're gonna hurt your landlord? Allegedly I will.

315
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,100
because my best friend Alex is upstairs right now he's got water in his room

316
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,140
from all the holes in his ceiling and he's not answering the call so you're

317
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm gonna harm you allegedly and we why do you have holes in the

318
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,540
doing a character saying this yeah we're gonna be one of the most nothing things

319
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,300
you've ever said is that you're gonna hurt your landlord no I'm not gonna do

320
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,600
that oh okay all right you know I watched a bunch this weekend man I had a

321
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
my battery because I watch it. I I got really laughing at

322
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,560
it's a normal thing to say to your friend if they ask what they're what you

323
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
if you want to know what he

324
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,840
roasting

325
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,560
you're roasting the way he says on peanut butter baby. It's baby butter

326
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,040
baby says ah you said butter baby baby butter baby baby butter baby butter

327
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
baby. I watch a bunch of

328
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,040
now i think it's funny uh... i watch a bunch of videos this weekend the first

329
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,360
time of people uh...

330
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,160
shooting at each other

331
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,280
yet yeah i found a bunch of videos of people should each other

332
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
as a couple

333
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,960
something so interested in what i have to say i hate you leaning over like this

334
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,120
no stop it's not a good sound

335
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,760
you sound like a whole some kind of bovine now you're roasting

336
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,320
i said you sound like one of the uh... old no i'd love some roasted bovine

337
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,560
right now. Oh my god! Roasted bovine is good. I've been watching these videos of

338
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,920
people, there's all these videos where people like security camera footage of

339
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,480
people getting in gunfights and stuff. I was having the time of my life dude. Yeah.

340
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,240
Because it's videos where guys sit there at gas stations like 90% of them. They're

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,920
guys who are sitting there pumping gas and then they see, it's always in the

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,160
south, and they see like a guy they don't like and they pull out the biggest most

343
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,320
illegal gun you've ever seen in your fucking life. They shoot 500 bullets and

344
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,840
and they hit nothing, and then that's the end of the video.

345
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,880
But then I saw one where the people actually get hit

346
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,800
and they die.

347
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,760
- Yeah, that's not fun.

348
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,160
- That's not nearly as funny.

349
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,600
- Yeah. - You see the one--

350
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,840
- Why do people like those videos?

351
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
And then I told Noah about it,

352
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
and Noah's like, "You gotta watch this one."

353
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
And he sent me one of a guy

354
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,160
just getting his fucking head blown off,

355
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,680
and he's like, "Isn't that cool?"

356
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,320
Like, no! - Goddammit.

357
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,040
- Why do people like those videos?

358
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
- I'm gonna move in with him,

359
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,880
he's gonna be playing that on the fucking living room TV.

360
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,240
- Dude, he sent me one, it was like a guy,

361
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,480
like two it's like neighbors these two neighbors and they're getting in an

362
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,880
argument the guy's like fuck you neighbor man you fucking suck and they

363
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,520
guy what he's like fuck you and his wife's Aaron she's like fuck you too and

364
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,760
then the guy's like oh fuck me and then he kills both of them instantly whoa I

365
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,480
don't know if it's it's a snowy yeah old that they are on yeah yeah I saw one

366
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,440
anything girl he like executes the lady and I was like why then he goes back in

367
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,480
his house and he shot himself. So you've seen it? Yeah. And why are you not

368
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:35,320
like scarred? I am. It's scary. He's damaged. Do you know how damaged my ass is? Can you

369
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,040
imagine how terrifying it is to fucking die? Yeah. It's probably peaceful. Did you see the one

370
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,400
the one that everyone uh what's his name that guy Matt Walsh posted it and was

371
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,920
like there needs to be uh there needs to be like they need to be more lenient

372
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,440
when good guys kill bad guys and it's like a video of a dude just like unloading

373
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,120
a full clip onto it like a dude's just like waving a gun around in a restaurant and then

374
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,880
he like shoots it after the guy like he kicks his gun away and then like shoots him like

375
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,440
six more times it's just like oh this guy is like yeah that's like every good guy with

376
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,800
a gun is just a guy waiting to like kill somebody. I have such a good idea for a conservative

377
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,600
comedy sketch. What's that? Luke Skywalker. Holy crap I'm already in. Luke Skywalker he's

378
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:22,100
in a he's getting shot at by a stormtrooper he deflects the bullets runs up cuts off the

379
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:30,460
stormtroopers head liberal cops show up handcuffs oh my god right we need to get a

380
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,260
conservative daily wire sketch what if that's a great fucking idea

381
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,980
where I was going with that good I think I just got upset watching that here's

382
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,540
another one that you could do is they come out with a new Star Wars movie yeah

383
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,260
yeah and it's a guy you know it is a guy he sits on his knees and he prays a God

384
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,340
right? He's a real religious guy. He's a religious nerd. He prays to God

385
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,780
and he says, "Please let them make a new Star Wars movie." He goes to the movie and

386
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,980
they got Mark Hamill in a fucking wig, right? And he's got fake breasts and all

387
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,460
of a sudden he's some Luke... what's a girl version of Luke?

388
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,980
Luciana Sky... not a guy washer. Sky shopper. Yeah, Sky shopper.

389
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:19,220
that's good and he's a girl shopper and then so and yeah basically disney's

390
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,860
gone. Oh here's another one. Okay,

391
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:32,140
yoda oh shit. Yoda is teaching a class a college class. Oh fuck me. He's like

392
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,700
the force works this way, but it says it written reverse. This way the force

393
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,620
works. Yeah, I couldn't think of that that or he could say like and then okay

394
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,220
and then a young yoda girl. Oh God, college age yoda girl, smooth with a

395
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,720
nose piercing nose piercing.

396
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,720
And she says she says

397
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,720
don't think force works that way, but in reverse. Oh fuck me. Or maybe not

398
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,720
don't think that force works that forward.

399
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,020
That's a good point.

400
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,420
But yeah, well, maybe she's okay.

401
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Maybe she's actually like me for force works that way.

402
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:15,100
it actually doesn't. Oh, that's good. And then Yoda's like, "Oh, me know lots about

403
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,420
force." That's how Yoda talks. And then, and then, handcuffs. Yeah. Oh, I was gonna

404
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,700
say. They say, "You tried to Yoda-splain." I thought this is gonna be a different,

405
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,860
well, first of all, imagine that video, "Good Guy with the Gun" video, where it's

406
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,380
the guy who's waving the gun around the restaurant, and then he comes up with a

407
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,220
lightsaber and just does that, right? Uh-huh. That's the, that, that video. That's good.

408
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,440
this one yeah Yoda is teaching its atheist professor Yoda oh fuck me oh no

409
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,580
and he's teaching his class he says real God is not I was yeah - yeah one brave

410
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:55,660
marine normal just why you are he stands up and he says real God is yeah and then

411
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:05,420
now that yeah yeah yeah he has head pops off and coins go everywhere exactly yeah

412
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,300
yeah maybe there could be one where all the liberals move to Tatooine and it

413
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,020
gets expensive to live there. See we do need that. They have

414
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:21,600
I want blue milk in my latte. And they open a coffee shop called Jawa Java. Oh my god.

415
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,260
They want blue milk. I can't have blue milk I can only have oat milk.

416
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,840
Droid milk. They would like droid milk. They probably think I'm a droid.

417
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah, oh my god, don't even tell me that my son would say that to me man. That would make

418
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:45,340
Yeah, well that's another just that's him also being a complete SJW you call me mom

419
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,520
My son is an SJW

420
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,660
But yeah, we would do so good at a conservative Star Wars

421
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,760
We need a conservative SNL dude. Yep. That's what we need. We need oh my god. Wait, wait, wait

422
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,200
This is it's the whole United States or genders. No, he's saying no. No, no, no, where is a conservative here?

423
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
He's in more

424
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
Fun of it. I have a really I have a really good one. I have a really good one

425
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,360
So the Mandalorian, okay, it's the Mandalorian. It's the scene where he takes his helmet off

426
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,840
Yeah, he's like dying and he takes his helmet off and then this this blue-haired lady with a piercing with piercings all over

427
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:34,000
tattoos up the neck gang tattoos shit gang tattoos yeah and she said and she

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,160
the second his helmet comes up she says put that helmet back on haven't you

429
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,040
heard about Darth Kovid oh my fucking god fuck oh my god is incredible that's the

430
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,560
thing about a lot of these people who wear masks you know who else wore masks

431
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,840
and then she's like this and she kills a line of babies yep here's here's what I

432
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,920
Yeah, we could do a whole we could do a whole thing. It's a it's a

433
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,840
Bakery a conservative normal conservative bakery that fucking won't make a gay wedding cake

434
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,740
Yeah, and then people are coming in and they're asking for gay wedding cakes and they all have masks on but they have like Jason

435
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,740
Voorhees masks or like

436
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,040
Mask like Jim Carrey mask on right? Yeah, what's that one? Maybe?

437
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,840
Yeah, man Halloween every other year take your mask off inside the store Halloween this year keep the mask on or you're going to jail

438
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,680
- Yeah. - Yeah.

439
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,760
- What the hell's going on there, man?

440
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

441
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,420
- It's like some kind of-- - And we're recording--

442
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,260
- It's like we went into an opposite world.

443
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,100
- This is 2020 right now,

444
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,600
and we're recording it in 2020.

445
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,680
- I think that Star Wars in 2020,

446
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,520
or was a long time ago, 2020 BC.

447
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
- Yeah, 2020 BC. - We could do--

448
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,240
- Yeah. - Way, a long time ago.

449
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,240
- We could do all sorts of conservative SNL stuff, I think.

450
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,880
- But mostly Star Wars. - I think that'd be really good.

451
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,720
We could do straight Stefan.

452
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,640
- I think it's just gonna be Star Wars.

453
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,040
- We could do an entirely straight Stefan,

454
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,880
where he talks about-- - I think Stefan

455
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,720
would not change in conservative--

456
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
No.

457
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
He might be right.

458
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,840
No, no, we would do straight Stefan and he'd be talking about different Dick's sporting

459
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
goods he went to.

460
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,880
He'd be like, "They had footballs and they had basketballs and they had basketballs,

461
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,440
footballs, and they had a golf ball and a golf club and they had swimming trunks that

462
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
were really long.

463
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,200
They went past your knees over there."

464
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
And I ate lunch and I ate dinner.

465
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
I didn't eat breakfast.

466
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
And then I ate lunch.

467
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
"I don't eat breakfast.

468
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm doing intermittent fasting and I'm on the carnivore diet and I only eat honey, dairy,

469
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,960
meat and we go God that's some funny fucking conservative that's funny it's

470
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,000
true yeah can I do another Star Wars one a really short one yeah so it's Darth

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Maul okay and he has his double lightsaber but he's like he has the two

472
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,440
but he's like rubbing them together and he's going like oh okay gay I didn't

473
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,040
know what I didn't know where this was going until you said he was gay and then

474
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,840
I thought it was fucking hilarious we did but I feel like that there yes still

475
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,640
one's the face tattoos too. Yeah. Cause those gay guys have facial gay gang tattoos.

476
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,820
All gay guys have face tattoos. Gay facial gang tattoos like nowadays people have.

477
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,600
We can do conservative good neighbor too. We'd be kind of a bad neighbor. I guess

478
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,320
it's just the opposite. Bad neighbor. And we'd do... Better neighbor. Better neighbor.

479
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,280
Yeah. Oh good homeowner. That's yeah. That is good. Good homeowner. Because you know

480
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,520
when they're saying good neighbor they're talking about an apartment building. Yep.

481
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,900
in some left away country.

482
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
- For sure, for sure.

483
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,280
- But we would be good homeowner

484
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,200
and there would be, what's a good neighbor sketch?

485
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,720
- Could do like Kyle interviews where he's talking normal.

486
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
- One of those ones where he smokes weed

487
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,440
but he's just smoking cigarettes and normal tobacco.

488
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,360
- Well that's just Chris.

489
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,640
- Yeah, he might be right.

490
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,120
- I think they covered all the bases there.

491
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,960
- Damn.

492
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
- God damn it, wait maybe they're already conservative.

493
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,000
- They are conservative.

494
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,160
- Crypto-conservatives.

495
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,640
God bless you good neighbor.

496
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,480
- Boys after a couple of good old boys.

497
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,720
- Yep, weekend update we could do.

498
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
Oh, that would be a really easy to put a conservative spin on.

499
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Work week update.

500
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
Yeah.

501
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Right?

502
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
And they'd be doing, what kind of stuff they'd be doing?

503
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
This week, liberals are taking an extra lunch break.

504
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,280
Yep.

505
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
During the day.

506
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Yep.

507
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,080
Blow that smoke off your mic, that was heat.

508
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,640
Oh my god.

509
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Meanwhile, conservatives work the whole day through, nine to seven.

510
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
Yep.

511
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,640
Five days a week.

512
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,080
It all has to be about work weeks.

513
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Oh yeah, fuck.

514
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,420
I fucked all my jokes up so the Dow

515
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:20,180
Actually makes a bunch of money. It makes everyone extremely happy. You know what I would love

516
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:27,060
The liberals are more concerned with the cow as they are Hindu. I guess this is just kind of Dennis Miller kind of stuff, huh?

517
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,600
Yeah, but it's about work weeks. Oh, you're right

518
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,160
You know what I would love to do what I would love to get on there at some point is having

519
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:40,560
Maybe a liberal could say something stupid and then the conservative could say you are the weakest link

520
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,060
think no, he could be like say brainless. That's good. Yeah, I really like that

521
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,920
term right yeah is being like say brainless. You really think that there's

522
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,000
a fucking sixty thousand genders yeah. I have a good joke a good one. That's all

523
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,760
about work weeks. All right conservatives are often seen working a nine to five

524
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,520
job. I'd like to see a liberal live to ninety five. That's all the drugs and

525
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,580
smoking and drink it and well drinking is okay. All the drugs and smoking is okay

526
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh the drugs. Yeah. Speaking of drinking, I have something I promised I was gonna do.

527
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,720
Wait I have a joke. Okay do your joke, I'll pull it out. So this week I worked 40 hours

528
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,720
because I'm a conservative Republican. Meanwhile a Democrat family walked into

529
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,600
a liquor store and said that's that 40s hours. Yes. Of malt liquor and then they

530
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,640
sat around with no job. Yeah and my job, I'm a mall clicker. Yep. A mall clicker? I'm a

531
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,800
full-time, I'm a mall clicker. Get a real job like working Amazon Mturk on your

532
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:50,000
netbook like I do. Yeah. As a conservative. Or being a mall clicker. Or being a

533
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,760
clicker at a mall, whatever that could possibly mean. Is that like a clicker of

534
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,440
like you like how many people go into the mall? It's a mall clicker.

535
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,960
it's obvious. All right, what do you have here? I have, I found this on the on the way over here.

536
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,960
New energy drink called Blue Magic. It looks like an old energy drink. Can I hold it up to the camera?

537
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah, hold it up. Yeah, let me actually check, speaking of that, let me check the expiration

538
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,040
date on this. You're drinking it regardless. Yeah, it expired in 2022. You're gonna drink that no

539
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,120
matter what. All the way in 2022? That was almost a few days ago. Yeah, just October 2022. That's

540
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,960
That's not too bad.

541
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,800
- That's really not that long ago.

542
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,240
- And this is a whiskey flavored,

543
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,200
non-alcoholic energy drink.

544
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,040
- Uh-huh.

545
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,880
- So.

546
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,320
- It's called Blue Magic.

547
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,920
- Blue Magic, and look at this logo.

548
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
- The L-U.

549
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,600
- Of two dragons fucking.

550
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,440
- I don't think it's, I think it's a double-headed dragon,

551
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,320
like dragon tails, two heads are better than one.

552
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,160
- I think they could be fucking.

553
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,360
- They are having sex.

554
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,780
- What's wrong with you two?

555
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,040
You think every brother and sister--

556
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,120
- Look at the expression of the one on the top.

557
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
- The one has its tongue out.

558
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
- He's going like this.

559
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,840
- Yeah, and the other one has its tongue out.

560
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,280
I think that you two are reading into this a little much.

561
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,120
I think we'll all take a look and we'll all take a sip.

562
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,400
It says best served chilled.

563
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm going to let you take a sip first and depending on your facial reaction, I may or

564
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,400
may not take a sip.

565
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,720
It certainly smells like whiskey.

566
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Does it have legs?

567
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,960
Does it actually smell like whiskey?

568
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Yeah, we need like a...

569
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
I don't know what that means.

570
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,560
Legs is when you put it in the glass and then it like, when it trickles down.

571
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Does it have legs?

572
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I don't have a glass to put it in.

573
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,640
that have what's one of those what's one of those little things you put

574
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,920
definitely smells it definitely smells like whiskey and by that I mean some

575
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,120
kind of gasoline I don't think it smells like whiskey gasoline and by that I mean

576
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,480
some kind of gasoline what are you eight years old smells like it smells like an

577
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,240
energy drink for the most I definitely can I can I detect a hint yeah of maybe

578
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,440
the smallest whiskey smell but I think it mostly smells like an energy drink

579
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,600
that matters the most here is the taste yeah which I would say with most things

580
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,800
that you taste yeah does it taste like

581
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,760
whiskey because it could be whiskey

582
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,240
flavor but also not have like can you

583
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
stop fucking running your mouth all

584
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,720
there goes yeah it does taste like

585
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
whiskey really yeah that tastes like if

586
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,440
you've got like a whiskey red bull at a

587
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,080
bar read the ingredients before I do

588
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
this yeah whiskey and third one is

589
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,480
carbon dioxide what I was I was reading

590
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,160

591
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,120

592
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120

593
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,920
I just a little ingredient sidebar something funny. I saw on an ingredients.

594
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,160
I was I read the ingredients of a sour patch kids bag and the first ingredient

595
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,400
is sugar as you can guess. Oh, you know what the second ingredient was bloody

596
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,240
tell me it was inverted sugar. Oh, I've seen I've heard of that reverse sugar.

597
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,840
Yeah, is that the sugar that's on the outside?

598
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
It's simple syrup.

599
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,080
All right, here I go.

600
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,640
It's my turn to try this weird drink.

601
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,020
Okay, go ahead.

602
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,960
It doesn't taste like whiskey.

603
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,200
It tastes a little bit like a whiskey ginger.

604
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
It tastes like some kind of berry.

605
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
Yeah.

606
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah.

607
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
I mean, it's not bad.

608
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I kind of like it.

609
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
It's all right.

610
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Now you have to try.

611
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200

Look at my green shirt. I see Joe McHale right through me. God I wish I was like him.

620
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,260
Yeah this is just an energy drink. Well it's whiskey flavor. I don't think it really has a flavor.

621
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,300
Yeah it's not it's whiskey flavor and it's distributed in the Bronx. It was

649
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,480

- Yeah.

651
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,720
- It looks beautiful.

652
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,200
Who wants to go first with their crib?

653
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,040
Patrick, you wanna show your crib off?

654
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,980

Yeah. These style of buildings are actually some of the most affordable and

664
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
actually most goaded.

Before you go through it yeah, you probably have to walk around fucking fine trying to

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,840
I want to go through this door, but it's too dry. Yeah. Yeah, that's right, but I'll go in anyway

737
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:16,840

741
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,460
And I've been into fapping lately.

742
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,460
Really?

743
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,760
This is supposed to be an auto play.

744
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,760
I've been over...

745
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,600
I mean, not to ruin the bit.

746
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
What is this?

747
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,780
Harry Potter, Gryffindor ambiance?

748
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,080
This is in my secret room.

749
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,400
Wow, it's kind of sick.

750
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,880
It is cool.

751
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Yeah.

So y'all, fapping or sexy times?

It's going to be fucking fapping for me.

754
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,640
I've been into fapping lately.

755
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,360
I really like fapping a lot more.

756
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Yeah.

757
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
What do you guys like to...

758
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
Fapping to a naughty video.

759
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Do you guys like to fap to...

760
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,720
You guys like to fap to NSFW stuff or more people going wild?

761
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
I do like NSFW.

762
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,720
I like NSFW OC.

763
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Oh yeah, that's good.

764
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,600
It's not made by some fucking trillion dollar studio like MCU style.

765
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Yeah, for sure.

766
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,160
MCU style naughty videos.

767
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,560
I hate naughty videos.

768
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,760
Naughty photos on the other hand.

769
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,600
Naughty gifs I quite like.

770
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
I do like.

771
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,040
I love a naughty gif.

772
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,200
to a naughty gif. That's right. Here's another part of my room. Here's the thing, I hate

773
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,540
when you're watching a porn, the gifs are the best because there's no sound. Sometimes

774
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,140
you're watching a naughty video and the girl's like "a naughty video" and you're saying,

775
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,420
you're talking to the video, "oh behave video" and then the girl sounds like fucking Gilbert

776
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,300
Gottfried or some shit, kills my boner. "PUT YOUR PENIS IN MY ASS!" Yeah, and I'm going

777
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,460
- And then, "Sound off, please," and a gif.

778
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,540
- I want you to fuck my butt!

779
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,920
- I'm watching a gif, and I see the girl mouthing.

780
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,760
- Yes.

781
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,460
- Those upstairs are gonna hear that.

782
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,740
- Yeah, they're gonna be like,

783
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,060
"Gilbert Gottfried's downstairs getting fucked."

784
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,900
- He's alive!

785
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,740
He's alive!

786
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,560
- Fucking fucked, holy shit.

787
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,740
- He's punching the ass so bad.

788
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,620
- I see the girl mouthing, and I'm doing my own voice.

789
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,860
I'm going like, "Oh yeah, put it in my ass."

790
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,700
- Wait, why?

791
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,020
- So it sounds sexy.

792
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,580
- You sit on the, you're telling me,

793
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,380
you sit on the toilet seat.

794
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,220
- Yeah, or on the--

795
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:27,400
and you walk or on the my pillow on the floor on the my pillow on my pillow on

796
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,180
the floor. What's your favorite place in your house to fap? I really closet. I

797
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,840
like to fap with my back against the front door so no one could come home.

798
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,740
Yeah, I get it. See me. That is good. I was talking to somebody about this

799
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:44,940
share under the doorknob and I sit in the chair and I fap really hard and it

800
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:51,940
makes the chair go "Eek! Eek! Eek!" Everyone in the lobby of my building can hear it.

801
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,940
Everyone can hear it just going "Oh, oh no."

802
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:01,940
And when the chair breaks, they just hear the sound of like a Jenga tower falling down every day.

803
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,940
I keep breaking chairs by leaving the door.

804
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,940
And then I just hear like a clattering noise of me going "Oh!"

805
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:11,940
"What the hell's going on up there?" "I'm a stuntman and I'm practicing."

806
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,940
I'm practicing on my fucking clothes. I'm not fapping. I was talking to somebody about this the other day.

807
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Somebody told me that they were at their parents' house and they were fapping,

808
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,940
and they were like, but their door doesn't have a lock on it over Christmas.

809
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,940
They were fapping. Getting caught as a grown man.

810
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,940
And they were just saying like, "Yeah, it sucks. I'm worried about getting caught by your mom or your grandma or whatever."

811
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,940
And I was saying about, do you think it's worse to get caught masturbating completely,

812
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,940
just like in the middle, masturbating, you had no idea they were coming?

813
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,620
or is it worse to like hide it or something but for whatever reason you

814
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,380
can't hide that you have like a huge boner and so your mom walks in it just

815
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:51,940
looks like you're sitting there watching TV with a boner hmm probably jacking it

816
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:58,220

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:03,620

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,260

You can't miss it, it's got giant impact font

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,680
that floats above it that says,

850
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,640
"The perfect house doesn't exist, dot, dot, dot."

851
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,080
As you can see, it's about 50% house, 50% garage.

852
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,120
- Yeah, we're about in the way to see that garage, Pat.

853
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,060
- I am a bit of a car guy, okay?

854
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,360

855
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,200

00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,240

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,260

looks like we interrupted

863
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,440
interrupted Jim Norton

864
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
he's just sitting right there at the entrance

865
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,600

00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:39,020
this is where i do all sorts of stuff on watching adam regis you know i'm

871
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:46,760
I'm watching Kenji, I'm watching Joshua Weissman on a loop, on mute.

872
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,220
This was the big feature when I talked to the architect.

873
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,500
I said, "Here's what I want.

874
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,980
I want a one-to-one recreation of the guys' grocery game set directly in my kitchen, and

875
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,700
I want competitors running around doing their thing.

876
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,220
Let's check on one of those competitors.

877
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Press next for me."

878
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,820
Oh my God, it's Jim Norton again.

879
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,820
What's he making?

880
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,900
He's making scrambled eggs.

881
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,780
I can't wait to have those.

882
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,600
Oh my god, I'm hungry for some scrambled eggs.

883
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,740
- You can't really see very well,

884
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,260
but they look really good right here.

885
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,420
- They look delicious.

886
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,900
- Look at how good those eggs look.

887
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,100
- They're still in the shell.

888
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,940
That's a--

889
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,780
- They're probably scrambled inside though.

890
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,600
- He likes them rare.

891
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,780
Here's my bathroom.

892
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,620
- Oh, this is fire.

893
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,300
- This is a fire-ass bathroom, is it not?

894
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,140
- Good bathroom.

895
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:26,980
- So here's what I like.

896
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,060
I have only a urinal.

897
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,420
I put my turds in it too.

898
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,180
I just thought, I was like, you know how I always wanted it?

899
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,420
It was a fucking urinal.

900
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,780
Everything's mechanic themed.

901
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:41,900
got the old mechanic newspapers on the wall we have that that soap that Patrick

902
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,100
got for the office for some reason that washes off the oil which by the way I

903
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,820
would like to why the hell did you get a fucking five gallon thing of that of

904
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,620
mechanic soap okay at the time it didn't make sense but then we started building

905
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,700
a set in here and you're getting paint on your hands all the time don't slap

906
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,940
this like that was a great point it was a good I didn't ask did it work out I

907
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,900
I asked why did you get it in the first place?

908
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,460
- Because when I lived in the dorms in community college,

909
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,940
my roommate had it, because my roommates were--

910
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,100
- He was an oil man.

911
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,380
- They were both mechanics.

912
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,220
- Oh, okay.

913
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,060
- And they were like, "I like this."

914
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,020
- And I liked, yeah, it made my hands real.

915
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,220
If you don't do a day's work and you use that shit,

916
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,320
that pumice stone makes your hands soft.

917
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,660
- Hmm, I don't like it 'cause it smells like nothing.

918
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,180
So we're in the bathroom.

919
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,020
Go ahead and click next.

920
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,500
Oh my God, wait, Jim! - Jim!

921
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,260

930
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,020
anything in my mouth. You're so gullible. Again, I like to keep that whole...

931
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:13,180
I like to keep that whole kind of car theme moving throughout the whole house, right?

932
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:18,220
Yeah. Cars are cool. They're fucking badass, no? I love all sorts of cars.

933
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,340
Cars is dope. Mitsubishi Eclipse.

934
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,460
That thing is badass. Toyota, Honda, Ford, Volkswagen.

935
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,500
I was about to say Toyota.

936
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,140
Toyota, Honda, that's true. They can be...

937
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,940
They make that.

938
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,420
That's a real car.

939
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,340
They make that for rich guys. Autobots, Decepticons, Predacons.

940
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:37,100
Yeah, me and Cameron saw a Decepticon or Autobot on the way over here.

941
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,600
For real?

942
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:43,580
Did you know that Autobots are in like 2002 Ford Fusions now?

943
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,080
Really?

944
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,940
It's fucking crazy.

945
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,700
It was a Jetta.

946
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,140
Or a Jetta, that's what it was.

947
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,420
And it was so dirty.

948
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,160
It was covered in dirt.

949
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,380
It was the dirtiest car I've ever seen.

950
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,580
Probably from fighting a Decepticon.

951
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,500
Yeah, probably.

952
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,860
That was a Beets Pill or something.

953
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,060
It was probably from the Beast Wars.

954
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,060
Yeah, it had to have been.

955
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:56,560
Yeah.

956
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,700
So let's keep going. As you can see, I have some awesome ass art that I hung up in my place.

957
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,860
This one says "Heavy Metals" and we got "Feh, Peh, Beh, and Zin."

958
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,460
Oh, that's our initials. You got a friendship painting?

959
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:09,960
Yeah.

960
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
My initial is "Zain."

961
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,300
Fetter, Patrick Bourne, and...

962
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,060
Zain.

963
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,100
Zain.

964
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,460
That'd be a cool new name for me.

965
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,260
Yeah, it would be good.

966
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:18,760
Zain Caleb.

967
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,260
Zain.

968
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,100
Zain.

969
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
That'd be my alternative ego.

970
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,960
That could be good.

971
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,700
Zain.

972
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,300
Zain.

973
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,820
I got more art though.

974
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:28,700
This is a beautiful portrait of a beautiful mind.

975
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,180
This is Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

976
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,220
This is him thinking about,

1021
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,900
gangsta. God damn it, Chip Chipperson, he keeps sneaking into my house.

1022
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:02,580
It's been a serious problem. Luckily, press next. Luckily, my security guard's

I have one in there. That's what I lock up. That's the number one, yeah.

1026
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,540
When I become a millionaire, dude, I'm putting a teacher's lounge.

1027
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,540
I was never allowed in there in school.

1028
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,740
Yeah, a teacher's lounge where teachers aren't allowed.

1029
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,740
Yeah, exactly.

1030
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,740
The teacher's not allowed.

1031
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,940
Oh my god, a nightclub that's called the teacher's lounge.

1032
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,340
That would be fucking badass.

1033
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,540
But basically, yo, that's my crib.

1034
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,740
So I'm going to have my security guard kick your ass out.

00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,540
They finish with peace.

1041
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,740

00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:04,740
No, yeah, you I don't want chip. Hey, if you want that bastard vagrant chip chipperson in your house, you can fucking have him

1054
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,080
- I guess.

1055
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,900
- You're some kind of house master?

1056
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:16,740
- I'm the house master.

1057
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,800

All right, so this is my crib.

1060
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,640
- Cameron, this looks like a fucking laboratory.

1061
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,520
- Looks like an outhouse, man.

1062
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,360
- Well, this is just the outside of my house.

1063
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,320
- Okay.

1064
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,080
- And I think you're gonna be surprised

1065
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,080
when you step inside.

1066
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,920
Let's go to the next slide here.

1067
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,960
Because, and let's move into my foyer.

1068
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,400
- You have a foyer?

1069
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,040
Let's move into my foyer, please. There it is.

1070
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh, wow.

1071
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,040
Wow.

1072
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
So...

1073
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,040
It's so spacious in here.

1074
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,040
Umbrella Corporation vibe.

1075
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,960
It's actually really, really spacious, and there's a lot of

1076
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,080
doors that go into different dimensions.

1077
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
Yeah, so it's a long, long...

1078
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,840
It's like a nightmare before Christmas.

1079
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,900
That's scary. There's a long, long hallway with tons of gray

1080
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,000
doors everywhere, fluorescent lights. It's kind of a, I would

1081
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,800
say, neo-brutalist style.

1082
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,600
Yeah, so I'm really into architecture and style.

1083
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,280
Neo, I think I learned from Neo-Nazis or the Matrix, and then

1084
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:12,080
list I think that's a Skyrim thing. How did you learn that from

1085
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:18,520
Neo-Nazis? What do you mean? The word Neo? You were hanging out with them? No. He was

1086

That's just Marcus, bro.

1120
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,080
You guys are focusing way too much on the people.

1121
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,320
- No, I'm focused on these watermarks.

1122
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,200

Okay, well, I don't really care about that because your house is over.

We're going to head to the dining room.

00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,080
This is where you take the food from the kitchen.

1137
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,080

00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Oh, that's Brick.

1141
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,560
Well, he's just one of my roommates, don't worry about him.

1142
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
Brick, what the hell are you eating?

1143
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,960
He's a hunger guy, he likes strawberries, he likes bread.

1144
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,560
Looks like he's eating half a cantaloupe.

1145
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,920
Yeah, he likes cantaloupe too.

1146
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:48,920
I love that Henley.

1147
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,720
Yeah, and look at his collar.

1148
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
I mean, wow.

1149
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,720
Oh my god.

1150
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
That's just Brick, don't mind him.

1151
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,780
I mean watermarks around the fucking house dude. You got a dole be stock you are

1152
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:03,260
We go like that you were so money, and you don't even fucking know it now

1153
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:08,140
So I do want if brick if you could just move out of the way which it seems like he's kind of he's kind of

1154
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,580
Just staring us down. I do might be a little he's might be a little confused that you guys are in here

1155
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,260
So I'm not drinking from this French press straight

1156
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,140
It's a little blurry because it looks like maybe the cameras focusing on brick

1157
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,220
But you can see all my utensils in the back in the background. It's a French press a mocha pot

1158
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:26,500
Oh, fuck um and you can see my shelf. Oh, well, you can't see my shelf, but there's a lot of utensils. Yeah

1159
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,500
I know this background. I'll say I'll say your diner or your kitchen looks lit. Yeah. What is my dining room?

1160
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,900
I'm Johnny room looks lit. Well, you said kitchen for yeah, I know well I get confused sometimes

1161
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,020
I get all my house get off of bricks breast

1162
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:42,300
Get off of his breast right now Patrick stop licking brick. This is his house

1163
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,860
You're walking into his house being so fucking disrespectful actually nasty to him. All right, you'll want to see where I sleep

1164
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:47,860
Oh, for shizzle.

1165
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,860
Bedroom's up next.

1166
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,860
Damn, who's this?

1167
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,700
Who are these for?

1168
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,700
That's the family.

1169
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,700
The Smith family.

1170
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,500
Is this where the magic happens for them?

1171
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,500
No, that's where they sleep.

1172
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
Oh my god, wait, are you fucking this whole family?

1173
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
No!

1174
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
They make magic two times, look at that.

1175
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,620
They sleep during the day and I sleep at night.

1176
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,720
What do they do during night?

1177
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,720
They get up.

1178
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,720
And roam?

1179
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,720
And go around.

1180
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,720
They go to work.

1181
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,060
Even the kids, they go to night school?

1182
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,060
Yeah.

1183
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,060
Oh god.

1184
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,420
There's a vampire family or some shit?

1185
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,700
But, you know, I guess it's kind of annoying that they're sleeping here right now because

1186
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,540
I wanted to show you guys some other parts of the bedroom.

1187
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,860
I mean, I want to see there.

1188
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,860
There's not even a single.

1189
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,820
I guess this must be the Smith's room because there's not a damn watermark.

1190
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,460
What are you talking about?

1191
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,340
Dream's time, right?

1192
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,100
Well, you're covering it up, pal.

1193
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,060
Oh, shit.

1194
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,900
I got it like that on the comforters.

1195
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,900
No less than on the on the kid.

1196
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,100
I like it because these are a watermark on the kid to the family's

1197
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,580
kind of enjoying a dream's time right now.

1198
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,140
They are out snoozing on your seat over here.

1199
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,180
I got I got some flowers down on the corner.

1200
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,300
I see that.

1201
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:45,420
I do really wish that the Smith family would kind of move out of this shot

1202
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,420
because I want to show off my bed. Let's not bother them. They're asleep.

1203
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,420
I'm just screaming in here.

1204
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,420
Alright, well let's go to the closet.

1205
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,420
Oh shit! Sarah Michelle Geller!

1206
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,420
That's not Sarah Michelle Geller.

1207
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,420
But her name is Sarah.

1208
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,420
Damn!

1209
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,420
Coincidence.

1210
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,420
She just stays in the closet.

1211
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,420
I don't really know what her deal is.

1212
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,420
No watermarks in the closet though.

1213
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:09,420
Does she help you see my clothes?

1214
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,420
No, she just isn't there.

1215
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,420
That's a good move not to put the watermark in your closet.

1216
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,180
really do much. Do you ever

1217
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,020
accidentally reach for a coat and

1218
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,380
you actually grab her, you wear

1219
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,060
her all day? I have done that

1220
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,340
once or twice. That's gotta be

1221
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,940
bloody embarrassing. I shouldn't

1222
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:23,820
admit that, but you see my

1223
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,460
shirts, I got stripes, I got

1224
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,820
checks, I got solid colors, I

1225
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,980
got no pants to shirts. Whole

1226
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,940
closet, Joseph A. Bank. Whole

1227
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,220
closet, only shirts and one

1228
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,100
woman. Kinda Winnie the Pooh

1229
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,100
style. Yeah. Closet, I like it.

1230
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,460
I'm walking around. That's

1231
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,980
fire. No bottoms. That's fire. I

1232
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,860
don't wear bottoms at home,

1233
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:39,820
dude. Definitely, you don't have

1234
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:40,780
to, it's your house. No, fuck

1235
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,980
no. You know what I'm saying? I

1236
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:42,860
don't remember what the next

1237
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:48,000
for communist Asia. So the next room is my bathroom. Oh snap wait. I hate to

1238
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,940
alarm you. There's two lovers in your bath. That's Billy and Willa. Oh snap.

1239
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,680
They just take baths in there. They're dirty people. They're dirty like in a

1240
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,860
sexual manner. Are they making a naughty video? She's drinking his piss look.

1241
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,980
Yeah, she's got a piss cup up there. But no, they're just, they just, they like,

1242
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,580
they usually roam around during the day. So they usually take a lot of baths and

1243
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,420
they're, they like to be, we like to be water efficient in my household. So I let

1244
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:15,980
to take two baths at once. Okay, it seems like they like taking two baths at once.

1245
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,180
Yeah, they're friends. They're just friends. Yeah, they're telling me with

1246
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:22,600
each other. See, this is the problem. Hey pal, I don't ask too many questions

1247
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,340
about my roommates. I'm trying to stay on good terms straight up. If I was

1248
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,900
what's his name, Billy, if I was Billy, I'd be getting fucking I'd be in a

1249
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,660
woody. Okay, well, we haven't even met woody yet, so I don't know why you're

1250
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,100
bringing him up. Well, you'd be calling me woody because I'd be sitting in his

1251
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,580
bathtub with a fucking boner that could put out the sun, but I am kind of

1252
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,580
annoyed at this that they're taking up the frame here because I really can't

1253
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,220
show off much of my bathroom. I mean you can see my my my bath faucet my tub

1254
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:52,100
faucet that's a good one. That's quite nice. Candy cane style yeah as they call it. Yeah it's got

1255
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,480
the hook to it yeah looks like a metal candy cane. I do I do wish. You know I've been

1256
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,180
talking to all these realtors as of late every fucking apartment I go into and

1257
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:06,380
they've been saying yep the faucets all candy cane style. Stainless steel appliances

1258
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:10,400
candy cane style faucets. I wish that Billy and Will would get out of the damn tub

1259
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,260
because it's I've got a beautiful bottom of the tub. Oh yeah does it have a gumdrop

1260
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:21,560
stopper? Mm-hmm. Oh gumdrop stopper M&M pebbles. Like a fishbowl. I bet that shit feels so

1261
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,560
good on your back when you rub up and down on it. Yeah I do rub up and down on

1262
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,140
it but I'm not in the bathtub that often because they are in the bathtub 23 hours

1263
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,280
a day. They're in the bathtub often. And the other hour they are in the dirt. So please

1264
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,680
Please tell me you have a shower in the bathroom as well.

1265
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,080
Well, no, it's just the bath.

1266
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,080
Oh, damn.

1267
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,080
That's nasty.

1268
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,080
You nasty, bro.

1269
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,080
That's that type of shit you get in Bushwick.

1270
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,320
Well, I get to take a bath a day because there is one hour they're not in there.

1271
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,320
That's true.

1272
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,340
But, you know, you guys thought maybe I only have one bedroom.

1273
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,340
No shot.

1274
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,340
We got a guest bedroom.

1275
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,560
Anytime you guys want to come over, you can come to the guest bedroom.

1276
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,080
Isn't it a bit weird that we've never been to each other's houses?

1277
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,520
Here, let's show it off.

1278
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:57,520
So that's Woody.

1279
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,520
Whoa!

1280
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
That's Woody.

1281
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,520
That's Woody!

1282
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,520
Woody, what are you doing?

1283
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,440
What are you doing? He looks like he's a tired tired guy today. He's all tuckered out

1284
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,480
I don't think he's trying to sleep. He looks like he's looking to the door for help

1285
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,120
He's a construction worker and he works hard during the day. So he comes back and he just zonks out

1286
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,800
He has a condition where he sleeps with his eyes open and with his arms and legs

1287
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,300
Why is he tied as it looks like he's tied almost no, those are his cuffs. He wears

1288
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:28,280
He has to climb these kind of like electrical towers and all sorts of buildings

1289
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,820
So he uses those for it to balance himself. He's strapped in like Mike Berbiglia

1290
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:35,580
So that he doesn't jump out a window in the middle of the night. He's not strapped in at all guys

1291
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:40,280
He was really less or a few wears. Those are bracelets. Oh, he's like Chris Cole. He wears fucking sweaty

1292
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,340
Weas those are bracelets those he hooks them into the construction site so he doesn't fall down

1293
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:49,160
Oh, the bracelets is one of those seasickness bracelets cuz he rides a lot of boats for a bracelet

1294
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:54,920
I'm sorry that I so insensitively accused him of being sexual. He's cosplaying as Macho from Pokemon

1295
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,720
And the bottoms - yeah, okay, I like it. Yeah, but let's see what my what my next room here is

1296
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,220
I want to show you all my man cave. Oh, hell yeah

1297
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:09,540
I hope they're not in there right? I hope the boys aren't in there right now, but well, that's what you want in the man

1298
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,320
Okay

1299
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:19,080
What the hell looks like the boys are busy watching sports, I don't think so it looks like maybe they're going on some kind of

1300
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:24,060
You've been watching too much avatar. He started acting like James James Cameron doing some deep

1301
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,320
- James, 'cause that is James there with the gas mask on.

1302
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,160
- Really?

1303
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:28,980
- I don't know if he can hear us.

1304
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:29,960
He probably doesn't even know we're in here.

1305
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,680
- Gas mask, is this a smoker's lounge down here?

1306
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,680
- And that's Tyler's foot up there.

1307
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,520
- Where is the rest of them?

1308
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:36,260
- You can tell Tyler got the shiny feet.

1309
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,100
That's how you can tell.

1310
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,680
- Who's this guy with his back to us?

1311
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,200
- Oh, don't worry about that guy.

1312
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,040
He doesn't live here.

1313
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,520
- Yeah? - Oh, okay.

1314
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,680
- We're gonna move forward to my study though.

1315
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,520
- Oh, okay.

1316
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,840
- This is where I get a lot of my research done.

1317
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,680
- Yeah, I'd love to see your study.

1318
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,720
- Hey, you could almost call that your man cave study.

1319
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,820
There's so many studs in there.

1320
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,200
Those are my study.

1321
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,700
Really?

1322
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,200
Wow.

1323
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,200
Yeah, and these are some more of my roommates.

1324
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,640
All these little families?

1325
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,960
Yeah, well, none of them are related to each other.

1326
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Oh, that's cool.

1327
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,480
That's cool.

1328
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,320
So it's like a co-op you live in.

1329
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,480
No, it's just a house.

1330
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,480
Oh, it's just a house.

1331
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:04,980
Yeah.

1332
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,040
But this is where I get a lot of my research done.

1333
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,520
Yeah, I don't know why you're moving the mouse around

1334
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,020
down there.

1335
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,680
That's just one of my roommates.

1336
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,520
That's a baby with a weird-- he's got a fucked up head.

1337
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

1338
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
That's the most fucked up head I've ever seen.

1339
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,040
That's Darryl.

1340
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:18,840
How old is he?

1341
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,480
you're twenty seven. He's small. Look at how small it's just the angle of the

1342
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,000
camera. I really wish that all these people weren't getting their study done

1343
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,300
right now, because I really wanted to show you guys my book collection, but

1344
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,040
it's just so so far away and we can't really get past my room mates here.

1345
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,840
Yeah, we have to jump over all those people. Look, look, I'm crushing their

1346
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,760
head. No, don't do that. Okay, that's not very nice to do. That's actually

1347
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,080
violent. Yeah, that's very violent. Well, I have one more thing to show you

1348
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,160
guys in my house, and it's actually outside. This is my backyard. Oh my God,

1349
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:44,280
this is your backyard. Whoa, some of my room mates are having a picnic right

1350
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,640
now. Holy cow! That doesn't look like a picnic. It looks like nearly a million

1351
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,340
people. It's actually a thousand. Wow! That's way more than a thousand people.

1352
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,460
It's actually thousands. Oh, to the point where it's a million. Maybe not. That's

1353
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,700
the thing, when people say... A thousand to your tenth power. But it's my backyard

1354
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:02,140
anyway. A million could also be thousands. And you can see, so that up right here,

1355
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:07,420
that's Clint. Oh, hey Clint. What? And over... My girlfriend got mad I couldn't find

1356
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:15,100
Clint. Over here, right over there, that's Gabriela. Oh, she's lovely. Yeah, she's

1357
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,180
lovely and so far away that I can barely tell. This guy right here that's actually the

1358
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:25,380
gardener I don't know his name. Oh and that's Alfonso. I know Alfonso from school. Yeah he lives here.

1359
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,620
But that's my crib so you know usually I would say get the fuck out but if you

01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,900
guys want to join the picnic. Alright yeah I'm not opposed. I can fucking eat.

1361
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:37,580
That's fun. I'm ready to do I'm ready to I'm ready to have a picnic.

They haven't made your house yet. Oh okay. You live in a McDonald's? Wow. Wow.
