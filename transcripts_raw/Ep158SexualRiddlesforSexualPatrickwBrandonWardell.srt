50
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,000

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,200
Say oh yeah like the Kool-Aid man, fuck you and the orange juice.

53
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I love it when you remember the 90s.

54
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Mm-hmm.

55
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,720
Just stepping on just shampoo bottles over and over and over, squirting across the bathtub.

56
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,160
I start using like my dandruff shampoo as lube and stuff.

57
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Ow, dude, fuck.

58
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
It stings, dude.

59
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,880
Do you have like grimy floors in the shower?

60
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Oh yeah.

61
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
I feel like your feet get dirtier.

62
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

63
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,800
I get out of the shower with like black like pig pen feet.

64
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,080
It's really fucked up.

65
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,240
I just had to replace the shower mat pretty recently,

66
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,120
because I shaved my dick and balls in the shower.

67
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,620
Wow.

68
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,280
And there was so much hair in it.

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
Oh, I did.

71
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,840
Yeah, we get manscaped ads on our pod, so I get free manscaped.

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Oh, shit.

73
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,600
And so I put that shit to use.

74
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,880
And then I got--

75
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,880
I think it was like a night where I was like--

76
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,040
I had like a 7am flight so I was like, "Alright."

77
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,000
I was like, "Addy'd out."

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I was like, "Time to put the manscape to work."

79
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
I mean, 4am, that's the best thing to do.

80
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,360
And then it was like one of those situations where you finish and you're like, "Oh, it's

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
too much."

82
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah.

83
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,640
You shave your dick and balls and then you're like, "Oh, wait a second.

84
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,840
I have a child's cock in my hand."

85
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,000
you call you you call the cops on yourself you think that you're holding a

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,560

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:16,040

And if you like saw me with my shirt off, you'd be like, you shouldn't have that much.

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,800

Yeah.

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,280
I know somebody whose dad shaves his entire body every single morning.

102
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Well, like,

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,360

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,800

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,720
square into your body, including your penis.

Love being here at 22

134
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:44,100
22 stop Street

135
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:51,980
That's too much already

136
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,220
Too much no, that's gonna freak me out

137
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,940
How many 22's do you think there are?

138
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,940
in New York City. Stop saying the number! Not even the number! It's not allowed. How old

139
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,140
were you two years ago? Huh? How old were you two years ago? Stop! I just want to know

140
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:20,140

143
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:37,460
I have all my skateboards next to the camera and one of them is going to fall over.

144
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:46,620
You have a big pile of, yeah, a bunch of, all of your worldly possessions.

145
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,340
I am so bad at organization.

146
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,420
This is a bad spot for the skateboards, but don't you normally keep them behind your door

147
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,180
so if you open your door more than halfway they all fall

148
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,780
well i'm trying to figure out a new spot to put them

149
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,260

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I was so mad at you.

165
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Oh yeah, I'm so sorry.

166
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Honestly.

167
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,860

People have read the title.

175
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
That's true.

176
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Yeah.

177
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,580
Yeah, no, we went to, well, I got, I don't know that I'm going to be able to do this,

178
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,580
That was where everybody we'd make you feel like there's so many people.

179
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,820
Did it make you feel like you were in L.A.

180
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,340
because it was full of evil people?

181
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,700
Right. Demonic.

182
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,140
Yeah. Felix was like, yeah, this is it's a bunch of people that are like networking,

183
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,060
but unemployed. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

184
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Yeah. Like it was all like sort of, yeah, godless hedonists.

185
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,020
Yeah, it was bad.

186
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,220
Dude, there's so many drinks too much.

187
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,780
They were so expensive. I bought me and Brandon.

188
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,340
I got you a tequila soda, a gin and tonic.

189
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
and immediately as I turn around,

190
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
dude just fucking knocks it out of my hand

191
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
and didn't even offer to buy me another one.

192
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,340
- $20 drink. - I was just so fucking mad.

193
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I was like pacing back and forth in that back room.

194
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Like, "What? He didn't even fucking offer a peg!"

195
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
- Yeah. - "Here's a couple of..."

196
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
"Here's like $20! He didn't even fucking offer!"

197
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,340
A schoolyard bully lunch tray smacks the shit out of your hand.

198
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
"What? It was your drink too!"

199
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
Which I felt like such an asshole about.

200
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Yeah, but I gave you...

201
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
- Oh yeah, you gave me... - ...a 20.

202
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,340
But no, that was like a...

203
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,220
Well, it was like just late it was like late it was late and that was like where people I knew

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,660
Yeah, we're like we got there had friends there. Yeah, we got there and there's like a piano there and they were playing

205
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,380
Fuck you can't get what you want by Joe Jackson and like you can just hear that like they're like

206
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,180
I noticed like the dudes like DJing but it's like the DJ equipments on top of this piano

207
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Right like every 10 minutes. He stands up and just tried to play

208
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,580
and he just wasn't like, he was literally like a kid hitting the keyboard.

209
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,980
So it's just like this dude in a suit just like, "No, no, no, no, no!"

210
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
Like, over like that song.

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
It's just kind of like pressing the pedals as well.

212
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,780
And that song, that song's like a really like fast like slap bass like eight like new wave song.

213
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,580
It's just like, I like I was talking, I met with, Clark was there and like I'm talking to Clark and the whole time I'm just like,

214
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,980
"Alright, I can't talk, what the fuck is that guy? What is he doing?"

215
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,580
It's like, "Oh yeah, I guess people sing here too."

216
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,980
Oh yeah, it was like different levels.

217
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Yeah.

218
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Everybody was on the floor.

219
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Almost like hell.

220
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Yeah.

221
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
Yeah.

222
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
Exactly.

223
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Yeah.

224
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,540
That was, yeah, I didn't mean to lead you astray.

225
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,540
It's okay.

226
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
If you-

227
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,500
If all the like marks of like a bad bar were like the bartender is like having way too

228
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
good of a time.

229
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Right.

230
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,260
That is a bad, that's a bad sign.

231
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,980
Like if the bartender is like fucked up and dancing, that's going to be a $45 gin and

232
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
tonic.

233
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Right.

234
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
He's not putting any fucking well gin in there.

235
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
No.

236
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,600
the shelves to start at his chest that's it yeah no it's definitely a scene yeah

237
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,140
that was that scary I went I went out onto the roof and I had like asked to

238
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,980
bum a cig from somebody and he just immediately just started making fun of

239
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:38,420
me and I was just like I forget exactly yeah he started making fun of me for

240
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,980
shit and like I don't know like I recognize somebody there and it's like

241
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,080
talking to them like somebody I've met at like a like a friend's house one time

242
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,180
I was like mm-hmm she was like asking me for like her like like Instagram or

243
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,340
whatever it's like oh do you have like Twitter or whatever and like the guy was

244
00:10:51,340 --> 00:11:00,060
like Oh Patrick likes Twitter and I was like oh what the fuck yeah he wasn't

245
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,700
making fun of you it was nice of him he said it immediately went all right you

246
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,020
know you got me pretty good yeah that's pretty how did why did he say that

247
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,800
Because you asked about a girl's Twitter or what?

248
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,180
Wait, you asked about a girl's Twitter?

249
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,960
You tell people about your...

250
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't tell people about my Twitter.

251
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,800
I was just saying like, you know, it's like...

252
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You say when somebody asks if you have Twitter, you go, "No."

253
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
I don't know.

254
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
There's...

255
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I promise I don't.

256
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
I was pretty fucked up.

257
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,960
I really don't remember what I said.

258
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
Yeah.

259
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
But...

260
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,440
You definitely, at some...

261
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,160
You definitely at some point have been like, "I guess I'm on Twitter."

262
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,380
I know.

263
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Come on now.

264
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,380
I've seen what you've done.

265
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
I've done it.

266
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:51,820
What you forgot is that you went up to that guy to buy him a cigarette and you held up

267
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,780
your phone and went, "Look how many followers I have.

268
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,540
Give me a cigarette now."

269
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,820
That's what you did that you forgot.

270
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:06,540
I can't explain to people what I do because I have a podcast and I just say stupid shit

271
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,540
online.

272
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Just say you're in the military.

273
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,540
I should start doing that instead.

274
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,760
It's like the easiest, because nobody cares.

275
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,500
Just say something like, say a job that nobody will ever ask about, you know?

276
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Military.

277
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I'm in the Peace Corps.

278
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Author.

279
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Yeah.

280
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Right.

281
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,740
Say that you wrote Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wilde.

282
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,380
Well, that's the thing, like, those, the people that I was talking to on the, that

283
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,620
roof were like, "Oh, I'm a writer," or like, you know, like, just shit like that.

284
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
No, that's-

285
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,300
It's like, "Oh, like, I don't, like, I don't know what I do.

286
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,580
I don't do stand-up anymore, so I can't be like, 'Oh, I'm a comedian,' because I'm just

287
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
like-"

288
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
"I'm an evil murderer."

289
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Yeah.

290
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,340
I'm a monster. I'm the worst person in the world. Which I mean you know if I'm saying

291
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:51,140
on my Twitter it's not super rough. I'm your worst fucking nightmare. I'm from hell.

292
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,860
Take all of his cigarettes. I think if someone asks you for a cigarette you should be able to be like

293
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,300
yeah fat ass like no problem. You should be able to do that one for each cigarette.

294
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
You get one kind of rib.

295
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Yeah, if he gives you one cigarette, he should also be allowed to give you one titty twister?

296
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Yeah, one purple nurple. You should have to smell his shoe.

297
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
He should have to take his shoe off.

298
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
And you should have to take a deep whiff.

299
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
You have to look at his, the circle.

300
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I know what you're doing. I'm not going to look at it, Pat.

301
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
No, I'm sorry. You're not going to give me a...

302
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm not, you know, just don't worry about it.

303
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
What?

304
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Just, I, the thing, you know what you're doing.

305
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Oh, you dropped, um...

306
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,300
You dropped this circle of my finger. Yeah, I got you.

307
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Yeah, Patrick's doing the white power sign.

308
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Oh, I forgot that they changed that. You know why that changed?

309
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,300
Because some nerd, that happened to him too many times. He's like, "You know that's white power!"

310
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,300
And then that guy like saved

311
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,300
so many people from getting dead on him.

312
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Yeah, that was definitely a party where there was a lot of

313
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,460
lot of people there that are like yeah I'm I'm trad calf yeah yeah yeah I mean

314
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,100
yes you know that was that was in Lower East Side or yeah it was a lot of oh god

315
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,420
you know that yeah a lot of you know like Chinatown kids yeah yeah the dime square

316
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:22,580
as they call it what's what's your problem with these people yeah that's

317
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,660
such a it's such like saying that there were trad calf people at a party to me as

318
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,580
as like as like nonsensical as being like yeah there's a lot of like bloods and

319
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:39,220
crypts. I feel like that is a very specific to New York. I mean I guess it's just a weird

320
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,020
like niche part of the internet. It's not just New York but it feels

321
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,500
like a very New York thing. Fucking like 22 year olds.

322
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,620
Who are like I love Christ. Yeah like they stopped drinking for like two weeks.

323
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,140
they're like two weeks I was actually saved yeah they're like but then they're

324
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,900
still going to bars and shit right like it's like oh I still want to hang out

325
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,380
but and I feel like right fucking 17 year old yeah the most

326
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,300
trad cat thing at which I guess that tracks a little yeah but yeah no I doubt

327
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,100
isn't I have not been to a single bar like that until until that one we mostly

328
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,500
go to bars that are like like we went to a bar last night there's basically a

329
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Halloween store. Oh yeah.

330
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
That sounds nice.

331
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
It was very fun. It sounds a little scary.

332
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I swear there was a ghost there.

333
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I swear to god there was a ghost there.

334
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm gonna get a drink while he explains it.

335
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm sitting there by myself

336
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm waiting for Caleb to leave this

337
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
eSports thing he was at.

338
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I heard he was at

339
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
an eSports event with a bunch of children.

340
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
He was screaming at kids.

341
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I was there with him for a couple minutes and it was just like

342
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I don't...

343
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,500
is not for me, but you know, it's cool people there.

344
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
- Cool the cool kids, you like the kids?

345
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
- No, no, no, the people we were hanging out with were cool.

346
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
- Cool people, you like the little kids?

347
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
- Just like, I'm just gonna ignore it.

348
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
- So I was gonna go to...

349
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
- Patrick got there, Patrick got there.

350
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
- I'm talking about the ghosts!

351
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
- Patrick was walking up to kids and being like,

352
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
"Do you guys need a fifth? I don't even know how to play this game,

353
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
but I wanna do teamwork with you so bad."

354
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
(laughter)

355
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
- "I wanna join the team!"

356
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
I love teamwork. I love sharing.

357
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Patrick was cornering people saying, "My ultimate's ready."

358
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
[Laughter]

359
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
But no.

360
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, you're talking about that thing. Okay.

361
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, like you screaming at the kids.

362
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I realized that the reason I like any sports is because any scream that I can just scream at.

363
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I mean, we were like... So this whole thing was like these two teams on a stage.

364
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
And one team, they brought all their friends, and these guys are going insane.

365
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
And every time they get a point, they're yelling.

366
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,620
and then the other side was just it was a Valorant tournament.

367
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,660
How did you find out about this? Some guy just asked me on Twitter to go and I was

368
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,260
like sure. A guy you hadn't met? A friend of a friend. Okay. He was like yeah I'm in

369
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,340
town doing this you want to come? I was like sure and the other side of the of

370
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:05,020
the stage was just this one kid on the team's mom and we were like we're going

371
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,580
to that side and then those kids like destroyed the kids who brought all the

372
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,660
like fucking friends and we were just like that was getting so belligerent and

373
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,660
just scream just like it was like in good fun until we got there we're like

374
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,460
fuck you! Fuck you, you piece of shit!

375
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,500
Every single time that our team got a point and like we started freaking out the kids who we were rooting for.

376
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
[Laughter]

377
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
We would scream and they'd be like, "Shut up, man."

378
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:35,220
So while that's going on I was like you know I don't fucking scream at sports shit so I was like this isn't for me I gotta go.

379
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,380
So I went to this bar and I'm sitting there like waiting for him to show up and like there's like a fireplace

380
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,380
like from like where I'm sitting to where like a

381
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,200
Little bit past cam is like right over there. That's like where the fireplace is

382
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,500
Okay

383
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,820
and this candle just like fell off and

384
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,600
rolled onto the floor and just shattered and I was like what the fuck just happened and the guys like

385
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,440
Looking is like did you do that? I was like nine fuck you like what's going on?

386
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,040
I like look up and there's like a statue like staring straight at me and like a taxidermy animal on the wall

387
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm just like oh fuck one of these things is haunting me right now

388
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,120
It sucks, and I go to like pick it up and just like cut my finger on the thing

389
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,880
Oh, I start going to cut your finger the ghost ghost tried to snap didn't you didn't knock over a candle

390
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,000
It sounds like a story where you knocked over a candle and then he was on the fireplace

391
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and then you are stupid.

392
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A ghost!

393
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A ghost!

394
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Did you start running through the hallway going indoors

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and then outdoors over and over again?

396
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was crazy, a piece of glass fell to the

397
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
ground and a ghost turned it into a thousand pieces

398
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
with magic.

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, that was before Caleb

400
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
showed up.

401
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I forgot.

402
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I bought a white cloth

403
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
at the place next door and the bartender got mad at me.

404
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah, which was a weird move.

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,080
yeah and we got mad at you the bartender

406
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,640

e-sports event for a little bit of that too

408
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,340
there's a lot of news it was like uh... all of the bartenders had like

409
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,920
in the exact same spot in their body the same doctor who tattoo pretty much

410
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,400
java

411
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,320
home we got a bit of a delicate

412
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,360
whatever i think it was the phone booth is that what they call it i think that's

413
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
what we're a little robot guys

414
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,480
the other the doll it really sounds like i used to watch that in high school

415
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
sounds like you're the biggest guy

416
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
what are they called?

417
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,960
the little monster that in season two episode five he fights is that it?

418
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,240
and just like to be funny like who's your favorite doctor

419
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,920
like your favorite episode yeah just for just as a gag like what's

420
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,520
yeah what what's the best generation who uh yeah no i wish i i don't know maybe i

421
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,560
probably would have gotten some joy from you know I never dealt I remember I

422
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,320
remember when like Chris Hardwick used to talk about it all the time I'm like the

423
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,080
Nerdist podcast. Doctor Who is horrible. I mean that like there's other shows like

424
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,760
Star Trek and stuff you can still watch. I'll fuck up with Star Trek still.

425
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,800
No good. I'll fuck with that shit. That shit was fire back in the day.

426
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Honestly and shit. Yo what's your favorite generation though? TNG like what's up?

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
up. Yeah. What do you think of Odo? He sleeps in a bucket. What do you think about that?

428
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,840
What do you think about Odo sleeping in a bucket? He's like the, like, he's like the

429
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,800
shapeshifter. Like he's like, like the last of like a race of shapeshifters. But then

430
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:44,360
in season five, yeah, that's deep space. Oh yeah. Oh, I don't like any show with more than

431
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,960
like 15 episodes. Yeah. I'm just never going to, except for the Simpsons. Every season

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,740
of the space nine is like twenty six episodes i don't like it the uh... nine

441
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,200

442
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,200
he was like a weird jewish caricature yeah

443
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
yeah every other

444
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
yeah he was a hulk nose monster

445
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,200
who was very greedy

446
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,200
he was like a slave master to anakin skywalker

447
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
oh i forgot that yeah that too

448
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,200
yeah there's like a line it's such a fucking funny line read

449
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,200
where like quaggan jinn is like walking in like telling anakin he's like free

450
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:54,200
like free and he's just like you're no longer a slave. He's the one who's like "Credits! You can't pay me credits!"

451
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
"Your mindshades don't work on me!"

452
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,120
Yeah, he's awesome dude. They should have brought him, they should have done the

453
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,800
Mandalorian with Wadow. Oh man, I wonder what happens to Wadow after

454
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,800
episode 2. He doesn't show up ever again. He should have done baby Wadow.

455
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
That thing would look fucked up. Yeah, because he's got wings too.

456
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,800
He just starts stripping the ship of all the metal.

457
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Just like taking it out of the walls.

458
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,800
It'd be awesome. Damn.

459
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Alright, what's the list today? The nasty ripples.

460
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I have told you guys that I'm a listener.

461
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,640
listener. And I do love that all of the lists are, usually, this one is not written by a

462
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
child.

463
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
No.

464
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,000
No, I feel like it usually is like, I have, I mean, I've probably listened to like, maybe

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,840
like 10 to 15 episodes at this point. And it's almost always like, I'm always like,

466
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,880
oh yeah, this list was written by like a 12 year old.

467
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,160
Yeah, it's always a big, it sucks when I'm doing my job and the person we're making fun

468
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,840
of their name is like Chris 2009. I know why it's 2009. You are 12.

469
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,920
But this one I think you said is not a child and it is-

470
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,960
What's the thing? Whenever it's like, you know, like something like this, it's got something

471
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,560
as fucked up as gonna be in this. Like what was that one? Fuckable lesser apes?

472
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Oh yeah.

473
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah, we did one. If someone made a list of monkeys, it would fuck.

474
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Yeah.

475
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,400
The thing about the ones that are written by kids is they're all from the same website,

476
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,260
but we didn't know the website existed

477
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,960
like before we started the podcast.

478
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
- Yeah.

479
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,620
- Like we just found that website

480
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,820
and it's like, okay, I guess we have to do this

481
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,240
every single episode.

482
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,360
- It's also easy.

483
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,200
- The only good one.

484
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,020

570
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Some username.

571
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I'm checking it every day.

572
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,400
God, it's so funny to look at every day in the morning before I do anything else.

573
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,560
in the day. Oh my God. Okay, number two. Now guess this time Patrick. Don't. Okay.

574
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,120
You know. Patrick is the one who has to guess all of these. Alright, yeah. I like that. Okay.

575
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Number two. You'll find them in different sizes. If it's chilly outside, it drips.

576
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,840
And if you blow it, it feels like heaven. What is it? Doesn't that sound sexual?

577
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,640
Say it again. You'll find them in different sizes. If it's chilly outside,

578
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,800
outside it drips and if you blow it it feels like heaven what is it so easy to

579
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,160
think about it okay all right think about so the obvious answer would be

580
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,480
because it's a sex or it'll be your cock have you ever been outside when it was

581
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:00,240
cold and your cock just started dripping all over the place yeah yeah I guess

582
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,240
that's why you're answering what when you blow it it feels is it cigarettes

583
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,480
(laughing)

584
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,840
- We learned that Pat just blows into the room.

585
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,280
(laughing)

586
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,840
I know somebody who I like,

587
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,080
they had been like smoking weed since they were like 15,

588
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,240
and I would watch them and every time they would smoke weed,

589
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,680
they would just like put it in their mouth like a cigar

590
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,120
and then blow it out.

591
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,520
And then I saw them at 22 years old,

592
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
it would be hanging out with my brother,

593
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,680
get high for the first time because my brother was like,

594
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,000
you're not even fucking inhaling it.

595
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
He was like, "What do you mean?"

596
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
He was like, "You have to inhale the weed."

597
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And it like blew his mind.

598
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I don't think he's smoked weed since then.

599
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Damn.

600
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You need the answer, Pat?

601
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
When you blow it, it feels amazing.

602
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You got...

603
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
When you breathe it outside, it drips.

604
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you want to phone a friend?

605
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
No, I got this.

606
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You got three guesses for each of these.

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Okay, that's your last guess.

608
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You ready for the answer, Pat?

609
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, I'm at a loss.

610
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Answer.

611
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
A nose, you dirty mind.

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Well, what is it?

613
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What's the...

614
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you blow your nose and it drips when it's cold.

615
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And it feels like heaven when you blow it.

616
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If it's chilly outside it drips?

617
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Is that about a...

618
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
No, you fucking know.

619
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No, obvious yes.

620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What is the question?

621
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It seems like you were stoned, my friend.

622
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The implication is that it's like

623
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
oh, this could be about something.

624
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
A nose isn't sexual to you?

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's not a sexy...

626
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
If it's chilly outside it drips?

627
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000

00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
No, no, no.

676
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
I mean, that's her.

677
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
This can't be her, right?

678
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
That's her.

679
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,640
But also, how many women are there named Sharon Alfonso?

680
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,760
Oh, nah.

Nah.

684
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Nah.

685
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:13,280
Yeah, she would have to be really hot for me to say yes to that, honestly.

686
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Yeah, I don't know.

687
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,280
Well, if you said yes to her riddle, you'd be wrong.

688
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Oh, boy.

689
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,280

Does that get you excited for the next riddle?

695
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,360
It's really sexy.

696
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,080
Oh, dude, you're making me want to bust.

697
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,480
Number four.

698
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,360
Oh, Christ.

699
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,120
Number four.

700
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,240
This gif is repeating so good.

701
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,160
Oh.

Okay.

Vacuum.

That's a pretty good guess, actually.

706
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,920
But also like my penis doesn't have the word. Yeah, I think they dropped the ball there by saying the word come.

707
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:03,680
They just said come. Oh, you know this one. Come on. This is easy like c-o-m-e or c-u-m. C-u-m, baby. Yeah, come on

Answer. Nope, it's not a hair tie.

781
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
It's your old friend, the thong.

782
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,660
Ah.

783
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,160
Your old friend the thong.

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
So if you didn't-

785
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,660
Bro.

786
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,160
If you have to guess, your old friend the thong or it's not correct.

787
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,660
Yeah.

788
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,160
If you just say the thong, it doesn't count.

789
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,660
You know Cher has some weak pussy for this.

790

marshmallow I love a fluffernutter sandwich but I hate having to spit it out.

815
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:24,180
I wish it was edible that's the only problem.

816
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:32,780
yeah the white sticky stuff is teeth. Fluffernutter sandwiches like I remember the

if you can eat it and not--

820
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,260

821
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,100
- Well, it's also, it's funny, gummy worms, though.

822
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,940
- I mean, truly, if you can eat it

reading that story on the show.

843
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,140
Nobody's mad. Everybody's happy.

00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,020
Except if a woman's ever farted in

850
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,220
your face and you've been like,

851
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,780
yeah, sure. Then you, you need to

852
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,220
grow up.

853
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
That's called a fluffernutter.

854
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:42,220
If you've never shat on the ground during sex, you need to grow up.

855
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:51,220
He's not even just getting up in the middle of it.

856
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,220
He's shitting on the ground and then going back to it.

857
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
No, you're like fucking.

858
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,220
Just fucking shitting all over the ground during a handjob.

859
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
*laughter*

860
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
I'm so sorry, I lost control

861
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
*laughter*

862
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Being just as bashful as when a woman squirts

863
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,220
*laughter*

864
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Being like, "Oh, I'm sorry, do you have a towel? I'll clean it up. I'm sorry."

865
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
Sorry, this never happens to me.

866
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
*laughter*

867
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,220
I creamed.

868
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220
My bad. Oh, fuck, I'm gonna squirt.

869
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,220
*laughter*

870
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
Oh, God.

871
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:36,460
I'm going to squirt and then actually shitting on the floor that she's like, is that, do

872
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,460
they do that?

873
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:48,340
You need the answer for this one with the white sticky stuff is you want to know?

874
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
Oh yeah.

875
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I forgot.

876
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
I never got the answer.

877
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
Right.

878
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
A toothpaste.

879
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,340
I was going to fucking say it too.

880
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
I don't think that's joy.

881
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,400
- Sticky though.

882
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,240
- No one enjoys toothpaste.

883
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,680
- Also it's like most girls.

884
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,740
- Guys do it too.

885
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,600
- Wait, the joke is that like, I don't know.

886
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,140
Is it implied that some people enjoy swallowing toothpaste?

887
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,900
- Some people do, do you?

888
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,700
Some people do.

889
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,700
(laughing)

890
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,140
- Okay, next row here.

891
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,120
- He was like, I gotta go get a drink.

892
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,140
- Big ol' glasses.

893
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
yeah i'm like trying to play it off like it's milk

894
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,980
i keep being like this milk's really stiff

895
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,980
what the fuck this milk it like doesn't move

896
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,980
is that weird?

897
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,980
this glass is so weird

898
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
this optical illusion where it looks like it's not moving at all

899
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,980
looks like it has little

900
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
blue and red stars in it

901
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
it's very funny to me that like the

902
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,980
it already would be weird if you walked back with a glass

903
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,980
you know

904
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,980
it already would be insane

905
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,980
i'm trying to play it off like that

906
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
just normal

907
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,980
fridge you know there's not milk in there at all. I think it's funny that the

908
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,100
solution to like people swallowing toothpaste was they made toothpaste like

909
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,780
you can swallow it now. Yeah. You know they make adult toothpaste where you can

910
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:13,460
just tank it dude. Just gulp it down. And what's it called? I might be hungry later. What goes in

911
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,540
hard and comes out wet, squishy, and sticky? Spaghetti. No. Oh that makes sense.

912
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,820
That's actually a great answer. You might be smarter than Sharon Alexander.

913
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,100
So it goes in hard and comes out wet, sticky, squishy and sticky.

914
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,380
Uh, then what else would it be?

915
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,820
What is it? Is it going to be like, "Bucatini, you dummy!"

916
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:42,580
It's two pieces of spaghetti.

917
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,020
Come on, you got this.

918
00:42:48,020 --> 00:43:01,500
this

919
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:16,500
fucking

920
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,580
you know it's a little answer

921
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,900
the talk okay so it's a yeah go ahead is that is the most uh... i was like

922
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,180
the

923
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,700
so that we're getting drinks as i guess you may remain you know if he's like

924
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,940
leaving

925
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,540
history with the book

926
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,220
but in our world

927
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,660
there's one of the water

928
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,820
we we talk about it is good to know that the public will be a little bit

929
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,140
instead asking

930
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,180
one of our water

931
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,220
and that

932
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,020
And then he said, "You didn't know?"

933
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,660
And then we were like, "What are you saying, dude?"

934
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,340
And we're like, "What are you saying, dude?"

935
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,420
And he's like, "Oh, I thought you said

936
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,980
"there was mud in our water."

937
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,140
(laughing)

938
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,220
- It must be crazy to be like your roommate

939
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,260
and just hear this all the time.

940
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,100
- Yeah.

941
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,920
- Yeah.

942
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,180
- But I thought I was just having a stroke.

943
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,020
Like I was like--

944
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,300
- I was so confused.

945
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,140
- Like what the fuck is going on?

946
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,660
- 'Cause I was holding the Brita filter too.

947
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,300
And he was just going, "Mud in our water?"

948
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,100
(laughing)

949
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,140
- He just put a bunch of mud in there.

950
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,940
I'm just letting you know before I go, I put a bunch of mud in the brine.

951
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,140
I want to see if it gets the dirt out.

952
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,900
Yeah, I made a bunch of mud, but I want the dirt back.

953
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,900
Don't they have that now?

954
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,900
Don't they have like black water with dirt in it that you can drink?

955
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,900
Oh, it's a charcoal water.

956
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,900
It's coffee.

957
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,900
Oh, the coffee.

958
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,340
Yeah, but like that doesn't, it probably tastes weird, right?

959
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
I don't know.

960
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Does it make your mouth black?

961
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Yeah, a little bit.

962
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Like when you eat ink?

963
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,340
Did you ever do that? You ever put ink in your mouth?

964
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
From a pen?

965
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,340
No, I've never eaten ink. It's pretty funny.

966
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,340
It'll make your mom real mad.

967
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Yeah, I mean it.

968
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Alright, wait, what was the...

969
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,340
It goes in hard, it comes out wet, sticky, and...

970
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Squishy.

971
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
I'm just gonna tell you the answer here.

972
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,340
It's a hot dog. It's not a hot dog.

973
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
It's bubble gum.

974
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Oh, fuck off.

975
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Come on, bitch. It's not hard.

976
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Bubble gum is not hard.

977
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,140
- You're pushing on the website. - No, no.

978
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,620
- Please, just please.

979
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,440

981
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,360
a hardcore just something going into your vagina.

982
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,940
Please, Sharon.

983
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,820
- Don't, don't ask her, come on.

984
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,060
- Why?

985
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,460
- What? - It's very rude.

986
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,220
- It's a, she's asking me all these fucking questions.

987
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,020
- All right, what's the next riddle?

988
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,900
- Number nine, you can't taste it until you undress it.

989
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,100
What is it?

990
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,940
- Ranch.

991
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:48,480
yeah taste it probably in a banana it's a banana take it why do you think that's

992
00:45:48,480 --> 00:46:03,720
there I love yeah that's good so it's like a picture of a computer dusting

993
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,720
himself with very buff white man arms. Can you imagine how he walks with his arms?

994
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:18,520
So it's basically like the way that it's set up is like the keyboard looks like it's dick

995
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,680
and he's just spraying computer juster onto where his penis should be.

996
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,880
Raising his eyebrows and kind of smirking like.

997
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,400
Damn that's cold.

998
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,560
Yeah alright that's fine. Sorry I got distracted.

999
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,560
No, it's important.

1000
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,240
I want to do more inhalants.

1001
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,240
I think that's the next drug for me.

1002
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Yeah.

1003
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
You hit that duster.

1004
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
I guess I could.

1005
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,400
The thing is, I would need to do some research and find out what the best one is.

1006
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,680
I'm in my inhalant era.

1007
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,680
Yeah, exactly.

1008
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
Make the worst music ever.

1009

Just get like poppers.

1010
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,080
Yeah, just if like David Bowie got into like inhalants.

Whippets while they're recording so they have to yeah they have to rap well on

It's so incredible.

1023

00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Somehow, yeah, just like a cartoonishly large penis.

1055

The only giant boner you've ever had.

two nights later we're watching Austin Powers here at his own home. No that's like a week after.

1114
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,880
five feet outside of this bedroom that we're in right now. He just like couldn't make it.

1115
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,680
And he was talking to me while he was falling asleep and he was like, "Yeah, Austin Powers,

1116
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,160
Fah-- Patrick." Oh, man. And then he's just gone. Patrick. Yeah. And I think he had one beer that

1120
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,320
Did you dream about Austin Powers that night? No, I just woke up on the floor.

1121
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:08,240
No dream. The rain shut off. Is that just like a... it's like part of your morning routine now?

1122
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,440
Like if you don't wake up on the floor, do you get off of your bed, get on the floor,

1123
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,080
and then get back up? You're asking me that because I told you I do that.

1124
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:22,320
He was doing the like talk show host thing. Yeah. Like you fed me that line earlier.

1125
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,360
There was a pre-interview. I understand that you've been getting on the floor from the

1126
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:32,240
in the mornings. Yeah, you just told me that. If I'm like hungover... Dude, I don't know what it is.

1127
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,040
Why do you love that damn floor so much? It's colder down there. You should be a janitor. Yeah,

1128
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,320
well you know that's the thing like, um, like when I was in high school, like I had to live

1129
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:52,320
in a hotel for like, like, god, like, might have been... Five days. Might have been two hours,

1130
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,360
three hours on this vacation. One night in Myrtle Beach I had to live in a hotel. It was horrible.

1131
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:04,000
Whole month of March till I graduated high school, like my senior year. And I, like,

1132
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,320
you know, it's like my family, my fucking family's like a lot of people. There's like no room for

1133
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:14,400
any of us. There's only like two bedrooms there. And I like, by choice would sleep in this bathtub.

1134
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,040
In a bathtub you slept? Yeah. I would just sleep in the bathtub just because like,

1135
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,440
the couch wasn't comfortable. What? Oh man. Yeah. Damn bro. Well, because you know my brother had

1136
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,920
the, my older brother had the air mattress. Yeah. And you know like getting... It'd be funny to be

1137
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,600
your mom waking up for school every single morning just looks like Whitney Houston's like

1138
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:41,120
walking in. She's like Mountain Dew bottles and shit. Yeah. I don't know. I just, I,

beds aren't comfortable for me. Yeah, they're not hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All men have one.

1140
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,720
Some got long, some got small.

1141
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,080
The Pope never uses his,

1142
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,360
and a man gives it to his wife after getting married.

1143
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,280
- Wait, the Pope uses his cock?

1144
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,840
He like pisses, right?

1145
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,680
- No, he doesn't.

1146
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,500
- Really?

1147
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,720
- No, that's what the hat's for, it stores it.

1148
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,200
- Is his second bladder up there?

1149
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,040
- Yeah.

1150
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,880
- Is it a ring?

1151
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,460
- Why would it be a ring?

1152
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,180
- Yeah, that's what it...

1153
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,080
- All men have a ring.

1154
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,960
- Every man has at least one ring.

1155
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,040
- It's either, it's got a spider on it.

1156
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,520
- True, that is cool, yeah.

1157
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,380
What's your answer?

1158
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,600
What does the Pope not use?

1159
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
His cock.

1160
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
We do-

1161
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
No, he-

1162
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Jesus Christ.

1163
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,600
Oh my God.

1164
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,600
He's being so confused by the riddles.

1165
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
He's losing motor controls.

1166
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,600
Oh fuck.

1167
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
Which way is up?

1168
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Oh no.

1169
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,600
I don't know.

1170
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,600
What?

1171
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
I give up.

1172
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,600
You need an answer?

1173
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,600
His last name?

1174
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,600
His last name.

1175
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1176
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
I'm so sorry.

1177
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,600

1178
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,600

1179
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,600
I'm so sorry.

1180
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
I'm so sorry.

1181
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,600
I'm so sorry.

1182
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600

1184
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,880
names and some have small ones. Yeah, but they don't become smaller over time. Some

1185
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:05,080
got long, some got small. Yeah. I don't know what to tell you, man. Some got long and some

00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,160
have them, like, have them long, some have them small. Yeah, man. Sharon's stupid. How

1188
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:16,880
How many fucking times do I have to go over this?

1189
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,480
Before Sharon lets you hit, you have to answer 20 really?

1190
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,760
And then she sits there grading for two hours.

1191
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,400
It's close to Scantron, it makes it a lot easier.

1192
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,960
Alright, we're at home stretch here.

1193
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,040
Number 14.

1194
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,720
What is soft and wet on the inside while being hard and hairy on the outside?

1195
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,640
The word begins with C, ends in T, and there's a U and N between them.

1196
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,120
one feels too complicated also our vagina is like hard as steel on the outside

1197
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,400
it's like a bear trap oh really yeah yeah we're just soft on the inside yeah it's

1198
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:58,160
a carapace nobody's using the word cunt in like a sexual context

1199
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:05,600
fuck my hard cunt that's the funniest part of the departed is that like

1200
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,920
they're trying to make Jack Nicholson a tough guy and they're like yeah like a

1201
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,360
tough Boston guy what would he say if he like was talking about sex he'd be like

1202
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,360
Yeah, I get cunt.

1203
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,360
Oh yeah.

1204
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,360
I would not say that.

1205
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,360
So gross.

1206
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Wait, hold on.

1207
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,360
The answer is Chewbacca.

1208
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,360
Obviously.

1209
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,360
It's hairy.

1210
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,360
Has

1211
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,360
the letters for cunt in it.

1212
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,360
Patrick's like adding things.

1213
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,360
It smells like Arby's.

1214
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,360
Yeah, read it again.

1215
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,360
What is soft and wet on the inside

1216
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,960
on the inside while being hard and hairy on the outside. The word begins with C, ends

1217
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:49,040
in T, and there's a U and N in between them.

1218
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,040
Come on dude, you got this.

1219
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:55,560
This would be the ultimate bait and switch if it's just cunt. That would be so good.

1220
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,420
I wish.

1221
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,420
Is the answer obvious?

1222
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,420
Harded?

1223
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,920
I don't think so. There's too much spelling here for it to be obvious.

1224
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,680
The spelling is what's throwing me off.

1225
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,680
You want the answer?

1226
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,280
Yeah, I'm done with this fucking thing.

1227
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
A coconut.

1228
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,280
Wow.

1229
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,840
Oh, fuck off.

1230
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,080
That's actually pretty good.

1231
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,080
Answer, a coconut.

1232
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,080
By the way, what popped up in your head?

1233
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,080
You know, Shirley.

1234
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,080
Alright, alright.

1235
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,880
Keith fucking know what you've done.

1236
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Alright, last one.

1237
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Is that Russell Brand?

1238
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
I think that's Keegan-Michael Key.

1239
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,880
It's not Keegan-Michael Key.

1240
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,680
I think that is, let's see, let me look, let me get a little closer, but not too close.

1241
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,680
Yeah, it's Keegan-Michael Key.

1242
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,680
Yeah.

1243
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,680
What is that?

1244
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,680
Keegan-Michael Key.

1245
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:39,680
Dressed up as Ozzy Osbourne.

1246
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,680
Who is that?

1247
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,680
Who is this fucking guy?

1248
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,680
Who is this person?

1249
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,680
I don't know.

1250
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,680
Television show.

1251
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
That's what it says here.

1252
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
Keegan-Michael Key was on a television show.

1253
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,680
It's only, it's Tru, Tru, I don't know.

Trugerina.

I don't know if that's the name.

1257
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,680
I don't know what's going on.

1258
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
That's a different guy.

1259
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,680
There's all, these are all different.

1260
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,680
Wait a second.

1261
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
Yeah.

I don't know.

1266
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
I don't know.

1267
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
I don't know.

1268
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
I don't know.

1269
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680

1273
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,200
- It does.

1274
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,400
- You don't know what you're talking about, dude.

1275
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,160
- No, he's right for that.

1276
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,240
- I'm just so spot on today.

1277
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,160
- Fuck.

1278
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,640
- All right, you ready for your last road all pass?

1279
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,840
What gets longer if pulled fits snugly between breasts,

1280
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,200
slides neatly into a hole, chokes people

1281
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,040
when used incorrectly, and works well when jerked.

1282
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,460
- What did they say about breasts?

1283
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,680
What the hell?

1284
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
- What are breasts?

1285
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,480
- Wait, say it one more time.

1286
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,600
- What gets longer if pulled fits snugly

1287
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,480
between breasts, slides neatly into a hole, chokes people when used incorrectly, and works

1288
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,480
well when jerked.

1289
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
Oh I know this one.

1290
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,880
This one's easy dude.

1291
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,120
Come on, you got this.

1292
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,120
You can do this.

1293
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,480
I believe in you.

1294
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,480
Like a pen maybe?

1295
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,880
Yeah, everybody else knows the answer except for you.

1296
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,800
Yeah, you look so stupid right now.

1297
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,360
Sharon's never gonna fuck you.

1298
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:31,920
Why would the fit snugly... I'm now just like confused about the fit snugly in breasts thing.

1299
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,320
That's one of the big clues.

1300
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
So it has something to do with boobs?

1301
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,320
No.

1302
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,640
No, it fits snugly between breasts.

1303
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,640
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

1304
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,320
Oh, it's chicken.

1305
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,320
Is it?

1306
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,680
Let's see.

1307
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,680
Is it chicken?

1308
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,680
Let's see.

1309
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,840
No, it's not chicken.

1310
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,040
What else could it be other than a seatbelt?

1311
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,760
Oh fuck off.

1312
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:02,320
I would like to come out and say to everybody, I thought that it was chicken.

1313
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,720
And I was like, Pat, you fucking idiot.

1314
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,840
You don't know that it's chicken.

1315
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,600
Fuck dude.

1316
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,880
Because the jerk thing.

1317
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,320
Slides neatly into a hole.

1318
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,320
Pulled.

1319
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,200
Like these are all kinds of chicken that you can eat.

1320
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,280
Slides neatly into a hole.

1321
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,280
My mouth!

1322
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,280
Yeah.

1323
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,280
Yeah, he's demonstrating.

1324
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,280
Tell me that doesn't look like a hole.

1325
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,280
That's a good chicken hole.

1326
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,280
If I was a chicken, I would love to slide in there.

1327
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,280
Yeah, I would love to have you.

1328
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,280
So, did you find these dirty riddles funny too?
