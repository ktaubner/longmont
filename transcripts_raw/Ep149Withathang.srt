00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,200
Podcasts are the bomb, lads.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,200
You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Stop! Not doing a dubstep thing!

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,700
No.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,400
No, you guys ruined it already.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,900
You know what?

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm not-

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
No, don't mind me.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:54,400
*Beatboxing*

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,900
Now end it, finish it up!

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
BUM BUM BUM BUM

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
BUM BUM BUM BUM

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
That was horrible. That was a bad ending.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
That's the worst ending I've ever seen.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
That is Electric Funeral by Black Sabbath.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
So that song has to have an ending at some point, right?

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,900
I did a cover.

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
You have to have some kind of ending for it that you could use.

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
You need a better ending.

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
But instead you just hit BOW BOW BOW

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
You just kind of did the same.

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
That's how the song ends!

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Well they should have written a better ending.

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,900
That's one of the top ten Sabbath songs.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,780
It's Iron Man, War Pigs, and they didn't write any other songs to my knowledge.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,780
What about Paranoid?

28
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,780
That was in Guitar Hero.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,760
No, I think that's actually by Justin Bieber.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
What the hell?

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Paranoid is Justin Bieber, yeah.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
No!

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Not Justin!

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,060
You can't talk about Justin Bieber and Black Sabbath in the same sentence!

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,060
Why?

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
They're two of the greatest guitarists of all time.

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
No!

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,060
Paranoid is a...

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,060
What?

40
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,620
Simon was telling me that, like, whatever the guy's name is, he has a funny name.

41
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,620
Tony Iommi?

42
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,660
No, the guy who writes the songs, he has a funny name.

43
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Geezer Butler?

44
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
Yeah, Geezer Butler.

45
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,820
he was like writing paranoid he like he the song is about being depressed and he

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,340
just forgot what the word for depression was he called it paranoid instead

47
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,580
because the song is all just like I am so crazy cuz I'm frowning all the time

48
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:14,740
yeah that type of thing. That's so funny. That rules. I love stuff like that and sundry. Yeah. Yeah. And what?

49
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,340
And sundry? Oh sorry I've been playing chivalry too so I like things and sundry. What the fuck are you saying?

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,320
my new thing. You don't know about how to talk medieval? No. That's kind of

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,440
embarrassing dude. You weren't talking medieval at all. I mostly say stuff like

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,080
that in sundry now so. Stop it. It's not medieval. It is medieval. That's just one word. Yeah it's pretty

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,520
pretty medieval. You're not saying there's no ye olde or anything. So if I was like so if I was like yeah I'm

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,600
gonna go to the store lasers and I think I'm gonna buy like some bread or

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,280
something would that be like a futuristic? No because if you were talking

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,880
of buying a laser. Okay wait I'm gonna go buy some space bread. Alright. Fairly well. Yeah

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:04,920
me and Patrick have been really into the future lately. So we've been talking sophisticated

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:14,160
like that. Well me I'm more medieval. 001100110011. In our robotic conversations we tend to mention

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,880
lot of technology like that so you enjoy the heavens you you you you foul boilers

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,080

computer game that's not yeah no it is medieval because I don't know how it

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,720
works so I'm just I I just medieval guy wouldn't even get to click a button I

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,520

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
escapism

72
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,960
You guys you know escapism when they make that like when you're so he's too much

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,400
They make you poop so make you poop yourself when they cut open your stomach so a bunch of flies go in

Yeah, I think cam knows camp cam knows a lot more about maybe you know tons of sundry about medieval torture stop stop saying it why

And then it explodes and then somebody in NASA doesn't realize it's exploding

114
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,300
So you still hear him be like like like the the like radio communications from NASA be like, okay approaching this speed

115
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,140
and they're just all dead and then the guy in the anchor goes like

I'm not sure what has happened

117
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
It's like it fucking exploded!

118
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
What are you doing?

How do you see that?

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
You're like, "Oh, hold on, we need to go to the research desk."

121
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
That was the fastest rocket I've ever seen!

122
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Wow! It was here one second, gone the next.

123
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
These fellas at NASA really know what they're doing.

124
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Yeah.

125
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Man, did you see, uh...

126
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Did you see Jeff Bezos is gonna be in, uh...

127
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,100
the... the space?

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,100
Yeah, they're sending him to space?

129
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Jeff Bezos is gonna go to space.

130
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
For what reason?

131
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,140
Uh, probably sex stuff.

132
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Probably right?

133
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
He's single now?

134
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,140
He's going up to mingle?

135
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,740
You know what, maybe he's only going to space so he can tell women that.

136
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,260
Why'd you say space like that?

137
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,260
What?

138
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Space.

156
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,820
- Nacho-ly Nacho.

157
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,500
- Who is it, Lee Lee Nachos?

158
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,660
- I've talked about this before,

159
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,200
I think I've talked about this before,

160
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,380
but when I was in like the third grade,

161
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,300
my Aunt Joanne came over my house

162
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,860
with a newspaper cutout of--

163
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,260
- My Aunt Joanne came over my house.

164
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,780
- That's all I gotta say.

165
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,320
But my Aunt Joanne came over my house

166
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,620
with a newspaper cutout of a picture of like Nacho Libre,

167
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,140
and she was like, "Doesn't this look like Patrick?

168
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,740
"Doesn't this look exactly like Patrick?"

169
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,420
- You were like a skinny little kid.

170
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
I was eight!

171
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,940
And she was like, "That looks just like Patrick!"

172
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,220
And I was like, "Why are you saying that to me?"

173
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,220
Why are you saying that to me?

174
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,980
Yeah, she's like, "See?

175
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
Told you.

176
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Same guy."

177
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,300
Yeah, that'd be a mean Halloween costume, I think, for you.

178
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Yeah.

179
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,860
Basically any Jack Black role, I think, I could do.

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,860
You should do Shallow Hal.

181
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

182
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,380
You should do the Shallow Hal remake, 'cause these days, you want to fuck a fat woman,

183
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,100
and then she looks skinny.

184
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,760
- I wanna see you in full body paint for Kung Fu Panda.

185
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,600
- Okay. - That's right.

186
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,300
- That would actually be,

187
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,140
that would be so fucking funny.

188
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,920
(laughing)

189
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,880
Not wearing a panda costume,

190
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,180
just like painting myself so I look like a panda.

191
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
- Wearing just a speedo and--

192
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,020
- And prosthetics. - And painting your entire body.

193
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,100
- Just gonna be like a panda face, dude.

194
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,980
- No, no, no prosthetics, nothing at all.

195
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,020
- Oh, I'm out.

196
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,660
- Just like white face paint.

197
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,940
ears some yeah yeah like just ears just ears yeah I'm like paws maybe you could

198
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,380
have like some no pause your paws no pause yeah you just have to know that

199
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,300
I'm a panda okay you just can't well be pretty obvious once you say skadoosh I

200
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,680
don't know it wouldn't really question much after that yeah not many pandas say

201
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,220
skadoosh yeah well now I'm rethinking this because I don't want to like be the

202
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,020
turtle. I don't want to. Maybe I'll be a panda costume and I'll be I'll be Master

203
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,100
Chief too. It'll probably not be it'll probably not be a good look for me to

204
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,780
only use paint. I mean from the back people are gonna be pretty scared and

205
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,700
confused. Yeah. I hope this he turns around there's some white on that face.

206
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,100
Yeah. And when you turn around people be like oh he's Kung Fu Panda. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
I hope.

208
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,300
Also, you need to be actively doing Kung Fu to avoid the...

209
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,680
I'm looking at Kung Fu Panda right now and he's... the pattern of his fur is that his

210
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,660
arms and legs are black and everything else is white except for the circles around his

211
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
eyes.

212
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,060
So I think you might be fine, you know, as long as maybe you don't sweat and the paint

213
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,220
from your armpits goes down and covers your midsection.

214
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
That might be a little tough.

215
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
Or up to your face.

216
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,420
That would also be...

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
That would be...

218
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,540
Hanged upside down. Yeah, it's some form of medieval torture. Maybe yeah, or sundry, you know

219
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,500
Or sundry, whichever maybe maybe I go maybe like maybe I go like cropped shirt like cropped long-sleeve

220
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,420
Shirt women love that. No, you that's I mean then just you might as well not be even dress up as a panda

221
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,860
You gotta do like I'm talking like skin tight skin tight under armor cut you talk so much about

222
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,260
your entire body to be Nightcrawler and you know you're bitching out about a

223
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,980
panda he's blue he's a deep blue my friend blue is a dark dark blue not any

224
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,240
yellow eyes which is hard yeah yeah the yellow eyes would be that

225
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,300
also he doesn't know kung-fu or how to Nightcrawler he knows how to teleport

226
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,180
tail though that's not kung-fu teleporting is good it's not kung-fu

227
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,420
It's a type of Kung Fu.

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
I think he's right.

229
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,100
Teleporting is magic.

230
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,780
Teleporting is like the furthest level of Kung Fu.

231
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
I mean, you of all people should at least pretend

232
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,620
to know this, Caleb.

233
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,500
It's a form of sorcery.

234
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,940
But I guess I wouldn't expect you to.

235
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,060
I mean, you don't really know anything about medieval times.

236
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
So you obviously don't know anything about this.

237
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,820
There's something called sorcery, all right,

238
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,020
and that comes from magic books.

239
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,580
But then there's also something called chi, okay?

240
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
Which is what I'm centering myself with right now

241
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,420
to avoid murdering you with my bare hands.

242
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,460
There's all types of chi too.

243
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,220
There's nacho chi, there's--

244
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,260
So you'd agree that it's a form of magic.

245
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Yeah, this is Nacho Chi.

246
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,260
That's right.

247
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Whose Chi is it?

248
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Nacho's.

249
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Nacho Chi.

250
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,300
But Chi is, I guess, Chi is not really magic though.

251
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,260
Chi is like essence and spiritual power that you can use to teleport.

252
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,980
I don't think that Nightcrawler uses Chi to teleport.

253
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
I think he uses magic.

254
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,900
No, he uses Chi in Sunday as well.

255
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,820
He uses oomph to teleport.

256
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Shut up!

257
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
What does that even mean?

258
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,100
It's the sound that they make.

259
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
It's bamf.

260
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh, bamf.

261
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,020
fucking idiot don't even know shit about X-Men dude you guys both don't know

262
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,060
anything and I'm the only smart guy on this podcast all right wait till I say

263
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,940
that's a huge that's very embarrassing for me to not know the Nightcrawler

264
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,900
sound can we restart the whole episode no because I'm now I'm starting to think

265
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,140
about chi and its various uses I think I think nobody would mind if we restarted

266
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,620
the whole thing I'm a high chi individual yeah you're very low chi I have insanely

267
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm extremely high chi.

268
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,180
You have very low chi.

269
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,360
You don't know anything, dude.

270
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
I've never seen you meditate once.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,940
I'm one of the best meditators.

272
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,260
I've meditated for hours.

273
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,100
No, you're not.

274
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,940
No, you're not.

275
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,760
You don't know anything.

276
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
Yeah, I have.

277
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
You cannot meditate for hours.

278
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,300
I've meditated on a beach and I've lost a sense of myself

279
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,140
'cause I've had so much chi in my body.

280
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:30,980
That's bad.

281
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,080
That's not a good thing to lose a sense of self.

282
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,920
That's what meditation is about, okay?

283
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
No, it's not.

284
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,100
You're talking to the foremost expert on chi

285
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,120
on this podcast.

286
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,920
me. No, you're not talking to yourself. I'm talking to myself. Hey, what's up? Okay, crazy.

287
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm hanging out. Oh, you're fucking crazy. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't expect a lesser mind

288
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,400
to understand, you know, the power of Zen of talking to yourself, but, you know, being

289
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,000
at one with yourself. Here's the truth, my mind is completely turned off. You know, people

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,600
who often have dim minds will label others as crazy, whose ideas they can't comprehend.

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,320
Okay, okay. Yeah. And sundry, but whatever. I kind of am like the perfect hybrid between

292
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,920
medieval knight and a Chinese monk. Yeah. In sundry with my chi yeah. Yeah.

293
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,760
Yeah because I basically yeah because I mix the spiritual beliefs of

294
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:26,560
the Far East and the Orient with the bravery and the tactics of a

295
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,120
medieval knight, an officer actually. You know they call me a berserker.

296
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,860
don't call you a berserker. A berserker is not a knight because a berserker follows a code of

297
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,580
chivalry a berserker has no code it's chaos. Well they call me the berserker

298
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,740
knight. They don't call you that. It's a nickname. Who calls you that? A berserker with a code is not a knight.

299
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,700
Yeah I mean a berserker and knight are like opposites. Yeah. They're like opposite

300
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,860
ends of the order and chaos kind of spectrum. Would two white guys know or would the

301
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,420
berserker knight know? I think me. I think I would know. Would two white guys know or would a pink guy

302
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,740
know that's a good question I do look very pink today because I'm so filled

303
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,500
with rage as a berserker you look like you look like Majin Buu I know oh no I

304
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,540
wasn't gonna say Majin Buu but that's pretty good I was gonna say you look

305
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:21,020
like you look like if mr. bubble already so much worse just say I'm Majin Buu no

306
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Who's Mr. Bubble?

307
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
You guys don't know Mr. Bubble?

308
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,020
I look like Mr. Bubble?

309
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,020
Yeah, you look like pink...

310
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I just googled Mr. Bubble and nothing came up.

311
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
This is inventing a fucking character, man.

312
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Oh, okay, here we go.

313
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Yeah, Mr. Bubble.

314
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,020
You should not be using this on your body.

315
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
This looks like it will kill you.

316
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Why? I use that every day.

317
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Mr. Bubble?

318
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
Yeah.

319
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
This is not acceptable.

320
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,020
It's a bubble bath. It's colored exactly like...

321
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
You take a bubble bath every day?

322
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Yes, I use this in the shower.

323
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
Really?

324
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
No. What the fuck? Why would I do that?

325
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't know.

326
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
Because you said that. You said you'd do it.

327
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Oh, now I can't even believe my friends anymore.

328
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,020
You're robbing me of my chi every time you lie to me.

329
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,020
And one day the entire Earth is going to be in grave danger.

330
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,020
I do think you're sure.

331
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,020
And I will have to defend it.

332
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm talking about Mr. Bubble now.

333
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Shut up!

334
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
No!

335
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
Nobody cares about Mr. Bubble!

336
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,380
They want to hear about cheating!

337
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
His name isn't even Mr. Bubble.

338
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
It says Mr. Bubbles.

339
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
No, it's Mr. Bubble.

340
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,460
Here it says Mr. Bubble, but then here it says Mr. Bubbles.

341
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
What's the difference?

342
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,220
You're doing the Mario effect to me right now.

343
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Oh, Mr. Bubbles is from Bioshock.

344
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Yeah.

345
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Okay.

346
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,740
It corrected my search.

347
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,500
I searched Mr. Bubble and it said, "You mean Mr. Bubbles?"

348
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,620
No, I mean Mr. Bubble.

349
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,020
Can you guys get off the computer?

350
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Okay.

351
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Yeah, sure.

352
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,500
Just turn off your computers for one second.

353
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
No, don't leave.

354
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,220
No, you have to come back.

355
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,220
Guys.

356
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,420
Well, guess who it is.

357
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
It's just me.

358
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,420
Just like I wanted.

359
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
Just as I planned.

360
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,820
Now, I can teach you all sorts of chi tricks.

361
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,340
Chi, by the way, is short for China, which is where chi comes from.

362
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,340
And I source...

363
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
Don't breathe.

364
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Thank you.

365
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Stop!

366
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,340
You look like...

367
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,140
Nobody wants to hear that, dude.

368
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,660
Cam just turned off his camera.

369
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,660
- Whatever man, anyway, the best way to focus your chi

370
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,580
is to, it's a technique, ancient Chinese technique

371
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,420
called edging.

372
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,460
- It's not.

373
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,300
No.

374
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,460
- Yeah, so you basically rub the tip of your--

375
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,860
- I mean, a real monk would not even touch his thing.

376
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,460
- Yeah, you rub the tip of your penis

377
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,540
like a roller deodorant.

378
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
- Monks take a vow, the monks sign a thing

379
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,460
that says no Tadra touching.

380
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,060
We don't touch it.

381
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,140
- I touch my little Tadra all the time

382
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,980
and I'm one of the best monks in the world.

383
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,660
- So you just lost your place in the order of the monks.

384
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Explain my baggy clothes if I ain't no monk, huh?

385
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
You're a hip-hop.

386
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
Shit.

387
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
You mean that?

388
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:59,020
All right, maybe I might be giving up on the monk code, and I might let myself come, and

389
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,500
I might become a rapper now.

390
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Yeah?

391
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Yeah.

392
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
What's your rapping name?

393
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Fucking Swag Fucker.

394
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Swag Fucker?

395
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,300
Is it one word or two words?

396
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Three words.

397
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Where's the...

398
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Swag Fucker.

399
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,380
What the hell? Swag fuck her.

400
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Oh man. That's right.

401
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,180
Big word expecting that.

402
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,500
I wasn't expecting that. My chi tricks.

403
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,100
You don't have any chi tricks. I can't emphasize that enough. That wasn't chi.

404
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm gonna chi grab something in my room right now.

405
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,300
That's the force. You're thinking of the force. It moved a little bit. It didn't move.

406
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,420
Your webcam moved.

407
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:43,140

411
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,740

then fine what you talk about something

416
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,040
Okay.

417
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Let's- and here's- here you go.

418
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,740
You're not allowed to use Google and just read a website.

419
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,340
You have to talk about something, Pat.

420
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,840
Alright.

421
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,340
Go.

422
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,340
Have you ever seen, um, the movie...

423
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,540
The, uh...

424
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,040
Doctor...

425
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,540
It's either Strange Love or- or...

426
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,340
Strange?

427
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,840
Doctor Strange.

428
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,340
Have you seen Doctor Strange?

429
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,840
No.

430
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,040
So you're saying I have- well, this is back to Chi, man.

431
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,540
I haven't seen-

432
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,040
You fucked it up!

433
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
It's not back to Chi.

434
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
Is there Chi in Doctor Strange?

435
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Yeah, he gets uh...

436
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Tilda Swinton plays a Chinese man.

437
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,040
An old, old Chinese man.

438
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,040
And gifts him with the power of Chi.

439
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,040
I never saw that movie.

440
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I thought it looked...

441
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
It looked a little too trippy for me.

442
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Isn't it in Tibet?

443
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
I don't want to step on any...

444
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Oh shit.

445
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
China, Tibet, same shit.

446
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
No, no, don't, no.

447
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
We can't, no.

448
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,480
It's like saying the US and Hawaii.

449
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,760
That's not the same.

450
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,000
Tibet's basically Hawaii.

451
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,120
It's where all the--

452
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,880
Tibet is not a tropical island paradise.

453
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,960
Here, how about this?

454
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,200
Tibet is not part of China.

455
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,440
It's part of the United States.

456
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,800
I don't even know what the situation over there is.

457
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
I don't want to say something that'll get us kicked out.

458
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,240
It's probably good, dude.

459
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,160
Get kicked out of what?

460
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
We're not in Tibet right now.

461
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,080
What are you talking about?

462
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,040
What if we get kicked off the Chinese market?

463
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,840
I don't think anybody has ever listened to our podcast

464
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
in China.

465
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,840
How do you know?

466
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Because we would have statistical information.

467
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
We get analytics.

468
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Can we look up the analytics right now?

469
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,480
I'll look at it right now.

470
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Here, I'm logging in.

471
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,160
If we have a single Chinese listener, then I will...

472
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Alright, I'm logging in.

473
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm typing in the password.

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,720
You saw what John Cena had to do?

475
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
He had to learn Chinese.

476
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
He didn't have to do that.

477
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
He had to learn Chinese.

478
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,920
He did that because he wanted to.

479
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Did he?

480
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
I don't know.

481
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Okay, so...

482
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
But yeah, it's a bet.

483
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,320
I mean, have you seen how strong that guy is?

484
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,680
Nobody can make him do anything.

485
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
No, no.

486
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,040
You could take down China with one punch.

487
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Let's see.

488
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
Yep, nobody in China.

489
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Zero.

490
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Okay, alright, Tibet's Hawaii.

491
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Don't say Tibet's Hawaii!

492
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Tibet is as...

493
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Let's see what the top countries are.

494
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,800
United States, yep.

495
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Canada's next biggest.

496
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,560
So, I mean, I don't know about if I want...

497
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Okay, Canada is basically...

498
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,880
...is like Tibet for the United States.

499
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,560
Then we got the UK coming in after that.

500
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,080
I mean, even less I want them.

501
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,400
this you know here's my hope one day I mean they probably call this podcast

502
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,780
about cues over there yeah it's fucked up nice one day I pray that one day I log

503
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,660
on to pod bean to look at our analytics right I open up that map entire world

504
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,760
red white and blue America that's right every single listeners in America

505
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,800
because the entire world is America is - we have six downloads from Israel whoa

506
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:03,360
Sounds like a council has downloaded our podcast. Yeah, well um, because

507
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,440
it's because people say free to bet right? What's that all about? I think free

508
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,200
free is Chinese for for very nice. No. Why are you trying so hard to talk about

509
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,320
this when you don't know anything about it and are terrified of it? If it's free.

510
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,680
You can just move on.

511
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,840
If it's free, I'm taking it.

512
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,280
You're not, you can't take Tibet dude, they'll get mad.

513
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,600
China, the owners, will get mad at you.

514
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,360
I don't know if that's right!

515
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
They will, dude.

516
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,160
They own Tibet, it's like their pet.

517
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,680
We have 23 downloads from Poland.

518
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,880
I think it was probably one person who just downloaded the same episode 23 times by accident.

519
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,140
(laughter)

520
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,640
- Yeah.

521
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,720
- Fuck them, dude.

522
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
We should take down Tibet, I think.

523
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,640
- Three from Serbia. - No!

524
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,120
- Why?

525
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,240
- Can we, dude, we're all across the world.

526
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,960
God damn, dude.

527
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,640
- Anybody in Galactoy? - One from Nepal.

528
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,360
- Yep, it says five trillion in Galactoy.

529
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,640
- Ooh, wow.

530
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
That's not bad.

531
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,740
- Should we read our analytics on the show?

532
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,640
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

533
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Four from Saudi Arabia.

534
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
Yo, my cousins!

535
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm about to get flown out, fuck.

536
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,500
Three in Hong Kong.

537
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,720
Would you guys do that?

538
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,040
If a Saudi oil prince--

539
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,680
It's funny, it's Hong Kong you, but not China.

540
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,120
Okay.

541
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,960
That's a stance Pabin's taking.

542
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,800
If a Saudi oil prince asked us three

543
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,720
to come out for a lavish vacation for one week

544
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
in the United Arab Emirates.

545
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,840
Absolutely, yes.

546
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Yes, right, you know, we know what's happening

547
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:57,540
What's what's happening? He's gonna fuck our faces and our assholes. He's not gonna do that and he's friendly. They have a they're a friendly country

548
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,500
Yeah, I guess you're right Saudi Arabia. Have you seen like mostly friendly country?

549
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,200
I mean they Steve Harvey goes over there all the time. Yeah, they have they got big Tigers and stuff that they have

550
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,880
It's pets. I just don't even kill anyone

551
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,320
I mean to throw the Tigers to be that friendly the people got to be for I guess you're right

552
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,200
you gotta be really a very empathetic person. I looked up Steve Harvey Dubai

That guy who's pointing at him, that's Nas Daily.

570
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
That guy who used to post all those videos

571
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
where he, like, on Facebook and shit

572
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
where, like, he got a ton of followers

573
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
and he would, like, post things. He was like,

574
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
"Here's why I wear a t-shirt that has a loading bar on it.

575
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
It represents the days of my life

576
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
and I wear a different one every day."

577
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
And then he did a bunch of videos that were, like,

578
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:59,720

Swank's most beautiful Pokemon.

582
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,360
Is he doing a version of Family Feud there?

583
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I would hope.

584
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
That'd be sick dude.

He has a message.

602
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I haven't seen it, okay.

603
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,120
I thought it was, I like that that's the thing that made you feel bad is that I had seen it before.

604
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,120
I thought I was giving you like a treat.

605
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
No.

606
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
No.

607
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Let me tell you something, image of Steve Harvey, never a treat.

What are you talking about?

611
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
He's amazing.

612
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,120
He looks like a Chuck E. Cheese animatronic.

613
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
No, I love Steve Harvey.

614

618
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
He just texted me.

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,200
Sometimes, he likes to watch Family Feud, and hey, I do too.

620
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,920
Sometimes he just texts me the things that he saw on Family Feud that night.

621
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,320
Let me see if I can...

622
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
You gotta read one, dude.

I wasn't supposed to talk about that.

630
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I'm so fucking sorry.

631
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
We're on the lineup for next year though.

632
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
God damn it.

633
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Watching Family Feud.

634
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Question. You're fishing in the ocean and pull up a mermaid.

635
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,320
What are you going to do?

636
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320

00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I don't remember what it's named

692
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,540
It's probably that was the one that was the one where they did Gardevoir and they were like

693
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,660
Oh, we saw how many people freaked out about guard or we gotta go even further dude Gardevoir is a psycho type creature

694
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:45,040
You know, she crazy in the bedroom. See a little bit crazy. Yeah, I need me a Pokemon

695
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,040
that's a little bit crazy and makes you breakfast in the morning.

696
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Rabbit, Pokemon, Lopunny. Look up Lopunny. L-O-P-U-N-N-Y.

697
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
I'd rather look up Lola Bunny over here.

698
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
I mean, you pretty much are, yeah.

699
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Oh, fuck!

700
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Damn, she's got a bikini on.

701
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,040
Yeah, pretty crazy that they went for that one.

702
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Yeah, that's nuts.

703
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,040
That one's like, Gardevoir at least has some plausible deniability of like,

704
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,880
looks like a wedding dress it's beautiful

705
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,360
below parties you know that's

706
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,720
yet i don't need a plausible deniability because i did not have a tough but that

707
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,360
money

708
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,640
what's the it's a pokey mom

709
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,040
it's not an animal

710
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,240
that's i mean it's still your that's a you're saying that about some ten year

711
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,120
olds best friends basically

712
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,400
successfully what it could be what you

713
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
What are you saying here?

714
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
That's what Pokemon are.

715
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Are you saying, "I would fuck this kid's pet."

716
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Oh no.

717
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
No, it's not a pet.

718
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
I told you, it's not an animal.

719
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
It's a warrior.

720
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
It's definitely a pet.

721
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,400
It's either a pet or a best friend.

722
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Alright, there's a...

723
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
Wait, there's gotta...

724
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
There's so many comments on here.

725
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Yeah, there are a whole lot, dude.

726
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,400
We can't waste time.

727
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Holy shit.

728
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Wait, I gotta...

729
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
The comments are all insanely long, too.

730
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
I like her most.

731
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
She is really strong.

732
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
She has mega form.

733
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
She is really beautiful.

734
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
She is best in fairy.

735
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,800
be dragon type pokemon easily. Alright, but talk about the ratio here, you know? I don't

736
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,800
care about her abilities. You know? Unless she has a vacuum ability. I mean, you're gonna

737
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:23,080
care about her abilities. Yeah. Yeah. Um, there's, these are, Gardevoir's my most favorite

738
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,400
pokemon. She was based off of a guardian angel. I can't believe she is treated like crap!

739
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,280
And she will risk her own life to protect her trainer. She can even create a small black

740
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,760
cold just to protect her trainer. It's just sad to see that Gardevoir is treated so badly.

741
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
She is beautiful.

742
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,600
Ladies, I really love her design. This Pokemon is really really fabulous. Faf-faf-fabulous.

743
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
I also love her shiny style too.

744
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,800
I know Gardevoir can be male, but I usually treat it as female.

745
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,920
What?

746
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,920
There's male Pokemon?

747
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,640
Oh yeah, we should have gone in on that angle with you.

748
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
I still beat it up.

749
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,720
(laughs)

750
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,240
- These, yeah, these comments are, are...

751
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,680
It's so graceful, elegant, beautiful, cute, everything.

752
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
It deserves more.

753
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,800
And it's so strong, too.

754
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,040
It's better than any dumb Eevee or Pikachu.

755
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,220
And don't go off about all the porn going around.

756
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,680
It's not Gardevoir's fault.

757
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,380
(laughs)

758
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,640
- It's not Gardevoir's, is it Revenge porn?

759
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,480
(laughs)

760
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,520
- Speaking of that, this comment here says,

761
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,320
it's beautiful, but the fan art, no.

762
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,660
not friendly

763
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:34,520
no more fan art this thing is beautiful strong protective and uh... i don't know

764
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,200
as kentrick lamar said

765
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,520
be humble

766
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,840
wow

767
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,960
this is some serious fan art

768
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,540
someone has a gardevoir with a gaping

769
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,300
asshole looks like it's been opened with some sort of

770
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,860
like vice

771
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,980
uh... what else

772
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,200
what else

773
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,080
this is it

774
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,040
sucking a rhinos penis

775
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,700
the uh... uh... okay you know what you mean a ryan horn

776
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,220
uh... right on i don't know

777
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,920
uh... what else they got here

778
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,520
uh... what is purple nipples uh...

779
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,120
that's so that's interesting owner also the long guard or style penis

780
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,400
i'd just learned

781
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,120
record for is beautiful both on the outside and inside

782
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,480
that's right

783
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Yeah, beautiful on the inside.

784
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,600
Most of the... my problem with like when people take fictional characters that are non-human

785
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:37,600
and then draw like a sex version, they always just make it a woman with the same colored

786
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
hair.

787
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
Yeah.

788
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
That's lazy, dude.

789
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,000
What are you doing?

790
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's just lazy.

791
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I mean, I...

792
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,800
I mean I'm not trying to, you know, not all the time look up Gardevoir naked giant pussy,

793
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,720
but when I do, I don't want it to be just some green haired woman.

794
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,520
Right, you want the trainer to be in there too, is what I'm getting from this, right?

795
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
This is so messed up.

796
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,360
You want Ash Ketchum messed up as hell.

797
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,360
No!

798
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,760
No, I want, I want the, she should have the dress on, it should be tasteful.

799
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960
You want to see her come out of the Pokeball so you know she's a Pokemon.

800
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,520
That's right. That is exactly right. Yeah, I need some proof.

801
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,080
Yeah. I agree that Gardevoir's looks are pretty. I think the reason why she's treated as porn

802
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,200
is all because of that chest spike.

803
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Dude, that's chest spike? I didn't even know.

804
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Chest spike.

805
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wow.

806
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,200
Can we move on from this so Caleb can stop talking about Gardevoir?

807
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Every time I get home from work, I go to my computer and search Gardevoir on Google Images.

808
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,800
Then I grab my lotion and rub it on my wiener.

809
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,040
(laughing)

810
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:50,880
- Oh fuck, that's awesome.

811
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,120
That kid rules.

812
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,800
- That's not a kid, it's a get home from work.

813
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,140
- That guy rules.

814
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,340
- Number two.

815
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,260
My low tick.

816
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
This is a snake.

817
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,140
- Yeah, this one is not doing it for me.

818
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
- This is a snake with beautiful hair.

819
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,820
- I'm gonna be real.

820
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,940
Yeah, this is why this list is so funny to me is because it starts off with Gardevoir, which is like okay understandable

821
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,060
I mean, you know I'm not gonna endorse fucking wanting to fuck Pokemon

822
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:21,460
But yeah, you know Gardevoir like whatever that that one I get the rest of these are all like snakes and dogs

823
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,520
Yeah, this is literally just a

824
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,420
This is snake exact. It's a worm. It's a colorful

825
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,860
Well this this one

826
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:41,200
Evolves from my lotic evolves from Phoebus. Yeah, which is just like a bonefish. It's like an ugly magic carp. Yeah

827
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,300
Yeah, it's like a rotten magic carp. Oh, yeah Phoebus looks messed up. I just don't like her mustache looking thing

828
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,800
What eyebrows I'm thinking they're talking about her eyebrows

829
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,920
Here's a comment here no offense my lotic fans, but she kind of looks like a slug yeah

830
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:09,160
But well more of a beautiful one still I think people judge Gardevoir a bit too harshly while Milotic gets all the attention

831
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,520
She's beautiful, but it's Pokemon abuse

832
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,180
Milotic starts as an ugly Phoebus, but transforms into the world's prettiest Pokemon

833
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,080
She looks like the goddess of the sea and even the Pokédex states that she is the most beautiful Pokemon

834
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,960
If you think Gardevoir is the prettiest then you must think poop is beautiful

835
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,160
That's kind of unfair that the Pokédex says uh, yeah, just states it outright

836
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:39,480
That's kind of um, it's kind of not. Okay. I think I think they should leave it up to I

837
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,280
Agree fans to decide toots looks like a slug in mascara

838
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,520
All right calling a Pokemon

839
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,740
A little more personal than I yeah comfortable with maybe

840
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,240
Great design tomboys won't like her because she's girly

841
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,480
(laughter)

842
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,260
- This person also said,

843
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,240
"I just don't like her mustache and her black spots.

844
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
"Other than that, she's pretty."

845
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,360
Is there something we're missing here?

846
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,120
- A mustache?

847
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,960
- I think it's just the eyebrows thing.

848
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,800
- I think it is.

849
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
- They're clearly eyebrows though.

850
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,180
- Yeah, what's wrong with these people?

851
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,160
Number three.

852
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,320
- It looks like Chinesse legendary dragon to me.

853
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
special personality and simple look

854
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,000
it is beautiful like a chinese legendary dragon

855
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,820
number three

856
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,000
prima rena

857
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,980
this is a seal

858
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,320
this is a seal dog

859
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
this is a dog seal dressed like a ballerina this is a good pokemon to have

860
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,760
if it learns uh...

861
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,080
if it learns what?

862
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,640
what patrick spit it out

863
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,600
if it learns moon blast it got me through the it got me through the

864
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm going to moon this Pokemon and then I'm going to blast it.

865
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Coming through the finals.

866
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,600
No.

867
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Primarina, in my opinion, is the most beautiful Pokemon and I think she is most beautiful than Melodic.

868
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Her hair are just so pretty, her eyes are blue as ocean and her eyelashes are killer.

869
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,600
She is a mermaid ocean queen.

870
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Obviously the most beautiful starter on par with Milotic.

871
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Don't give me that Serperior.

872
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,520
No question this challenger needs to be in the top 10.

873
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,700
It even has a run at being completely viable.

874
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,240
It's like a goddamn fairy tale.

875
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,280
How the unwanted Popplio becomes something so sought after.

876
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,540
I mean, jeez, it uses a goddamn spirit bomb.

877
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,600
Majestic!

878
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,160
Rule 34, please, you do not want to do this.

879
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,880
(laughing)

880
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,840
- Beautiful, majestic, sweet, caring, kind.

881
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,460
She is just lovely.

882
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,040
- I want her so bad.

883
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,280
(laughter)

884
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,500
- That's what I mean, that's not,

885
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,200
man you can just go look at a mermaid,

886
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,380
you don't have to look at what this dog did.

887
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,540
- I need Primarina so bad, I need that.

888
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,040
- Her eyes stun me.

889
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,300
(laughter)

890
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,320
Oh man.

891
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
- She's so beautiful, queen, period.

892
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,000
- Too pretty and powerful.

893
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,200
see this is this is a heavy drop off here

894
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,160
for the uh... so this is what i'm talking about how how they're not more like

895
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,720
sexual look they didn't even put the sexy rabbit in the italy a playboy boy

896
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,160
that's not even the time i received to upset that the sexy rabbit isn't i'm

897
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,800
that i don't know what i don't name is that or that should absolutely be over a

898
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
thing this is a dog with multiple tell i'm sorry what about who's making this

899
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,040
list

900
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,920
mhm horny children

901
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,080
uh...

902
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,000
now I don't want to do it. Or maybe you're the one who said that, who's making the list.

903
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,480
Or grown men who want to fuck dogs maybe. Yeah, probably, you know, honestly.

904
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,960
One guy said he winks his wiener when he comes home from work.

905
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,440
Yeah, I guess you're right, he winks it. Number four is nine tails. I guess the appeal of this is like

906
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:13,360
a whole lot, there's a lot there. Yeah, I mean nine asses? I mean yeah, what kind of a dump truck ass

907
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,440
could possibly support Ninetales.

908
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,280
You know?

909
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,720
- Here's a comment.

910
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,780
Ninetales, so much Ninetales.

911
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,040
People just think Gardevoir is the most beautiful Pokemon

912
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,080
because it's human-like.

913
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,820
Ninetales really takes the cake.

914
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,680
It's powerful, myth-like, and its fur is so shiny.

915
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,520
If you grab one of its beautiful tails,

916
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,920
you will be cursed forever.

917
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,960
- You know, there's a reason that among the Pokeparents memes

918
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,440
Ninetales is the MILF.

919
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,200
- What?

920
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,760
- Ninetales is a MILF, I guess.

921
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,760
Why would you look at like a dog and call it a MILF?

922
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,760
I don't know.

923
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Here's a poem.

924
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,760
Here's a poem I wrote about this beautiful fox.

925
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
Nine tails, oh nine tails.

926
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Spellbound eyes so enchanting.

927
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Tails that bring curses for those who grab them.

928
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,760
Wait, so if you grab the tail...

929
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Oh, that's why she's so high, dude.

930
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
Cause it's like, it's forbidden fruit.

931
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
More so than any other dog.

932
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
Nine tails.

933
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,180
(laughing)

934
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,700
- Ninth Tales, enchanting eyes, elegant beauty

935
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,100
that matches no other, fire of a burning passion.

936
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,260
The beauty is unmistakable.

937
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,900
- This is amazing.

938
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,860
- The fire of a burning passion.

939
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,700
- That's so beautiful.

940
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,760
- It's a dog.

941
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,180
(laughing)

942
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,340
- The milfy dog though, I guess.

943
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,940
- I hate that they called it a milf.

944
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,940
- Just relax, Patrick.

945
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,900
You're such a prude.

946
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,740
- I guess I am.

947
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,680
cartoon

948
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,840
just you know i think it almost you're so conservative about this it feels like

949
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,840
you're covering up your desire for the stuff

950
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,000
uh... all mad dog grabbing all nine of its tails we fucking hit it from the

951
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,220
back of the car

952
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,120
uh...

953
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,740
what's wrong with these people all my god

954
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,680
you nasty

955
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,100
i'm not number five we stop talking about the burning passion of this book

956
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,000
and how romantic an evening with it would be.

957
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,040
- Okay, we get it, it has beautiful red eyes

958
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,080
that just cut right through you.

959
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,520
But, I mean, can we stop talking about fucking eating

960
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,560
its nine pussies?

961
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,400
What the hell?

962
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,240
- And a stunning conversation list.

963
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,120
- It has nine tails.

964
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,880
- Yeah, you would know, you've done a lot of research

965
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,280
on the matter, have you?

966
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,400
- I just don't like it when you guys switch it.

967
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,800
- Number five, dragonair.

968
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,080
This is another worm.

969
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,560
- Yeah, this is straight up a worm.

970
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,280
- This is a worm with big ears.

971
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,120
- This is a worm that turns into like--

972
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,760
- This is a worm that turns into a big--

973

turns into a dragon tails dragon. But it can fly right? Yeah. A flying worm. Suck you upside down.

974
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,560
Suck your shit off upside down dude. I don't know what to tell you.

975
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,720
I need to find, I need to hear from the kind of people that want to fuck this flying worm.

976
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,280
I need to know, like you know the dog, it's like okay I know there's a lot of people online who

977
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,160
want to fuck a dog. I don't think I've ever like ever read anything from somebody who wants to

978
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,240
for two years. Every time I see it I just fall completely silent. That's how beautiful it

979
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,600
is. This should be number one. Google her with safe search off, I dare you. What? It doesn't

980
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:24,600
have arms or legs or anything. It's a line. Hey, for research purposes, Dragonair nasty

983
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
It's way worse though.

984
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
Yeah, it's way, way worse.

985
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,480
Oh, here, let's see, this one has a caption.

986
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:01,040
So this is Dragonair with a, what looks like a dildo that says Impale Lord on the side of

987
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
it.

988
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,040
Impale Lord?

989
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,680
Yeah, getting fucked in its cloaca and it says, "Wailord migration is just around the

990
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
corner.

991
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,280
Girl, I wanna see your vulva get wrecked by them all.

992
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
So keep up the good work."

993
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,280
Oh, that's nice and encouraging, I guess.

994
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
Yeah, I guess that's pretty nice.

995
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,280
I guess that's sweet.

996
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,600
I don't here's what okay well this is just not okay this is this one is a

997
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,080
dragonair sucking a digimon's penis and that I won't stand for that.

998
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,200
That's too far. Yeah you can't put a digimon and a pokemon together I won't allow that.

999
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,760
Fuck as many of these fucking rainbow dogs as you want but just don't mix the

1000
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,840
the universes please. That's fucked up. It's not okay. Is there any sexual digimon?

1001
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,840
Digimon?

1002
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Aren't there some Digimon that are just like people?

1003
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
Yeah, there are many.

1004
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,600
There are a lot of sexual Digimon.

1005
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,240
Yeah, because a lot of Digimon are just people with like weird, with like power.

1006
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:57,880
There's one Digimon that, from season 3, that the creator has like gone on record of being

1007
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:04,640
like "I hate you people because you can't Google the name of this Digimon anymore without

1008
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
it just being porn."

1009
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh yeah, I'm looking this up and one of the Digimon is just a woman in a bikini.

1010
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,640
Yeah, there are a lot like that.

1011
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,960
There are a lot that are like angels and stuff.

1012
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,720
There's one called Renamon that's like an anthropomorphic fox.

1013
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,880
And there's a lot of porn of that one.

1014
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,000
This one looks way more like a fox than a person.

1015
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah, no, that's the thing.

1016
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,840
That's why people want to drop porn of it so bad.

1017
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,360
If it's just a person, it's not as interesting.

1018
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,680
Number six, Glaceon.

1019
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
This is just a dog.

1020
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,960
This is the closest to the dog that we had.

1021
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
This is just an ice dog.

1022
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,320
This is a dog and if you fuck it your dick's gonna be really cold.

1023
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,320
Yeah.

1024
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
It's a very cold dog.

1025
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,080
Uh, yeah, now this is, isn't this the same thing as Ninetales or something?

1026
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,720
Which, uh, which Eeveelution are you guys?

1027
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,720
Oh, so now you get into it.

1028
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,200
I wanna know which Eeveelution you are.

1029
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,520
Why should you fuck me, you fucking freak?

1030
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,520

1042
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,840
He muted himself.

1043
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,920
You fucker. Glaceon reminds me of an angel. She is so pretty. If I was a

1044
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,680
Pokemon, I would love to be Glaceon.

1045
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,920
She was, here's a comment. She was my guardian when I was born.

1046
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:19,320
She is so pretty, her color, her cry too much.

1047
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,960
Oh, her cry too much for me.

1048
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Her cry too much though.

1049
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,520
She play too much.

1050
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,000
She play far too much.

1051
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,040
This one, each word is capitalized.

1052
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,680
She's not always a girl.

1053
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
Wow.

1054
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Wow.

1055
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,520
That'll blow your mind.

1056
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,920
Yeah, that'll be a serious Ace Ventura moment.

1057
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,920
Number seven is Ab-Sol.

1058
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
Ab-Sol is like a...

1059
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
Again, a dog.

1060
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,400
again a dog yeah it's a dog it's got a it's got a scythe for an ear yeah it's a

1061
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,120
dog with like an evil Bluetooth headset yeah that's it's a dog dude I mean like

1062
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:06,480
the next four just like dog cat what is wrong with these people dude I mean I

1063
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,200
guess it's probably diagnosable what is wrong with them huh could you go to the

1064
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,760
doctor be like hey I want to fuck dogs like can you like give me medicine

1065
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,280
I'm sure you could go to like a therapist or something. I don't know about the doctor.

1066
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,840
I don't know if the doctor usually deals with that kind of stuff.

1067
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
You go to a doctor and you tell them that. All he'll do is check your blood pressure.

1068
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,640
Yep, and be like, "Well, you're in pretty good condition of fucking dogs actually. You

1069
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,760
can probably last a long time." Yeah. I was confused in my physical why the doctor checked

1070
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,720
my wiener twice, but the second time he brought a dog into the room just to see if there were

1071
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,800
any changes. But there's gotta be some like chemical imbalance, right? That you could...

1072
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,680
I don't know. I don't know if I want to go on the record with that one.

1073
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,760
Yeah. I'm not sure about that. You're right. It's the devil infesting those people.

1074
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,080
I'll stick by that. That's probably... that honestly is the safer

1075
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:02,120
opinion to have. Yeah. Well, the devil, it takes these people over. But they do it on purpose still.

1076
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:10,280
Esbion... no, Sylveon. Sylveon's number eight. This is just a pink dog. This is a fairy type dog.

1077
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,380
yeah

1078
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,040
uh...

1079
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,620
israeli disgusting here

1081
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,540
uh...

1082
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,220
there are there's a war between sylveon and espion fans in the comments here

1083
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,600
well like a mud war

1084
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,740
command

1085
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,200

1096
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,540
is that what you're saying?

1097
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,540
no listen what I'm saying is if I get captured in sort of a saw situation and

1098
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,140
jigsaw is like you have to choose

1099
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,140
you spent your entire life not fucking dogs

1100
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:32,260
you have to choose are you going to fuck a dog and I'm like what a dog fuck no

1101
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,080
And he's like or a cold dog. I'm just gonna fuck the dog. I don't want the cold

1102
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:43,820
Those are the two options in this list of two options that I'm being given started with a woman I

1103
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:48,660
Was one woman

1104
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:57,660
I want to fuck a worm worm is off the table for me. Yeah, I'm not fucking a worm

1105
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,500
But yeah, I'm gonna put that on record. I wouldn't fuck any animals either, but if Jigsaw is

1106
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:10,480
If Jigsaw is telling me you have to fuck a dog or a really cold dog, which one?

1107
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:17,140
I listen I'm not just gonna roll over and die, you know, maybe I have some heart or flavor that has some medieval in me.

1108
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:21,140
Yeah, I think the trap is beautiful dogs.

1109
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,820
I'm walking out of the room. Yeah, also the doors unlocked.

1110
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,460
You can leave whenever you want.

1111
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:36,260
I forgot to lock the door and honestly it's hard for me to get back in this room that I'm in.

1112
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:42,020
I don't know why I told you that. Yeah, beers are messed up. Oh shit.

1113
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,900
What do you do with a dog? The door's unlocked.

1114
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,220
Jesus Christ. I'm not even, I don't even have any cameras in the room.

1115
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,940
I can't even prove you did this. No!

1116
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:56,500
Best did me!

1117
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,740
See that's what I would do if I was in a saw situation

1118
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:05,100
Just like if there's like a trap before he even finishes the monologue just jump into it and die

1119
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,940
Yeah, cuz I think about the thing about the saw series

1120
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,180
Right is that you have to play the tape recorder every time and those movies are very unrealistic

1121
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,520
Not because like the traps are crazy or because there's like stupid plot twists

1122
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,160
It's cuz like yeah a normal person a saw trap would not

1123
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:26,020
Press play on a tape recorder before they just like try to what like this things was like if you open the door

1124
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,980
it shoots you in the face and it's like I don't know that if I see a door I'm just

1125
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,180
gonna walk out I'm gonna waste time like no I'm gonna turn on I'm gonna hear a

1126
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,460
guy doing a scary voice like yeah I don't have to listen to this yeah well

1127
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,380
you can always hope that there's maybe yeah some music in there I mean I've

1128
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:45,140
played video games I'm skipping the cutscenes I don't care yeah exactly I'm

1129
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,540
getting right to the game well I got a flamethrower attached to my head I'm not

1130
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:53,620
pressing fucking play on a tape recorder also get what you give me an iPod right

1131
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,540
What the hell? Why do you still use a tape recorder?

1132
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,500
You know how much?

1133
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,820
Are you making no money off these movies?

1134
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,340
You have to be making some money.

1135
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,660
Are you one of those guys who buys like,

1136
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,660
cassettes, like music cassettes?

1137
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:06,700
Is that like, you know, like...

1138
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,220
You think it's cooler?

1139
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,660
You think it's cool? You think it's trendy?

1140
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,940
It's not trendy. It went out of style a really long time ago.

1141
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,460
And it's hard. What if the tape jams?

1142
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,260
That's the other thing.

1143
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,700
Yeah, what if a magnet's near it?

1144
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,300
What if you need a magnet for your trap?

1145
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,700
And it erases your tape?

1146
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,860
This J-Sup character is pretty stupid when you think about it.

1147
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,060
I mean he's not a puppet so you might.

1148
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,260
He's actually a haunted puppet.

1149
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,260
He's a guy.

1150
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,260
He's Toby Bell.

1151
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,260
He's Toby Bell.

1152
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,260
No, it's Chucky.

1153
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,260
No, you're thinking of Billy the puppet.

1154
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,260
His name's Billy.

1155
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,260
I thought it was Jigsaw.

1156
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,260
He's a puppet who works for Jigsaw.

1157
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,260
Some job that is.

1158
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,660
He's just an actor like in Iron Man 3?

1159
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,660
He's a puppet actually.

1160
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,660
More than an actor.

1161
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,660
I guess you could say.

1162
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:50,060
An actor is kind of a puppet.

1163
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,060
Wow.

1164
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,900
- Wow.

1165
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,200
- Yeah, that's--

1166
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,360
- So the next one, this is a little girl.

1167
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,100
- This one's kind of a person, but it is a little girl.

1168
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:57,940
- Yeah.

1169
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,600
- So I don't really care what they have to say about it.

1170
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
- Next one, what is that?

1171
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,440
I don't know how to describe that.

1172
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,900
- Next one is some kind of four dimensional being.

1173
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,300
- It's like a, yeah, it's like a spaceship.

1174
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,180
It looks like a spaceship.

1175
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,880
- Oh, Meloletta.

1176
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,960
- No, we're skipping that one because that's a child.

1177
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,800
- I didn't know that.

1178
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
- But I mean, you can talk about that as much as you want.

1179
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,700
for it dude that's all you man I that's where you want to jump in on this
