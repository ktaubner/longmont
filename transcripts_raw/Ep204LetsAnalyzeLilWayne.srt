- Oh my God. - Maybe a good parody.

18
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,460
- Last Sunday morning, we got down onto our knees.

19
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,380
- Yes. - Put our hands together, please.

20
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,540
- Yeah, he died upon the cross,

21
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,540
and when he died, we all were lost.

22
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:46,180
Before he died, we all were lost.

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,140
Put him in a coffin box, the death of Christ.

24
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,140
In the Sunday morning fog, he was singing to a frog.

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,540
Which I think is in the Bible.

26
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,880
And he got killed by those Wops.

27
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,000
That last Friday night,

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
'cause it was the Italians that killed him, right?

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,560
And because he did turn into a man after the prince,

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,720
after Mary Magdalene. He was a boy.

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,000
Mary Magdalene found a frog that had a cane and a top hat.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,040
He was running around. Oh, a cane.

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,760
Cane like a boy. Cane and a hat.

34
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,320
Cane like a boy. Cane and then Jesus,

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,160
he was a frog who was disabled.

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,520
And he was running around. Yeah.

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,920
He was running around, "Hello, my baby.

38
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
"Hello, my darling.

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,320
"Hello, my ragtime gal."

40
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,800
He gave him a kiss, right?

41
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
All of a sudden. Gave him a kiss

42
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,960
and then bam.

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,200
he said, "I'm gonna become a prince." He said, "Give me a kiss and I'll turn into a prince."

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,000
She didn't realize, prince of princes. Wow. King of kings. Lord of lords. Sunday of Sundays.

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,760
Sunday of Sundays. Back in that time, like back in Christ's era. Yeah, what year? Year

46
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,440
1. Do you think they had schizophrenia back then? Probably not, because there wasn't phones

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,720
in technology. Yeah, there was no doctors to say that. Yeah, they didn't have

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,560
anything. Yeah, they had either bad blood or you have something in you.

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,960
They would just be like something is different about you. Yeah, something is

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,840
happening to you, but it's not a thing. Yeah, they really didn't know what to say.

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,600
I guess that was all just like back then. You would go. That's what you would go to

52
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,880
it. You go to a healer, not a doctor. You go to a healer. You would go to the

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,640
doctor and you say, I broke my foot or I'm sick and they'd be like, well, why are

54
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,200
you telling me? I don't know what to do. They haven't invented anything. Yeah,

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Well no, what happened is you'd go and you'd be like, "I have a fever and

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,200
there's snot coming out of my nose and I just want to sleep all the time."

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,200
And then you go. They would say, "Well, something's clearly wrong with you, but it's not a thing or

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,200
anything." Yeah. There's not like a thing out of this.

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Why are you telling me all these things together? Do you think, exactly, I don't know what to tell you?

60
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Like, sorry? You used to go to a doctor and you'd say, "I have

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,200
this happening to me. This is happening to me." And they'd say, "I'm sorry." Yeah.

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,800
what that's what the Hippocratic Oath is. That was what doctors did until like

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,340
1950. They were just people that you'd go to and they'd be like I'm so

64
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,160
sorry that's happened. Yeah something that's really really awful. And then they'd

65
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,760
prescribe you fricking butter. And then okay the bill a hundred coins. And then for a while, dude I hate

66
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,400
a hundred coins. Your wife and man that was a lot of money. Yeah coins have gone way way

67
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,280
down in price. Yeah. They used to be worth a lot of money and then at one point I

68
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,220
think the first thing they invented was putting a hole in a woman's head because

69
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,060
she got too angry about something.

70
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,900
- Yeah.

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,700
- They used to just prescribe women a vibrator

72
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,380
and say, "Hey, you need to go calm down."

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,580
- They used to prescribe women--

74
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,420
- You're being hysterical.

75
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,140
- They used to prescribe women a guy named the vibrator.

76
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:29,980
- Yeah.

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,820
- Yeah.

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,640
- Yeah.

79
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,380
- There's old ads you can look up.

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,940
It's like, it's literally, it's for stuff that's like,

81
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,060
to treat hysteria.

82
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,500
They used to just make women ride the Sibian, basically.

83
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,340
- Really?

84
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,160
- Yeah.

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,660
Which Howard Stern is probably the closest thing we have--

86
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,500
- To a doctor.

87
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,180
doc to a 1901 doctor yeah yeah never met one for real it is it's so awesome to

88
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,700
like a woman right a simian yeah that I monkey there is a picture that somebody

89
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,080
got yelled at for posting once something I yelled at so yeah Patrick yelled at

90
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,100
him cuz he was he's got scared yeah scared yeah picture that someone got

91
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,340
yelled at for posting once what does that mean is like a group chat where he

92
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,500
would send pictures of apes and stuff and somebody sent of a picture of a chimp

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:22,820
competing a woman out. Really? Yeah. It's amazing how much video and photo there is

94
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,020
online of people having sex with animals. Yeah. It really pops up in crazy places.

95
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,340
It just comes up. It just comes up. It's that whole fucking that lady. Yeah, just

96
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,540
as on Twitter and stuff. When? A couple of weeks ago. You never saw that one?

97
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,340
Yeah. I saw it and I was like and I saw the set up and it was like a woman and a

98
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,260
dog on a bed. I was like, oh, it's a camera trick. Yeah, there's no way that

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
there it's for perspective. It's like the Lord of the Rings running away from

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,440
that the dog is actually really far away from running away from that video like

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,000
you're the one of the first people to see train arriving at the station. Yeah,

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,080
like I was like there's no way that this is what's actually happening. This is

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,640
gonna be some kind of joke. I'm gonna yeah vine style thing and then it cuts

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,360

110
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,600
thing that you're not allowed yeah exactly I guess yeah I feel like bestiality and CP

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,640
laws should be the same you you think that there should be more CP on Twitter

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,040
No, yeah, cuz you're right cuz video of somebody

00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:47,280
Fucking a dog you should get penalized the exact same as like I kind of agree. It's a freaking woman getting penalized by the dog

165
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,740
and I walk out and then Pat is sitting at the entrance and he's holding the weather app on

166
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:31,100
his phone. What do you say? Says he's drinking a hot coffee in the hot summer. Make it make sense.

167
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,180
I like that a lot. I think it's a good idea. I have a suggestion. He's drinking a hot coffee

168
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,220
in the hot summer. The thing about that is it's so easily faked that I think that um...

169
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,460
What do you mean? Just to make it just so people that people...

170
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,820
They can make him say whatever they want. Just so people really will connect with it on a deeper

171
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,860
level I think maybe you add kind of an establishing shot at the beginning when

172
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,860
you're kind of ordering your coffee or whatever than usual you have taken a

173
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,820
super shower up there it's a you should it shows the thermometer it's not the

174
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,940
weather it shows like their mom very thermo like a mercury thermometer and

175
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,180
it's rising up and it's got all going to like a hundred and twenty degrees so we

176
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,620
can film this after this yeah we can go film it and post it but there's gonna be

177
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,620
basically a video I'm gonna be leaving a coffee shop and Patrick will say he's

178
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,900
He just ordered a hot coffee.

179
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
He just ordered a hot coffee.

180
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
In the hot summer.

181
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,540
Yeah, in the hot summer.

182
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Make it make sense.

183
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Make it make sense.

184
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,400
And then do a flip.

185
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,180
And then maybe I could get like knockout gamed or something.

186
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,500
Yeah, they take the hot coffee.

187
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,840
If you could do a, wouldn't it be so awesome if you could do a flat ground backflip because

188
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,460
that is the perfect ending to any video.

189
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,620
Is like if somebody's filming you, you just do a backflip.

190
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,420
If you get in a car accident with somebody and they start filming you because they like

191
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,540
need this car insurance thing. If you say if you're yelling at them, I didn't rear

192
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,380
end you as soon as you see that camera. Yeah, this is bust out a backflip.

193
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,820
You're going to be a legend. Also like yeah, you you're trying to try to

194
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
shoplift something right you read you put a candy bar in your pocket. You look

195
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,620
up you notice a security camera. Oh shit backflip. Have you seen that video

196
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,980
rating your you're getting swatted right? Yeah, if there's a SWAT video of

197
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,020
them busting in your door and you see them and just instantly do a backflip,

198
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,340
They won't shoot you. You're going to Cirque du Soleil. Have you seen that video?

199
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,940
It's like some comedian posted it. I forget who, but they... I don't follow comedians. It's like a

200
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,820
video of like the performers at Harry Potter World ending and they go up in the like in the front of

201
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,140
the crowd and do a backflip and walk back into the crowd. That's sick. It's so fucking funny. Yeah,

202
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,020
see like I if I could do a backflip... That one and then the other one there's a different guy. I

203
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
- There's a different guy.

204
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,660
- He's actively trying to get--

205
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
- There's this guy in Philly,

206
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,140
and his thing is he goes into stores and stuff,

207
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,420
and while people are behind him,

208
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,060
he just does a back flip.

209
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,340
He goes like, "What?"

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,380
while he does the back flip.

211
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,860
So there's a video of a guy at the counter,

212
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,500
and he's arguing with the owner of the store,

213
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,740
and he goes in and starts pulling bags of ice

214
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,900
out of the freezer,

215
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,940
and then just fully does a back flip.

216
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,380
- Oh yeah, that is a funny video.

217
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,260
- That is a really good one.

218
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,040
I think I would probably try, it would be like, for me, I would want to do like, "Maskless

219
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,560
Karen harasses store clerk for not pulling down mask and then does perfect back flip before

220
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
leaving."

221
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,480
Maskless Karen, but they don't realize you are wearing a mask, but it's one of those

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
Obama masks that you are banked with.

223
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,480
Or it's a Karen mask.

224
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
It's a Karen mask.

225
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Oh shit, yeah.

226
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,320
But just the idea of, maybe I'm a maskless Karen, I'm yelling like, "Take that mask off!

227
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
What, it's not going to kill you?

228
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
What are you, a pussy or something?"

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Watch this.

230
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,820
flip in the middle of it and keep yelling at them and then pretend it didn't

231
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,920
happen. Why'd you backflip? What are you even talking about? You're crazy.

232
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,240
See if you could just do perfect backflips with no fatigue and you could

233
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,360
backflip like a hundred times in a row. A really similar thing to that that I

234
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,400
would really like to be able to do is complete hands-free vomit. Yeah

235
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,880
definitely. That's another perfect video thing. In the store just hands-free nutting.

236
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,880
People say, oh I can, I wish I could vomit.

237
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
But that would get you sent to jail.

238
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
That's the problem with that one.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
I wish I could vomit on command.

240
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
You can vomit on command, but it's obvious there's a lead up.

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah, you have to like, you can, yeah.

242
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,480
You have to like try, like I can make myself vomit at any point in time.

243
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Yeah.

244
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
But I gotta try.

245
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Exactly.

246
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I wanna be instantly no provocation.

247
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Yeah.

248
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,080
And not even, I wanna something I can, I do it with a thought.

249
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
No heaving, no lurching.

250
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
My brother, yeah.

251
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,480
I'm just, vomit is spewing out of my mouth.

252
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,560
My brother used to have acid reflux so bad that he could just make himself spit up on

253
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
command.

254
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
That used to happen to me every morning.

255
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I can kind of do that.

256
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,760
He would kind of like, he would do that after he ate like fucking Jeff Goldblum in the fly.

257
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,560
He'd sit there and go like, and then just like, so crazy.

258
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Acid reflux sucks.

259
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,800
It will ruin your life.

260
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,200
I've been getting it really, really bad.

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Two years for me.

262
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Me too.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,520
Remember that, remember we went to New York for the first time and I was taking Prilosec

264
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,080
And I literally like, I was like anxious all the fucking time because I had that allergic

265
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
reaction.

266
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,920
I was like covered in hives and I just like, my heart rate was up fucking crazy.

267
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,240
And then what did you decide to do?

268
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,280
I smoked a joint.

269
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
And I got-

270
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Smoked a stranger's fucking dope.

271
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,600
It wasn't a stranger, it was my friend Marion Zoe's.

272
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
It was strange dope.

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,240
It was my friend Marion Zoe's.

274
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
He was their weed.

275
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Who's Marion Zoe's?

276
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Nah, I'm playing.

277
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,320
Hmm. I'm playing yeah, I smoked one hit of their spliff and I freaked the fuck out

278
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,460
Yeah, cuz you know what you know the worst thing that front the worst part is he's right in front of a fucking eatily

279
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,600
Yeah, yeah, that'll I was in front of an eatily and

280
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,220
The fuck is in front of a belly in front of the belly in front of the eatily yeah

281
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:40,080
Yeah, that's Mario Batali's place right eatily yeah, no Mario Batali's place is prison

282
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Eataly is owned by Mario Batali.

283
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
It's basically a huge...

284
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I can't look it up, but it's owned by Mario Batali.

285
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Eataly.

286
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Eataly Mario Batali. I don't think it is.

287
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I don't think they would let that happen.

288
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Okay, well it auto-completes here.

289
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Well, but that's because he's Italian.

290
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
A lot of different city names.

291
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah, he's Italian.

292
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
And the fate...

293
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Once the crown jewel is this, let's see here.

294
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Eataly finally cuts ties with Mario Batali.

295
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, all right. He was completely right.

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,500
Yeah.

297
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,300
But now he's not.

298
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,500
I also knew he was right. That's why I didn't say anything.

299
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,700
And that's why I looked it up.

300
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,900
I knew that Mario Batali had it.

301
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,300
And I don't even really know anything about Italy.

302
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,500
But that's probably the only thing I know about Italy.

303
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,500
It's like a huge, it's like a Whole Foods, but it's only like try hard fake Italian food.

304
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,300
Yeah, but it's really fun to walk around and they have really stinky meat.

306
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,800
Yeah.

307
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,300
You know, like dry-aged meat.

308
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,800
Jamon Iberico.

309
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm trying not to eat that much meat anymore.

310
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
Really? Why's that?

311
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,040
I got, went to the doctor, I have really high cholesterol.

312
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,720
Really? You have high cholesterol?

313
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,400
I have high cholesterol, can you believe that?

314
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,120
I really can't.

315
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,360
Yeah.

316
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,880
How do they test that?

317
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,120
I got, I went in there and they took out like six vials of my blood.

318
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,560
Vials?

319
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,680
I hate having blood taken.

320
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,480
I like it.

321
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm kind of freaky like that.

322
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,400
I don't like it.

323
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,320
You told me you hated it when you got it done.

324
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
I'm keeping you accountable.

325
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,280
My grandpa.

326
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,560
You said it scared you.

327
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,880
No.

328
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,800
My grandpa will go give blood and he'll like push his arm down and like do this and shit,

329
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,760
try to make it go faster. That's funny. Because it doesn't bother him. I feel like that's a thing

330
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,080
you would do if it did bother if you wanted to be over. No he's like he's like doesn't. Why else

331
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,360
would you do that? Why if you didn't bother you why you just sit there? Maybe he does maybe he is

332
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,640
a little baby, but why is he giving blood? For the cause. I hate the cause. Oh he might like it

333
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,840
though. Yeah yeah. Oh that's a really good point. Also what is the cause when you give blood? If

334
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:37,480
people are dying they might want your blood. Who the fuck is dying from no blood? Blood

335
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,120
bloodless Joe who's that fucking guy yeah he needs a lot of blood he's a shit well

336
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
it's also if someone's blood it gets like dirt in it or something yeah like

337
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,080
you need we need you have clean blood because if you put soap in the blood to

338
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,600
try and clean out the dirt it's like now there's soap in there too

339
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,200
that's still a mystery just mysterious I used to give blood I find them

340
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,800
fascinating I had like like I think I gave blood like twice in a month once

341
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,640
Holy shit because they were giving out free hats. You needed two hats?

342
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,640
They're giving out free hats at a... Is that like a plot line to something? That's like a

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,280
TV show plot line that I've seen before I think. Yeah they gave out a free hat

344
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,720
but then I was like oh it's like a hat that just says like I donated blood or

345
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
something. Then I had a I got a sweatshirt. What TV show is that from?

346
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,440
That straight up is a TV show. I don't know. I remember I got hired as a fucking

347
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,840
Are you thinking of? I got hired one time as this fucking as a fry cook at

348
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,880
this fucking stupid ass restaurant. Krusty Krab. The Blood Restaurant. I was pretty excited about it, but then all these

349
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,960
uh, there's all these anchovies they show up. They're going meep, meep, meep, meep.

350
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Because they're just so hungry and I'm trying to make all the burgers I can

351
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,560
but it's actually really hard. They started surfing their bodies like a wave, right? And at the end of the

352
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I mean of the story.

353
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,440
That's what I was given blood with my mom and like two of my aunts.

354
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,320
Yeah, my mom Marge and my aunt Selma and the other one.

355
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,400
But basically I was working at this restaurant and my boss, listen, God bless him, fat daughter.

356
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,040
Yeah, like whale level fat.

357
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,840
Also Patrick was telling us the plot line of an Office episode.

358
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,480
That is not the plot line of an Office episode.

359
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
I think that happened to me too.

360
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,480
an episode in the office so they do that. And I remember one time he wants cookies.

361
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah cookies not a free. Okay that's a little bit of a stretch. That is a huge stretch.

362
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,600
He's not ripping off the office because there's. I thought it was a free hat and I looked it up

363
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,440
and it was cookies. Also that's based off of real life people get shit for giving blood.

364
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,160
And literally that's also a joke from the jerk where Navin just gives a bunch of his blood.

365
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,040
Well then why didn't you say that when I was asking what it was from? You're trying to cover

366
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,120
something up no listen I'll concede the point but I have the I have the the

367
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,520
sweatshirt that I know

368
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,840
yeah all right this is actually changing you might be right on to something I

369
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,080
think there's a green sweatshirt that said I don't remember him mentioning

370
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,520
that it was red blood you know get some kind of red souvenir see I thought they

371
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,440
were gonna have more blood themed stuff but it was not even blood themed it was

372
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,080
more hospital theme than blood theme. What you're saying it like that like you they

373
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,320

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,720
that they canceled or someone wants this is some kind of number is not four one

404
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,480
one seven so this is some kind of you're in some foreign country and you're

405
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,560
wearing kind of like cloth diapers. But you're grown men there.

406
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,480
Where? Right here. Yeah, we're grown men there. And above you're babies and

407
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,380
then underneath I really I think those are also babies. You guys look lily white.

408
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll tell you that much. Okay. Oh here's something. Here's my

409
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,240
prescription card for my eyes. You're just going through your wallet. You don't have

410
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,560
anything like nothing crazy happen. Do you want to hear something crazy that happened to me?

411
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,160
Nobody last night got completely hit by a car.

412
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Nothing like that.

413
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
Do you want to hear something that was...

414
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Oh shit, here's my donor card.

415
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Okay.

416
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,680
I am blood type A positive, but also here is the business card for Steven Vega.

417
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,320
Oh, the pit bull impersonator.

418
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,800
The pit bull impersonator that my friend Charlie hired for his runway show.

419
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,840
I think the wallet needs to go in the phone circle.

420
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Yep, I agree.

421
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,840
I think that this is now a wallet and phone circle, because somehow you're doing your phone

422
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,520
with your wallet right now.

423
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Something that happened...

424
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Donor ID 214160.

425
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Stop.

426
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,200
Something that happened to me the other night that was not funny at all. It was very scary.

427
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Yeah.

428
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,640
As I was sleeping and I woke up. You know when you like first wake up and you kind of

429
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,840
are still dreaming a little bit and you can just like see stuff, like a weird dream hallucination

430
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
in the real world or whatever?

431
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,200
Yeah, yeah. You get little floaters.

432
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Yeah. Well, so I had one where I woke up and I was like half awake and my like dream, waking

433
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,080
dream hallucination was just my bedroom door just closing.

434
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Scary.

435
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
So scary.

436
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Nice.

437
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,520
One of the scariest things I've ever seen.

438
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I had a scarier dream.

439
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
I had a scarier dream.

440
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Yeah, I had a scarier dream.

441
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I had one where just Darth Maul cut me in half.

442
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
I had one where I was closing Cameron's door.

443
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Really?

444
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Why was that scary for you?

445
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Because there was a monster behind me, obviously.

446
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Because it was between you.

447
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,520
It was a door between you guys as friends and you couldn't hang out.

448
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Yeah.

449
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Yeah.

450
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,080
I had a dream that we were all in the same room, but I was like, you guys were like two

451
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,840
feet close to each other.

452
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,600
Like there's two feet between you and there's like 15 feet between me and you guys.

453
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,100
So you guys were talking and like laughing and stuff.

454
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,480
And I was being like, "What?

455
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,200
you say yeah like that and it was really scary yeah I told you guys about my

456
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Patrick's neck dream Oh Patrick in my dream Patrick got stung on the neck by a

457
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,960
bug that's so scary yeah and it's done by a bug his neck swelled up really huge

458
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,120
so it's like the size of his head and then he was walking around to us and be

459
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,520
like guys I think something's wrong with my neck we kept me like Patrick there's

460

463
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,520

464
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,760
it would make a weird easy thing. I had a dream last night. I had a dream because I had like a

465
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,120
like I was going to see a doctor today and I like fell asleep and woke up and I

466
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,600
think I had a dream that I already went. To the doctor? Yeah and then I was just

467
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,720
I hate that. I hate when I wake up from a dream where I was doing what I'm planning to do during

468
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
the day.

469
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
Yeah, I have to do it all over again.

470
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I get confused. I get really confused.

471
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
Whether or not you did it or not, you know?

472
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah.

473
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Yeah, I would dream.

474
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I wake up confused every single time.

475
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Oh, yeah.

476
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,200
I've never woken up and immediately known where I was, even in my own bed.

477
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,720
That was the worst on tour when I would like wake up and be like, "Oh, I'm at home," and

478
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,360
then like I roll over and I see one of you guys and I'm like, "I am not at home."

479
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,520
Wait, what is wrong with seeing one of us in the mornings?

480
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,680
well sometimes I just want to roll over in my bed and just start whacking off.

481
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,840
You can do that. It wouldn't bother me if you whacked off. Sometimes I just want to

482
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,040
just roll over and just pull on my Johnson Leggings. Pull on my Johnson Leggings. Pull on my Johnson Leggings.

483
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,200
Like it's owing me a free like it owes me a sass Toyota CNS. A sass Toyota. A sass. If I'm I'm good

484
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,000
enough friends with you that if you if we were sharing a bed in a hotel room you

485
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,160
were like Caleb I really have to whack off but the bathroom is broken. I'd be

486
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,360

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,960
first way I learned because I don't know how to wash it. The first way I

509
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,720
learned how to masturbate was was using just I would make a circle, make a

510
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,120
circle and I would fuck it like a two fingers like a dainty yeah and I used to

511
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,480
use soft pinkie out I used to use soft soap the hand soap and it now every time

516
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,680
go outside every time

517
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,720

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,200
I you know you ever hear somebody say that they grew up. They would like hump

520
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
their couch. Yeah, yeah, that's a way. That's really weird. Hump the couch. I

521
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,400
don't understand how that like works. It feels good. Also, I think it probably

522
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,000
like that fucks you up as an adult because you're looking for people who

523
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,500
of who just look like couches maybe yeah also the couches that you should at

524
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,060
least do it to like your own bed yeah and there's certain things like the

525
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:33,940

545
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,380
your body I think I think if you take a bunch of zinc we'll tell you what I had

546
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:59,420
today super awk or no swear rocks swear OX swear OX electrolyte beverage guess

547
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,940
what this has in it zero sugar zinc zero calories with zinc to help boost immune

548
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:10,340
system guess what else it has eight of calories ions yeah I think it's zinc I

549
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:16,540
don't know yeah I think I think I think it's a makes your nut whiter zinc why

550
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,700
no it's it's one of those her you haven't you heard the the mnemonic device

551
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,180
zinc make it stink zinc make it stink zinc make it stink magnesium make it

552
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:31,100
pleasing him Oh vitamin B makes it P yeah you just peeing when you come yeah

553
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,580
the same vitamin C also makes it P vitamin D, also makes it P as well.

554
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,380
Vitamin E does not make it P.

555
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,200
No, vitamin E makes it erect, makes it makes it good for she yeah.

556
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,900
So magnesium is for him, pleasing him, pleasing him.

557
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,100
Vitamin E is for she.

558
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,700
They make a skateboard trucks out of magnesium.

559
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,500
Isn't that weird?

560
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,700
That's because all skateboarders like to be pleasing him.

561
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,100
Yep.

562
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,300
Come on pound that out pound that out real long.

Give me a long.

565
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,200
He wants to be pounded out by a long pounder.

566
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,760
you want to be pounded out by his that's what they say - we just needed each other

568
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,960

569
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,440
shield the shield I love that you'll see CH bounders her name is CCH pounder

570
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,360
yeah funny very funny always sunny clip I don't know I don't know Dennis does an

571
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,500
impression of her and then D does something racist and hilarity ensues

572
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,940
that show is honestly funny but I do find that the characters are like not exactly

573
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,960
they're unlike a best people there well here's the thing if you idolize them

574
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,920
you're watching the show wrong well I watch it upside down ah is that that's

575
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,040
the right way to watch you're watching it wrong in two ways hmm it's a double

576
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,520
negative two ways cuz you're yep because you go both ways and both ways are wrong

577
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,920
wrong. Yeah, yeah, I think both ways are wrong. Yeah, I'll say it all right. I

578
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,320
think that you should be doing a third way third way third way like Andrew

579
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,120
Yang. Yep third way right down the middle. I'm not fucking men. I'm not

580
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,120
yeah. I think hey people some these these people nowadays. They're they're

581
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,820
going both ways when they should be focusing on the eightfold path. Here's

582
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,120
the thing who does it nowadays. Everybody's going both ways, but we

583
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,320
can't even get our politicians to fund roads that go both ways. Yeah, all

584
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,240
fucking one way. And they have a guy that goes one way with guys in charge of the roadways

585
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,240
now. They do. And he goes one way with guys. He goes one way with Chasten. He goes one

586
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:44,200
way. I wish he was chased. Yeah then maybe he would get all the roads working on time.

587
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,360
Basically these roads are going both ways and I'm like well that's why I'm late everywhere

588
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,920
because bisexual people are fucking late everywhere. And they're late on their periods. Because

589
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,400
they don't cuz they because they have a kid cuz they're full they're getting

590
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:05,120
filled up with nut by both ways by both ways and they get completely filled with

591
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,640
nut and both sides of our system are is totally full sides of the aisle I hear

592
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,400
bisexuality is basically the new viral dance move it's pretty much viral yeah

593
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,240
it's completely viral to be bisexual. It's spreading. I would say that's true.

594
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,200
Yeah, I think that's what a lot of people are saying. There's a lot of discourse

595
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,880
online about, "Is bisexuality just viral or is it like a

596
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,040
dance that stays like the whip and the locomotive?" The locomotive?

597
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:44,760
You know the song? "Come on, come on, do the locomotion!"

598
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,120
that's what you're thinking of. You know what needs to come back is hula hoopers.

599
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,200
The hula hoop? There's a lot of uh there's an undergrad there's a burgeoning

600
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,040
undergrad. There is a lot of people if you look up hashtag hula hoop on

601
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:03,320
instagram there's a lot of women. Really? What are they wearing? A lot of grown

602
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,360
women with a lot of tattoos and dreadlocks doing doing hula hoop videos. I

603
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,160
saw the crazy I just saw I saw the craziest white guy dreads near your house

604
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,320
Caleb the other day. It was a while ago. It was maybe two weeks ago. I don't even like

605
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
what level.

606
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,800
Is it a fat guy? Kind of fat white dude who has, he doesn't have dreads, but he has like

607
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,040
four braids coming off his head.

608
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,120
No, I think he had like, he was wearing like super reflective sunglasses and he had like,

609
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
it was.

610
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,800
There's like a Paul Wall style white guy with like four, I don't know how his ears look

611
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
like.

612
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,960
You know what, maybe it was him. I think it was braids, not dreads.

613
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,360
but he has so few of them that it looks like spider legs coming off his head and

614
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,280
he's always talking to somebody and just being like that.

615
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:57,360
No, we wow. He sounds like that. Wow, like talking into a fan. Well, we were

616
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:05,240
yeah. Okay, he we all rapper. Yeah, today. What does that remind you of? It

617
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,000
reminds me of this list. Yeah, that I've pulled up here. That's called that 50

618
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,160
worst Lil Wayne lines examining the so-called best rapper alive and who what

619
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,880
is this his aura was orange this is from a blog called his aura was orange. So is

620
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,360
that probably that's probably this guy somebody told him you can't rhyme

621
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,660
anything with orange. Oh he said his aura yeah well it says he actually has a on

622
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,160
the sidebar right here where my blog got its name from so he actually disproves

623
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:36,560
you right there. Disprove me then? It's a it's a Charlie Murphy quote. Oh yeah oh

624
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,040
oh i'm rick james bitch oh okay all right quote yeah it's basically that he must

625
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,000
have mistranslated yeah. So let's just well he has a quote in the sidebar from

626
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,920
thomas pain albert einstein the honorable sass

627
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,880
and then this one that is unattributed listen. I've never really listened to

628
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,320
little wayne. It's just not my kind of type of music or anything. So like what

629
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,080
I mean what even could these lyrics be are they probably about maybe

630
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,480
drug abuse, maybe like a mis-officer, maybe like a jolted...

631
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,080
He actually has a lot of lyrics about female police officers.

632
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Really?

633
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,480
So you're a Lil Wayne, you're familiar with his work.

634
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
You must be some kind of Lil Wayne.

635
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,280
I know him from Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 5.

636
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I prefer the works of Rothko.

637
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,320
Me too, yeah.

638
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
I would say...

639
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
Bosh!

640
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Yeah, I would say like...

641
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Kevin Federline.

642
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Nietzsche.

643
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,440
Nietzsche is kind of my version of Lil Wayne for a lot of these people.

644
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Kevin Federline.

645
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,120
not I'm not loving not familiar now love and I know that movie

646
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,400
mclovin why'd they never do a mclovin spin-off called make love and where's a

647
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,200
detective that'll be so good I can't believe they didn't do that they should

648
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,000
have called it super detectives they should have just called it it was Evan

649
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,380
and it was Evan and Seth and instead of being in high school it's them as

650
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,680
detectives super clues they should have called her super bad was that murder

651
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,640
that we have to investigate now. That's actually true. Super bad, nothing that bad happens in the movie.

652
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,000
Maybe if there was some kind of... Well, if nothing that bad... What happens? Underage drinking.

653
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
Well that's true, but if there was some kind of like... like super bad is like a holocaust or like a

654
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,320
mass murder... I think the creators of that movie have relatives who were in the holocaust.

655
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah, so they have the perfect kind of cultural background to tell that story because that was

656
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,200
super bad. True. Yeah. Now anyway, there's an editor's note to open this kind of... it's kind

657
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,260
It's kind of an article.

658
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,760
It opens us with an article written by this guy or a blog post, I guess.

659
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,320
Editor's note, "This is a weak man on the microphone, ladies and gents, and it takes a strong man

660
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,320
who loves hip-hop and loves his aura was orange to put as much time and dedication and endure

661
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,880
things no man ought endure, like listen to Dwayne Carter's songs and lyrics to show you

662
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,960
how much this guy truly sucks.

663
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,700
All I ask in return is that you hear me out or at least consider the facts that I've painstakingly

664
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,240
amassed and tell me at the conclusion whether I'm justified in what I say or I'm clinically

665
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
insane.

666
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,920
is all. This guy sounds, he's almost, I'm suspecting him to be a member of

667
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,440
Intelligentsia. Yeah, like a Mensa. Like the coffee company? Intelligentsia, no coffee.

668
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,480
Oh. You know? So like I've already, listen, I've only been kind of paying

669
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,160
attention to this rapper style thing for a couple minutes and I feel like I've

670
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,080
already taken some of the slang. Yeah, it's like I prefer Starbucks anyway. It's much

671
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,280
more of a... Exactly, yeah. Notes of flavor. Yeah, the notes of flavor are... Alright,

672
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,080
well let's get into this. I really would like to, I mean I don't know much about

673
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,200
Lil Wayne, but I'd like to know, you know, because I don't know what side of the

674
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,360
aisle I land on yet. Yeah I've never listened to Lil Wayne. Do we want to read

675
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,600
I mean he's written a huge, I don't know if we want to pick up the lyrics.

676
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,960
Does anything stand out here? Wayne is the biggest bullshit artist, product of an

677
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,780
extremely weak era ass rapper. It's ridiculous. He forces so much garbage

678
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,280
that either makes little sense, no sense at all, or just no thought or cleverness

679
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,360
to its basic second-grade simplicity. He cheapens metaphors in a way that I've

680
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,080
only seen fabulous do fat why are you what's wrong fabulous I cringe every

681
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,880
time I see his spike from gremlins face or hear his prepubescent voice getting

682
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,680
ready to murder in the bad way as he's as deep as a YMCA kiddie pool Wow

683
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,640
no and listen I don't I don't know much about this little Wayne character but I

684
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,520
do if it he says on top of all that the dude is way too cocky yeah I hate

685
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,400
cockiness and raggedosciousness and that kind of thing. This line I think covers that

686
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,480
perfectly too that I would like to read for you guys. If he didn't have this

687
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
self-important attitude and cockiness then he wouldn't leave himself open to

688
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,760
this kind of criticism but when he calls himself the best rapper alive then he

689
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,920
deserves the scrutiny and he's not just rapping for fun and in a light-hearted

690
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,560
manner and we should all who consider ourselves true fans of the genre take

691
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,400
off the kiddie gloves when dealing with him. Okay the gloves are off Mr.

692
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,480
Wayne or Dwayne what his name is Dwayne but he says but isn't it rapper name I

693
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,800
think his name is is Dwayne little that makes no sense what if I said my name

694
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,360
was a lib I just drop a letter yeah a let's I was like Kramer I think about it

695
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,760
a lib is kind of cool if my name was like a miracle at Rick at Rick at Rick

696
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:13,120
not that great maybe I just go by see by like Rick the ruler no you can't add

697
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,240
add extra things you have to just change one letter for a little way and added

698
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,560
little

699
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,240
that's more of an adjective yeah. So you could be like a ruler rick yeah,

700
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,120
maybe rick

701
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:30,320
rick the ruler and i could be on a be that's maybe i could be like that's just

702
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,200
a name. I thought i like camer a lot huddles of camer that's like more of a

703
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,920
like it sounds like a lord of the rings book. What about like

704
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,940
Griffin that's a I think they've done there's already like sticky white

705
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,360
kamer it seems like you're adding adjectives you try to make that about

706
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,480
like like set like white is about rice that's about jizz fucking hell right is

707
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,520

710
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,720
like a cum shot. That's about soup. I hate cum shots. We don't like cum shots. We don't like

711
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,320
cum shots. We don't like jizz. We don't like nut. I'm not doing that. I'm trying to come

712
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,080
up with a cool rap name that's about a food I like. You're trying to make a song about

713
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,520
jizzing all over something. No I'm not. You are. You're trying to make a new jizz anthem.

714
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,440
Chewing salty wad of kamer. Jesus Christ. Are you fucking kidding me? It's about salt

715
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,680
water taffy. That is. That's about cum. That is so clearly about cum. What does that have

716
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,960
to do with cum? That is about jizz. You're talking about sperm jizz. You're making sperm

717
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,440
All over my bed sheets, my Kamer flowed.

718
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
That's a sperm joke.

719
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
That is not.

720
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,880
That is when I was eating gazpacho in bed.

721
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Gazpacho?

722
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
What the hell is gazpacho?

723
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
What the fuck?

724
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,080
Is that another jizzy cum shot name?

725
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
No, it's not.

726
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
It's a type of food.

727
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,160
It's like cold soup.

728
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,440
You're talking about nut.

729
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,240
I'm not talking about nut.

730
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
You're talking about cum.

731
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,400
You're talking about squirting your hot.

732
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,800
I sprayed Kamer on my girl's face.

733
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Bruh.

734
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
It's about spray cheese.

735
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
Alright, well that one was a little too much on that one.

736
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
It's spray cheese.

737
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Okay.

738
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
No.

739
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,760
combined the list during thing got stuck on the roof of my mouth it does that it

740
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,520
does that but don't say anything about I'm not gonna start on the roof I was

741
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,280
why would I say that no foods do that you have a fucking come losing out of

742
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,280
your brain you were your brain okay can we at least just settle on drunk right

743
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,480
now a Kmart sandwich and that's about ham stop making serious bukkake

744
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,160
references what I hate bukkake it's a you are talking with literally obsessed

745
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,840
with loads. I'm not obsessed with loads of food. I hate loads. Stop talking about loading

746
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,080
it up. A pig with kamer in its mouth. You're talking about loads of chunky jizz. You're

747
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:48,080
doing... You're talking about somebody being a splooge target. I am not. You're talking

748
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,880
about splooge. I'm not talking about... Admit it. I'm not talking about human oil. You're

749
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,920
making splooge comparisons. I'm not. You are straight out talking about white spew. Stop.

750
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,640
You guys are just bringing up all this stuff like the swamp water of the human body.

751
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,920
The swamp water.

752
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,080
See it's automatic for you.

753
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,400
You always have new words for fucking cum shots.

754
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
It's not automatic.

755
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,880
I have to work up to it.

756
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,920
I'm sick of your cum shot words.

757
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,600
I've been talking about food only.

758
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,080
It doesn't belong in a podcast.

759
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,840
Cum shots are for napkins.

760
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
And paper towels.

761
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,280
What about a sock that you don't wear anymore or a shirt you don't wear anymore?

762
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,080
I just gave a cum shot to my shirt.

763
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,320
Did a serious cum shot on my shirt.

764
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,520
My shirt is so crusty from all the cum shots.

765
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,760
You're talking about doing a tribute onto a Kleenex.

766
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm seriously not, okay? I never did a cum shot on the wall.

767
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
You've done one.

768
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,120
I never did a cum shot on the seat.

769
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,880
You did a cum shot on the wall and you did it near your oven so people would

770
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,960
think it was olive oil.

771
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,680
I didn't cook my cum in my oven.

772
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,080
You bet you boiled and baked a car. I did not. My come did not get stuck in the

773
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,320
crack between two things. You jizzed in the toilet. I didn't just anywhere and

774
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,120
you swirled it around like it was a poached egg. That's right.

775
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,840
You got it right. You made a for you made a vortex. You did and then the

776
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,040
toilet with your jizz. I did not come shot into a bottle and when someone

777
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,880
asked me what it was, I said it's nothing. The bottle is empty, but the

778
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,960
bottle was half full.

779
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,960
There's nothing in that.

780
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,080
There's nothing in there.

781
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,800
I did not wave my hand in their face like Obi-Wan.

782
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,080
Wait, what the fuck?

783
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,560
For comparative purposes, I hate Tupac, but he had tons more depth to his best works than

784
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Wayne.

785
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Dude, Tupac is one of the greatest fucking rap artists who ever lived.

786
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,960
I'm thinking about getting a Tupac tattoo.

787
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,680
He actually did Matt, a tummy rocker that says Tupac instead of Thug Life.

788
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
That's pretty good.

789
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
No, like a portrait.

790
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,680
A portrait?

791
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
A portrait.

792
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,240
If you get a Tupac portrait, I don't even, I mean, I'll just smile.

793
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,680
Yeah, I'll admit it. I'll smile if you do that and I'll enjoy it.

794
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,880
Yeah. I don't even like Tupac's music that much.

795
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,320
I feel like I would definitely get a Tupac portrait. The thing is it's funny.

796
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,920
You should only be getting funny tattoos.

797
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,920
Yeah. Yeah. In one way or the other. I'm a tribal type man.

798
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,040
Yeah, I got a spider web on my elbow. Well that one's cool though.

799
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,160
Yeah, that one is cool. But then you also have the word Dr. Evil on your arm.

800
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,440
Yeah. I think it would be funny if I got like...

801
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,200
I got my eyebrows tattooed on.

802
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,240
Again, don't get me wrong.

803
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,800
If you take away the buzz and the arrogant swagger of Wayne

804
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,760
and you put him in the same character as someone more affable

805
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,440
and less self-involved, it'd be a different story.

806
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,120
But when you put him up as a great of his time,

807
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,080
which for all purposes is a very talent depleted era

808
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,680
in hip hop, fair or unfair,

809
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
you then have to have him survive the test

810
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,760
of comparing him to the other greats of other eras.

811
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,980
And there's no way that you can put his ass up there

812
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,680
with other greats of other strong eras of hip hop.

813
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,080
It's just not a credible case. The fact is, the fact that this is even arguable

814
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,400
shows that Jesus died in vain. So like honestly this guy's bringing Christ into it.

815
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,880
Yeah, you gotta do the Kool-Aid with the Christ stuff.

816
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,800
You better have some really good points. I want to read these lines. I feel like we've done so much

817
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,400
building. I need to hear what the fuck this Little Wayne guy is talking about.

818
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,040
Okay, here's a thing that says "World's Worst."

819
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,600
Okay, and it's a picture of Little Wayne kissing Birdman.

820
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,680
Okay, so gays are bad to this author.

821
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,200
Okay, so I guess he's not fucking okay with LGBTQness, which is

822
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Which is actually not fire. Yeah. Yeah, but here we get to the list

823
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,720
There's a new heading the 50 worst most forced most nonsensical idiotic things

824
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,400
Wayne has said as in his career is wayne little wayne. I think he's who he's referring to little wayne's a different guy

825
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,080
All right. No, i'll read this because i'm probably the best at reading rap. Yeah

826
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:40,840
So you go ahead and read just every word now now where you ho at wipe your feet on the doormat

827
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm a bring the N-O back like a, and he says actually,

828
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,960
- A word.

829
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,240
- I can't say that, but with no back.

830
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,640
I'm gonna bring the N-O back like a--

831
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,480
- Let's say friend.

832
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,240
- Friend with no back.

833
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,600
What does that mean?

834
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,280
I mean this is basically--

835
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,720
- Not operational?

836
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,440
- It's almost forced and nonsensical if you ask me.

837
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,640
Idiotic I don't know about,

838
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,480
'cause I really don't understand the context.

839
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,980
I would need to know you know rap songs are money based on based on on on this

840
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,240
line so far that we're wondering what what I'm a bring the n o back means I

841
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,120
think no might mean no I'm nonsense obvious oh because of that it truly

842
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,720
makes no so no lick of that's almost meta that's like an almost have you seen

843
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,720
the movie the so sorry the film adaptation yeah so he's kind of doing a

844
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,000
film have an adaptation of what no there's a movie called at a film called

845
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,520
adaptation and it's about-- I don't remember it but it's about

846
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,960
meta-ness and kind of-- it's about yeah it's about if a movie and a book were the

847
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:54,360
same thing. So it's a film adaptation of a book adaptation of what? Of a experience--

848
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,940
You're getting caught up in the wrong thing. The next one is-- this is almost-- I mean

849
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,520
and this one almost also has some kind of racial tinge to it. He says, "Get girls

850
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,480
wet like backs and I don't think that I can say that. Interesting. And I just

851
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,280
completely did. This one here, this is a good one I think maybe. This one actually

852
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,760
makes some sense. This one makes sense. I'm hot like dogs. Yeah like hot dogs. Hot dogs.

853
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,440
Or a dog pants when it's hot. I don't think that that's nonsensical at all.

854
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,360
Maybe this is this could actually be a deep line about wearing pants. Maybe he's

855
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,680
wearing cool pants. I'm hot like dogs when a dog is hot at pants. Holy shit. I'm

856
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,260
wearing cool pants and a dog pants I just got new I also just got new pants a dog

857
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:42,120
pants to get cool that's actually to cool down to the tailor I'm so sorry I'll

858
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,260
read this one here my girl is prego and then in square brackets pregnant which

859
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,120
you have to assume is at is added by but you never know author yeah little Wayne

860
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,440
could have said my girl is pregos left square bracket pregnant right square

861
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,800
bracket and that's why it's transcribed that way but I don't want it so I'll cut

862
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,560
it out like Joey Gladstone. Oh that makes sense to a Full House fan like me. Yeah.

863
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,160
Does he does he perform an abortion with a razor blade? No. Joey...

864
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,840
Caesarean section? Joey uh Joey Gladstone has a he's a... He cuts out babies? He does

865
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:21,680
this he goes cut it out. Of a woman's womb? It's a catchphrase. He cuts out a... so it's not so full.

866
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,200
The house is too full so they can't have another kid in it. On the show Full House the

867
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:33,920
mother was full we need yeah we need the mother was cut out of the show because

868
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,120
she had cancer but what I should just cut that out of her yeah they should just

869
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,560
cut the cancer out too late well they should have done it earlier not too late

870
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,280
to abort this child well there's two children on the show and they cut them

871
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,600
both out and they got one child they got completely cut out and aborted yes okay

872
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,260
and now one of them is married to the Prime Minister of France's brother.

873
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,660
They need to change the word abortion. I feel like it's a little too nautical.

874
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,340
Yeah. Or space. It does make me think about...

875
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,540
Or abort. It's kind of spacey.

876
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,540
Spacey, yeah. The further we get into the future, the more abort is going to be...

877
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,900
That is a word that's a bit... It's early.

878
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,340
Exactly. Yeah. We're not ready for that word yet to be used a lot.

879
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,900
Abort is going to be so ubiquitous, because everybody's going to have a

880
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,100
spaceship with a big red button that says abort, and we're going to have a lot

881
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,540
of very stupid people thinking that that'll make their baby shoot out of

882
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,420
body so I think we need to change it yeah I got a bitch with me I call her miss

883
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:33,660
without draws I go to the bank they call me mr. withdraws okay that one's got

884
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,620
some wordplay - yeah you know yeah because you with actually sensical this

885
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:42,340
one's really good like the number after one I'm gonna get me - he's got me - see

886
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,340
that's a really now and I think I'm assuming that one's just aged poorly but

887
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,660
yeah saying I'm gonna get me - does not the best that's maybe yeah and it's and

888
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,620
And you'd imagine he's bragging about it because of how much he's read about his

889
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,620
machismo.

890
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,620
Yeah, like the number after one, "I'mma get me too'd."

891
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,620
Yeah, I don't know if that's a good thing to brag about.

892
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,620
He's bragging about getting me too'd.

893
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,620
Yeah.

894
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,620
And Harvey Weinstein.

895
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,620
Oh shit.

896
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,620
Whoa.

897
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,620
I just realized that.

898
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,620
Yeah.

899
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Um, "Baby, I'm an acrobat.

900
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,120
Sweetie, I'm a stunt devil.

901
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,120
You can't get on my level, 'cause I am so unleveled."

902
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,620
Okay, so it's kind of a--

903
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,620
'Cause he's a stunt man.

904
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,180
Or it's a role playing game or video game reference.

905
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,380
Oh, he's on a different level.

906
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,780
Or he could be unleveled like he's an NPC or something.

907
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,020
I would like to make some kind of game where I can run around like Mario and

908
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,580
jump on all these rappers heads and kill them.

909
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,580
Yeah.

910
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,580
Kill every rapper.

911
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,580
Just flatten them.

912
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,580
Yeah, just fucking flatten you out.

913
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,620
Hey, stop ruining culture!

914
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:39,620
Yeah.

915
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,620
Rapper!

916
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,620
And then just jump on them and flatten them.

917
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,620
There is a game.

918
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,140
I'll tell you who I'd love to see flattened, Post Malone.

919
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
There is a game.

920
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,420
jump on Post Malone and all his his tattoos and grossness would disappear

921
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,660
like like when you jump on a Koopa and it comes out of the shell. Yeah, there's a

922
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,220
game where you can box other rappers. Yeah, but they should have Post Malone and me do it.

923
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:04,020
And I can just get him one-on-one in a ranked DLC pack. Yeah, Post Malone and Caleb.

924
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:09,180
Yeah, and I can do a special. I can do a Hadouken or a Samurai Sword.

925
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:14,260
You have like a specially developed... He has a diaper. Yeah, you have like a specially

926
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,160
you develop like it's like you're like a vampire hunter, but for post malone like

927
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,100
you're you have a specific equipment that is just for killing. I'll say this

928
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,660
post Malone. He talks all the time. Oh, I drink I drink fifty Bud Lights a day. I

929
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,820
drink sixty cigarettes. I smoke sixty cigarettes a day. I'm a rottie buddy.

930
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,940
I'm running five six miles every single day. I'm shadow boxing for about an hour

931
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,840
and

932
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:42,100
I'm coming for you. Yeah, you know, you got you better. I've already you had

933
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:47,800
start getting in fighting shape. Yeah. Here's my new version of Post Malone's

934
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,360
song, okay? I'm dead, I have rigor mortis, and now my body's rock hard.

935
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,960
Oh, that's good. He died. Yeah. My body's calcified, I'm a mummy, I've died

936
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,600
for a thousand years, I'm rock hard. That's good. What's another one?

937
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,440
Dying dead and ghostly. Instead of white Iverson, he could say, like,

938
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:13,440
I'll have no son because I am dead and now I'm done.

939
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,920
Caleb killed me with a gun.

940
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,040
He took my money and all of my friends.

941
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,680
The one where he's listing his cars.

942
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,680
I just died.

943
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,680
I just died.

944
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
I just died.

945
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,680
Ow.

946
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Bentley.

947
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
What's...

948
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,680
The Beamer Benzer Bentley?

949
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680
That's Lil Wayne.

950
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,680
No, that's not Lil Wayne.

951
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
That's Lloyd Banks.

952
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,680
That's not...

953
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,680
Okay.

954
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
I don't know any rappers.

955
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,680
I don't listen to rap.

956
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,680
I listen to like guitar and acoustic music.

957
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,680
music verse on that nope maybe there remix I did a remix I mean I've never

958
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:50,940
heard any of these songs check my bio I started high with two ounces just like

959
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,680
Ohio - well yeah this person wrote - Oz this doesn't say ounces it says - Oz

960
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,680
well this doesn't again I don't used to fall in recipes come also a chef part

961
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,880
time I mean amateur of course I mean I personally I consider chefing I'd say

962
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,520
it's less of a science than it is an art and I mean it really depends on who you

963
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,040
are and look at this next line here. There is no grammar. If you you know what

964
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,200
the difference is between chef being an art what and chef and chefing being just

965
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,560
something you do is if you walk behind somebody and you say behind you behind

966
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,080
behind or behind or what is it? I'm behind you right now behind behind

967
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,440
behind which if you're the thing is if you're trying to corner, you're turning

968
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:35,700
corner corner ready if the foods food. Oh, that's the other thing they say

969
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,500
foods ready when the foods not ready. That's just a weird quirk that only

970
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,940
people who worked back of house now tips everyone's like oh if they seen a TV

971
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,540
show if they'd say foods ready and the foods ready like you know yeah. I'm in

972
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,940
the back of the house in the back of my house. I'm taking a fucking monster

973
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,780
dinosaur shit in my bathroom and that's where my bathroom is the back of my

974
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,660
house. Yeah, yeah, and I honestly when I'm doing his house, that's not true. It's

975
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,220
is completely false. Well, the back of my house is my bedroom. So I'm in there and

976
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:07,500
I'm is it wrong morally to take a shit and then do a cum shot onto the shit

977
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:12,060
because you save flesh? Yes. Yeah, I think it's I think it's completely safe.

978
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,700
One of morally wrong. So yeah, I think that's one of the I watch a

979
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,220
Kurzgesagt video about how there's no fucking water. So I'm saving water. I'm

980
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:25,740
doing cum shots onto my poop to say what the fuck did we just talk about

981
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:33,240
earlier with combshots. I don't like doing that. I didn't do a single combshot thing and you guys yelled at me for 20 minutes and now Caleb admits that he's

982
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,440
he's literally combining two things. He's shitting and pouring jizz on his shit like it's a Cinnabon. I'm not doing that.

983
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:55,440
It's literally you are basting your poop. I'm not trying to put sage and rosemary on it and basting my poop inside. You are taking your poop. I don't have a cast iron toilet that I get to temperature and baste it with my poop.

984
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,280
- I've been there. - I'm pasting with butter

985
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,640
in my nut. - You were putting your poop.

986
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,200
- Pasted in the nutter. - You were putting cheese

987
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,320
on your poop like it's ice cream

988
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,060
and you're trying to put one of those hard shells

989
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,480
that you can buy. - Yeah, I love those.

990
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,840
- I just remembered those just now.

991
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,680
- I had those ones

992
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,640
- You know what I had the dream I've always had?

993
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,600
- I had that at the beach.

994
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,920
- You know what my entire dream has always been?

995
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,200
Pour it on my tongue, get my tongue really cold,

996
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,040
pour it on my tongue, make it harden onto my tongue,

997
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,400
and now I have a chocolate tongue for an entire day.

998
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,240
And guess what?

999
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,760
Everything's tasting like chocolate.

1000
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,480
and then I could finally eat my vegetables. You might have to live in a cold place. No,

1001
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,240
I just tongue cold, cold up my tongue. Here's an idea as a prank, put it on the like a pole

1002
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,200
in the winter. Chocolate pole. Chocolate pole. Someone tries to go lick the chocolate pole.

1003
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,560
They get their stung, their stung. Stung pole. They get their stung. They get their stung.

1004
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:51,400
The thing is tongue stuck. If you just say stung, that communicates the entire meat. So you can just

1005
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,240
say I didn't they go up to it they put their tongue at they get their stung and

1006
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,480
people will know what you mean I didn't grow up in a very cold place did you

1007
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,760
guys ever put your tongue on a pole yeah I did it I did I did on my back porch

1008
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,680
did it get completely stuck yeah and I ripped it off and I saw like you ripped

1009
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,080
your tongue off I ripped my tongue off the back porch thing and I saw like a

1010
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,360
little bit of blood on my tongue yeah I didn't I didn't do it when it was um

1011
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,720
when it was that cold when I was afraid I did it when it was kind of cold I see

1012
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,000
the country of New Hampshire. Did you say oh fudge? You know when you're taking ice

1013
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,720
cubes out of the ice cube train you can feel them stick to your fingers a little

1014
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:34,000
bit? Yeah. That scares me, I don't like it. What if my rip, rip, what if my rip,

1015
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,240
you're like a bitch with no ass you ain't got shit. See that's I think unfair

1016
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,280
because I think there's plenty of women with no ass who actually have huge boobs.

1017
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,160
Yeah. But they don't have shit. They work at Hooters. It's just not about having boobs, it's about

1018
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,320
having shit. Oh, because he's saying if you have no ass, of course you can't shit. I hope

1019
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,600
women have no shit. That's actually a really good point. I thought it was a stupid line.

1020
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:01,240
It's a smart line. No, it's clever. If you don't have an ass, you can't have shit. No

1021
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,960
shit is coming out. I hope a woman has no shit in her butt ever. I think they try to

1022
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,480
keep it out. Yeah. I'm in the hood. I'm butta on bread like parquet and I'm all about me

1023
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,560
like do re do re like do re me do re me oh my god that's actually good how is he

1024
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,160
saying this is bad yeah I just didn't need the part where he says he's in the

1025
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,280
hood I think that's what author thinks I got old money could have bought a

1026
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,520
dinosaur clever hmm it's very clever it's about old money it's about it kind

1027
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,520
of engages with the issue of an ancient economy yeah it's actually academic yeah

1028
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,920
like what would you have bought it with Mr. Wayne? Yeah, I don't Mr. Wayne. I'm

1029
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,920

00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:06,220

1042
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,480
HIV positive I mean that's a again that's yeah like it or hate it I mean

1043
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,200
that is true that people who have HIV are pretty sick. Here's a scary one. Her head is crazy

1044
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:14,600
so she's insane. This is kind of like a horrorcore like ICP type line. Here's one below it, "You

1045
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,800
can't see me Ray Charles." Yeah, which is like, yeah. He can't see you. It's rude to

1046
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,040
Ray Charles, he can't see anybody. Yeah, like why, also you're not special because Ray Charles

1047
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:29,080
can't see you. Her toes smelling like, or smelling mint like Tic Tacs. This would be

1048
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,480
be a better line. I okay. I like the use of simile and metaphor and figurative

1049
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,980
language in rap, but this would be a much simpler and more evocative line. If

1050
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:41,180
you just said her toes smell like mint yeah and also you don't need the tic

1051
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,400
tax in there. It is a brand name. It's a crutch again. I don't know that yeah.

1052
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,280
He's probably paying royalties out to tic tac yeah. Just say second. She has

1053
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,100
minty toes. I've never heard any of these damn songs. I for all I know. This

1054
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:56,800
is a whole song about a candy woman. Yeah, you know like I she's got a bubble

1055
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,460
lips she's got she's got she's got laughing tacky nose you gotta say

1056
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,860
tackles bubble gum lips she's got laffy taffy and her butt is full of fudge is a

1057
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:11,540
complete it's got a fudge but it's not candy but it's okay

1058
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:17,880
not only hot like stove but I also cook like its cousin oven I told the bitch

1059
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,140
Jorge like the ketchup for the Yankees he's not currently the catcher for the

1060
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,860
Yankees anymore so if you listen to that later in life it's gonna make no sense

1061
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:32,540
Yeah, you know, I think Jorge Posada has now played for the Yankees in some time. He should say wait, what's hey

1062
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,540
He should a good line would be like I'm

1063
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,420
Completely swinging on her vagina

1064
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:42,000
My penis is a complete bat and I'm in I'm doing this in the same way as Aaron judge does I don't like a white ball

1065
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
With red. Yeah

1066
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000

1076
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,540
because you know I had my vitamin E.

01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,900
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1078
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,740
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1079
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,560

tell him to ketchup like mayonnaise.

1083
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,960
- A bitch is a female dog and a dog is a man's best friend.

- Oh, oh.

1089
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:25,580

1090
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,400
- Oh, I must have misspelled.

1091
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,420
- That's an app now, but I guess back then,

1092
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,260
it was just bomb.

1093
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,540

and these friends soft, they should be rapping in leotards.

1100
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,620
This is a line, this line, this next line here

1101
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,620
one that I've always wanted to add to one of my reps. I didn't know that he'd beat

1102
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:57,500
me to it. I'm hot too, baby girl, I'm soup. I mean what's what's hotter than soup?

1105
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:13,980
It's a cold, it's not even gazpacho. It's coldly red. It's a redly, boldly, coldly soup. It's entirely cold.

1106
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:21,580
completely ice-cold. You've been having hot gazpacho? Where? I just thought it

1107
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:26,300
meant soup. Gazpacho? No it's like a cold it's like a chilled what's in it like

1108
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,600
cucumbers or something. Tomato? Crap tomatoes. What? It's a cold tomato soup.

1109
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:37,780
The gazpacho that I had was completely white. Okay I just found out

1110
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:41,340
earlier when I said that when I said that. The gazpacho I had was completely white with

1111
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:47,740
chocolate chunks in it. Did you have it at my house? I had it at Baskin-Robbins.

1112
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:54,540
Oh I think that was ice cream. Well and it was hot? It was hot.

1113
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,900
Fudge was hot. Oh okay. I just had a banana with the banana and the cherry.

1114
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,260
Earlier when I was reading the sidebar I said he had a quote from

1115
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,460
somebody named the Honorable Sass. I've just got to the bottom of this blog post

1116
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:11,060
and see it says posted by the Honorable Sass. Holy shit it's him. Yeah at 301

1117
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,300
He says, "I arrest my case, now you be the judge."

1118
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,300
You got a picture of a judge.

1119
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,300
Is there any comments here?

1120
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,300
There's a lot of comments here.

1121
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,700
Let's just read one or two.

1122
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,380
Yeah, let's see here.

1123
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,580
Christian, I like the name, he says, "I completely agree with everything you say.

1124
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,660
Everything Lil Wayne says is intelligible or nonsensicable."

1125
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,620
This anonymous said-- Only if his fans see what we do.

1126
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,340
Anonymous said, "Last guy to post is a dipshit."

1127
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,340
Wait, what?

1128
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,380
Oh, wait, no, that comment continues.

1129
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:38,980
I thought he was just saying like, "Oh, whoever leaves the last comment is a dipshit."

1130
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,480
says wait anonymous says you guys are retarded Wayne's the best there is he's

1131
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,820
not retarded and how you gonna say a ten-year-old can write that it's true

1132
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:53,380
it's completely true I'm on Wayne's side let me just clarify yeah thank you for

1133
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,300
writing this I'm showing this to every Wayne fan I can find that's you know

1134
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,820
maybe they're fans of just Wayne's in general this is this article has a

1135
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,460
multi-generational kind of reach here there were three three years deep into

1136
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:08,340
comment section. Oh yeah, wow, I didn't even notice.

1137
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:14,820
Some people are writing some long comments here. Yeah. Yeah. I mean basically

1138
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,660
they're just, I would say they're mad because they can't come up with 50 lines.

1139
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:24,500
Lupe Fiasco, Aesop Rock, MF Doom, Deltron 30/30, Big L, Wu-Tang Clan, Jedi Mind

1140
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,420
Tricks, Brother Ali, and Atmosphere are 300 times better, yet none of them get

1141
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,420
the recognition they deserve Caleb.

1142
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:39,920
Fuck man.

1143
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,020
If you take him for what he is, he is pretty amusing couldn't help but laugh

1144
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,520
out loud at at least half of these lines.

1145
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,820
Maybe he's less of a rapper more of a comedian.

1146
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:52,020
He should do comedian four words Lil Wayne a fucking sucks.

1147
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,320
