1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
*Badass music*

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,760
*Badass music*

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,260
Well...

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,800
Happy birthday to you!

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,600
Happy birthday to you!

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Happy birthday, dear Cameron!

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,440
Happy birthday to you.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,960
I love that song so much.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,800
And Manny, the birthday song?

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,300
Yeah.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,800
I love happy birthday.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
That's what my weird math teacher in sixth grade said was his favorite song.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,880
The birthday song?

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,560
He said you would ask him what his favorite song was and he would know.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
He genuinely went,

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,800
"My favorite song is happy birthday."

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,200
He had you wrapped around his little finger.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,920
In more ways than one.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,040
That's my favorite song.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,480
Wrapped around your finger.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,580
linger had me wrapped around. I've had me wrapped around my own finger. The

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,300
Rugrats movie. That movie scared me. I thought that's in a Rugrats movie.

23
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,640
Yeah, dude, the Rugrats movie. Remember when he gets the new mall? I know about

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,200
the Rugrats movie that I've heard in Paris. Reptar, whatever the Rugrats

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,640
movie, though the Rugrats movie is the Rugrats movie. Rugrats. Oh, my God,

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,040
that movie is so heartbreaking, dude. When he's on the plane and he clicks

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,760
the flight attendant button because he thinks it'll bring him a new mommy.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,460
is that one? I've never seen this one. I still try that. That's the Rugrats movie.

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Okay. Rugrats in Paris as they go, which is a weird bunch of babies in Paris.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,240
That's your idea for the movie? Well it's mommies and daddies too. Yes there's

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,220
mommies and daddies there. The mommies and daddies go to Paris I assume. Yeah. But fucking Mr. Chetty

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,960
Chuckle. What's his name? Chester. No the fucking ugly kid. Tommy Pickles. Chuckie.

33
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,960
No, the ugly, Tommy Pickles is actually the handsome one of the Rugrats.

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Or Phil and Lil.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
What's his name?

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Chucky.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Chucky.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Chucky Finster and his dad Chester Finster.

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
Chucky tries to get a new mommy.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
I don't think that's his name.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Chaz.

42
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Is his name Chaz Finster?

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
I don't think that's that important.

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
I think the baby's name is Chucky.

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
Chucky Finster is looking.

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Maybe he goes by Chaz when he gets into all grown up.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Chucky Finster's mom has passed away.

48
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Is that for real?

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
I didn't never know that happened.

50
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
I thought that show was about crawling on the floor.

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
He gets on a, he gets on a, he gets on a, he gets on a, he gets on a, he gets on a, he gets

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,220
Lucky Fenster's mom has passed away. Yeah, that for real. I didn't ever know

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,680
that happened. He gets on. I thought that show was about crawling on the floor.

54
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,880
He gets on an airplane. I thought that show was about fucking ripped off. And

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,920
then he went to Paris looking for answers to questions that bothered him

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,680
so. Wow. And so he gets on the plane and he sees the flight attendant button and

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,320
instantly he's like, time to get a new mommy. The husband? The... Tries to

58
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,240
press the... The husband tries to do that, yes. The child son, the baby son

59
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
The child son of the Rugrat Daddy.

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
The child son of Chester Finster.

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Is it Chester Finster?

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Or Chez.

63
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Is it Chaz?

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
We have a guy who can look this up for me.

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
But the point is,

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
he gets a new mommy on the airplane.

67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
But it's not the mommy that he was looking for.

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
You have the chroma key on your hat.

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Sorry.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
It's kind of cool actually.

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
White hat, green hat.

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
White hat, green hat.

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,960
hat green hat white hat green hat. Yeah, you were doing yeah. Okay, I was trying

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,160
to figure out what that song was for that entire time. I figured it out

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,140
instantly. It does you or he always does the I don't think you were hitting the

76
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,380
right note on the one can tell green hat white hat green hat. You should be

77
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,740
green hat white hat the second time green

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
for the second time. Oh,

79
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:41,220
green hat, white hat, yeah, that's right. That's an amazing song and they need to

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,520
put little John back in the music and I think I know exactly what the music

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,260
video will be.

82
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,780
I got a green hat and I got

83
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,560
that's way too many words. Little John would never say all that. What are you

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,840
talking about? You would never say all that. He only does like three words per

85
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,720
bar. No, yeah, what's that song? But they don't

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,920
do shit, but they don't do shit.

87
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,920
You know the one.

88
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
That's four words.

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
All I ever remember.

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
That's a sick song.

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,360
All I ever remember about Lil Jon is his song where he talks about, or where they sing about

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,520
pussies and buttholes.

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,020
What's that song called?

94
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,260
What are you talking about?

95
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,200
The other song, Skeet, Skeet, Skeet.

96
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Oh yeah.

97
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Yeah.

98
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Which Skeet, by the way, probably.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,080
He says a lot of words in that song.

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,280
Well he says Skeet the most though.

101
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,240
He says, "All these bitches crawl, sweat down to my balls. I'll skeet skeet,

102
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,280
motherfucker." I probably didn't learn that skeet was a cuss until I was

103
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,040
probably 18 or 19 years old. Right, you were too concerned with shooting skeet.

104
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,080
Yeah. You were kinda thinking about that. I thought skeet, the thing is,

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,600
dude, I'm from the farm. Yeah. I'm from one. So I was out there and

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,080
I was shooting clay pigeons. You're from the manger.

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,760
I was born in a manger. Pole. I was saying pole to my assistant.

108
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,440
And you didn't even know pole could be a sexual word. Yeah, you didn't even

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
you know, it could be on your on your weenie and then all of a sudden I get to

110
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,400
the big city. They're saying we're pulling on my God, so it's making pulling

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,340
your thing till it's skeets and then they get mad at me. When I put my gun

112
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,180
thing till it's skeets, yeah, I used to think that it was just fucking. I

113
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,020
usually think it was just skeet because of the shooting. I didn't even consider

114
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,440
the pulling yeah, pull it and then you pull the pull, create skeet and then

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
you the pole does create

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,520
when you say pull it creates a great skit in flies up, he flies in this as high as

117
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,580
it can flies in a napkin or the sky, not a lies and you shoot skeet. I don't like

118
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,860
that they took skeet away from us and they made skeet a cuss. They made skeet

119
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,140
in I don't know. I guess I mean, I guess it's technically a cuss, but like if my

120
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,960
kindergartner came home and said skeet, I don't know that I'd be like how dare

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,360
you say, but what if like his friend is I think I was probably video recorded.

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,800
Yeah, I would think it was funny. I guess yeah, the same way I would if he

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,240
said fuck yeah, kids cussing is never gonna get old for me. It's always funny.

124
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
It's funny every single time my

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,040
mean towards you. My nephew tells on me when I swear, but then he says the

126
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,760
swear and it's so funny. He says he says like Uncle Pat, Uncle Pat said a

127
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,400
bad word and then my sister will be like what and he goes, he said mother

128
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,280
motherfucker that's on your that's on your sister. Why is she asking the kid

129
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
to say the word just say just say just trust him bad word yeah, but it's I

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,200
mean yeah, it's she's asking because it's funny. It's it is funny. Yeah,

131
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,760
it's funny. Every single it's funny every single time, but because he's got

132
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,480
a speech. It's funny when the kid gets trains like a train seal to say I agree

133
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,200
when parents I honestly think

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,720
I think that it's go actually trashy to cuss around your kids. Yeah. I think that

135
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,480
people should not be doing that. You got to wait till they're adults. Yeah, yeah,

136
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,600
even then I down a few middle school own to throw them out of what you can say

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
damn an ass in middle school, right, but I'm saying you have to you have to swear

138
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,440
in front of your kid one time in high school to late it to be like yeah,

139
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,040
that's right and even even when they're grown is all powerful, even when they're

140
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,880
grown adults until you're like a grumpy old man, you should not be saying fuck

141
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
this, fuck that, mother fuck you.

142
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,520
Oh, I'm complete trash.

143
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,020
Yeah, I know you are.

144
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,280
My parents swore in front of me all the time.

145
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I know, I can tell.

146
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,200
I was saying swears when I was a little boy.

147
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
My parents were not.

148
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,000
That's why I was an expert on swearing in elementary school and that's why kids would

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,340
learn cusses from me.

150
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,640
I learned that I could say crap at school when I was around my parents in second grade.

151
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Yeah.

152
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,880
I learned that I could say crap in third grade because out of Jimmy's head, that movie or

153
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,420
reanimated. They say the word crap in it, and it was the word crap was on Cartoon

154
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,840
Network on Prime Time, and I said, "Whoa." I wasn't allowed to say sucks. And then I

155
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,860
said crap. Really? I wasn't allowed to say this sucks. Yeah, I wasn't allowed to say

156
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,420
"shut up." There, in my third grade class, there were people who said that jerk was

157
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:08,560
on par with the F word, and they would try to get me in trouble for saying jerk.

158
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,940
what the fuck is wrong with these kids? Yeah, these jerks. Jerk is as bad as F-word?

159
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,680
Yeah. Hey, tell that to a

160
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,540
linguist. Yeah, tell that to a Jamaican linguist. Tell that to a cussist. Yeah.

161
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,980
Which I've been looking into becoming. The cussists versus the linguists.

162
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,040
A cussist is gonna take that every single time. Yeah. Words have power.

163
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,220
Yeah, words have power, but a linguist is gonna make a sentence that a cussist

164
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,580
couldn't even tell. But a cuss can basically, it's basically adapted to be

165
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,540
any word of the English language. It can basically mean anything. I'm going to do

166
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,420
some shit. I'm going to work some shit. I'm going to eat some shit. I'm going to

167
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,860
play with my shit. That type of thing. A linguist will know what the etymology of

168
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,340
the cuss word though. I have to go to fucking work. I have to eat fucking shit.

169
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm going to play with my fucking shit. It adapts. It can mean anything. I took

170
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,140
my shit out of the toilet. I took my fucking shit out of the fucking bitch

171
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,660
toilet. I fucked my shit in the toilet. I fucked my shit. And then I ate it. What?

172
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,780
That's so nasty. That's disgusting to think about.

173
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,460
Somebody fucking a shit and eating it.

174
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,420
But picking the image of a guy pulling his picking up his turd out of the

175
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,660
toilet is always funny to me.

176
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
We're back.

177
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,780
Anytime, honestly, if I imagine that the first thing that comes to mind is like

178
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,620
some kind of picture, the guy where he's like, guys, I just took the like as a

179
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,060
Reddit post where he's like, I took one of the biggest shits I've ever seen.

180
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,560
and they're all like. Why are you holding

181
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,460
still

182
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,720
holding a

183
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,860
that's like the size of a football? It's so funny. I always think like if you

184
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,180
somebody says pick up a shit. I imagine somebody like doing it at work yeah and

185
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,180
then having they're in like a meeting and then it's like a flashback scene of

186
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,380
them being like well. I walked into the bathroom. I took a shit and then it was

187
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,340
really big and I picked it up and took a photo that one of the funny things to me

188
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,180
about picking up a shit out of the toilet is as I whenever I imagine it or see it.

189
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,740
It's always somebody always is is full handing it yeah. You'll never see

190
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,520
someone daint like being like oh, I don't want to touch it. I was picking up

191
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,000
a shit. They're going you don't pick it up like in a clear. You pick it up like a

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,500
cell, like a baseball bat. I think that could be funny is like it up like it up

193
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,760
like picking it up. That's that's a that's a thing I've never thought about

194
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,060
because in my head, whenever I imagine somebody picking up a shit with their

195
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,340
their hands. It's always a full fist. It's always like, yeah. There's this kid that I

196
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,900
knew. I think I said it before, but there's this kid I knew, my brother's friend, they

197
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,620
called him Tater because he got blackout drunk and took a shit in the woods while he's camping

198
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
or something.

199
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Ron Weasley?

200
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,620
No, the Ron. It's Ron.

201
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
I don't know what the fuck.

202
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
The Ron who drinks.

203
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
The comedian.

204
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,620
Swanson?

205
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
The comedian from the blue collar.

206
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Oh, Tater Salad.

207
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Tater Salad.

208
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,620
The comedian from the blue collar...

209
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,620
Oh, Tater Salad.

210
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
Tater Salad.

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Ron White.

212
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
Ron White.

213
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Yeah.

214
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,100
But everyone called him Tater because he got fucked up, took a shit, forgot about it, and

215
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,060
then picked it up and was like, "I think I found a baked potato."

216
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
That is not a true story.

217
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,060
That is a lie story.

218
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
I don't know if it's true.

219
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
I don't know if it's...

220
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
I still think that that is funny.

221
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I don't know whether it's true or not.

222
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
It's a funny story, but it's not...

223
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,720
I think that that is funny story, but picking it up, picking up a turd and

224
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,360
saying, I think I found a baked potato is funny. It's definitely funny, but it

225
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,520
did not have the funny part of that is picking up the shit, though, yes,

226
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,440
and having the nickname tater is also funny. That is a made up story. Yeah, I

227
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,600
don't care. It's a false. I don't care. I told you this is a kid. His name was

228
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,620
tater because he ate a potato one time and they put a potato to school yeah and

229
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
they were like. Oh, you tater now that's tater and then he's like how do I how I

230
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
change this? How do I change the narrative? I'm going to pick up my he

231
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,480
told his story. No, my brother told me yeah, that's a fake one. Did you know my

232
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,640
brother said taters coming over that

233
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,600
tater chowder? Who the hell is my brother hanging out with food? Yeah,

234
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,600
he was best friends with Bob the tomato and Larry the fucking cucumber. I will

235
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:26,140
you

236
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
but I imagine it wouldn't be good to make a meeting.

237
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Wasn't there in the pickle Goliath?

238
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
Well then they show that they can forgive him.

239
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,140
Goliath is the pickle.

240
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
I don't ever watch that much VeggieTales.

241
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I watched a lot of it.

242
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,140
I watched a little bit when I went to church.

243
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
I had these little pewter VeggieTale action figures.

244
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Not even action figures.

245
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Instead of watching VeggieTales.

246
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
I was watching Newgrounds on the pewter.

247
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
As soon as I found out about Newgrounds,

248
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
VeggieTales was done with.

249
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,140
I watched VeggieTales.

250
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,820
I watched VeggieTales for a very long time. They had an amazing VHS case on the VeggieTales.

251
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,820
They had the green tapes.

252
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Yeah, they were green and they were really, you know those like huge ones that have a

253
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
lot of air in them?

254
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
Yeah, the puffy ones.

255
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I loved those.

256
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
The clamshell ones.

257
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Clamshells, that's what they're called.

258
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,140
They were amazing, dude. And the VeggieTales ones were really high quality, man.

259
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Yeah.

260
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,140
Wow.

261
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,620
And they had some great stuff on those boxes. A lot of info.

262
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,020
I love the info on the boxes.

263
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Me too.

264
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
I love looking at the run time.

265
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,420
I used to take them into the bathroom and I'd read them while I shit.

266
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,020
that was like a lot of there. That was a real primitive three D stuff, because

267
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,180
you re watch that they should remaster all that first of all

268
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,180
buddy. I have a movie for you.

269
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,300
There's you like an unreal engine five. Yeah,

270
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,660
dude like re like finding all the old three D models that they made for

271
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,100
regular, upscaling them with a and it gets all like fucked up. Yeah,

272
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,660
proportions are all putting like a billion more polygons or whatever. It

273
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,620
doesn't look anything like a vegetable. Yeah, yeah, like like San Andreas,

274
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,460
yeah, like the fucking San Andreas remastered. They're doing like that.

275
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,020
They turned Larry to a rack check and Benny. Yeah, Bob, the tomato is not a

276
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,340
vegetable. He's a fruit, yeah, but they also have the blueberry. He's definitely

277
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,620
a fruit. I'll say that much. He's walking around being a know it all. He's a

278
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,340
fucking, he's one of these closeted Christian guys that his mega church gets

279
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,240
defrauded or defunded because everyone finds out that he's gay. Like a Mark

280
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,980
Driscoll. Well, he wasn't gay, but he, I think my mother's surname, he was using

281
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,340
heroin, not heroin, prostitutes. Made a name. Or maybe drugs too. There was a

282
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:33,140
bunch of big church guys. I heard that happened to this one family called the

283
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,220
Gemstones. I've actually been watching this documentary about it. Wait, really?

284
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,140
Yeah, they were pretty crazy influential growing up in the South. Yeah.

285
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,340
yeah, but speaking of pickles, yeah, I did yeah. I went to the gemstone

286
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,220
church, yeah, yeah, and I worked at parks and rec to

287
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,660
yeah, it's true, and then when I works at at Dunder Mifflin and then I broke my

288
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,300
foot and went to scrubs. Yeah, I'm sorry, and I was friends with a guy named

289
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,140
Nintendo, and even when I was a baby, I went to cheers and I drank beer with I

290
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,900
drink beer with norm. Why didn't they call that show beers? They should have

291
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,040
that fucking show, Woody Harrelson's hairline timeline.

292
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,480
You go on the whole show.

293
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,780
Can I say?

294
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,180
Yeah, wait,

295
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,380
can I save it by presenting Cameron with his birthday? Yes, you can.

296
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,780
Yes, Cameron's birthday.

297
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,280
And it's also America's birthday.

298
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,480
Yes, but I don't give a shit about that because of my leftism.

299
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
That's fucking awesome.

300
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,380
Honestly, I see America's birthday is less of a count up and more of a

301
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,720
countdown. Yeah, count down to annihilation. Yeah, wow,

302
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,320
that's something I thought of a few years ago. Something something I know

303
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,780
about Cameron is that he loves music right.

304
00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:01,820
He is a the musician of our group. He see he loves this song. I like the

305
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
song more than I like anything in the world. So

306
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,960
well,

307
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,800
besides whatever I'm okay, all right, show him the birthday bash.

308
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,240
So I

309
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:18,320
spent painted. I came in here early today and I made Cameron something that is, I

310
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
think, so amazing.

311
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:28,580
Wow, George Michael, George Michael from way, I am which it's supposed to be

312
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,120
George Michael, but I said that this looks like to be, which is why I put

313
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,400
sunglasses in and also why you put George Michael. Yeah, I had to put his

314
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,820
name in the band. He was in good. It looks great even yeah, and I like you

315
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,560
put police department up there. I like that. No, that's my artist signature. Oh

316
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,580
yeah, well, I like okay. I was the police department was not very kind to

317
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,760
George Michael. If you remember history, I don't know anything about George

318
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,840
Michael really, and this is maybe a bad gift. I think George Michael, this is

319
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,960
exciting because it honestly makes me want to learn George Michael was one of

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,640
their first gaze yeah music. He was one of the first gay guys.

321
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,280
Last Christmas got on what would happen to him. They they set his ass up and

322
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,320
they're going to say on fire. No, they said his ass up. They made they knew

323
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,560
they said they knew he was a gay guy. They knew he was a gay guy and they're

324
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,200
trying to expose him the British tabloids. So then they enticed him with a

325
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,880
glory hole. When are we going to be done with that fucking tabloids? What are

326
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,060
talking about that is a total. He was set up. He was set up. How's that a set?

327
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,320
That's a complete and total. They had a paparazzi on the other side. They had a

328
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,520
yeah,

329
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,920
selfie of his and the police and the police

330
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,600
the other. The Bobby was on the other side of the glory box as they call it

331
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,160
right in the yeah. Well, no, it's just a difference like how they we call it

332
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,320
like a like a dollar, but they call it a they call it a pound. Yeah, I mean,

333
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,760
Yeah, you know, I didn't know that quid wasn't a different kind of currency

334
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,120
until last year. It's just a name for a buck. It's I thought that they had

335
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,640
quids and shillings, whatever it's called. Shillings is apparently old

336
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,160
shillings. They don't even use anymore. Yeah, I would hope not. They're old.

337
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,960
Yeah, they're made of metal.

338
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,040
He's got a lot of crowns in his mouth. I got it. I might have another one

339
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,740
on a Friday might get another crown in there because I cracked my damn tooth

340
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,680
open. So can you tell me why you chose George? So let me actually tell you

341
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,380
because I walked in and this wasn't George Michael when I came in. There was

342
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,220
a different face that was drawn on here and it was a picture of Vin Diesel, who

343
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,440
I like Vin Diesel, but what I said to Patrick was, oh, I get it. It's like a

344
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,980
cheeseburger.com/pun because it's on an easel. It's supposed to be Vin Diesel.

345
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:49,960
I think that's a bad change it. Yes, he's one. He saw the gift, so I got

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,320
self conscious facing the door. Okay, I didn't think that you'd be the first to

347
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,960
show up. Caleb said I'm on my way. You said nothing, so I'm already. I had no I

348
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,560
had no

349
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:08,000
thing. I had nothing to to to gauge my time and then I had to turn the white

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,160
board away from the door and I thought who does Vin Diesel kind of look like

351
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,680
right? Who can you? What can you add on? Yeah? What can I do to like you know

352
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,480
when they like do I can see the cover of the tent and kind of yeah,

353
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,480
that like a renaissance master yeah. You can kind of see does George Michael look

354
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
like that. I don't know. I don't look exactly like this. The fucking there's

355
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,980
like an album cover where he looks like this. He's a pink body and blue hair. He

356
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,400
looks pretty much and then I know he was gay to a tee. He looks like this. I

357
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,360
think I don't think he's a Mediterranean man. That's why oh yeah. George, my

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,600
real name is like George. He's Michaelopolis or something careless

359
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,620
He does these Quasimodo style soldiers.

360
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:56,620
That's just kind of like a perspective thing for my art style.

361
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,620
Maybe his left shoulder is a little closer to us and that's why it's higher up.

362
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,620
No, it's just because he's playing the guitar.

363
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
He's playing the guitar. Have you seen the...

364
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,620
Well, he has a music video. You don't know anything about George Michael.

365
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
He has a music video called "Faith".

366
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Well, I know that Limp Bizkit cover of that song.

367
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Here's what you should have done, man.

368
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:21,340
This is him in his leather jacket and his little Levi's 501s playing his guitar with his big

369
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
ass.

370
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Oh, I forgot the fucking earring.

371
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,340
I forgot the earring.

372
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,020
Here's what I would have done if I were you.

373
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Motherfucker, hear me?

374
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,740
You know, if I was Patrick, here's what I would have done for your birthday if I was

375
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
thoughtful.

376
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Okay.

377
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,580
Well, I have a birthday in 19 days.

378
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,140
I would have drawn for sure.

379
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,780
I would have done a drawing, and I would have done something wham, but it would have been

380
00:20:41,780 --> 00:21:05,060
in

381
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,220
I'm a girl. I don't really know. I think it was just a note of that. Why are you

382
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,040
saying? I don't really know. I don't really know, but I mean that's open for

383
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,500
interpretations. We're saying you're saying you're used more pink because

384
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,220
you're saying he's more girl than guy. What the hell you're saying? What

385
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,920
you're the most homophobic drawing I've ever seen. I was just homophobic

386
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,800
because you just admitted it was a meaning that I'm honoring him lips with

387
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,220
the pink and the beard with the blue. You say that he has a boy. He has a

388
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,220
his girl mouth and boy hair and boy beard. Yeah, I don't really know and you

389
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,060
say you're saying he has a beard also. No, it's homophobic drawing. I've ever

390
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,420
seen a beard. He had a

391
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,540
I guess a husband. I don't know. He had a husband and they were wondering died

392
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,500
on Christmas. He's dead. He died on Christmas. You're disrespecting this

393
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,260
day. He died on Christmas and he had a song called Last Christmas. That's

394
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,700
crazy sad. Yeah, wow, and the only good Christmas song. I don't want to die on

395
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,640
Christmas. There's no good Christmas song. There's no good Christmas songs, but that

396
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,060
one is, it sucks that that's a Christmas song, 'cause it sounds amazing. I don't

397
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,180
care so much for that song. And I want to listen to it all year round. I found out

398
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,920
this is a bit off topic. That's fine. I'm ready to leave this topic. Yeah, me

399
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,960
too. I think we should have left it a while ago. Alright, we'll leave it in

400
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,800
two seconds. Okay. One, two. I found out something amazing this week. Okay. In

401
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:29,940
1920 something, a man in Sweden swapped bodies... I've heard this. With a man in

402
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,720
the year 3960. Whoa. Yeah. Can you believe that shit? No. And there's a couple of different

403
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,100
facts about it. I mean, yes. And they're coming at you right now. Number one, in the future,

404
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,180
and this is 1920, this is before nuclear bombs or anything, but he said that there was a

405
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:57,580
nuclear war in the year 2800 and something, and it wiped out 90% of the population, including

406
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:07,720
most English speaking countries. So the dominant language in 38 whatever is a combination of

407
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:14,040
like Swedish and some other thing.

408
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Hope it's not Arabic.

409
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,240
Swedish and Greek or some shit.

410
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
Why don't you hope it's not Arabic?

411
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,960
Imagine that fucking alphabet. You got all those A's with the umlauts or whatever.

412
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,280
Jeff Dunham kind of racism coming out here.

413
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Problematic.

414
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,480
he's homophobic. Now he's being racist against whatever countries they do

415
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,780
Arabic and I don't know, but I didn't have to learn that I'm giving you the

416
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,680
I'm giving you so much knowledge right now and you're just trying to drop some

417
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,680
drop a little more because I have some know after this. Okay, so not only that,

418
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:50,380
but by that year we have moved on to the next stage of human evolution, which is

419
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,080
gills, not gill wings. It's not so you might think more you're thinking. Oh,

420
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,940
it's physical. Oh, it's surely a physical. It's a mental autism.

421
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,980
No,

422
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,520
there is a the next step of evolution is people start undergoing this this

423
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,240
spiritual change called nebelreich yeah, okay, spiritual is not so I knew no,

424
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,780
no, no, no, no, no, but it's your changes humanity. It changes humanity

425
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,360
from

426
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,200
being interested in the self and being selfish to being selfless and living

427
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,720
for others, and so by the year thirty eight hundred something and this

428
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,380
evolved it evolved, and if you were wondering about aliens in this universe

429
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,120
or in this timeline, this feature this university by this university mean our

430
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,660
universe

431
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,240
they've existed forever. They're around they're not interested in chilling with

432
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,680
us. Of course, they are guardians okay, and so once we get the nebo reich, they

433
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,900
pop in they say what up what up you joined the whole kind of League of guys

434
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:59,120
who don't give a shit about themselves and now you're awesome. The UN wow yeah

435
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,820
the United Nebulas, the uninterested and he spent the uninterested days and days

436
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,000
there in the body of a man who was in a coma and then woke up. Wow what was his

437
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,200
name? Some shit bull right? I don't remember that guy's name yeah, but that

438
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,440
which is my science facts of the week. I actually have some interesting

439
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,680
information, too, to drop. I mean, you go ahead. I just I knew a guy who

440
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,760
fully believed that

441
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,960
autism was the next step in human evolution. He fully believed this, and

442
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,400
he said he hoped all of his kids have autism. That was the big plot point in

443
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,680
that terrible Predator movie. Really? Shane Blackman. The Predator has autism?

444
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,920
No, there's a kid that it's so, dude, the kid, the main kid has autism, and

445
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,160
the predator like wants to get him and then they're like the scientists are

446
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,560
like the reason the predators trying to get this kid, I think I remember this

447
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,880
because he has autism in a thousand and eighteen, so like twenty seven yeah,

448
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,760
and it's not a good portrayal of it's like it's fully like a like a moaning

449
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,720
noise, a lot of it, but he's got like the predator wants them because he's

450
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,600
he's highly evolved. He's like a little kid and he's drawing like pictures and

451
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,800
he's doing like magneto like in the prison thing where he's doing the

452
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,840
standing up and all the stuff's flying around him. He's not doesn't do

453
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,920
anything or like Matilda in her house. He has no power line around her. Can't

454
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,340
you give yourself autism with if you microwave plastic or some shit? Let's

455
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,400
start doing that. What are you talking like the stuff in plastic? If we

456
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,480
microplastic, I know the that's when it's good. PPA. That's if you put

457
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,000
plastic in a shrinker. Yeah,

458
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,160
we should whatever you do do not use plastic bowls in your shrinking

459
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,160
machine. You can get up with a microplastic. You know what you can give

460
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,780
yourself, you put some plastic in the oven, Spider-Man, get some

461
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,060
Shrinky Dinks in there. True, Shrinky Dinks. Yeah. What's a Shrinky Dink?

462
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,540
We've had this... Okay, we can't get into that. We're not doing... We have

463
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,060
totally, 100% explained what a Shrinky Dink is to you. Let me share my

464
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,780
information, 'cause this is more important than Shrinky Dinks, which are

465
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,980
a kid's toy. Is it on the same level as my idea? It's barely a toy. It's

466
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,740
not quite on the same level, but I think that it could eventually get to

467
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,420
that level. Okay. Basically, this Facebook group that I've been moderating

468
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,120
for a while.

469
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah, so I've been moderating this Facebook group for like a little over a

470
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,740
year on Facebook.

471
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,460
I told you about this before. What is it? It's a conspiracy group for people

472
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,820
who don't like I don't want to say what it's called, because I don't want

473
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,820
people to join. How'd you become the moderator? I just like I like woke up

474
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,020
and I got a notification on my phone that said you are now an administrator

475
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,340
of this.

476
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,980
Like it just randomly gave it to me. That's amazing fighting spam on it,

477
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,240
which I so I've been kind of on the front lines of spam. I've known all that

478
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,500
you know all the spam links to try to get old people that are like

479
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,120
unfortunately, Justin Bieber has died going one hundred twenty miles and per

480
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,960
hour in Chicago. What I get those all the time wait and I see all the way

481
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,660
what happened to Justin Bieber. That was actually false like

482
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,600
Christ, but actually you know, let me actually check really quick what what

483
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,160
the current one is because they're always they're always doing stuff like

484
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,700
that.

485
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,620
they always have well. No, I can't. I'll find it later. Yeah, but anyway, I this

486
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,320
group that I've been moderating and kind of welcoming new members and such. They

487
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,200
recently added to Facebook a function where you can make a group chat attached

488
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,960
to the group and it will automatically put everyone in the group into a group

489
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,560
chat. Okay, and so I made this chat. I told everyone welcome, welcome and

490
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,280
everyone was saying hello. Hi. I was like, how's everybody doing?

491
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:33,640
And this is what I received from member Brenda. This is Brenda. Here's what

492
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,440
friend to so before you go. This is the Facebook group where the woman believes

493
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,100
that her son is an angel. No, I wish I was an administrator of that. My group

494
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,880
is a lot lamer. That's why I don't want to get up. I want to kind of make it

495
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,800
cool before I get

496
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,840
because it is kind of what I tried to start. I tried to start free thought

497
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,900
Fridays in there

498
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,280
and the only response I got was my guy going. What

499
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,680
it's been kind of rough getting this off the ground. Thinkers there,

500
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,180
yeah

501
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:07,280
wait. What was your idea for free throughout Friday? I just said happy

502
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,840
free thought Fridays. I was hoping someone would well. You should you

503
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,000
should have at least explain what it is to the people. I mean I'll do that

504
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,960
next for yeah, yeah, next I'm going to be doing a week. I'm going to be

505
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,120
ramping this group. Can you add me into the yeah? I only I only have a

506
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,600
Facebook to use my Oculus. This is the only reason I have a face, and I think

507
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,880
it's called Doug something.

508
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,200
So this is what Brenda messaged me when I said, how's everybody doing okay?

509
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,620
right now things are awkward as hell in this group. So what do you guys

510
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,320
personally think about Biden's latest comment about selling state secrets? Was

511
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,720
he kidding or did he let something slip that he really wasn't supposed to let

512
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,240
slip well, and then I said I wouldn't put anything past him. Yes, Anthony said

513
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,420
me either to him, then Brenda says I'm kind of thinking that his dementia mind

514
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,720
sold him out. There is no video that indicates that he was kidding. Look at

515
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,640
his face. He's not joking and then I said what's everyone getting up to

516
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,180
and

517
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:09,140
and then Jeanette said, and this is the bombshell. Jeanette said, I believe

518
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,200
Biden is played by four different people and we are watching theater these days,

519
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,860
whoa and I said true that and then Jeanette said a thumb sent a thumbs up

520
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:25,260
and then J M sent a thumbs up and then Brenda said is it only for whoa she's

521
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,900
thinking it might be more than four guys playing the president yeah. That is

522
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,960
incredible. Here's you are being so disrespected as a moderator. You're

523
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
asking what is everyone doing tonight? Nobody

524
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,960
completely. I'm being completely. That's why we got to get in there.

525
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,560
How's everybody doing? No. Okay. This is awkward. You need a couple of

526
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,260
plants in there. Yeah. Who would you send stuff like that? I can be like

527
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,560
free thought Friday. I'm having a fucking Wednesday. Yeah. I need maybe

528
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,960
maybe I will Crocs Monday. I'm switching my name Wednesday. Yeah.

529
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,160
Chlorine half chlorine half. So he didn't even participate yesterday in

530
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,760
Crocs Monday. Also, I wore Crocs yesterday. Did you send a photo like

531
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,200
me, Cameron, a dubio day Crocs Monday is a good day. That's a dumb ass day. It's a

532
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,800
good day. We are our group chat already has one other. What other day is going to

533
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,320
be cross day and there's no day that there's no reason of a crocs. Do you

534
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
think there's a day called crumb day? It has to be Monday that there's a day

535
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,960
called crumb day crocs crumb day. You think

536
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,600
for why you wouldn't have crocs. I'm saying that you're you have lost. Okay,

537
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,040
you think it's called cry day is or cry day. It should be casual Friday, which

538
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,680
is you can do it every or that's separate, whatever we can do free thought

539
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:36,300
Friday is that I'm staying, I would say I'm the the number one advocate for me

540
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,980
Wednesday yeah. I love me for me. Wednesday is very big in the group chat.

541
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,540
We see some funny as shit, but the skeletons jumping around their skeleton.

That's a hobby. It's a job

559
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,740
Well, it's a hobby when it's on eBay. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah, it's actually

560
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,780
completely true. So eBay, it's a hobby

561
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,660
loading dock. It's a job.

562
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,820
Yep.

563
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:13,100
Speaking of, well, what's Etsy? That's a hobby. Speaking of loading docks, wait,

564
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,040
no, we gotta keep going with what you're saying. Let me call out, let me call out

565
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,600
crossword creators real quick. Okay. When you have a clue that says "online

566
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,500
marketplace and you start it with E and you end it with Y and it's four letters

567
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,160
and you know that everyone's putting eBay in there, but every time 100% of the

568
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,280
time it's Etsy. People are on to you. We put Etsy in now. We don't think it's

569
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,200
eBay anymore. Switch it up. You stole the words right out of my mouth. Thank God.

570
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
That's something I've been thinking about. Thank God he said this. Yeah,

571
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,360
yeah. That's a really, I mean, thank God he fucking said this and also Walgreen

572
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:53,660
security guards. Yep. Yep. Talk to you. Do not need a gun. No way. You do not

573
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,020
need a gun and you need to stop buying Gatorade because I here's the thing.

574
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,860
Gatorades are free for them. I am sitting in the line minding my own

575
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,460
business and oh and there's another part about the security guys. The

576
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,820
security word, the word security needs to be on the front and the back

577
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,400
because when I'm in line behind you,

578
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,400
when I'm in line behind you, I am seeing just a black shirt, black pants, a

579
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Gatorade in the back of the head to make you go faster.

580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm seeing a black shirt, black pants, I think you're an usher for the law. I

581
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,420
have my extendable fork. I'm this is a problem. I'm seeing the all black

582
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,260
outfit, a Gatorade and a Glock on the guy's hip, and so my cortisol levels

583
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,440
going insane. I'm becoming so stressed out that I can't even see, right? I'm bumping

584
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,760
into stuff. I'm accidentally cutting the line in front of every single person and being

585
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,140
confused about tap to pay, right? Because of how much distress this is causing me. Until

586
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,680
I see them turn around and they have security on their shirt.

587
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,340
They have to have a big Velcro patch. Also, you should be wearing a bulletproof vest that

588
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:08,500
has a Velcro patch that says security if you're going to carry a gun. And if I pay you enough,

589
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,040
I get to shoot the vest.

590
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,240
hey and another thing hey Wendy's, thanks for making me my food the other

591
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,480
day.

592
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:23,160
It was good. What'd you get the thing that Dave's double the bag, the biggie

593
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,040
bag, what are you doing with a bag, the big bag or the full of hole, the biggie

594
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,280
bag or the full for four for five, and he they do a four for five. I think it

595
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,120
said four for four. That is so fucked. I think they have four or five and six.

596
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,280
The Biggie Bag is the, they have five and six and they also do four for four.

597
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:51,160
When Applebee's adjusted the two for 20 to be the two for 25, I felt a disturbance in

598
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,160
the force.

599
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I like sat in my, I remember being at home and feeling like a shockwave over my body.

600
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Because Applebee's changed.

601
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Applebee's changed.

602
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,540
Applebee's is not good man.

603
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,120
I've been to Applebee's I think two times.

604
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
No shit.

605
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
I think I've only been with you guys.

606
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah.

607
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,920
You go there, you get two meals for $20.

608
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,420
I'm a TGI Fridays man.

609
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,120
Or a Red Lobster fan.

610
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Red Lobster.

611
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,120
I guess so. I didn't grow up with them.

612
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
In my head, it's rare.

613
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Yeah, I've never really been.

614
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,120
I've actually never been to Red Lobster.

615
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Only Red Lobsters in Connecticut and New England.

616
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
I always just got the

617
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,120
they have the cheddar biscuits.

618
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Chibio's pulling up Chili's. Chili's for me.

619
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Chibio likes Chili's.

620
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
I've only been to Chili's one time.

621
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,220
Chili's is good. Chili's is better than Applebee's. Yeah, Chili's you can get nachos in.

622
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Yeah. That's a big bonus. I didn't even know that. Yeah. I didn't even know that.

623
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Speaking of jobs and working at different kinds of jobs. Speaking of workplace accidents.

624
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Well, okay, so at Chili's, what kind of workplace accident would you get? Getting the chili in your eyes

625
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,220
from the logo. That's so true. Fajitas accident. Stabbing yourself on a chili.

626
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Yeah. Bringing a fajitas to a table and a

627
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,220
little punk puts his foot out. You're 100% right. Why didn't

628
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,620
some that definitely there's some ocean violation with with the good search.

629
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,220
Yeah.

630
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,920
But fuck I should have looked up for heat. We today we decided that for the

631
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,920
fourth of July and I got to look up who suggested this in the disk. What's

632
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,520
more American than getting extremely physically injured at your job? That's

633
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,920
my point of view. At least. Yeah. Well, I think the only thing more American

634
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,020
than that is being unemployed. Holy

635
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,020
Holy fuck on that and there should all honestly be an OSHA for people who

636
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,920
don't have jobs.

637
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,640
That was I think this was vex. Okay, so thank you vex in the discord for

638
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,840
sitting this OSHA for people who don't know OSHA stands for oh shit. He hurt

639
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,760
his arm

640
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,720
oh yeah. He's and

641
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,600
which is a some kind of it's a some kind of acronym that it's a saying it's a

642
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,280
saying basically it's a popular so anytime somebody says this saying is

643
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,640
very powerful on a work site, the government, which I don't even get me

644
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,380
started on the government, but the government has to put this in a database

645
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,780
of every time somebody said oh shit he's injured. So we they have an online

646
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,080
database and we found some hilarious accidents, some funny as accidents and

647
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,780
we had a rule yeah and if it wasn't for this rule, I want I want to say this

648
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,700
should be a much funnier episode yeah, but the only one got Mary, but the rule

649
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,760
was we couldn't do anything where somebody died, which was I'm going to say

650
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,340
ninety percent of the pretty much crazy a good chunk of them. Yeah, can I say

651
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,180
one that where someone died that I didn't put in yes, cowboy died falling

652
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,820
off horse

653
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,500
because every other things these are the word employee, but there's one that

654
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,280
said cowboy.

655
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,620
Okay, so cowboy, but that one's not fun. Someone died. Somebody's not a tragic

656
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,840
cowboy passed on to the next not funny because the ranch in the sky, the cowboy

657
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:07,320
didn't die in like a gunfight or any like a lasso thing. That should be a cow.

658
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,200
By the way, cowboys should not have a job. That's not a job. That's not a job.

659
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,940
That's a thing you wear for Halloween. That's a legend. Yeah, and you should not

660
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,700
have. OSHA should not be involved in cowboy. That's the most dangerous job

661
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,320
there is yeah. They have a different man. They have a different. It's the same as

662
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,440
a ninja. Yeah, a robot exactly. Why the fuck are you a cowboy is exactly the same

663
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,680
as being a rope, although there is a lot of robot stuff on ocean. Yeah, if you

664
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,120
search robot all right, throw up my power point, I'm going to go for a that

665
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,680
was another good search term. Yeah, I don't have all so many drive heave

666
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,140
all right. So here's here's some that I found some accidents.

667
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,760
Employee is injected with soapy water at approximately seven forty AM on

668
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,280
September, Fifth, Two Thousand and Six Employee Number One was cleaning

669
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,240
mandrels. I don't know what that is when she accidentally injected herself with

670
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,620
soapy water. No

671
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:03,060
injecting a man, how could we have stopped this? What kind of regulation do

672
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,300
we need to come? Well, first of all, we should probably not be cleaning with a

673
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,820
syringe. Yeah, I agree. That's probably the number. How are you injecting

674
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,100
yourself with a syringe for the sponge? Yeah, let's use a sponge. I miss a

675
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,620
wrench, a brush you

676
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,240
using a syringe on the ground to clean something. It really makes it a

677
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,560
fish. It doesn't even like it. It doesn't even make any sense. I'm

678
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,520
getting flustered and maybe the mandrels can stay dirty. If it's between that and

679
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,560
injecting yourself, mandrels are not that listen. Even if you inject yourself

680
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,200
with soapy water, you're not going to become cleaner man. No, you're not

681
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,080
going to clean faster. You're not going to be able to use your skin to scrub

682
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,920
the. There are so many of these incidents where you read it and then you

683
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,960
think to yourself, oh this guy was trying to become a superhero in this way. Yeah,

684
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,360
there's one where you'll see that is one hundred percent. That is one of the

685
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,800
craziest things I've ever read.

686
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Here's this next one employee suffers respiratory distress, brought on spray

687
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,160
deodo. Was this the one assumed deodorant? Was this the one you're just

688
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,500
mentioning? No, you'll know okay, you'll know I was trying to become deodorant

689
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,860
man

690
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:13,060
at seven thirty PM on September sixteen twenty eighteen, an employee was

691
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,300
cleaning shift change in a patient's room and suffered respiratory distress

692
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,040
brought on by the spray deodorizer. My God, this is me in the damn locker room

693
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,020
in middle school. Yeah, I was in friggin sixth grade acts, dark temptation,

694
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:31,720
the acts. But also I have to say this guy probably was stinky. Yeah, if he's

695
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,400
so allergic to deodorant that he's having to go to the hospital, he was

696
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,120
stinky. This is employee turns into chocolate man after spraying acts, dark

697
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,320
temptation on himself. That's a good commercial. That's the most amazing

698
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,060
commercial of all time. All right, here's the next one. Employee accidentally

699
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,120
ingest brake cleaner. It's really making me laugh at nine thirty a.m. On January

700
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,420
thirteen twenty twenty, an employee filled a Gatorade bottle that was in the

701
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,680
shop with water and Mio energy liquid concentrate. The employee drank from the

702
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,860
bottle and thought he smelled a chemical odor, but figured it was a co worker

703
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,220
working on something in the shop. The employee took a second drink from the

704
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,860
bottle, finishing approximately seventy five percent of the contents. After

705
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,840
taking the second drink, the employee realized the chemical smell was coming

706
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,120
from the Gatorade bottle and recognize the smell as break cleaner that had to

707
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,600
be like a play. Okay, so seventy five percent of it to drink. This was an

708
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,320
empty. This was an empty Gatorade bottle that you had been used to house break

709
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,140
cleaner. At some point, I guess it doesn't really specify. I would like to

710
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,180
imagine that there it was a partially full with something and he just talked

711
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,100
and he's a what is break cleaner smell like this is, if anything, this is an

712
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,740
amazing

713
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,780
advertisement for me. Oh yeah, me, a mask, the taste of break cleaner, you can

714
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,420
drink anything with me, but also if he had not put the bio in, he wouldn't have

715
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,100
had nausea, which is what he suffered from true. It was the aspartame. The

716
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,780
accident was because of the meal they called O show over some nausea. It was

717
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,180
not I mean I think you had to go to the that's some bullshit, but

718
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,980
this is the

719
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
insane

720
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:16,460
employee incurs arm swelling from piglet vaccine infusion. He was trying to

721
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,820
become pigmen in at nine a.m. on October fourth, twenty nineteen, an

722
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,140
employee who worked on a pig farm was administering exceed vaccinations to

723
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,300
piglets. The employee infused herself with a full dose of the vaccine in her

724
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,460
left arm. The employee had a serious reaction to the vaccine, cold and

725
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,340
holding swelling and restricting blood flow. What was the vaccine? Exceed

726
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,340
vaccinations? She was vaccinating piglets and she thought I'm going to put

727
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,340
this in my arm. I might as well give myself the piglet. What is it? What is

728
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,080
it? A seed vaccination? It's probably some kind of vaccine for pigs. Don't

729
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,660
worry about that. I don't yeah. It's what I don't do to the pigs. It probably

730
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,740
prevents disease. Probably prevents exceed yeah or maybe it makes them

731
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,440
succeed piglet vaccine infusion is so insane yeah. I couldn't believe this.

732
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,980
This is why I didn't this is this does not seem like an accident.

733
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,980
Oh, it's not an accident. How do you put a full she was wearing roller skate?

734
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,780
She was like whoa,

735
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,300
how do you put a full thing of old piglets vaccine in yourself?

736
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,780
Yeah, but it just her arm just swelled yeah, it's really not that I would have

737
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,900
thought it was well. Yeah, I thought something bad happened snout or

738
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,340
something or a tail like a tail. Oh my God, no, yeah, yeah, that'd be bad news.

739
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,640
Okay,

740
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,180
so employee experiences, nausea and fatigue while working at approximately

741
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,640
nine thirty AM on September two two thousand and eight employee number one,

742
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,520
an inspector was at a cinema roof performing steel inspection. He was

743
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,200
feeling a little weak and went downstairs to the restroom in the

744
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,460
bathroom. He started to sweat, so he walked towards his work box area where a

745
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,520
the worker gave him some milk. The employee immediately vomited an

746
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,600
emergency medical services were called. He was taken to the hospital and given

747
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,000
an injection. They prevent nausea and vomiting a handheld nebulizer treatment

748
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,080
with breathing medication was as minutes was administered because he sounded

749
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,880
congested. He was diagnosed with weakness, malaise fatigue, but was not

750
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,240
hospitalized. He was released after four hours without any work restrictions and

751
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,960
was advised that his blood work and EKG were normal. The attribute the employee

752
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,920
attributes his symptoms and condition to his personal medical condition and not

753
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,720
work related. He did not want to disclose additional information about his

754
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,060
physical condition and did not want to sign a medical record release form. So

755
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,900
he got ranks and milky threw up and he had to go to the hospital wow and then

756
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,800
he got so embarrassed that he didn't want to sign

757
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,980
medical release. They were like you're completely normal. Nothing is wrong with

758
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,000
you. He's like this is actually because of my personal

759
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,940
we need to call you right now.

760
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,240
He's sweated in the bathroom. I've had like moment like moments like that,

761
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,660
where I'm like if we had to file a sick complaints for this for the podcast, I

762
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,160
would have this complaint ten thousand yeah yeah. Oh my God, I'm a yeah tummy

763
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,400
sweating in the bathroom yeah, taking your shirt off to poop. I don't take my

764
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,960
shirt off to poop. Mine was already have it off okay.

765
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,040
Kind of cool to learn

766
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:14,100
okay, then we have employee injured by soccer ball and please tell me this is

767
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,040
in Fifa. An incident occurred when employee number one was seriously

768
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,120
injured by a soccer ball. The soccer ball hit employee number one's head while

769
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,740
supervising kids playing soccer ball. Employee number one was transported and

770
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,900
confined at the hospital for treatment of her head injury and concussion

771
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,660
occupation, guards and police. So I got it was a school cop. A cop got hit by a

772
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,160
soccer ball in the hospital and then called OSHA yeah yeah. I feel like he

773
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,500
was planning that he's like I could probably get some. I was a girl. I was a

774
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:46,300
girl yeah. He doesn't think girls can be a lot of years. No, I don't know yeah. A

775
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,540
lot of years are girls. A lot of them are women. You're trying to hurt girls.

776
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,580
No, I don't think you're trying to make a lot of girls hurt. You don't think girls

777
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,980
die as much as guys, because they don't have as many jobs.

778
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,720
No kidding, okay, then these are just a bunch of ones that are that don't have

779
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,560
descriptions. I just put the funny title. So employees suffers non work related

780
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,220
chest pain. So why call Osha? I don't know this doesn't doesn't fit to me.

781
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,260
Seems like you shouldn't call Osha for that employee suffers burns when sprayed

782
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,420
by thick hot beach.

783
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,200
Is that a death that we know? No, none of these are deaths, but the I mean this

784
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,680
the description of this was like a juice and employee got sprayed and burned very

785
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,760
badly. It's not very pleasant, but thick hot beet juice. Yeah, it feels like the

786
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,320
titles are funnier than yeah. So then

787
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,080
I have a whole series. I'm going to go through lightning round here. Okay,

788
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,700
employees attacked by lion employees hand is bitten by wolf employees finger

789
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:46,280

00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,780
attacked by river otter employee injures leg when attacked by panda, when

791
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,760
attached by panda bear employee, injured by venomous vector. When I have been in

792
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,420
this vector

793
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,040
by venomous

794
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,780
employee is bitten by insect during maintenance employee performing some

795
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,380
apartment maintenance and was bitten by an insect. He hadn't seen employee

796
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:04,780
injured when

797
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:11,060
employee injured when door kicked by camel door kicked and that's all I have

798
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,660
car door,

799
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,920
but I know that we that these are all from a zoo. We have to live in the

800
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,460
fantasy land where these guys are working a factory floor. They get

801
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,020
sat on by an elephant, best buy, all that kind of thing. Yeah, the best by

802
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,260
elephant, it fucking just sits in there. All right, go over to my sleds.

803
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:34,560
I pretty much have the full of all of these employee experiences, adverse

804
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,600
reaction after insect bite to G and I'll tell you what G is at three thirty PM.

805
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,080
An employee was operating a forklift when he was bitten by an insect on the groin area.

806
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,500
No, the employee was hospitalized due to an adverse reaction that required cutting away

807
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,740
the infected area.

808
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,740
This guy got his penis cut off because a bug bit him.

809
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
That is not good news.

810
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,860
I also have a similar one to this one.

811
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,860
I can show you later.

812
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,860
This is awful, awful news.

813
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,860
That's terrible.

814
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,860
And he was 57 years old.

815
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,500
So he was a little past his sexual prime, so I'm not too worried about it.

816
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,300
doesn't matter that yeah. There's just like there's basically menopause for

817
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,540
employee. I bet it was an excuse. I bet he didn't even get bit by a bug.

818
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,600
Employee lacerates genitals with skill. So, oh my God,

819
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,660
what

820
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,260
employee

821
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,620
number one was preparing to change

822
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:34,540
bracket on a skill saw. He did not unplug it. He was kneeling with the saw

823
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,780
between his legs and you

824
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:41,720
to rock the nut holding the blade as he did. So the saw started climbing up his

825
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,820
pants leg and lacerated his genital. He he rocked his nuts for sure.

826
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,540
He definitely rocked his I would call that an unskilled saw

827
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,680
yep

828
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:02,620
employee is not injured, falls asleep operating vehicle hell yeah employee

829
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,600
number one, the driver and co worker were traveling in company work vehicle on a

830
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,860
public road. Employee number one fell asleep at the wheel and drove off the

831
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,140
road into a fence. Employee number one did not receive any injuries in the

832
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,260
accident. The co worker was taken to the hospital and underwent a medical

833
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,060
examination after being

834
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,100
valued by a physician. He was released on the same day. My thing with this is

835
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,140
why are they calling OSHA? Yeah, why are you there's a lot of stuff on here?

836
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,420
There was one two that I didn't put in or another another like death one that I

837
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,700
I don't put in because it was a death is like employee dies at home from non

838
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,380
work related

839
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,100
you could have put that way in

840
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,980
and this guy following the rules.

841
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,380
The occupation, it says

842
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:51,580
the something hard and soft. I can't read that. So I make tile tile setters,

843
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,620
oh, I'll setters hard and soft.

844
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:58,620
This one is employee struck by slow moving vehicle. I like this one a lot

845
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,460
employee number one while working as a

846
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,700
I can't read that something inside a construction zone. You made your shit

847
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,620
was hit by a vehicle driven by an elderly man.

848
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,100
The vehicle was traveling between five and ten

849
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:20,940
he was taken to the hospital for treatment of a laceration and concussion.

850
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,880
So yes, I'm some okay going five miles an hour in a car hit this guy while he

851
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,100
was working in a construction. So that's funny yeah. I like that one.

852
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:35,440
employee becomes ill while picking fruit and employee was packaging table grapes

853
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:42,920
when packing grapes the employees. Oh my God, I made everything so what the hell

854
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,080
did you do? The point is this bitch was

855
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:52,120
felt numbness, blind, blurred vision and shortness of breath for no reason. While

856
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,920
well, you know, a bitch, this old lady, she was 42 years old and she didn't even

857
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,320
the hospital. She just felt ill while she was picking fruit. Why would you report that to

858
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,000
OSHA? Sometimes I feel ill when I'm picking fruit at the grocery store because of how

859
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,080
many options there are. Yeah. Or also the bananas are brown. Oh yeah, when I go to the

860
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:13,240
exotic fruit section, I touch a dragon fruit. This is an employee injured by venomous vector.

861
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,200
We won't do that one. Venomous vector is so funny. I read the whole thing. There's nothing

862
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,000
they don't say at all. What could it possibly be? It's got to be a cobra. But at the bottom

863
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,640
it does say bee sting animal bite. So it's got to be something. Oh, another one that this

864
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,580
this reminded me of that I put in that I didn't put in was was employee bitten

865
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,020
by a snake or spider.

866
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,720
They were like he wasn't sure what he got by two employees are injured from

867
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,480
firearm discharge. Oh, so I won't read this whole thing, but what happened here

868
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,260
is that they were at a range and a guy shot through his own hand into another

869
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:50,920
guy's asshole. Oh, the whole yeah, the asshole and then these two guys decided

870
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,360
to call OSHA with a bullet in the guy's ass. They called OSHA because they were

871
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,460
at work. I bet there were police officers right. They were guards and police,

872
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,240
yeah. So there were two cops and he shot through his left hand into another guy's

873
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,560
ass. Jesus! It's kind of cool. I thought it was kind of a neat one. I would love

874
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,000
to see that in a movie. Employees buttock impaled by rake.

875
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:20,080
Employee fed, fell off a bed, the bed of a dump truck and landed on an asphalt

876
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:35,120
a

877
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,420
Hey, look, I got a hole in his asphalt for sure. Come on now.

878
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,320
Because of his butt, he got a hole in his another hole in his butt.

879
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,520
He said he got a hole. He already had a hole. He got another hole.

880
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,820
Talk about tearing him a new one.

881
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,020
There we go. Okay.

882
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,220
Okay, it was it was right there and I didn't take it. Employee is injured

883
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,620
when cow charges in the gate. A part-time employee with the livestock

884
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,760
the market was helping to move cattle to designated peers during a livestock

885
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,760
auction. As a cow was moving down an alley, a co-worker signaled employee

886
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,480
number one to let the cow enter a particular pen. As the cow approached the

887
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:18,220
designated pen, he opened the pen gate, but the cow stopped. Employee number

888
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,680
one then backed up to allow the gate to fully open and stood behind it. Rather

889
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,560
than enter the pen, the cow jumped over the gate.

890
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,280
Whoa. What the... This is a high jumping cow. Employee number one...

891
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,340
one. Yes, this is a one of the highest jumping cows. Okay, here's what it

892
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,900
should say. Rather than enter the pen, the cow jumped over the gate,

893
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,340
breaking a world record. No, no,

894
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,580
'cause one of them jumped over the moon. Yeah, jinx.

895
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:48,380
That is not even true. That's a true story from a true song.

896
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,280
That song is supposed to be like Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. It's not

897
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,140
called a... The cow struck the gate, knocking it. Okay, the cow jumped over

898
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,840
the moon, including the gate.

899
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,580
diddle diddle is exactly like record the Edmund Fitzgerald. The cow struck the

900
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,980
gate, knocking it into his face. Employee number one was transported to

901
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,060
the hospital and transferred to a medical center where he was treated for

902
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:14,900
fractures. His upper jaw nose and both eye sockets. His sense of smell was

903
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,260
also impaired. Oh no. Well that might be nice if we're working on a farm.

904
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,260
Yeah, you can't smell cow. You're in a livestock market. It's pretty actually

905
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,260
kind of a blessing to have your sense of smell impaired.

906
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,660
worker unearths beehive and is stung in the face over 100 times. I have this one.

907
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,860
You have this one? Yeah. Well, I'll save it for you then. You could use this one

908
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,820
later. Oh, you read it. I don't have it. I just have the title. Oh, it's my last one.

909
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:41,580
Yeah. On 8 a.m. on August 10, 2017, employee number one employed by a

910
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,780
construction company was clearing land at a job site.

911
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:50,140
Employee unearthed a beehive. He was stung in the face over 100 times.

912
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,740
Emergency services were called and the employee was transported to the hospital.

913
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,280
he was admitted and treated for the beastings.

914
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,680
If you could believe that one hundred one hundred times, I don't think I could

915
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,380
fit those on my face. Also, the word stung by a hundred is a big for an

916
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,500
earth. Yeah, it was about a receding hair. It was covered in honey. Yeah,

917
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,900
that goes up to the top of his or wait. What do bees make honey? They like

918
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,540
these like flowers and flowers. I've been covered in flowers and bear fur.

919
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,900
Yeah, I don't like bears. It says here. He was it says like honey or whatever

920
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,940
Earth moving equip.

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,540
All right. So these are just some titles. I found that I did liked

924
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,540
key. Well keyword guy. Yeah,

926
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,740
You didn't I guess Cameron found

927
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:56,380
but I have a sense for when we find the risotto did not return any results.

928
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,620
Results for no results for risotto.

929
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,140
That is fucked.

930
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,260
That is so fucked.

931
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:06,940
Employee fractures tibia and fibula after being kicked by a no employee

932
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,020
suffers from preexisting condition.

933
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:14,100
Worker on Earth's beehive and is stung in the face over 100 times.

934
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,900
Worker injures hand and noodle machine employee fractures hand while sorting

935
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:19,740
heavy grapes.

936
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:26,900
So it's a heavy grapes. Oh my God, I squeeze you do. I could read it on my

937
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,460
computer

938
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,100
teacher is inadvertently struck by student falls and breaks. So what

939
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,560
happened was the teacher breaks employee number one, a teacher employed by a

940
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,540
school district was watching students play a game of four square. One of the

941
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,380
students backed up into the teacher and knocked her onto the ground. Emergency

942
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:50,260
surfaces were called. I think she broke yeah. She fractured her hip. Oh my God

943
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,120
after she was

944
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,760
I like to think that she was watching this four square game and just like

945
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,120
throwing down like one dollar

946
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:04,860
but this next one employee is injured when struck by frozen chicken. Oh, you

947
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,800
marked this one up yeah. I marked it, but then realized the window was too small

948
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,960
for me to read anything

949
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:16,860
Yeah, an employee on January. Yeah, employee of a temporary employment

950
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:22,160
agency attempted to clear a blocked pipe on the jib chiller while clearing the

951
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,060
blockage. The employee was struck in the face with a plug containing ice and

952
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,160
chicken parts. Employees suffered a broken jaw and shoulder injury. That was

953
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,160
what was blocking the pipe. Chicken part made of ice and chicken. Yeah, my God.

954
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,560
Imagine like getting your shit rocked by like a chicken wing.

955
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,960
Yeah, that was so bad. Yeah, it's not even a chicken. It's chicken parts.

956
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,860
Yeah, employee is injured and fall from ladder. Now you think like, oh, this is

957
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,760
just like a typical like, oh, he fell hit his back. No, he was getting a

958
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:58,660
cheese sample from a hopper. He slipped and let or can you make the window big

959
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:02,660
again? I like can't read it all. Approximately six feet landing in a

960
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:06,860
straddling position on a handrail. I found this because of the keywords penis

961
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:13,240
the ladder slip packing. So if he fell off of a ladder, this is on his wiener

962
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,780
and balls. Yeah, a handrail. This happened at like

963
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:22,880
like I feel like this is a Kevin McAllister trap. Yeah, there's no way

964
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,340
and you're not let Kevin McAllister onto the work. So no, no, this guy is

965
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:31,780
not. He's a child. Second of all, this guy has not done an OSHA forty hour.

966
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:38,220
no access to this thing from maybe he has now maybe he you know. I mean that movie

967
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,420
came out in what ninety three and Kevin McAleish has got to be old enough now.

968
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,120
Now yeah

969
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:48,920
employee is bitten on penis by Black Widow spider. That's scary. That is so

970
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:55,020
so the employee. He was working on a job site went into the porta potty and got

971
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:58,920
his his penis bit by a Black Widow. That's horrible. Which I thought he was

972
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,440
fucking the spider wait. This is Kern County. Where's that? This is in

973
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,800
Bakersfield. Oh

974
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,520
oh my God,

975
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,600
yeah, but the so I guess black widows is another reason why I don't ever want to

976
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,320
shit in a let me read this. This sentence that's at the end, a causal

977
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:23,560
factor for this event was identified. This guy did something yeah. He was he

978
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,160
was fucking the spider to fuck the spider man. What do you think he tried

979
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,400
He was trying to kill the spider with his penis.

980
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,560
Yeah. Do you think that he was trying to do that or maybe he went in there to

981
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,120
take a shit? Maybe it was just because I mean hey,

982
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,240
when you sit down on a porta potty toilet those things are kind of deep.

983
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,920
That's gotta be such a nightmare to get bitten on the dick and realize it was a

984
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,520
black widow.

985
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,200
Yeah, it could have been any spider. Yeah, because that could have destroyed his penis for good.

986
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,640
It probably did. I'm sure it did. They definitely took away part of it.

987
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,840
Yeah, well, speaking of taking away a part of penis, I found the absolute

988
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:08,240
worst thing in the world and the reason why I don't wear sweat pants.

989
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,240
I think I've talked about it before.

990
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,240
Your print is too small.

991
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,240
My print is too small, but

992
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,840
employee is entangled in mixer and is seriously injured.

993
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,640
Oh no!

994
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,640
Employee was wearing loose cotton drawstring shorts.

995
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,440
Fuck!

996
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,480
The other drawstring dangled loosely on the outside panel of the front shorts.

997
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,580
He was cleaning a like in a mixer.

998
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:36,880
The outside drawstring on employee one short gotten tangled in the rotating

999
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,480
shaft where the accessories are usually attached.

1000
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,580
The inside drawstring wrapped around employee one's testicles and the shaft

1001
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,280
of his penis, while the outside drawstring pulled employee one into the

1002
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,480
commercial mixer.

1003
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,280
Read the next thing.

1004
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:58,680
The employee's skin degloved from the shaft and castrated his two testicles as

1005
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:04,020
a result of the accident. Employee one picked up his testicles off the ground

1006
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,200
where the commercial mixer is located, then placed them inside of a plastic bag

1007
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,100
with an ice pack. Physicians were unable to reattach his testicles, but were able

1008
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,880
to perform a skin graft to replace the lost skin on his penis.

1009
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:26,000
that is that is actually worse than dying. Three times worse D Glove, the

1010
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,640
he get a

1011
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,260
pick those balls up off the ground.

1012
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,300
War, she did the

1013
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,540
leg. They didn't loving of the skin on the shaft here. Okay, first of all,

1014
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,420
this is this. I put this in here as a PSA against sweat pants, but I also

1015
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:46,820
put it in here as a PSA against circumcision. This is what you're doing

1016
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:53,140
to your babies every single time, but it probably would have not have happened if

1017
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,860
he was circumcised. Keep it good, leave the hood.

1018
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:00,600
I'm wearing drawstring shorts right now. I actually am too. I'm going to get

1019
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,720
sucked into this mixer. Your dick is caught in a mixer. I'm getting caught in

1020
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:10,880
this one and like your balls have like or make you so high pitch drawstring gets

1021
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,920
stuck in the fader. I'm trying to turn the volume up

1022
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,920
I

1023
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:21,220
yeah well, that has got to be one of the worst things I've ever heard in my

1024
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,520
entire life. Is that your last one? That is my last one. Okay, good, because I

1025
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,140
don't think I can handle that. That's that has to be that one ruined

1026
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,940
everything. Yeah, that is I don't like this website anymore. No, I didn't like

1027
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:36,220
it. I thought it was funny until you put the worst one. We did all of this and

1028
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:40,460
then I couldn't find it funny and then I just kept looking at the really was

1029
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,620
you made the best Gore version of the website. This you know what this is.

1030
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:50,500
This is like this is like best Gore for like a like like a text based best.

1031
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:56,060
That's so awful. It's so bad. It's really. Yeah. So who sent this to us?

1032
01:03:56,060 --> 01:04:02,940
Vexa Vexa. Fuck you. Fuck you. This guy never wanted to read that story. We

1033
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,780
thought that this would be funny. It was funny. It was funny. You just put at

1034
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:13,520
at the end of a crazy one. Yeah, you kind of you and you made in it's not my

1035
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:17,240
fault. You put it in, you screenshot it, you highlight it, yeah, you highlighted

1036
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,440
the most gruesome part. This is not my but the one thing I'm not going to

1037
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,600
accept is

1038
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:27,480
responsibility for okay. What I put in the slide show,

1039
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,240
that's the one what I will accept responsibility for is booking an amazing

1040
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,560
show on the fourteenth of July at Littlefield World's Biggest Army

1041
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:44,280
tickets are still available and they're going to be available until the

1042
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,520
fourteenth when you can make it by the door or can sell out before

1043
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:54,080
something is going to happen at that show that you are not going to want to

1044
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,280
miss. I don't like you saying that after the thing you just read. I don't do

1045
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,880
something is going to happen and let's just say

1046
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:07,600
don't show up wearing sweat pants because you're going to suck. I'm going

1047
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:07,720
to

1048
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:10,040
Pat won't be able to

1049
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,920
print

1050
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,440
yeah, the print fuck dude. Oh my God.

1051
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,920
Come to Littlefield on the 14th. Bye bye and happy birthday Cameron.

1052
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,920
Happy birthday to you.

1053
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,920
*claps*

1054
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,920
*gunshot*

1055
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,920
*static*

1056
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
*beep*

1057
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,920
Let me just say

1058
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,920
I meant, I gotta

1059
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,920
I forgot to apologize for something

1060
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,920
What'd you do?

1061
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,920
I have to issue an apology to our producer

1062
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Um

1063
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,920
Juby if you want to get on screen

1064
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,920
to accept this apology

1065
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,920
or deny it

1066
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,920
I'm here.

1067
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,920
Okay.

1068
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:59,880
So, last night I was asking for reference photos for a D&D poster for pictures of our

1069
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:11,680
faces and Jubio, let's just say, I thought he was trolling me.

1070
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,440
Oh no.

1071
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,440
And in a...

1072
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,440
Hit the GoPro cam, Jubio.

1073
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,440
Yep.

1074
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,440
fit of rage.

1075
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,620
My girlfriend is kind enough

1076
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,360
to draw this poster for us.

1077
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,360
And because I was getting trolled

1078
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,080
by Jubio last night, I

1079
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,040
commissioned her with a snack

1080
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,240
and said, can you please draw this

1081
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,800
immediately and

1082
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,980
come to my defense?

1083
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:34,980
I'm being trolled.

1084
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,840
And she drew this.

1085
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,480
Whoa.

1086
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,920
Which is Boobio.

1087
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,020
And I just want to say that I'm

1088
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,920
sorry to Jubio.

1089
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,640
why I'm apologizing. Why are you removing points?

1090
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,560
He didn't even know you did that until right now.

1091
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,200
You didn't have... It's gonna stay between you and your girlfriend.

1092
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,720
This was in the group chat. This was in the group chat.

1093
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,040
Oh, I don't check that thing.

1094
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,380
You sent a photo. You sent a reference photo.

1095
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,720
Show my photo.

1096
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,280
Also, if we're getting into this, I need my photos to be shown

1097
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,820

Now read what you said.

1104
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,060
No, no, no, no explanation.

1105
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,860
Just read what you said in response to that show.

Okay, now what did Cameron send?

1109
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,760

1110
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,560
not to have my hair.

1111
