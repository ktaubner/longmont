1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
*laughter*

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
*music*

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Crap monster.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
*laughter*

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
*explosion*

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Holdin' on your rope got me ten feet off the ground.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
*music*

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I'm hearin' what you say but I just can't make a sound.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
*music*

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,680
You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,000
But wait, tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,520
And say that it's too late to apologize

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,000
It's too late

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's too late

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:10,780
I apologize. It's too late. Too late. Oh. Oh. It's you. I don't know how this song goes.

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:20,660
Just eight, eight. I'll take a shot for you. Oh, I need you like a heart needs a beat,

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:31,240
But it's nothing new, yeah, yeah, I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:41,660
And you say, sorry like the angel, heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid, it's too

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:48,660
It's too late to apologize.

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,460
I said it's too late to apologize.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,460
It's too late.

24
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:10,420
It's my favorite part of the song.

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,700
think this is a part of the timberland produce song

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,900
it's too late

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,900
it's too late to apologize

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,980
it's too late

29
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,960
there we go, we're harmonizing

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,020
it's too late to apologize

31
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,620
it's too late

32
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,660
i said it's too late to apologize

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,380
yeah

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
No, you gotta, you gotta straight.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,140
It's too late to apologize.

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,540
Yeah!

37
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,780
Yeah!

38
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,140
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground.

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,180
The ground!

40
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,180
The ground.

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,860
The ground!

42
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,620
That was good.

43
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,300
That was good.

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
That was really good. What's the next one?

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,940
What next one? We're not gonna do another one, are we?

46
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,300
Wait, no, click that one. Total Eclipse of the Heart.

47
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,900
Whoa.

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
You know this one?

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
Do you know this one?

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,220
I don't know this one.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,380
Dude, this one always hits you hard.

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,820
Just let the lyrics wash over you on this one, okay?

53
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,700
So it starts off with an instrumental.

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
I can feel it already.

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,820
Oh, I remember this one.

56
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
I remember this one.

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Wait, no, there's a bit weird.

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,820

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,380
That's really good Cameron.

96
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Alright.

97
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Should I pause this so we can move?

98
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,380
Yeah, I think we should probably...

99
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,380
Smell my hat real quick.

100
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,380
This just smells like a hat to me.

101
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
Yeah?

102
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,380
Yeah, I can't detect any difference in smell.

103
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
I don't know, I wore it skating yesterday.

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
Nothing in here smells like anything.

105
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,380
Or tastes like anything either.

106
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
And I've been coughing too.

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
Mm-hmm

108
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,940
We got kicked out of the karaoke bar we were in

109
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,900
Karaoke bar was my living room speaking of smelling. You know what I realized Caleb got really sick after he smelled your butt

110
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:37,940
Shit that's not even false that literally he smelled your button. He's been trapped at home for

111
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,660
Days now yeah

112
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,820
Huh

113
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,740
Yeah, interesting. He said it smelled so good. He did say it smelled really good. So I

114
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,540
Don't know

115
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,020
There's really no I wish we could you want to do you want a chair? I'm standing staying limber. Yeah

116
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,420
Yeah, cuz we had my energy level. We have to record in my room again

117
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:08,100
And I'm really close to this light. Yeah, and it's really a dire situation in here right now. I haven't done

118
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,780
No, it is is it's cuz it's the winter time now, and I'm not just wearing t-shirts

119
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,620
Yeah, well, you know I laundry pile looks bigger cuz it's all sweatshirts. Oh, it's also

120
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,140
I mean, maybe this isn't for you, but it's also right

121
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm about to go home to my family and bring all my dirty laundry

122
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,640
Oh me too, so I'm putting your head again putting off putting off washing

123
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,520
Yeah, my clothes for a long time, and I got a I got a big pile mines in a hamper though

124
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,120
Mm-hmm my old not existing. No the hamper is over there. Oh, man. Yeah

125
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,020
I've overfilled the hamper.

126
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,020
And the thing is, I used to have two hampers,

127
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,520
specifically for that reason.

128
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,820
And then I had no, my shoe rack broke.

129
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,380
So now I just threw all my shoes in the other hamper.

130
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,180
- So you have a shoe bag.

131
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,420
- Yeah.

132
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,860
Well, I should get a laundry bag.

133
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,340
That's a good move.

134
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,020
- Yeah, a laundry bag is a great lazy guy hamper.

135
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,540
- Yeah.

136
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,740
I also don't have a trash barrel in my room.

137
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,500
I've just been doing a carpenter bag on the floor.

138
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,780
- Oh, man, yeah.

139
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,020
(laughing)

140
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,180
- It all sounds way grosser than it is.

141
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,140
- Dude, I have to say, having multiple trash cans,

142
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,400
like trash cans in different rooms is great,

143
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,480
'cause for example, the trash can in my computer room,

144
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,780
I would never use it, so I never have to empty it.

145
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,240
So I can throw something away in there

146
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,220
and just forget about it.

147
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,380
It doesn't exist anymore.

148
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Exactly.

149
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,220
Put it in the kitchen trash, it's gonna smell, I have to empty it.

150
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Disgusting.

151
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,540
Office trash might as well be a black hole.

152
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,540
Yeah.

153
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,540
Doesn't exist.

154
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,220
I mean, yeah, there's just clothes everywhere in my room.

155
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Yeah.

156
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,380
Man, I really wish I could finish this karaoke song.

157
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
I feel like I...

158
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,260
Well, that's the other thing is now we're next to Neil's wall and he's probably on some

159
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,300
fucking call already.

160
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,900
He's probably been on a call the whole time.

161
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,060
He's probably really mad.

162
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,980
Oh, he's probably pissed.

163
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,300
probably can hear us saying that he's really mad too.

164
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,540
Oh no, he can't hear anything through these walls.

165
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,820
Oh, then we can do karaoke.

166
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
Maybe.

167
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,700
No, we're done with that.

168
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,260
Should we test it out by yelling to him?

169
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,220
Should we test it out by knocking on the wall?

170
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
I might test it out by running through the wall like a Looney Tunes character and see

171
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
if he notices.

172
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,440
Yeah, because I know he'll definitely love if I sit in my room and just keep saying his

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,000
name over and over.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,540
He doesn't get annoyed when I do that.

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,380
No, that'll be good.

176
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Yeah.

177
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,180
Let's see

178
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,640
It's almost Christmas. Yeah, I can't wait. Oh boy. Oh, man

179
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,540
I love Christmas

180
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,900
Now

181
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,220
Are you just almost New Year's I

182
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,540
Think you're just looking at stuff in my room to talk about we could do that. Yeah

183
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, did you see I see this framed picture?

184
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,140
Yeah, that's the framed photo of the Home Planet video with the Rock and Roll guy.

185
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,140
I like your Duran Duran poster.

186
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,140
No, it's an Irish flag with my family crest on it that I found in my parents basement.

187
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
I like your Duran Duran poster.

188
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,140
Nope.

189
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
Yeah.

190
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,140
I'm tired of that joke. I've been tired of that joke my whole damn life.

191
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,140
It's not how my last name is pronounced, bitch.

192
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
Yeah, I like your Dora poster.

193
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,140
It's not a Dora poster. It's a Creepshow poster.

194
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,140
It's a Creepshow poster and it's in Japanese.

195
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,540
Dora n nope, what's the n mean Cameron? What are you calling her?

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,820
Naranja

197
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, does that mean orange and I think I think I think that means orange in Spanish. Yeah, I hope so

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,220

stuff and sit down on the bed. Okay. But it's all good. Don't worry about a thing.

223
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,820
My room seriously feels like a college dorm. That's okay. You're still in college.

224
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:49,980
I think well technically I was. That's true. Yeah. I have to I will.

225
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,900
- Well, I think next year--

226
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,160
- You should go to the new school.

227
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,500
- Yeah.

228
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,100
Well, next year, yeah, yeah,

229
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,580
this is like the final month that I can decide

230
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,340
whether or not I'm going back to Emerson.

231
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,060
'Cause I've been on a leave of absence.

232
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,300
- Yeah, for that long?

233
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,420
They let you go on it for that long?

234
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,340
- You can go on a leave of absence for two years,

235
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,180
and I was just like, well,

236
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm just gonna let that ride out.

237
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,820
- Yeah, no reason not to.

238
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

239
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,260
- So technically, I'm still an enrolled Emerson student.

240
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,500
(laughing)

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
- Yeah. - Well, no.

242
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,220
Well, that's how you got those glasses as you walked into the glass store and you

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:31,740
Detected up. He's an enrolled student of Emerson. Mm-hmm. These guys are good on me. We're getting around ease. They are good on you

244
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,300
They look good this fucking mic stands

245
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,660
Anyone wants to buy me anything off my Amazon wish list?

246
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:45,780
We could make an Amazon wish list dude, that'd be awesome for the holidays. Yeah, this room is disgusting

247
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,820
I got it. We don't have to talk about the room. Yeah, it's okay. No, I know I just unless you really want no

248
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,060
You know what? You know what? The thing is is I fucking popped an addy and fucking cleaned my room

249
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,660
I know it's back to this. It's back to this and literally a week. I don't believe you at all

250
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,860
You know what it is. I don't see anything that's moved. I oh you should have seen it dude. What's that? What's what?

251
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,900
That's a waterproof camera

252
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,460
No, what's under what's it on? What's that black box? Is that it? Oh, that's a that's a drum machine

253
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:24,620
Drum machine, I don't know you got a drum machine. Yeah, I have a Roland DDR 30. Damn. That's cool

254
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't know how to use it

255
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,540
You should give it to me. Do you want it? No, okay

256
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,220
I was I was gonna I have no room for it, but I would go crazy on it. Well, it's like it's the

257
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,780
It's like the thing that you plug the

258
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,440
The drum pads into it's like a sequencer. Yeah. Well, no, it's like see all these like

259
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,760
look, there's the MIDI inputs here and then they have all the

260
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,520
like

261
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,400
what are these uh

262
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,960
yeah, okay, so our things right there and

263
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,840
you have to

264
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,520
You plug those into the drum pads for like an old Roland drum machine. Yeah

265
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,700
Yeah, I don't own a drum machine from the 80s.

266
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,900
Yeah, well you own part of one.

267
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:21,100
I do. I own probably the most important, probably the second most important part of the drum machine.

268
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,700
It's important to have.

269
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah.

270
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,400
Yeah, I was thinking like, I was like, oh when I move here, I'm gonna like

271
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,000
kind of like clean it out, clean all the dust off of it and then sell it.

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,880
and uh dude it's impossible to sell music equipment it's so it sucks it's i have so much music stuff

273
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,600
i'm like i'll sell this but i know i tried to sell my guitar it's so fucking it's fucking

274
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,360
annoying as shit dude i tried to go to it all takes up so much room too i tried to go to a

275
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:00,120
pawn shop with my guitar really yeah what'd they say the guy was like well first it's missing like

276
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,080
like the the SG that I own is like missing like the truss rod cover. I don't know

277
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,240
what that means. It's like the thing that covers that thing up. Like the

278
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,880
like you adjust it to like fix the action and shit. Okay. It's missing that

279
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,800
because I bought that secondhand. That was after our first live show. Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:27,000
I thought I'm a rock star now. Yeah. I really did dude. Because I've had this guitar here since like

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,600
high school and it's like so beat up and shady like the one of the pickups

282
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,100
doesn't work and I'm like too lazy to fix it and I was like oh sick like I'm

283
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,760
gonna like you know start like it was at a time where I was like playing a guitar

284
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,040
a lot yeah and then I'd like stopped mm-hmm and then now I just have two

285
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,840
guitars and I just don't want the other one yeah but after the live show when we

286
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,840
We got we got pinned out. I spent most of my paycheck on that.

287
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,840
What's even like that much money?

288
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,840
I spent like 300 of the 500 we made on a guitar.

289
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,840
I was like yeah dude this is it I'm gonna start.

290
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,840
I'm gonna be live showing it up.

291
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I'm gonna learn how to make music now.

292
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Yeah.

293
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
And then you know.

294
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Sucks.

295
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,840
Life happens.

296
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Life gets in the way.

297
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Life gets in the way.

298
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You had your first baby.

299
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't know why I thought I was going to like, oh yeah, like this year I'm going to figure

300
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
out how to write a song.

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,760
It's really important to have like an insanely stupid creative goal that you work towards

302
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,280
for a year and then like completely forget about by the end of the year.

303
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
That's like super, super important.

304
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,380
I can't tell you how many video games I was going to make every year of my life from middle

305
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,780
school to freshman year of college.

306
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,020
The only constant in my life has been skating in that way.

307
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,100
In that, like, oh, you need a fucking thing like that.

308
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,500
But like, I don't know why the fuck I was like, I'm going to rock.

309
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,980
It would be really funny.

310
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,940
I was listening to A Loudest Sabbath at the time, too, so I bought the black SG with the

311
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
fucking...

312
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,940
We should start a...

313
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
It's called the...

314
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,620
It's a 2010 Epiphone Goth SG and it has like a cross on the 12th fret.

315
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,300
We should start a Doom Metal Band.

316
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Yeah.

317
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,660
Maybe I keep the guitar.

318
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,940
And we start a Doom Metal Band and we dress up in costumes.

319
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Yeah.

320
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,940
That's what I was gonna say.

321
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,940
It would be funny like, to not buy a guitar after the live show and be like, "Man, I'm

322
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,540
gonna be a rock star" and buy like a crazy outfit.

323
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Yeah.

324
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Like a...

325
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Buy like a Sephiroth cosplay.

326
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,700
That was the Boston Live show too.

327
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,940
So I had to carry that, I got a gig bag for it.

328
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
It came with it free.

329
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,860
Oh no, no, no, I got a free t-shirt from Mr. Music in Alston.

330
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:05,020
And I carried that with me on the train from Alston.

331
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:12,300
Or no, you know what I did? I fucking, I walked to, I walked from Alston to Harvard Square

332
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:17,740
and then took the red line to Davis Square and then waited for my mom to pick me up to

333
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,820
go to New Hampshire. And I just, I just carried a fucking guitar around with me all day. Like

334
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,300
I, like, I don't know, like I fucking, maybe I should get back on Adderall cause I, my

335
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,820
My impulse control is so bad.

336
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,780
Like literally, like my fucking...

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,980
Yeah, I'm lucky that for me, my impulse control is like my fucked up like...

338
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,060
Like look at how much shit I've bought just because...

339
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,940
My impulse buy stuff, yeah, it's always like, it's always movies, which are like, there's

340
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,540
a pretty, there's a...

341
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,300
I feel like I have it on lock enough that I won't buy like an $100 movie usually, but

342
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,500
I've come close.

343
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,760
I've impulse bought $100 box sets for no reason that I don't need.

344
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,140
My impulse purchases are like, look at how many skateboards I own.

345
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,140
Yeah.

346
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Well, one of those I found.

347
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,700
One of those a bodega guy gave me.

348
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Yeah.

349
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
But like, I can't stop.

350
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,420
I'll just like, I'll see like somebody, I'll see like something get retweeted onto my timeline

351
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,660
that's like the, like the, they just did a reprint of this, like this Japanese movie

Yeah.

382
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,980
I could justify that by like, well, no, this one's a 12 string.

383
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
Yeah.

384
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,900

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Oh my God, dude.

386
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900

I could, it would be so funny.

388
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,420
You come over the end of the tour and you have like, they're all like the exact same

389
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,980
model of guitar, but they like, each of them has like, you know, like, like state quarters.

390
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Yeah.

391
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,720
like different pictures of stuff from like the city. Well, this one this one

397
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,580
ever have one of those? Probably not, but did you ever have one of those? Like it was

398
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:05,160
like a, it was like a cardboard, like board and it stood up and it had a map of the U.S.

399
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,300
on it and it had the coins in every state. I had one of those. I wasn't a coin collector

400
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:17,820
kid. I was not either. I only cared about that. But I remember, I remember how, how like,

401
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,140
Because I would you know I was I don't remember how far I got. I was probably I

402
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,900
didn't I definitely didn't finish it, but I got like pretty close, but I don't

403
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,180
even remember what I bought. It was probably just like candy or something

404
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:34,180
or one day I was like I'm going to take all the quarters and go to the corner

405
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:41,100
store. And I remember my parents being like being like what. Okay, big sorry big

406
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,580
news. Okay, big new. I'm sorry to interrupt your story. Yeah, it's not an

407
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:53,140
interesting story. I just got a free city bike unlock. Yo. And this is great news

408
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,820
considering what happened. Yeah. Talk. I'll talk my shit. Okay, so I got a free

409
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,360
city bike unlock. This is unrelated to what happened. I just got one because

410
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,700
I've been right. I decided you probably get a free one. Maybe another one. I

411
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,300
already got a free one. So I'm just gonna ride this one out. Unlock one and

412
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,980
just leave it unlocked for yeah I'm just gonna leave that shit unlocked yeah

413
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,280
leave it in front of like a petco or something mm-hmm let somebody leave with

414
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,640
their dog put the dog in the basket and just bring it in my house mm-hmm

415
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,660
around the living room just doing like wheelies and shit on a city like an e-bike

416
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,220
yeah well speaking of e-bikes so I've decided I never rode a city bike before

417
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,340
and then one day like there's this like skate park under the the Cusco bridge I

418
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,820
know how to pronounce it. It's Polish. Yeah, under the KP Bridge skate park. I wanted to

419
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,140
go there, but I didn't want to take the bus, so I just took a city bike there. I was riding

420
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:59,940
it there. I was like, "Holy shit, this is the best thing ever." I've lived here for, what,

421
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,540
since March 2021, right? I don't know. Why are you asking me? Yeah, I've lived here since

422
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,380
like March and decided to get into city bikes in the winter. Yeah. Like a fucking idiot.

423
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,540
Yeah, that's very stupid. Yeah, like I've been riding city bikes more than I ever did. Like

424
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,260
yeah, riding a bike in the city more than I ever did in the summer. Bikes should be

425
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,460
destroyed in December. Yeah, you should not. They should put all the city bikes in a pile.

426
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,540
I quit my job rather than having to ride a bike in December. But I've been doing that.

427
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,540
Yeah.

428
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Because it's so nice and it's so convenient. But then I took an e-bike. Oh man, my mom's

429
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:50,740
gonna listen to this. But I took an e-bike from my house to go to Cooper Park. And I

430
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,300
was like riding around. I was just like, "Oh damn, it's like actually pretty easy to get

431
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:02,540
around cars." So I'm on an e-bike and this guy, I'm like, you know, about to get to the

432
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:07,640
skate park and then this guy doesn't use a turn signal and I start going and then

433
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,480
like he just decks me out with his like passenger side mirror yeah like right

434
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,620
next to the the doctor evil tattoo that I have on my on my left arm mm-hmm

435
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,580
giant bruise now cuz I just decked out his fucking mirror yeah I just destroyed

436
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,540
it dude yeah like it like you know like well what actually happened is he was

437
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,820
turning and you saw your you saw yourself in the mirror and you tried to

438
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:37,820
attack it like a parrot. I was going, "Hi! Hi! Hello! Hi little guy! Hi! Whoa! Look at

439
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,820
you! Look at your bike! There's a little guy! There's a little me in your car! There's a

440
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,820
little me in your car!" You started going way faster. Well, I don't think I would have

441
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,820
gotten hit if it wasn't an e-bike. Yeah? What is an e-bike? It just has like an electronic

442
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,820
motor. It has a motor? Yeah. So like as soon as I started pedaling, I immediately got a

443
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,820
bit more speed than I was used to. And then I didn't have the time to react.

444
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,100
And I got hit in the arm, knocked the bike over onto the sidewalk,

445
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:10,460
my board fucking flew out into the street. And the guy looks at me, he's

446
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,700
holding up traffic, and fucking everyone in New York, like you know, it's New York.

447
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,820
It's New York, baby. It's New York. Everyone's just holding down the horn at him.

448
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Everyone's holding the horn at him. And I'm like trying to just get the bike back up

449
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,860
and get my board onto the bike and everyone's holding down the horn. The guy just like waits

450
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,380
till I look at him and just goes, "I'm sorry, man." And I just went, "Yeah, me too." And

451
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,700
then we just both went our separate ways. I just went to the skate park.

452
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,580
That's literally, that's how you should, what you should say to somebody. If you didn't

453
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,580
kill them, that's what you should say to somebody that you hit with your car or that you almost

454
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,900
hit with your car.

455
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,940
Every accident should just be, "I'm sorry, me too." No exchange of insurance.

456
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,220
that's the perfect exchange. I almost got hit by a car on my bike when I was in like probably middle

457
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:03,140
school outside a guy pulled into a CVS parking lot really fast as I was like going across the

458
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,340
entrance and I like I like braked really fast and I skidded and he also braked and if he had kept

459
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,300
going he would have hit me. It was probably my fault. Yeah but I don't know if this was my fault.

460
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,780
Yeah that's why I think that yours sounds like half and half. Yeah I think we're both at fault

461
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,660
but it actually didn't happen on a city bike it happened on my own bike.

462
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,020
But I went into the CVS.

463
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,580
I can get this unlocked for free and then never report me.

464
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,420
I went into the CVS and then he came into the CVS after me and he came up to me and

465
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,900
said you should be more careful.

466
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
It's like fuck you.

467
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,900
Yeah.

468
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
I know it's my fault.

469
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,900
Leave me alone.

470
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Right.

471
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
I'm 13.

472
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Dude that shit's bullshit.

473
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Stay away from me.

474
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,980
Tell me you're sorry.

475
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,420
You almost killed me.

476
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,780
Passenger always has the right of way.

477
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
That's right.

478
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,100
The passenger has the right of way.

479
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,460
The passenger of the bike.

480
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Yeah.

481
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,580
uh... i mean the civilian

482
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,420
yeah i was a billion and he was a soldier

483
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,380
i'm even thinking for his third service

484
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,960
the other night we're going to fuckin

00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,500
gonna mellows and then

486
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,780
that car just almost hit me when we had a lot of melons

487
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,620
you make fun of me for that

488
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,880

499
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,700
I don't get why you and Caleb get so mad at me for my abbreviations.

500
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,180
A lot of other people use these abbreviations.

501
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
Nobody does.

502
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,180
Yes.

503
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,180
Nobody does.

504
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,220
You guys are actively trying to ruin my life by making me self-conscious all the time.

505
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
Maybe.

506
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah, I stopped by the bodego.

507
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,220
I call it the boat.

508
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,220
The boat.

509
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,220
The bodo.

510
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,860
I gotta go pick up some cigs from the boat. Yeah, that one could catch on some

511
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,940

513
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,860
yeah I've look at all man well I changed my life did you know there's that

514
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,020
there's been a friendle movie adaptation in the works for like years

515
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,020
They should get Tom Holland to play Friendel.

516
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,020
How long is it? Let's see here.

517
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Friendel, I remember I was like, "Did they ever make a movie out of Friendel?"

518
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:49,020
Because that would be a perfect, like, that seems like the perfect movie to make a movie, right?

519
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
Yeah.

520
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Let's see here. Friendel, film adaptation.

521
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:02,020
In 2015, they announced it. And Susan Sarandon was going to play Mrs. Laurie Granger.

522
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
She was going to play the Friendel.

523
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,220
and he's a serenity circus was going to play the friend

524
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,020
in the role of the

525
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,320
the mocap suit and he's just standing like straight up with

526
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,220
his arms at his sides.

527
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,020
There's recording him for like an hour.

528
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:25,420
He's still do you know, you know what actually it wouldn't be

529
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,120
for a friend.

530
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,220
Oh, it wouldn't be Andy circus.

531
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,120
He'll be Doug Jones.

532
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,520
Hmm.

533
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,120
He will be a much better friend older than a circus and he

534
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,220
circus could play an eraser and

535
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
Dude, Adventures of a Racer in Pencil.

536
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Mm-hmm.

537
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
This is a great movie.

538
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
With Doug Jones and Andy Serkis.

539
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,160
I can't wait to see, like, have you ever watched the Smeagol, like, test footage?

540
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah.

541
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,080
Like, Smeagol audition where Andy Serkis is, like, doing that shit?

542
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Yeah.

543
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
And he's like...

544
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Okay.

545
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
That shit's crazy.

546
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Like, seeing him outside of the Smeagol costume.

547
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Yeah.

548
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
The costume.

549
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
The costume.

550
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,840
Seeing him outside of that shit, that's crazy.

551
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Yeah.

552
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
Maybe it's, okay, it's like, Doug, it's Andy Serkis, 'cause he, Andy Serkis does monkeys

553
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
really good.

554
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Yeah.

555
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,480
monkey Doug Jones as a giant pencil and then maybe we could get Seth Rogan to

556
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,360
play an eraser Seth Rogan as all to okay starring a pencil and a monkey yeah

557
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:23,160
alright and Benedict Cumberbatch okay as a smog smoke well maybe he could play

558
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,800
let's see maybe he do CGI of Benedict Cumberbatch I think he only did smoke I

559
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,240
Rango I think they rang yeah, okay, did he did all the mocap for Rango?

560
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,920
Did he really and the cover badge those just used his fucking face? Yeah, that's what I say is like that. It's so funny

561
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
It's Magus the only

562
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,800
CGI he did it's so fucking funny. They're just like like we're really fucked up really alien motherfucker

563
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,680
For this role need a human argonian. Yeah, literally

564
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah

565
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,300
It's like they have a fucking guy who does mocap for every monster in Lord of the Rings like Andy circuit like he's right there

566
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:06,300
And they're like no we need the ugliest guy on earth. We need a dragon. We need the fucking we need literally we need a repulsive

567
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,980
disgusting sexually overbearing reptile

568
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:20,540
Yeah, I bet Benedict Cumberbatch has a thumb yeah, sorry sorry Andy circus, but you're too sexually warm

569
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,140
Yeah, we need we need a sexual winter

570
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,420
oppressive

571
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,360
Basically, we need a sexual nemesis. We need a sexual nemesis. We need icicles to be forming on on

572
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:38,780
Everybody's private areas when they when they look at this fucking dragon. Yeah, I know because people look at smiegel

573
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,780
And they're like damn. I want to fuck him smiegel

574
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:48,740
Probably has a big dick mm-hmm. Well. I mean you see that loincloth flapping back and that's right. He runs. Yep. Mm-hmm

575
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,780
Yeah, the smiegel have no dick

576
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,420
smiegel I

577
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,220
Don't know. I wonder if hobbits have big dicks or not

578
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,900
No, they have little ones. Well Smeagol's probably got Smeagol

579
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,180
Before he was corrupted was a proto hobbit. I think Smeagol fucked the ring

580
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,780
did yo, I did find a fan fiction one time of

581
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:17,100
Smeagol and Dobby and Yoda all having a three when I was looking for that fart episode

582
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,100
And I didn't read it cuz it wasn't fart themed but it's pretty good. We could read it right now

583
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,820
Yeah, we got what we got like 20 more minutes. Also, we do have an oh I do I do have a list

584
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,740
- Yeah, I think we've just--

585
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,660
- We could do that fan fiction instead.

586
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:34,020
- Caleb's not here to try and alpha us.

587
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,620
- That's right, we can just chill and talk

588
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,980
without being afraid.

589
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,340
- Being afraid of his oppressive force.

590
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,980
- He's so evil.

591
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,220
- Caleb's truly the most oppressive force in the world.

592
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,800
- He literally slaves us.

593
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,980
I think it's still in this document.

594
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,620
- Well, what's this list?

595
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,140
What do we got here for this list?

596
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,540
- Well, I found the fan fiction.

597
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,700
Alright, I guess we can read it.

598
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,460
It's called Rings-

599
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,860
It's cool that you have to get a DDoS check before you enter fanfiction.net.

600
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,180
It's called Rings, Socks, and Minds.

601
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,400
Ooh.

602
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,480
Um.

603
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,240
Oh.

604
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,260
Yeah, who's who?

605
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,540
Yeah, ring, okay.

606
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,660
Smeagol crept from the cave and smelled the air.

607
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,860
Yes, my precious.

608
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,820
Tonight there were no nasty orcs and goblins about.

609
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,860
No elves with bright eyes or men with sharp swords.

610
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,580
Not tonight.

611
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,340
Just him and the fishes of the stream.

612
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
Nice fishes swimming blindly towards him.

613
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,140
Tasty fishes.

614
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,900
he would catch them swiftly and silently.

615
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,440
His mind conjured images,

616
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,340
his fingers curling around the scales,

617
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,680
the helpless creatures flopping on the bank as they died.

618
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,760
It brought a lump to his throat and a thrill to his loins.

619
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,580
Gollum, Gollum.

620
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,300
Smeagol crawled on his stomach to the water

621
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,200
with no cursed white face and only the stars above.

622
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,520
The dark stream ran near invisible through the meadow,

623
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,100
but not for Smeagol, not for sharp-eyed Smeagol.

624
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,080
He reached his hand out,

625
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,260
ready to dip it into the cold, cold stream.

626
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,980
He jerked back as he heard a sudden click.

627
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,060
What, can you do the voice?

628
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,060
What was that my precious?

629
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
"Is that my precious?"

630
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,740
Someone there, some hunter more silent than he,

631
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,100
lurking, ready to pounce, he sniffed the air desperately.

632
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,900
What does Dobby sound like?

633
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,860
- Like a bitch.

634
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,300
- Dobby is lost!

635
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,060
Dobby is lost!

636
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,020
Smeagol readied himself to flee, then stop.

637
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,700
His night vision spotted movement not 20 yards away.

638
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,460
- Oh, I forgot that about Smeagol.

639
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,420
He's got night vision.

640
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,260
- Yup.

641
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,940
The new arrival, whatever it was, was small

642
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,420
and waved what looked to be a sock.

643
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,260
Its head was completely bald with wide,

644
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,780
Caleb, with wide pointed ears and massive eyes.

645
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,860
Its scrawny body was wrapped in a pillowcase.

646
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,340
strange little creature all told, Smeagol paused.

647
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,660
- That's what he wears?

648
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,740
- Yeah, he wears a pillowcase, right?

649
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,700
- Damn, no, I'm just thinking about Dobby now.

650
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,060
Thinking about what Dobby looks like.

651
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:39,900
- In all his years.

652
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,700
- And it makes sense that he wears a pillowcase

653
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,580
now that like--

654
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,700
- It does, yeah.

655
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,420
- 'Cause like a whole time I'm thinking like,

656
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,360
man, where'd he get that?

657
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,740
Why is it so, it's like so sweaty too.

658
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,620
- It's true.

659
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,100
I have some Smeagol lines for you to read here.

660
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,260
Starts here.

661
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,420
- What does it say?

662
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,420
- Is it here?

663
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
"Is it tasty?"

664
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
Come on, keep going.

665
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,420
I don't want to do that voice anymore. It hurts.

666
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,420
Good on Andy Serkis, because that voice sucks to do.

667
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
It's fun.

668
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,420
"Is it tasty, my precious? Is it crunchable?"

669
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
He licked his lips.

670
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,420
"Crunchable? But it might have a sword, my precious.

671
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Long, thin, nasty sword.

672
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Careful, careful, my precious.

673
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,420
Let us see, oh, let us see."

674
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
I can't do the voice very well.

675
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,660
And then basically they fuck yeah, yeah, this is not that good too long

676
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,660
I mean, yeah, this is like I can skip ahead here look get to the Yoda

677
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,180
I want to see what Yoda has to say this is a this is a good a good entrance for Yoda, okay?

678
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,140
Precious he screamed those skylight it burns us nasty Harry Potter

679
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,180
We hates it forever

680
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,100
But just as he was about to reach the cool darkness of the cave a boulder tumbled down across the entrance blocking off escape a soft

681
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,920
New light spread across the night smeagol looked over his shoulder fearful of what would come

682
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:01,520
stop we say yep dude if that was in a movie like the audience would stand up

683
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:09,640
and cheer yeah do they'd fuck in they go nuts that's like that's like Captain

684
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,000
America live that bigger reaction than Captain America lifting up Thor's hammer

685
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,400
okay we need to have there's a there's a conversation here that we need to do

686
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,160
okay it's me going Yoda are you better at smear or Yoda I can't do either I'll

687
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,360
I'll do, I'll try Smeagol.

688
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,120
- Okay. - I can just do both

689
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,960
and then you read the stage directions.

690
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,420
- Okay, here, it starts here.

691
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,640
(Smeagol grunting)

692
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,720
Said Yoda.

693
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,160
- So stuck we are, except for you.

694
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,240
- He gestured at Smeagol.

695
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,880
- Come you here, we command.

696
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,840
- Smeagol found himself helpless to resist.

697
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,160
He crawled slowly over to Yoda, head lowered.

698
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,520
He muttered as he went.

699
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,720
- Is that Smeagol?

700
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
- This is Yoda.

701
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,700
- Oh.

702
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,280
- If crashed and lost we are,

703
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,860
a cheering up we shall need.

704
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,360
"I'm not showing up, my precious!"

705
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Yoda nodded.

706
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
"This sucks. This sucks. I hate you."

707
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
"This one's important."

708
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
"Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm!"

709
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,360
"Fancy you, we do. Horny we are!"

710
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
Smiegel blinked.

711
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,360
"Horny, my precious!"

712
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
"What is horny?"

713
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
He's going to this next one.

714
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
(laughter)

715
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
(laughter)

716
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
(laughter)

717
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
(laughter)

718
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,060
Wanting to put our bits in you. We are

719
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:29,260
you can skip to this line right here.

720
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,960
This last yoda line

721
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,860
wanting to put our bits in you.

722
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Yoda's bits

723
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:45,560
said Yoda friends of Harry Potter. We are lots of snary on lonely nights. We

724
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,560
have read a threesome. We need

725
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:55,480
*laughter*

726
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,080
Smeagol tore off his loincloth and stood naked beneath the stars.

727
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,960
His long-forgotten phallus rose majestically.

728
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,760
He rubbed it, recalling the contours.

729
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,600
The texture, the wiry hairs.

730
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,200
It was a thing of beauty.

731
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,440
He saw Dobby had dropped his sock in pillowcase.

732
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,120
Yoda had discarded his robe.

733
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,960
Both were naked and erect as he.

734
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,140
Yeah.

735
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,960
"Dobby aims to please every friend of Harry Potter."

736
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Read this Yoda line right here.

737
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,960
"Chaffed you with our meaty lightsaber, we shall!"

738
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
*laughter*

739
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
He padded it.

740
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
"Dobby has much experience! Dobby is always of service!"

741
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
He knelt and took Smeagol's phallus in his mouth.

742
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
The warmth and wetness left Smeagol gagging.

743
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
"Gollum, Gollum."

744
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Yoda moved around behind Dobby and thrust himself into the creature's rear end.

745
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,120
friend. He did not even flinch his lips moved up and down the length of

746
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,260
smiegel his tongue so strong and flexible.

747
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:58,460
Such a tender arse of you yeah, why do they why would they put is the

748
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,160
author British or are they given Yoda the British accent here? I don't know

749
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,860
why do you say cuz yeah, do you think Yoda would say arse

750
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:13,560
hummed Yoda at last he slapped Dobby on the behind and backed away. Yeah,

751
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,320
is a British author. Yeah. He smacked him on the behind. Yeah. He smacked Yoda.

752
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,560
Yoda smacked him on the behind. That's the most disgusting part of this story.

753
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,440
Hmm? What's the most disgusting part? That the author's British. Oh yeah. Well yeah,

754
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,640
it's gross because it's Ricky Gervais. Yeah. Oh then they just fuck each other.

755
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,600
Yeah. It goes pretty long. Oh they talk about fanfiction. Then they do three-way

756
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:45,640
fellatio. Whoa. And then here's how it ends. So Smeagol starts sucking Yoda's

757
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,160
dick. Smeagol tried. He got to work keeping his teeth away from Yoda's shaft

758
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,560
but as Dobby brought him to ever-increasing peaks of ecstasy he lost

759
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,320
control. Carried away by the surging power of his own orgasm, Smeagol sunk his

760
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,240
teeth into the meaty member in his mouth. For a moment he tasted blood. His old

761
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,920
hunting instinct suddenly asserted themselves and he bit down again hard.

762
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,640
"Oh, bitterness you have!" Yoda cried. He pulled his bleeding phallus from Smeagol's jaws and backed away.

763
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,000
"Ruined we are!"

764
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,200
Oh my god.

765
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:14,700
Yeah.

766
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,200
Um...

767
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Yoda got his bit dicked by Smeagol.

768
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,400
And then Yoda hits Smeagol with his staff and uh, they all run away from each other.

769
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
It's kind of a sad ending.

770
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,080
Yeah. I would think, I would have expected Yoda to force choke him or something.

771
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,580
Yeah.

772
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:42,680
This list is too long. Yeah. To do. Let's see we got what 28, 18. 18 more minutes. 18 more minutes.

773
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to just sit in silence for 18 minutes? We could.

774
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,600
We could do karaoke again. We could do karaoke again. I wish we could have finished out the

775
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,440
karaoke. I think we could have done a lot more songs. Yeah. We could have. Look up,

776
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,440
Go on top tens, look up Yoda.

777
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,440
I was looking up Friendl, but nothing came up.

778
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
Best Yoda quotes. We'll do this.

779
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
"Do or do not, there is no try."

780
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
That's a classic. That's number one.

781
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,440
Damn, he really did that shit.

782
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Number two, "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is."

783
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Now hold up.

784
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Here's the comment. "I like this one. It adds humor and shows that Yoda appreciates children."

785
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
From pedophile420.

786
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,440
From Rihanna410.

787
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,760
one oh oh you know well she's just have she's having a kid now yeah so she's

788
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,520
like the best parent in the world Yoda taught all those younglings mm-hmm and

789
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:42,800
you know if I'm gonna if I'm gonna look up this one's really getting me number

790
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,920
three size matters not look at me judge me by my size do you and the car said

791
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,400
that in the last story you should have that would have been a little out like a

792
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,480
big throbber yeah I got here's the comments getting me here this could work

793
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,720
from Mario after he says this uses a super mushroom laugh out loud.

794
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,960
Damn, you got me laughing too, bud. Yeah, that's a good one.

795
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,520
Damn. Oh, Yoda and Mario. Looking, found someone you have. Now, when

796
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,120
the fuck did he say that? Probably when someone he was found.

797
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,760
There's like not even that many Yoda quotes. I think Yoda would be a better-

798
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,960
I think they've run out. Like, there's the big Yoda quote. Yeah. The biggest Yoda quote,

799
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,280
or do not there is no try truly the wonder the truly wonderful the mind of a

800
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:34,320
child is that's like I don't yeah yeah that's a deep cut yeah going into the

801
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,420
deep cuts by number two is a bad sign I know yeah cuz then yeah this is like a

802
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,080
true Yoda fan I think that Yoda would be a better brother to Mario than Luigi is

803
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:48,960
oh yeah and they're both green well Mario's red no I'm saying Luigi's green

804
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,480
I know I don't think there would be that hard of a transition yeah I think that

805
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,480
they would do a lot better together. I think they would support each other more.

806
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,560
Yeah. Yeah. I think he would.

807
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,280
What? Dude, they should make a Mario game.

808
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,120
What's the Mario game where you have the water backpack?

809
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, that's Sunshine. That, but it's Yoda.

810
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,280
Yoda's on his back? Yeah.

811
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,240
Like when Yoda goes on Luke's back.

812
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,720
Yeah, but there's got to be like some kind of catalyst or whatever, like not,

813
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,720
which I don't think catalyst is the right word there.

814
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,440
Some kind of like a hindrance for Yoda, you know, because like Mario and Yoda

815
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,640
team up that's like too powerful of a team. Yeah, well that's why it'd be so good to go.

816
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,000
I guess... I think Yoda, if he's on the backpack, because

817
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,760
Yoda could just... Yoda could fuck up the Mushroom Kingdom with just like one force push.

818
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,240
That's true. I think Yoda needs to have cancer.

819
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,840
I think Yoda does need to have cancer. I think maybe, maybe there's some...

820
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,320
Malignant tumor. Yeah.

821
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,680
On his brain and sometimes he forgets powers. Maybe he has a brain tumor. Yeah, he forgets...

822
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,240
good that could be really good also he has no lightsaber okay and he's also naked

823
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,980
on Mario's back lightsaber to like end of the game yeah that's like the final boss

824
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,580
well you like lose the final boss and you're like oh it's impossible and then

825
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,640
he has the lightsaber remember where my lightsaber is I do yeah it was in his

826
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,280
pocket yeah time his skin pocket he's not wearing clothes malignant brain tumor I

827
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,480
I have there's a really graphic and upsetting scene.

828
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:25,680
It's like the surgery. It's like the focus to yeah, it's like the

829
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,480
field of flowers level in in mother three, but it's where it's

830
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,480
just like an interlude thing and you just like walk through but

831
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,680
it's you just like yeah, you just walk through you just are

832
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,380
watching yo's brain get cut apart.

833
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
you have to do the surgery on Yoda's brain.

834
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,280
Yeah, and there's like things like a mini game.

835
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,380
Yeah, it's like a mini game.

836
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,980
That's also like a big.

837
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:56,280
It's a big part of the game too because you have to do it at the

838
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,680
end of every level because the tumor grows.

839
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,680
And that's how you level up because then you can like there's

840
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,680
different parts of the tumor that you can cut out if you yeah,

841
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,180
and if you can gain a skill, but you can also lose one.

842
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,880
Yeah, if you if you fuck up when you're doing the surgery, he

843
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,120
he doesn't die, but he gets like way stupid. It's really sad yeah yeah he's

844
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,620
like he just goes like who are you? He says who are you the entire and then

yeah and then the final boss is Luigi, who's really angry that Yoda replaced

847
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,940
him as my brother. That'd be good. Yoda Mario is a good name. Yoda Mario would

848
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,980
the title of the game. Yeah, Yoda Mario is malignant. I'd be the yeah, it's also a

00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,540
Pikachu does just like me.

trek they're all crossing through dimensions. They're crossing over into

895
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,580
the Star Wars universe, but because of the like the the power they have to use

896
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,240
the drive for their spaceships, it emits radiation and they all have horrible

897
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:07,760
answer

898
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,360
and they're like

899
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,360
to work together to destroy Palpatine junior and it's just like squirtle and

900
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,440

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,800
have Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh, but he's just in a hospital bed the whole movie. He's asleep.

904
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:53,240
Yeah, we got Clifford the Big Red Dog, but he's missing a leg and he also has like part

905
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:01,760
of his face is missing. And yeah, I mean, it's the only way he was able to be kept alive.

906
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,600
It's like the fucking, it's like the scene at the end of Endgame where all the like portals

907
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,400
portals open up and they're like on your left and they all come out, but

908
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,800
it's like they're like we need to fight Palpatine and a bunch of portals

909
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,300
open up and it's everyone like just falls. There's like all

910
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,500
like

911
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,200
green

912
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,100
the portals

913
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:30,200
gives you like cancer. It gives you cancer immediately instant cancer.

914
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah, it like accelerate.

915
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,440
It's like if you were able to survive with bowel cancer for 20 years.

916
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,000
Yeah, because it travels through time too.

917
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,240
And then all the characters who cross over, they still have cancer forever even in their

918
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,240
own movies too.

919
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
We couldn't fix it.

920
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
We couldn't fix that in the movie.

921
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
Something wrong with the character.

922
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,240
I don't know.

923
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,240
I don't know what happened!

927
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
It went through the printer and then he lost his leg!

928
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:18,240
The artist drew him normal, and then we printed out, and he has one of those big fucked up black lumps on him like dogs can!

929
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,240

938
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
[Laughter]

939
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,820
But I'm really excited for this to come out!

940
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Yeah, oh man, that scene...

00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,820
[Laughter]

943
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,820
We have to print new editions of all his books!

944
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,060
Yeah, do you see the new Star Wars movie?

945
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,100
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not really too into it.

946
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,180
I mean, like, you know, it's cool to see like they brought like Yoda back and everything,

947
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:30,700
but like, he has cancer and then like, when Yoda and the guy, Maury from Tuesdays with Maury...

948
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,820
[laughter]

949
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,500
Have to fight Jango Fett.

950
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:42,220
[laughter]

951
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:49,220
Dude, it was so upsetting. After Superman was in the last big Star Wars crossover movie, like, there was this like...

952
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:55,220
There was this hospital ward with all these kids with terminal cancer, they wanted to meet Superman to cheer him up,

953
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:02,220
and he showed up and he keeled over and died from cancer the second he walked in the room.

954
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,220
Dude, that fucking final battle in the new Star Wars is crazy. Judge Judy shows up at the end.

955
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:14,020
*laughter*

956
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,060
Oh my god.

957
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,440
Yeah, I just think it's like one of those stupid fucking crossover movies.

958
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,200
*laughter*

959
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,080
It's just like, they just keep bringing like Judge Joe Brown, and like-

960
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:30,740
*laughter*

961
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,480
They only bring like circuit court DB judges.

962
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,740
(laughter)

963
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,180
- Oh man, this is gonna be the craziest crossover ever.

964
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,760
We got Judge Cherry, we got Cherry Springer.

965
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,580
- They get a new writer for all the movies

966
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,280
and they're doing another endgame style crossover movie

967
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,540
and it's like all the portals open

968
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,540
and it's only like anthropomorphic animal,

969
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,240
it's like all the Zootopia characters come through

970
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,600
and like Parappa the Rappa comes through,

971
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,640
Bugs Bunny comes through, Jessica Rabbit of course.

972
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,180
I guess, like like hundreds of them every of every one of the like like

973
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,460
anthropomorphic animals ever made and they're like

974
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:15,880
what wow it seems like like due to some strange chemical in the portals. It's

975
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,340
made everyone who crosses through them pregnant.

976
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:27,900
It's just three hours of the cartoon animals just becoming this. The

977
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,060
stomachs getting bigger and going "oh I'm so pregnant"

978
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,500
yeah because they're using the- they're basing all these movies off of like the

979
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,940
YouTube algorithm so it's all like Elsa spider-man pregnant

980
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,660
so it's all just shit like that it's just like yeah this is like the first movie

981
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,980
entirely written by the YouTube algorithm

982
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:51,860
to destroy Palpatine we have to pop every pimple on Elsa's face

983
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:57,300
we have to do a full disgusting princess makeover

984
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,460
Dude, do they still do those?

985
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,460
I don't know.

986
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,560
I think the algorithm's like shifted now that it's just like, well I'm sure if you look

987
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:10,180
up like baby shark pimple, something like that, like some crazy shit would show up.

988
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,620
Let's open an incognito window here, YouTube.

989
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,580
Why are you opening it incognito?

990
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,460
I don't want this to affect my YouTube.

991
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,460
That's true.

992
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,460
I'm a baby shark pimple.

993
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,940
That was fucking crazy though.

994
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,940
Like I know you and Pierce used to talk about it a lot, but like the...

997
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:43,500

00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:49,980
Faster version of Baby Shark. When I lived with my parents and like my sister, they would

999
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:54,620
play this on the fucking living room TV all day.

1000
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620

You want to listen to this?

00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,860

1009
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,660
That's going to be the worst.

Look at this.

1013
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,420
I've been trying to show them Mr. Bean and stuff.

Look at this.

1015
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,420
Whoa.

00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,500
That is a huge pimple.

1017
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,500
That's what, yeah.

1018
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,740
I've been trying to show my nephews like Mr. Bean.

1019
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,940
Yeah, you got to get him started early.

1020
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,980
Yeah, I mean Mr. Bean is like the easiest one to get kids into.

1021
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,300
They think it's funny immediately.

1022
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,500
Yeah, it is really a shame, his mouth cancer.

1023
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,500
Ever since he-

1024
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,780
I can't speak, his tongue is huge.

1025
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:46,860
Ever since he appeared in Revenge of Palpatine the Third.

1026
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,860
Episode 75.

1027
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,760
Revenge of Palpatine the third featuring Mr. Bean featuring Mr. Bean yeah yeah

1028
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,500
that was a huge get for them they thought they thought the Bean estate would never

1029
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:03,020
allow him to appear. He did it almost immediately. Yeah he has to I mean Rowan Atkinson has to

1030
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:07,380
pay for those cars yeah but you know he should you know it'd be so cool if he

1031
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:10,700
did if Rowan Atkinson did a press conference that was called Mr. Bean

1032
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:27,100
he's like Mr. Bean is dead. He died last night. I saw Mr. Bean. Rowan Atkinson still alive. He was hit by one of my many cars. I have one million big cars. I have one billion big cars and I hit Mr. Bean with all of them.

1033
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,400
I can drive them normally. I don't put it I don't drive them from a chair on top of the car.

1034
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,680
Dude, that's the crazy, like, Rowan Atkinson just owns a shit ton of Ashton Martins.

1035
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,180
Really?

1036
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,480
Yeah, dude, he's made, like, Mr. Bean was on, there's six episodes of Mr. Bean.

1037
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,120
Yeah, there's very few. How many are there exactly?

1038
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,200
Six, because it's like a BBC series.

1039
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,700
Yeah.

1040
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,360
I think it's six. I don't know.

1041
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,680
I watch them shits over and over.

1042
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,560
I mean, it's still good. I think it's, yeah, then Mr. Bean the animated series...

1043
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,120
Fourteen.

1044
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,160
Took off way longer.

1045
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:00,660
Yeah.

1046
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,920
But like the original series.

1047
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,120
Yeah, there are 14 episodes of the original season.

1048
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,120
Oh, there's 14?

1049
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Yeah.

1050
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,600
Damn, I thought that every BBC series only had 6.

1051
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
I guess you're wrong here.

1052
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Yeah.

1053
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,280
Well, well, I'm stupid.

1054
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,440
Man, I love Mr. Bean.

1055
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Me too.

1056
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,440
He be making me laugh though.

1057
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,920
My nephew's been calling him Mr. Peppermint though.

1058
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,120
It's so funny, why?

1059
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,800
We were watching it in the living room and then I think he was a it was is Mr.

1060
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,520
Bean when he goes to the public pool and oh yeah and his shorts fall off yeah he

1061
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:47,880
turned to me and said why did mr. peppermint do that I was like who mr.

1062
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,760
pepper mr. peppermint is mr. beans nemesis yeah who pulls his pants off all

1063
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,640
the time he's a ghost that follows mr. bean around and makes him do all that

1064
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,600
fucking dumb ass shit. Yeah.

1065
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,800
Your nephew's actually tapped into the deep Mr. Bean lore.

1066
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,960
He can see, he sees a Mr. Bean character. Nobody else can.

1067
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,720
He's like the sixth sense. The seventh sense is for seeing Mr. Peppermint.

1068
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,440
Damn. Imagine how crazy Mr. Peppermint looks too.

1069
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,200
Yeah. Probably like a ghost.

1070
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,320
Yeah. Probably just a white sheet.

1071
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,480
Probably a white ghost.

1072
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,720
Yeah. Probably one big white sheet.

1073
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,260
Yeah.

1074
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,220
