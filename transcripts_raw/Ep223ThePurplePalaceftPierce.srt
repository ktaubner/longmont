00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
Hello, listeners of Podcasts About List. It's me, Pierce, friend of the show and director

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,320
and editor of Fright at the Museum, the most popular Podcasts About List video in recent

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,040
memory. I just wanted to let you know that an extended cut of Fright at the Museum will

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:34,540
be dropping on flight day the 13th in January. It will be longer, more scary, funny, movie.

5
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,580
And now please enjoy the new episode of Podcast About List, on which I am a guest. We had

6
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:48,060
a lot of fun reminiscing about old times, sharing laughs, and reading lists, but at

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,780
At some point, as usual, it goes way off the rails, and I think you'll be able to tell

8
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:05,380
at what moment I lost my nerve. Yeah. So take a look, and wish everyone involved in Podcast

9
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:13,340
About List, including JubyO and Patches, a happy season. Holiday greeting. Bye bye!

10
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:25,340
(music)

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
And now we're official.

12
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Okay, let's start it exactly how we started it before.

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,340
Oh yeah!

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,340
Well we saw the first 22 seconds.

15
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,340
I think we'll cut that in first and then just jump to this.

16
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,340
We lost the recording incidentally.

17
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,580
where Jubio fucked everything up.

18
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,380
Broke every single thing.

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,380
God damn you, you fucking piece of shit.

20
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,280
I think I should drink this.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,020
What is in that?

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,860
It's just it's hot coffee, but it's in a plastic cup

23
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,360
because all the other mugs were dirty.

24
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
And I was like, I thought about doing it and then I decided against it.

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,400
That was a that was a thing that I learned from about a few months ago

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,760
when we first got this office and we got the coffee maker.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,660
I was like, I'll have some I'll make some coffee.

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,240
And then the only cups were solo cups.

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,500
I took one sip and I was like, I this is so hot.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,580
And it tastes like plastic.

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,820
You can taste the plastic.

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,620
Yeah, but who gives a fuck for him?

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,940
For him, we talk about I mean, I'm in love with him.

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,620
And he's my friend. Wait, what did you just?

35
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,740
There you go. OK, love with me.

36
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,980
But like you, he's fucking throw another shrimp on the Barbie on this guy.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,740
What the hell do you? I'm not Australian.

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,540
I never shamper in the back.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
What's the voice?

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,140
What's the voice?

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,220
And there are no on the bar right now.

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,420
There are no showing that I'm doing it on a frog.

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,420
- Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,420
- You know what I'm saying.

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,420
- I think you're rushing.

46
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,420
I think, just close your eyes, think about an Australian,

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
think about a kangaroo.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
- Oh, wow.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,420
- Air, wow.

50
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,420
- No, Owen Wilson.

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
(laughing)

52
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
- Wow.

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,420
- Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,420
- Throw another, fuck me, man, what's going on?

55
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
- Fuck me.

56
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,420
- Let's throw another shrimp on the barbie.

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,420
- Let's throw another shrimp on the barbie.

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,120
Start with Barbie Bobby see Oh

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,860

60
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:22,720
You brought by a Barbie

61
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,540
Robin Bobby

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,860
Let's throw up another let's okay, so you're stomping over my shit because I was trying to do it actually reverse

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,860

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,920
Reverse he said backwards a brab a brab I asked Matthew golden to do a Stewie Griffin impression

And this was his this is what he said I struggle with that at my age

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,700
Struggle with that at boy age

67

Man it's hard to do it's hard to do different impressions sometimes yeah, yeah, yeah, you got this okay?

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,220
Was that

69
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,460
- Is this the beginning of This Girl is on Fire?

70
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,300
- Mm-hmm.

71
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,140
- That was pretty good.

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,420
- ♪ This girl is on fire ♪

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,260
- Check this one out.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,080

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,740

- Oh, okay.

79
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,380
- That's a terrible Zoolander.

80
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,220
- Shut up!

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,060
- No.

82
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,340
- Here's a bit I used to do in sixth grade.

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,820
It was like, all right, here's Christian Bale.

84
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,300
All right, here's Owen Wilson.

85
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,700
All right, here's Nick Cage.

86
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,140
- You're doing a kissy face.

87
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,100
- Yeah, same impression each time.

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,420
- And what year was that?

89
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,540
- Kind of like a-- - Were you in sixth grade?

90
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,380
- Yeah.

91
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,780
- Nick Cage used to be very funny to talk about, man.

92
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,700
- Oh, yeah. - He was like the

93
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,580
Chuck Norris of movies, let's say.

94
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,740
- Definitely. - Of randomness.

95
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,580
- Yeah.

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,420
- He was the Chuck Norris of randomness.

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,380
- Chuck Norris was also in movies.

98
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,220
- Right.

99
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,040
- Not as much as Nick Cage, though.

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,980
- Chuck Norris was like the Chuck Norris of fighting

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,140
and maybe even Chuck Norris jokes.

102
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,980
- True.

103
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,300
- Nicholas Cage.

104
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,180
- What's the best Chuck Norris joke ever written?

105
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
- Just Google it.

106
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,840
- Yeah.

107
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,900
- Best Chuck Norris joke ever written.

108
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,140
stroke ever written we're not gonna figure it out no figure we can write a

109
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,020
chunk what's the one that's in the expendables where it's like it's like

110
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,200
Arnold Schwarzenegger's like I who do a bit by a cobra and he's like yeah but

111
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,740
then the after three days of agonizing pain the Cobra died okay here's the

112
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,980
number one here's the number one joke okay boogie man goes to sleep every

113
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,180
night he checks his closet for Chuck Norris wow that's a riot these are just

114
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,180
in soviet russia

115
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,500
the same format

116
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,420
i'd like i think they turned into that it turned it if you i feel like it was

117
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,500
originally supposed to be it was originally when i read those jokes and

118
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,540
like say like two thousand eight or whatever

119
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,040
it was a like chuck norris yet chuck norris could punch through a wall

120
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,660
it will be stuff like that

121
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,420
you know i mean yeah but that that he had been a turn into a truck in the

122
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,020
first of all it's not true

123
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,100
what what give you the the sentiment

124
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
- Chuck Norris is strong as hell.

125
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,740
- When Chuck Norris runs, the world spins under him

126
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,060
instead of him running.

127
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,880
- He narrates, Chuck Norris narrates

128
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,300
Morgan Freeman's thoughts.

129
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
That was one that I remember from childhood.

130
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,900
- The joke was that he was just like a shitty

131
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,380
80s action star who was like never in a good movie.

132
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,020
And then like--

133
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,420
- Yeah, that was the joke.

134
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
- Yeah, that's what it was, but then like--

135
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
- Doing a video essay.

136
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,220
- Growing up, I thought that Chuck Norris

137
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,320
was like a beloved like action star and it's like that was not the case.

138
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah when he's not at the end of the ultimate showdown I mean I was

139
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,940
learning about Batman and Godzilla and then Chuck Norris shows up he must be

140
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,080
famous than Batman. He's gotta be bigger than Abraham Lincoln. I definitely thought he was just the meme guy.

141
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah the guy from Chuck Norris. I thought he was basically number one badass. Really? But then you find out

142
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,700
when you're kid he's 82 years old. 82 years old and he's a freaking Republican.

143
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,100
Yeah, and first of all, I'll play that conservative bullshit.

144
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Yeah, I don't fuck with that.

145
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
No, no, no.

146
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,460
He's, I think he was supposed to be like Mike Huckabee's running mate.

147
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,540
Yeah, he used to go on Huckabee all the time.

148
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah.

149
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,180
And just talk about nothing, which to me, kung fu is not like very conservative.

150
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,420
Hey, you'd be surprised.

151
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Huh.

153
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,420
About what?

154
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,420
What my sensei says to me.

155
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
You don't have a sensei.

156
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
Sensei is karate.

157
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,420
You've never done kung fu in your life.

158
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Well, but yes, I've done karate.

159
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
Sensei is for all of them.

160
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,580
that's that's a good point I haven't done kung fu yeah yeah I guess kung fu is for

161
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,120
libs and karate is for red red-blooded Demo Republicans like me when Chuck

162
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,060
Norris does karate

163
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:43,120
his opponent becomes hit by him exactly a black belt earns Chuck Norris see

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
- Dude, that's pretty good.

165
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,040
- I will say it's a,

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,880
(laughing)

167
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,120
this is a good one.

168
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Chuck's Gmail account, gmail@chucknorris.com.

169
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,960
That is good.

170
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,800
Chuck Norris on--

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,620
- Chuck Norris on Hillary Clinton.

172
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,800
Yeah, she votes for him.

173
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,760
- Damn.

174
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,600
- Yeah, she's with him.

175
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,420
- Or she doesn't vote for him, maybe.

176
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,200
- Yeah, this isn't even like a Chuck Norris meme.

177
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
- That's just a quote.

178
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
- Yeah.

179
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
God, he looks like shit.

180
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,520
- It is a really great,

181
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,040
what a wonderful concept for a TV show

182
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,400
of a sheriff who can do kung fu.

183
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,240
- Yeah.

184
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
- That's a really, I never really considered that.

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
- Walker, Texas Ranger.

186
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,280
- What a goddamn amazing-- - Anybody who just,

187
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,820
anybody who is, anything that's,

188
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,920
it's a guy who has a job and he can like,

189
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,840
he fights people.

190
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,080
- So good. - That's great.

191
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,120
- Roadhouse?

192
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
- Yeah.

193
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,880
- Roadhouse is a real good movie.

194
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,840
- Yeah, Texas Roadhouse.

195
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Those teedots on the floor.

196
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,480
- I really like Roadhouse.

197
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
- Yeah, I got some-- - I love that movie.

198
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
- My girl gave me some Roadhouse.

199
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
- Damn. - Yeah.

200
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200
- She built a house on the road.

201
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
- She gave you Roadhead in your house?

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
(laughing)

203
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,160
- On the couch.

204
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,560
- Oh yeah.

205
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Oh yeah.

206
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,240
- Playing Flight Simulator? - You're playing

207
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,980
- I have a force of four.

208
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,520
- I've been watching a bunch of videos on flight simulator.

209
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
Did you know that the flight simulator games,

210
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,800
there's people who don't even fly the planes.

211
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,880
They just go in there and do air traffic controller

212
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,720
for like eight hours.

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,540
- No fucking way.

214
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,600
- They literally sit there and just be like,

215
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
JetBlue03071, go to November.

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
- That's so funny 'cause like,

217
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,160
flight simulator guys are like so obsessed

218
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,880
with like getting their PC to be like the most like,

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,460
like high powered thing in the world.

220
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,920
And then just to do that, like spending like,

221
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,640
like probably like 2K.

222
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,980
- I think these are the guys who can't afford the nice things.

223
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,820
- Yeah, okay.

224
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,900
- Well, I think that makes sense.

225
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
It makes sense to me.

226
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,580
- No, but just imagine.

227
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,840
- I don't think, if somebody is obsessed

228
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,920
with air traffic control, I don't think that's a job.

229
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,860
That's something that you have to really want to do.

230
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,460
I don't think anybody has ever fallen

231
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,020
into a job at air traffic.

232
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,420
Nobody's like, well, I'm looking at a few things.

233
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,140
I don't know, I haven't gotten hired yet.

234
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,980
- You're really good at--

235
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,700
- What about a disgraced pilot?

236
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,540
- Yeah, they probably let a disgraced pilot

237
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,900
be an air traffic controller.

238
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,080
I mean, besides crashing the plane,

239
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,340
in what world can you even become a disgraced pilot?

240
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,140
- You're goosing all the flight attendants.

241
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,580
- If you're rude over the intercom, you say.

242
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,660
- Goosing, that's, what does that mean, goosing?

243
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,740
- You put your finger up a skirt.

244
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,580
- Yeah.

245
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,260
Oh, have you guys ever played flight attendants?

246
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,420
(laughing)

247
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,060
- Yeah, you gotta dodge a lot of those.

248
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,460
- Yeah, well you can't last 10 seconds playing that game.

249
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,100
(laughing)

250
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,140
- There's guys who go on flight simulator

251
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,020
and nobody can hear them unless they press the button

252
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,340
and they'll just like talk to the cabin.

253
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,980
they have like a script and they'll be like,

254
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,820
we have cloudy skies, we have a little bit of turbulence

255
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,340
about halfway through the route, a nice tailwind,

256
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
it'll be 30 minutes out of schedule.

257
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,900
- I think that's baked into your brain when you're born

258
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
that you're going to be an air traffic controller

259
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,460
and if you spent the first 30 years of your life

260
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,380
living in a basement and you can't go out

261
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,020
and get the actual job, that's the only thing you can do.

262
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,780
You can't even be like a Crusader Kings guy,

263
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,420
you have to be an air traffic controller.

264
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,660
I think that's a destiny thing.

265
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,860
- Yeah, the only ladder that you can climb

266
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,980
to end up as an air traffic controller

267
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,940
that you're an autistic guy who plays those games all the time. It's not like

268
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,820
someone is really good at throwing luggage onto the plane. You know your way around planes.

269
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:57,580
You can be a pilot for a day, we'll see how it goes.

270
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,060
Holy shit this kid's a natural! What the fuck has he been doing all this time?

271
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm starting to not like flying. I used to love flying. I hate it. I like it.

272
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,260
you I blame you yeah I'm sorry I literally never want to see you about I

273
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,220
never once thought that a plane crash I basically never once gotten a plane it

274
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,980
was like oh yeah I guess this could crash until he would start I started

275
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,620
flying with him and he started acting like that I just like nor him

276
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:30,980
can't help it yeah we should be actually sorry we should we should put I get it

277
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,680
We should put a we should knock you out with a Billy. I think

278
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,360
I would love to take Xanax before taking flights, but my truly my

279
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,440
I

280
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,320
Like take an anti-anxiety or something and it's zonks me out

281
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,520
But not enough that I'm like like if I'm like halfway and I can't like fall asleep

282
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,040
I like going in because that's happening getting like sleep paralysis

283
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,240
Actually my full nightmare

284
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
- Yeah. - Especially--

285
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,980
- Which is the reason I don't do it.

286
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,200
- But you might like it 'cause it's so similar

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
to your favorite shows and books.

288
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,860
- Yeah, I guess I might like it.

289
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,080
Wouldn't that suck if you took the Xanax

290
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
and you're like all relaxed and shit,

291
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,560
and you fall asleep, then you wake up,

292
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,520
(imitates plane crashing)

293
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,600
plane's actually crashing for a moment.

294
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,440
- (imitates plane crashing)

295
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,260
Getting shot in the head with a machine gun.

296
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,100
- I don't get any love.

297
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,920
There's a terrorist on the plane.

298
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,760
- Could happen.

299
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,720
- I mean, you can't fly the plane better than the pilot.

300
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,040
That's what I always call myself.

301
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,000
Like, even if there's mad turbulence.

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,720
That's a crazy thing to tell yourself on a plane.

303
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Well, what am I gonna do?

304
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,400
Even if I hate it, even if I'm really nervous

305
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,300
that it's gonna come down, I'm like,

306
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,560
well thank God that there's someone who flies planes

307
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
who's in control right now.

308
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,480
- I'm not even consciously thinking like,

309
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
oh this plane is gonna crash.

310
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,220
There's something about the physical sensation

311
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,200
that turns me into a crazy person.

312
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,040
- I think that, yeah.

313
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,860
- I have no conscious thought of like,

314
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,560
this plane is crashing, this turbulence means

315
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,400
we're going down.

316
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,560
- We kept playing Word Scramble.

317
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,720
- That was fun AF.

318
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,680
- That was the only time I've ever seen you

319
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,960
calm on a plane.

320
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,820
Was when we went from Tampa back to New York,

321
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,920
like six in the morning.

322
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,120
We were trying to play games with other people.

323
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,920
- Oh yeah, they have the, you know on planes,

324
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,400
they have the games on the back where you can like,

325
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
start a room, like it's a fucking like,

326
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
- Yeah, we like, we kept requesting.

327
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,120
- Like it's a Battlefront 2 server.

328
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
- Goddamn.

329
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,040
- I always, you can set your nickname,

330
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,960
so I was setting my name to Rubbing Me One,

331
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,720
and like said, like opening my room,

332
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
so everyone in the plane can see,

333
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
like, would you like to join Rubbing Me One's game,

334
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,360
Bird vs. Bird?

335
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,440
- I always have, I always play the poker one,

336
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,440
and I, it's always me versus like some eight year old

337
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,080
who's like, "Oh my God, I get to play poker,

338
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
and his name is Y," and I just clean him, dude.

339
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,520
I'm just fucking winning every single hand, dude.

340
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,800
He folds every time, fucking idiot kid.

341
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,760
- That's how I used to win all my poker games.

342
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,880
- Just fold every single time?

343
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,200
- Go all in on the first hand,

344
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,480
and then fold until you keep cash out.

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,800
- Yeah, smart.

346
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
- Yeah.

347
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,200
- Oh, dude, Mahjong.

348
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,520
- Oh, yeah. - Mahjong?

349
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,960
- We gotta start our Mahjong tonight.

350
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
- Have you guys been playing?

351
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,640
Do you guys know how to play Mahjong?

352
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
- No, no, no, we've been talking about it

353
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,720
for probably a year and a half now.

354
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,760
- That was a game my mom had on the computer.

355
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,600
I don't know how to do. No, that's not the championship.

356
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,560
My job. Oh, shut up. Oh, shut the fuck up.

357
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Came with purple palace.

358
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,560
It's a completely different.

359
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm going to put you in the purple palace.

360
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,000
It's a completely to go.

361
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
You would not because there's no white people.

362
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,880
I would love to go to all just purple people.

363
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,200
And they'll be mean. I would love it.

364
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,760
There's no I don't care. I'll win them over.

365
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
No, no, no, no.

366
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
I'll show them the purple on the inside.

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
They hate white culture at the purple.

368
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
They don't hate white culture at the.

369
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,800
They really do.

370
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
Now, when I get there, no, they're going to show them the worm.

371
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,680
that's not

372
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,380
yet they invented the word they don't need to be someone to explain the

373
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,800
report

374
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,720
now they invented the purple were which is a different saying

375
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
this is why i was going to shut up all the sudden i'm talking to about my

376
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,840
job

377
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,400
there is a fair way to go back to the purple

378
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
there's purple

379
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
are probably

380
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,520
spot always called it what is purple play that's a real thing

381
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,120
the myself game artist hope yeah it's a game that came with windows vista

382
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,280
Holy shit, the purple place looks sick.

383
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,960
Dude, Windows Vista was fire.

384
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,520
The Windows Vista games, dude.

385
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,960
What is the purple place in this picture?

386
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
Is that building alive?

387
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,560
Cakes?

388
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,280
What?

389
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,960
Yeah, look up purple place gameplay.

390
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,800
Purple place walkthrough.

391
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
Whoa.

392
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,880
This looks fun.

393
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,440
See, they would love me.

394
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
No, they would not.

395
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,840
I would fit right in.

396
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,880
I'd look just like that.

397
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,560
Are those purples?

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,160
This is the purple place and not the purple palace.

399
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,960
No, you're talking about a different thing.

400
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,880
cakes there and you are you kidding my song no it was on the same it was in the

401
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:29,040
same folder as my song the computer listen the Mahjong you're talking about

402
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,880
is basically fucking spot the difference but it reverse this real Mahjong is

403
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,000
poker well there's also a spot difference on purple please I'm speed

404
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,040
I'm spying a difference on you yeah the rest of us what's that you have a you

405
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,080
have a crane in your head yeah yeah I have a crane that picks up the wrong the

406
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,000
wrong thoughts and drops them in your mouth yeah that's fine

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,320
have you ever won a crane game or any kind of yes I did you can't win those

408
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,840
Shaw's Londonderry New Hampshire any games at the arcade sorry hey to break

409
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,200
it to you guys but if you haven't that's a false memory if you got a check out

410
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,320
you got to check out our Kate Matt he gives away all the secrets and he has a

411
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,980
- I have heard that the crane only activates

412
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,120
like one out of 10 times.

413
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
- Yeah, there's like an odds calculator

414
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,600
or whatever the fuck it's called on the inside.

415
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,640
- Really? - Yeah.

416
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,320
- So what happens, the way to win a crane game

417
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,080
is you watch somebody play the crane game.

418
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,120
You watch somebody win and then count how many times

419
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
to the next win and then that's your odds.

420
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
- Oh. - And then--

421
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,520
- That's not how you win, that's just how you know

422
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,360
when you're going to win. - That's how you know

423
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
when you can win. - Yeah, exactly.

424
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,440
But that's the only way you can win.

425
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,200
- How you win is to select an animal and press a button.

426
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
- And press a button.

427
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,540
- No.

428
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,360
- Yeah, that's how you win.

429
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,200
- That has nothing to do with it.

430
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,160
- No, 'cause you're not gonna,

431
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,200
you're gonna have to play for a bunch of times.

432
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
- You know how much--

433
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,980
- Oh, and that would be such a nightmare

434
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,600
to play a game a bunch of times.

435
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,360
You just don't understand arcades in the slightest.

436
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,840
- I won an orange robot at Shaw's in the orange jute.

437
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,600
- That's about the only thing you can win, yeah.

438
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,000
- Remember when we went to that arcade

439
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,920
and Pat was obsessed with the coin pusher game?

440
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,000
- Yeah. - I love that.

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
- I do love it.

442
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,680
- You guys turned me on to this.

443
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,960
- I won so much on that.

444
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
- That's the best arcade game, I think.

445
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
- Yeah, I had no idea.

446
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,920
- Because you have to actually have strategy and timing.

447
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
It's a skill game.

448
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,760
- I like the one, I used to always like the one

449
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,200
where you shoot, you roll, or you either roll

450
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,600
or shoot the coin down and it goes into a spinning wheel.

451
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
- Oh yeah.

452
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,320
- But the one I used to play was called Wonder Wheel

453
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,480
or something, it wasn't ski themed.

454
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,760
And it was on the conveyor belt.

455
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
- Well you did a bad one.

456
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
- There's one in Nashua.

457
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,200
- I was really good at it and I won a lot of stuff.

458
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,540
- There's this place called Play Kingdom or something,

459
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,680
or like Fun Castle in Nashua.

460
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,240
And I won, I figured out how to get the jackpot every time.

461
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,820
I got my nephew a good gift for his birthday.

462
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
What gift?

463
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
He wanted the iron.

464
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
The iron?

465
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
They had an iron in there.

466
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Like an ingot of iron?

467
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,820
No, like a clothing iron.

468
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Oh, he wanted an iron.

469
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I have a video of working iron.

470
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Wait, that was in an arcade?

471
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Yeah.

472
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,820
I have a video.

473
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
At Fun Palace or Play Kit.

474
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
I don't want to...

475
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Don't dump game pieces from board games into this thing and say you can win.

476
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,820
You can win an iron.

477
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,820
It's not a real working iron or a toy iron.

478
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
I have a video, but I don't want to show a video of my nephew on the podcast.

479
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,820
This doesn't make any fucking sense.

480
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
There was a video of a kid playing with a toy.

481
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
I don't know if you can see it.

482
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,380
working iron or a toy iron? I have a video but I don't want to show this video of my nephew on the podcast.

483
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,060
This doesn't make any fucking sense. There was a clothes iron in a...

484
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,860
In... what's it called? I think it's Fun World.

485
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,780
I told you. What game world? Did you purchase it with tickets that you had won for...

486
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,460
Okay there we go. But why was that available for... I didn't get the iron.

487
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,980
What? You said you... I just have a video of him talking about the iron. You were lying.

488
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,980
I'm a liar. Why'd you lie? Because I wanted to be good on the show. But there is... I've been...

489
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,860
My performance lately hasn't been great.

490
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,860
A lot of people are annoyed with me.

491
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,860
A lot of people are annoyed with me all the time.

492
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,860
I just want everyone to think I'm cool.

493
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,860
So I lied about it. Yeah. I made the whole thing up.

494
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,860
I wanted Pierce to think I was cool.

495
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,860
No, there's an iron. I have the video. I can show you.

496
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,620
freaking me out yes or no there was an iron I'll show I guess my just well just

497
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,220
say yes or no you have to show it's probably that's that yes or no well yeah

498
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,980
I guess just like why would you ruin an iron and a wire in a in an arcade

499
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,220
cabinet do you guys ever play that game where you put the penny in and then you

500
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:37,500
flatten your giant Mickey Mouse

501
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,900
fridge to imagine the person is weird

502
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,860
as fuck

503
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,940
can you imagine me the person who like

504
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,260
stalked that and like had to convince

505
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,060
him like no we'll put it on there will

506
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,220
be a kid and nobody would believe them until your nephew was like did your

507
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,180
nephew was a plant yeah a crowd of like of like 10 kids who are on like a

508
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,540
field trip there or something and they're like I want the spider ring

509
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,500
they're fresh out of all these okay now go go oh yeah

510
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,540
there's an iron? Let me look at how many points that was - that was - look it up on Google

511
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,800
No, that was that that is like 3,000 tickets

512
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:21,640
It was 3,000 tickets get the eye I didn't get it though PlayStation control I got him a Chinese finger trip. Oh

513
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,460
There's actually way more points show this right now. It's 10,000 how much that's in destiny to

514
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,480
Okay, that's in destiny - thank you. Jubio. I

515
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,120
Really? I've always

516
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,960
I think it's impossible to win like the Xbox and stuff right but the one the one

517
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,480
Under where you can get like an RC car and stuff. That's doable for that

518
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,920
I never got that I never got any of those so like not in an arcade where there's clearly like they can measure how many tickets

519
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,360
But like the one-off games that they have in like the malls or whatever like Patrick got busted playing at one of the arcade malls

520
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,360
That we went to when we were in

521
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,520
Patrick went missing and then we like

522
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,560
- Yeah, when we were in North Carolina when you left.

523
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,380
- Oh, you left, we were at that mall.

524
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,840
I don't know why the fuck we went to the mall.

525
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
Yeah, we went to Independence Mall.

526
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,500
- We went to Independence Mall.

527
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,340
- Born on Airsoft.

528
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,180
- Oh yeah.

529
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,000
- Oh yeah.

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,840
- Cameron did, you went to Chris Kyle on Airsoft.

531
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,720
- Yeah, you were insanely good at Airsoft.

532
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,560
- Sharp shooter.

533
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,380
- Yeah.

534
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,660
- But we went and then I tried to win that,

535
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,740
what is it, oh no, the key ring.

536
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,580
I tried to win the key ring.

537
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,960
- Yeah, that was really hard.

538
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,280
- Whenever, that's something you'd also--

539
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
- I put like 20 times.

540
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,040
- I remember when, back when Caleb would drive us

541
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,520
back and forth from New York,

542
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,360
we'd always stop at a rest stop or something,

543
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,320
and we'd be going to the bathroom,

544
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
we'd come out, and you'd have put $10 into the,

545
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,880
like, whatever game.

546
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,560
- Yeah, I got this one game they have

547
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,400
in the buy me a burger game.

548
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
- I got the stimulus check.

549
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,680
- It's for people who can't speak English to fall for.

550
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,520
- But if there's a PS5 or whatever in one of those games,

551
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,240
the one-off games, clearly the only way to get that

552
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,300
is to cheat, but if you walk out of the mall

553
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,600
holding the empty PS5 box, and you're like,

554
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,520
"I won this at the thing,"

555
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,680
- Whose job is it to say, "No, you didn't."

556
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,640
Like, who could possibly stop you?

557
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
- Oh, no, you didn't.

558
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,280
- Yeah, you were saying that.

559
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
- You were saying that at the mall.

560
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,280
- I was, that's right.

561
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,600
- I remember that, 'cause then I was like,

562
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,440
well, what if we do that?

563
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,400
- Yeah.

564
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,360
- Wait, you're saying, oh, you're saying,

565
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,120
grab the box, just bring an empty box.

566
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,960
- To someone.

567
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
- Tell them and say, "I won this out of the thing."

568
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
- Yeah, who's she gonna call?

569
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,800
- Do you guys remember when,

570
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,320
I forget what casino we were even at.

571
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
We were at a casino.

572
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,720
Oh, and there was there was like the arcade downstairs.

573
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,020
Yeah, we saw a sign that was like the kids area.

574
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,720
They're like, there's a kids area of the casino.

575
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,620
So we went looking for it.

576
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,020
We went it was like downstairs like tucked away in a corner.

577
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,620
It was like a tiny arcade.

578
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,120
It was at Caesars Palace, right?

579
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,420
Yeah, I don't remember even.

580
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,020
It was either Caesars Palace or Bally's.

581
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,320
Yeah.

582
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,020
No, no, it is.

583
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,520
It is.

584
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
And just there was just one.

585
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,920
I remember it was one. Wild West at Caesars.

586
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,320
It was completely empty.

587
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,820
The person who was working there did not want to be working there.

588
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,020
No, he helped us with Guitar Hero or something.

589
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,260
We were there at five o'clock on a Tuesday or something.

590
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,060
Well, there's going to be plenty of kids in schools out.

591
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,900
Yeah, true.

592
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,100
And there was just one guy there who was getting so into the games.

593
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,380
I think he was playing one of the motorcycle games or something.

594
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,700
And it was me really hard.

595
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,140
No, there was another guy in there with like an adult.

596
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,700
Yeah. And it was really making me laugh that there's a guy

597
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,660
who was like upstairs at the casino and he's like, you know what?

598
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,620
Fuck this.

599
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,140
Well, I haven't won shit.

600
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,700
Yeah, you know what I'm going to do?

601
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,220
I know. Yeah, it's a motorcycle.

602
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,740
I want to play as something.

603
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,580
It's exactly the same thing.

604
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,620
No, because at the arcade, you get

605
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,540
to ride on a motorcycle when you get no money.

606
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,060
You win more at the arcade, because you can buy funny candy.

607
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:35,780
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

608
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,460
You can't get anything out of gambling.

609
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,780
There's more rewards.

610
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,220
When I was in Vegas a couple weeks ago,

611
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,580
there was a huge arcade in the bottom of the casino.

612
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,060
And it really was so tempting to me.

613
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,980
And I kept suggesting it to the people I was with.

614
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,700
Like, man, all this gambling's fun,

615
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,100
but shouldn't we-- we should go down and play the Jurassic Park

616
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Dark game.

617
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,880
That's messed up that no one would go with no one would go that's fuck

618
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,140
And I don't want to play the two-player games because those are the good ones yeah guitar heroes are the fun ones

619
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,500
I like this night that sniper game that sniper game was fucking awesome

620
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Fun world I have the high score on holiday in Cambodia not anymore not anymore

621
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,420
on easy oh

622
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,420
Yeah, he sucks a guitar

623
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,540
He pretended like he was gonna be good, and then I played with him, and I smoked it

624
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,220
Yeah, you smoke playing on medium and fucking missing 80% of the time. I'm really really bad at guitar here

625
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,500
- I'm like horrible at guitar hero

626
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,420
because I never played it as a kid,

627
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,260
so it doesn't confuse my friends.

628
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,100
- You weren't allowed to have video games.

629
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,420
- I was allowed to have video games.

630
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,100
- I went on a father-son fishing trip

631
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,500
with my dad and his company,

632
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,700
and I was like the middle child

633
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,820
of all the kids that showed up.

634
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,820
So I could either hang out with the 17 year olds

635
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,740
when I was 13, or I could hang out

636
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,620
with the 11 year olds.

637
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,540
And so I ended up just hanging out with the 11 year olds

638
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,500
'cause they would just watch me play guitar hero.

639
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,340
- You're a god.

640
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,700
- So for six days in a row,

641
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,380
I just tried to beat Seven Nation Army on expert mode,

642
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,620
no other songs, and they couldn't play if they wanted to.

643
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,940
I was just like, no, I'm almost there.

644
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,780
- He's hogging it.

645
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,300
- Treating Guitar Hero like it's a Dark Souls thing.

646
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,140
- Yeah.

647
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,980
- So at this point, just trying,

648
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,820
oh, dude, next time I'm gonna get it.

649
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,980
Looking up a video, how to do it.

650
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,260
- They didn't even have phones to go on.

651
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,980
This was earlier than phones.

652
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,820
- Earlier than phones.

653
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,300
- Earlier than phones, 1800s?

654
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,860
- You know what I used to do?

655
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,620
My dad had a Blackberry for work,

656
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,280
and I learned that you could put AOL instant messenger on it.

657
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,520
So when we'd go on family camping trips or whatever,

658
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,120
I would just message my friends on AOL and be like,

659
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,220
"Yeah, camping sucks right now.

660
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,980
I kinda wanna go home."

661
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,400
- Man, my stepdad had a Sony Ericsson that had--

662
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,860
- I'm Ericsson. - True, you are.

663
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
- That's my dad's name.

664
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,720
- I used to take it into the bathroom and play Neopets.

665
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,280
He had no idea I had a whole Neopet situation

666
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
on his phone for like two and a half years probably.

667
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,400
- Oh, Brick Breaker?

668
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,040
- "Breaker" on my dad's Blackberry was--

669
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
- Yeah, dude.

670
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,700
- Was beat-baller. - Goated.

671
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,900
The little trackball.

672
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,740
- Yeah, the little trackball.

673
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,880
And the rap.

674
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,440
- Mate, you just surfaced a memory

675
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,920
that I just remembered for the,

676
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,080
I haven't thought about this,

677
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,080
when I played like Smash at someone's house or something,

678
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,780
and I didn't understand what was going on,

679
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,420
and there was, or maybe,

680
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,560
somehow I was aware of Solid Snake.

681
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
- Yeah.

682
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,060
- And I just knew that Solid Snake existed.

683
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,300
I didn't know what he was or what he was from.

684
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,180
and my mom's Nokia phone had a game on it called Snake.

685
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,020
- Oh yeah. - Oh.

686
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,220
- And I was like, oh my God,

687
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,260
you have an actual game on here?

688
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,540
That was Solid Snake?

689
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,260
And I opened it up and it was Snake.

690
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,460
- You were a fucking idiot kid.

691
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,380
- I just remembered that for the first time.

692
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,420
- Oh my God.

693
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,940
- You were starstruck.

694
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,820
- I couldn't believe, I was like,

695
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,420
how could you play a game with a character

696
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,660
that looks like that on a phone like this?

697
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
How could that possibly work?

698
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,620
- Remember the, like some,

699
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,780
back in 2008 or whatever,

700
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,500
you could text, like, you could text,

701
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,460
it was like, if you had a Motorola flip phone,

702
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,940
you could text, like, Saints to 6-1-something-something-something

703
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,020
and you could just play Saints Row on your phone.

704
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
- That's tight.

705
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,700
- What?

706
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,580
- And it cost, like, yeah, it was like,

707
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,380
you would pay monthly to play the mobile version

708
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,180
of Saints Row.

709
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
- Yeah.

710
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,100
- Oh, I did have some kind of Godzilla game

711
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,940
on my E-touch or something.

712
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,540
- On my flip phone, I had worms,

713
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,140
And I had Earthworm Jim.

714
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,760
I had worms games.

715
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,860
- Worms type games with worms in them.

716
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,980
(laughing)

717
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,500
- Worms was good, man.

718
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
- Worms was so sick.

719
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,580
- Yeah, I used to play worms all the time.

720
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,300
- I wonder if any of those mobile games

721
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,440
are like backed up anywhere though.

722
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,580
'Cause I do wanna see what like Saints Row for the mobile.

723
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,060
- Yeah. - For like the Motorola,

724
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,180
whatever. - You must be able

725
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,860
to find them somewhere. - Yeah.

726
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,460
Remember the NexTel phones that had the walkie talkies?

727
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,780
- No. - My dad had those

728
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,620
for work. - I like that little jingle.

729
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,940
- The little beep, the chirp chirp.

730
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,420
I feel like that chirp has become an ad-lib in rap songs.

731
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,140
Does that sound right?

732
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,940
- I don't listen to phone rap.

733
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,780
- I do.

734
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,300
- Lucid Dreams by Juice WRLD,

735
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,060
I think they use the little next tail.

736
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,740
- Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

737
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,580
- Yeah.

738
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,400
- Little next tail chirp.

739
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,240
- He does that?

740
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,080
- Yeah.

741
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,900
- He does it with his voice.

742
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,740
- Really?

743
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,580
- He did it before he passed.

744
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,400
- He's tragic.

745
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,240
- Yeah, it starts,

746
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,220
the chirp is what the beat drop is.

747
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,060
- Yeah.

748
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,260
♪ I, I, I, I ♪

749
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,100
- I didn't know that.

750
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,920
♪ I still see your ♪

751
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,600
I didn't know that was the next tell sound, but I know which sound you're talking about.

752
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Because I've listened to that song 10,000 times.

753
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,720
I think that these hip hop samplers are getting fucking insanely way too crazy and disrespectful

754
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,960
with the stuff they sample.

755
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah, like Wiz Khalifa sampling Chrono Trigger.

756
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,560
Yeah, how about you just sample normal music, other shit that other people have made.

757
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,080
Stop trying to get fucking crazy.

758
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
Stop putting a fucking Taco Bell commercial in your song.

759
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,320
And make your own drums.

760
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,640
Don't steal other people's drums.

761
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,440
Yeah, and sing instead of rap as well.

762
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,720
And get two guitars and a bass and a keyboard player.

763
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,400
- I swear to God yesterday I was listening to a bunch of rap

764
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,240
in the car.

765
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,060
- No.

766
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,900
- I swear to God.

767
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,740
(laughing)

768
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,840
But then I picked up my wife from the train station

769
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,760
and I said something mean and she said,

770
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,920
"You're being disrespectful 'cause you're listening to rap."

771
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,160
(laughing)

772
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560
And I was like, yeah, you're actually kinda right.

773
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,520
I was listening to disrespectful rap music

774
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,040
and it made me act disrespectful.

775
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
- Yeah.

776
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,700
- Made me act rude.

777
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,360
- When people see me talking to my girlfriend

778
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,920
like outside through the car they are always horrified because a rap song is

779
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,320
on and I'm starting an argument that I know I can win. Exactly dude, I was like I think I

780
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:24,560
listened to I was listening to some super Mario, I was listening to Superman by Eminem

781
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,680
which is a very disrespectful song. Eminem has a lot of songs disrespectful to mine.

782
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:38,160
I am this Superman where I can fly around the world the world and you gotta

783
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,640
- By me. - By Eminem.

784
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,800
- But that song is very rude and I picked her up.

785
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,560
- You were my lowest lane.

786
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,120
- Thoughts. - I thought an evil brain.

787
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,620
- Now there's kryptonite in my bed.

788
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,400
(laughing)

789
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,480
Yeah, that's scary.

790
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,280
- I have these super dreams where I can fly and things.

791
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,120
- Where I can fly and things.

792
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,720
- I have these laser beams.

793
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,120
(laughing)

794
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
- Come from my eyes. - That I can shoot from these.

795
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,040
That I can shoot from these.

796
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,240
Now my laser beams are red.

797
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,560
- Oh, okay.

798
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,200
- I have a frosty breath.

799
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,240
(laughing)

800
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
- I will avenge dad's death.

801
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,520
(laughing)

802
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
- Yeah, he's Superman.

803
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,240
- Fucking, I don't know.

804
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,360
- Yeah, man, who gives a fuck about Superman?

805
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,200
- Cares about him.

806
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,640
- Don't give a fuck about Superman.

807
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,240
- But Batman probably, yeah.

808
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,880
- I have a batarang.

809
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,080
I have a batarang.

810
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,920
- Joker.

811
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,200
- What is that song? - Won't do a thang.

812
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,880
- Are you doing Dance Dance by Fall Out Boy?

813
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,720
Is that what this is?

814
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
- No, it's also like,

815
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,760
(humming)

816
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,240
Oh yeah, 1985.

817
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,440
- Oh, that's what it was.

818
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,920
- When did Superman become a--

819
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,800
- He got a super car.

820
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,320
- When did Superman eat a--

821
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,840
- There was Mewtwo.

822
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,680
- What would Superman do in 1985?

823
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,800
- Jump and leap a building.

824
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,480
- When did Superman leap a building?

825
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah, you could do that.

826
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,160
When did Batman--

827
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,720
- Who is someone like Mewtwo that rhymes with Blondie?

828
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,000
- Yeah, I never thought about it that much,

829
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,640
but it's not that impressive that Superman

830
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,840
can leap a building 'cause he can fly.

831
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,660
- He can leap anything.

832
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,400
- He can fly over, he doesn't have to leap at all.

833
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
- He could leap a puddle.

834
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,840
- He could start in the sky,

835
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,680
he doesn't have to jump over anything.

836
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,200
- Leap fucking whatever.

837
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
There's a great scene where she kills herself

838
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,060
he saves her Jane oh by flying around the world Jane drain

839
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,700
Lois Lane Lois Lane and he says around the world no shut up he she just out of

840
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,380
the laser beams she doesn't kill herself you're the you are such a fucking

841
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:54,580
Superman moron he jumped she jumps out of the purse she wants that she wants him

842
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,980
to set to prove to her that she's Superman or that he's Superman or she

843
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
knows and shows he falls out of the window

844
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
*laughing*

845
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
*screaming*

846
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Shut up! I'm almost talking!

847
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Caleb, you've been like close to crying this whole episode

848
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
*laughing*

849
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
She falls out of the building

850
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
Guys, the best part is, she falls out of the building

851
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,980
and he jumps down

852
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,980
*laughing*

853
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,980
So is that so hard to say?

854
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Caleb, is that so hard to say?

855
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Superman rescues

856
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,980
*laughing*

857
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I swear on my fucking mom's grave, Superman rescues Lois Lane. I would swear on anything.

858
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,980
And there's something about him that she suspects.

859
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
That she either knows or has to prove.

860
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,980
Lois Lane actually loves Clark Kent so much, but also thinks that he might be Superman.

861
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,980
She has a suspicion. In the movie.

862
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Oh yeah, and I guess Clark Kent is Superman.

863
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,980
And there's actually one way for Clark Kent to prove that he's Superman is when he's doing something reckless.

864
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:04,140
so she jumps out of the building and he goes very fast all the way down and puts

865
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:15,540
her in some fruit. She lands on the fruit basket. I've seen the clip. Oh wait, you have seen that? Yeah, but he makes it look like nothing, like

866
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,380

- That was good.

878
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,300
- I couldn't see it happening though.

879
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,540
(laughing)

880
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,540

00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,700
- Oh man, what a riot.

- All right, let's read this fucking list

885
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,980
that I put together in six minutes.

886
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,140
And you can put this on the Patreon, I don't care.

887
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,300
- Pierce's new list.

888
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,300
after after the songs I just sang I don't want to advance.

889
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,300
You don't want to advance? I do not want to advance.

890
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,300
I will not be advancing.

891
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Top 10 hardest things to describe. Yeah, maybe the scene from Superman.

892
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah, I mean, Caleb, honestly, you take an L on that one.

893
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
Okay, imagine the situation, a little dark nerd humor.

894
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Imagine the situation where Bruce Kent,

895
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:18,860
Kent is not Superman in that scenario. Imagine if Clark Kent did not have the

896
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:24,100
ability to save her with the awning. Prove to me you're Superman, jump out the

897
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,580
window. Meanwhile Clark Kent is he's a normal nerd.

898
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,500
All of a sudden you have a Happy Tree Friends episode on your hands essentially.

899
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,020
Happy Tree Friends, honestly I'm not kidding, the first time I watched Happy

900
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:42,980
Tree Friends I almost vomited. I got really really sad that the Carpal Tunnel of Love by

901
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,740
Fall Out Boy is the music video is just a Happy Tree Friends episode yeah and I

902
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,060
saw that and I was like why are they doing what is wrong? They should call it

903
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,900
crappy semen the way that it's combining something that is nasty with something

904
00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:02,940
that is cute. Semen is cute? It's young sparkly yeah glistening it is young yeah

905
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:07,940
Cute things are usually young and so what's younger than semen? I guess semen is young so it's probably cute.

906
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Semen is the youngest you can be. It must be cute. I mean if you zoomed in. I guess it's younger than a baby so it must be cute.

907
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:22,940
Yeah. Yes. Yeah and I guess crap is disgusting too. No I think that semen is in the... Because it's old.

908
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,940
Because it comes out after food. Food is cute. Crap is old food. That's true.

909
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,780
There's an uncanny valley with the human development where it's from sea it starts at semen and then it gets

910
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:41,660
That starts at the valley and then as you get to the top, that's the baby and then it goes back down

911
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:47,300
Babies the top but then then why is it old like that's the adorable?

912
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:53,280
Cuz like an embryo is it goes back up when you're like a hundred and fifty yeah

913
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,340
Yeah, old people are cute again, and the middle is hot old people are not cute at all

914
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,260
Old people agree look their skin looks like paper not working, and I'm punch right through it

915
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,700
Old people the other day yeah, I bet you were yeah

916
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,140
I was thinking about how it really sucks that we can't just like

917
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,220
Completely put them somewhere

918
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:26,780
Ever's that old people should be in like we've fallen like extermination. They should go to heaven and it should just be a bouncy cloud

919
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Florida?

920
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, no, we do.

921
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I mean, that is--

922
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
But I think they should be up.

923
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I think we should be able to throw rocks at them.

924
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,620
Florida, that's a good start, but it's not mandated enough,

925
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,260
and it's too large, and it's on Earth.

926
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,420
Yeah, so you're saying that old people should be at an awning

927
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,380
that we can throw rocks and tomatoes at.

928
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,340
All old people should--

929
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,500
For all of their misdoings--

930
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,540
We should be able to fit 100 million old people

931
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,740
on the head of a pin.

932
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
Agreed.

933
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
They should be shrunken.

934
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,460
We should compress them.

935
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:50,940
Yeah.

936
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,100
No, we should compact them.

937
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,140
So that they're so dense that they have gravity.

938
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,580
OK, so we shrink them.

939
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,180
Their bones are already getting small,

940
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,780
we shrink them down downsizing situation down size exactly down and then we put

941
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,180
them all in a big glass bottle that has a ship on it and let me shake it up and

942
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,100
then yeah it's like it's an old people ant farm and let me shake it up that

943
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,460
movie downsizing was one of those movies where I thought I didn't I never saw but

944
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,460
I heard it's terrible but I honestly thought it was gonna be good because of

945
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,380
the song in the trailer and I'm sure I've heard that song why I'm that trailer of

946
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,140
of seeing that trailer in the theater

947
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,420
and like turning to my girlfriend and be like,

948
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
we should see that.

949
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,300
And her be like, what are you talking about?

950
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,980
- Just 'cause it has like a good song.

951
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
- I looked at it and I was like,

952
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,300
there's something about that trailer

953
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,260
where the first time you watch it,

954
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,100
you're like, oh yeah.

955
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,860
- Oh yeah, I can see that being fun.

956
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,700
- That could be cool.

957
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,520
(singing)

958
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,900
- Downsizing.

959
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,420
- We should listen to this movie.

960
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,300
(singing)

961
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,420
- You will find yourself.

962
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,900
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

963
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,340
- And the days go by.

964
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,180
- What are you talking about?

965
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,300
That was like the most like,

966
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,980
there was like a big like talking heads like,

967
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
I don't even know what man that is, man.

968
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,820
There's like, in 2014, in 2014, everyone like,

969
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,780
God, I guess maybe people my age,

970
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,060
everyone was like, oh, like, the docking heads

971
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,340
are like one of the best bands in the world.

972
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,700
I'm gonna docking heads with you.

973
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,340
Yeah, I'm gonna dock my penis head into your nose hole.

974
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,820
Yeah. My nose.

975
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,660
Hole.

976
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,980
Your nose hole, I changed it up, flipped the script.

977
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
'Cause I called him out halfway through him

978
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,980
stealing my line.

979
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,820
You have to admire his adaptability.

980
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,500
Your adaptability, yes, his adaptability is impressive.

981
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,580
Give him some points for adaptability.

982
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,940
- Okay, he gets five or six points.

983
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,540
- Okay, good, five or six points to me, Pat.

984
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,420
- I'm gonna squirt a nut in your nose.

985
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,540
- Zero. - They've been removed.

986
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,500
- Yeah. - They've been completely

987
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,340
removed. - Okay.

988
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,180
- Yeah, you went too far. - It's a similar thing.

989
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,020
- It's similar, it's similar. - That's being expressed.

990
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,700
- It's actually similar. - Yeah.

991
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,180
- All right, top 10 hardest things to describe.

992
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,660
- This is scientist-esque, Peter looks at something

993
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
and says, "I think this is similar."

994
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,380
- I think this is similar.

995
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,300
This is similar.

996
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,500
These two things are similar.

997
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,060
Moving on.

998
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,180
All right, what do you guys think about water

999
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,220
being hard to explain?

1000
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,180
- I feel like I could easily explain it.

1001
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,020
- Yeah.

1002
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,220
- Soda with no bubbles and clear.

1003
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,540
And no flavor.

1004
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,700
Flavorless water. - I guess I would say--

1005
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,420
- Anyone who can-- - It's this.

1006
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,220
- Yeah, look here. - That is what I would say,

1007
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,380
a bottle. - But anybody--

1008
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,780
- No! - I would say anybody

1009
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,500
that you have to explain water to

1010
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,860
is not worth talking to. - Exactly.

1011
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,460
- I think anyone who can understand anything,

1012
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,660
water's the first thing they learn.

1013
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,500
- Yeah, exactly.

1014
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,260
- Yeah, like Helen Keller learned wah-wah.

1015
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,580
That was like her big word. - She is.

1016
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,780
- Wah-wah was her big word? - Yeah, she was from Philly.

1017
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,500
(laughing)

1018
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,700
- Wah-wah? - Her big word was wah-wah.

1019
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,420
That's the end, the final scene of Miracle Workers.

1020
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,380
- Why did they teach her,

1021
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,060
I thought she could like read and write.

1022
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,420
- Why do they, we're gonna teach her to say wah-wah.

1023
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,260
- Why not teach her to use the next word?

1024
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,900
- The next word, the next word.

1025
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,140
- Wah-wah, then hokey.

1026
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,980
- She's a full adult, they're like, okay.

1027
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,820
- Wah-wah.

1028
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,580
- This is wah-wah.

1029
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,340
- That's how they taught her, they talked to her.

1030
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,180
- This is gaga.

1031
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,220
- Well, she was running around the house just going, wah!

1032
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,340
And they were like, we have to teach her a new word.

1033
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,180
- We have to hand her something.

1034
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,100
- Say wah and then wah again.

1035
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,020
- Man, that honestly is like a complete, impossible word,

1036
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,740
it's an impossible quiz question to me,

1037
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,180
is how did they make her talk?

1038
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,740
- Well, so the misunderstanding about Helen Keller

1039
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,980
is that she was just Frankenstein,

1040
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,700
that she was just running around.

1041
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,780
I think that's what everyone thinks,

1042
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,620
is that she was just running around.

1043
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,220
- That's what I think, yeah.

1044
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,060
- Yeah.

1045
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,740
- She could kinda see and she could kinda hear,

1046
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,820
and she was just like.

1047
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,980
- Yeah, well she was like,

1048
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,140
she got like scarlet fever as a baby, right?

1049
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,980
And then it like fucked up her vision and her.

1050
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,140
- She has a permanent cloudy brain.

1051
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,980
- Yeah.

1052
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:24,860
around the house and like sewing and she wasn't just but I do think about like a

1053
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,940
boy Helen Keller a lot and that would be what he would be go because he think it

1054
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,860
was funny yeah just running through a pain glass door yeah he's holding it

1055
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:42,180
you know oh my friend god damn oh he's my friend I can't do that like that just a

1056
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,940
minute I think it stopped work I think it's when you shook your friggin arms

1057
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
around like a Elmo.

1058
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Just take this for a minute.

1059
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,940
Water. Well...

1060
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Shake your arms around like when Kermit gets excited.

1061
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,940
Well, it's like wet nothing.

1062
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,940
Okay, don't shake your arms around like Frankenstein anymore.

1063
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,940
No more steining.

1064
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,940
Water is well like wet nothing.

1065
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,940
Unless you want to go into the chemical compositions,

1066
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,940
which I don't.

1067
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
It's very complex.

1068
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
It's apparently... it's tripartite.

1069
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,940
I don't want to go any further than that.

1070
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,940
I like this username here.

1071
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,340
- B-boy making with the freak.

1072
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,480
(laughing)

1073
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,940
B-boy making with the freak.

1074
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,820
- What does B-boy making with the freak say, Pat?

1075
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,820
- A clear, flavorless liquid

1076
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,600
that makes up 70% of your body.

1077
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,800
Also, it's fun to say.

1078
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,420
- Is water that fun to say?

1079
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,140
Some people do have a funny way of--

1080
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,980
- When I was a kid-- - You say "wooder"?

1081
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,780
- I said "wooder" because my grandfather was from New Jersey

1082
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,220
and I never said it like that, but that's how he says it.

1083
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,060
But then one day I was like--

1084
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,500
- That must be a South Jersey thing.

1085
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
- I was like, you know what,

1086
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,460
I'm gonna start talking like Pete.

1087
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,180
And then I started going "wooder"

1088
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,540
And then my mom was like, "Why are you talking like that?"

1089
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,340
And I was like, "Eh, it's granddad.

1090
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
"He basically rubbed off on me."

1091
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,420
- Yeah, it's like when, like,

1092
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,380
I didn't have a Boston accent as a kid

1093
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,980
and then I tried to pick it up.

1094
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,380
- You ever have the guy who has

1095
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,360
the really specific speech impediment

1096
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,380
that only really smart people have,

1097
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,060
where they say "wather"?

1098
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,300
Like, "wather"? - Wather?

1099
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,140
What?

1100
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,740
- This tiny little wisp that--

1101
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,580
- Wather?

1102
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,420
They also have a wisp.

1103
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,740
- They have a tiny wisp, but they don't--

1104
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,460
- Really smart people?

1105
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:16,300
- Yeah, like autistic people have a certain kind of lisp

1106
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,580
that no one else has and it's like a lateral lisp

1107
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,060
but only in the middle of words on T.

1108
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,900
- And you say water? - It's like a soft T.

1109
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,060
- Do you have any other word examples?

1110
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,220
Thistle?

1111
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,780
- No, I don't know what that is.

1112
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,020
It's just a word that begins with T-H.

1113
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,560
Oh, Harry Potter.

1114
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,620
- Harry Potter?

1115
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,100
- Right, so usually, very smart people

1116
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,940
usually talk about Harry Potter.

1117
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,660
- Yeah, I love Harry Potter.

1118
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,500
- I love Harry Potter.

1119
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,340
- Harry Potter is my favorite book.

1120
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,260
I love Harry Potter and I love the scene where he goes in the water

1121
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:53,940
The gifted kids you remember the same sentences like this no

1122
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,100
Okay, this may have been why I was not in a single gifted class

1123
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,980
I got kicked out of get six. I said it was too hard. Yeah. Yeah, you're right

1124
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,540
I got kicked out of my slow class because I

1125
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:10,940
Being too funny. Yeah, which is that you got some good competition. I know it's me

1126
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:17,020
is my math concepts class where we made a tortilla covered in cinnamon sugar oh

1127
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,820
yeah you've talked about that talked about it before as me and four other

1128
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:29,540
kids paper is the stuff that's usually used to write usually well as I'd say

1129
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:36,140
it's flatter than anything it's flatter than God it's flatter than goddamn

1130
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,100
- Damn, that's what I would say.

1131
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,940
- Yeah.

1132
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,780
- If I had a cigar, I was a military.

1133
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,940
- Paper's flat as fuck.

1134
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,520
- It's flat as all fuck.

1135
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,660
- It's like if a big fat guy sat on a normal sized thing.

1136
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,500
- On a woman.

1137
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,340
- On a white cube.

1138
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,160
(laughing)

1139
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,320
- Imagine a white cube that you can write all over,

1140
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,060
and then a big fat guy just sits on it.

1141
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,420
- One pane of a white cube.

1142
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,180
- I would say it's the opposite of a pencil.

1143
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,020
- One plane.

1144
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:01,840
(laughing)

1145
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,680
- It's not the opposite.

1146
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,500
- It's the opposite of a pencil.

1147
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,340
- That's how I would explain it though.

1148
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,720
- You're right, yeah, you're right.

1149
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,300
- It's a slice.

1150
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,140
- It's a slice of a tree.

1151
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,600
- It's a slice of paper.

1152
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,600
- Did I tell you about my math teacher in sixth grade

1153
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,980
used to say, "Fresh slice of paper."

1154
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,460
And he would lick his lips like that.

1155
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,740
I've definitely talked about my sixth grade math teacher.

1156
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,660
- I think you have told me that before.

1157
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,220
- Yeah, the deluxe hugs guy.

1158
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,100
- Oh yeah, you've talked a lot about deluxe hugs.

1159
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,340
Never got one, by the way.

1160
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,540
- If I say like, "Oh yeah, my math teacher in sixth grade

1161
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:38,060
usually give me deluxe hugs with like no context sounds like I got no context

1162
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,020
folks our slash no context that's gonna get sounds like I got molestered this

1163
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,900
one isn't that good the internet we'll just say it well it's the internet and

1164
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,380
then read it well to say it's an amazing and horribly addicting worldwide

1165
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,740
communication is a pretty fair description to me

1166
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,980
I would say it's what's in the computer. It's the

1167
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:08,960
Fucking evil that's good. I would maybe I would say it's the magic that binds these devices right yeah, I can do a wizard

1168
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,240
It's basically water. It's like magic. Yeah, okay, so imagine

1169
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:21,480
Imagine everything on this list is being described to a wizard right traveled in time well

1170
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,180
Then I don't know I would say it's like what happens when you do the spell internetus

1171
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,020
I would say I would say why are you why am I explaining jack shit to a wizard?

1172
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:36,500
Explain explain jack shit right now to turn my sister and explain what Jackson is jack shit is when I

1173
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,540
Don't know actually

1174
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,260
Jackson is like fuck all

1175
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,020
But what's fuck all?

1176
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:46,420
You know you know what actually I would do if I was explaining any of these to a wizard as I would say

1177
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,100
Understandus and then he would understand it. Yeah

1178
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:57,280
Knowledge, knowledge abyss. Or I would make tell him you should use understandus on yourself. Knowledge abyss. Knowledge abyss is good too.

1179
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,280
What is that? Go back to jack shit?

1180
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,780
What?

1181
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Anything at all. Hmm.

1182
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Jack shit.

1183
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,780
You made it Tom.

1184
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,780
Jack shit. Jack shit. Jack shit. Jack shit.

1185
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,780
Jack shit.

1186
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,780
Number four is colors.

1187
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,780
Colors are indescribable. They're not indescribable.

1188
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,920
indescribable red looks red looks well red red looks like a combination you can

1189
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,740
point it should yeah orange but to a blind guy I guess you have to say colors

1190
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:35,320
are impossible to explain or a smell right but it's that's all I would say

1191
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,260
but it uses light yeah which is a concept and an energy what can you taste

1192
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,460
purple yeah if you have a purple candy what's that thing called synesthesia

1193
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,140
yeah so that is fucking only geniuses have that yeah what is what color is

1194
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,420
three oh three is orange for me it's yellow because P rhymes with yellow

1195
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:02,140
everything is yellow and three runs with P and three runs with P three is black

1196
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:10,580
on a white background yeah yeah all right I have that with like skateboard

1197
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,860
tricks though to me like a tray flip is green to me red is a color purple okay I

1198
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:20,420
wish that all skateboard tricks were red and yeah yeah that's a kickflip

1199
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,780
kickflips are red he'll flips are blue you read pretty soon would you be

1200
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:32,140
fucking so terrifyingly sad if you died in a skateboarding trick yeah not even

1201
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,540
really an accident like just like you just died in a trick yeah I tried I

1202
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,820
finally one day try to like jump down a stairs has anyone died during a trick

1203
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:47,140
yeah who never oh no no Jake Brown almost died so nobody has them not during a

1204
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,980
trick cuz doesn't the trick last for the time that you're in the air yeah like so

1205
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,340
you could have a heart attack in the middle of it yeah but has that happened

1206
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,740
Patrick who has died during a trick there has to be so I know there's

1207
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,020
somebody there has to be somebody there's got to be somebody has round

1208
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,020
- Like, uh, what's that? - 2007 X Games.

1209
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,020
- Lin Bias, that basketball player, died on the court.

1210
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,020
- Oof. Could be like that.

1211
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,020
- Has there ever been-- - There's definitely somebody, it's probably not, like, it's probably just like some local, like,

1212
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,020
- Probably X Games, I would imagine. - Big-ass ramp.

1213
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,020
- No, there's been no deaths, there's been near death at the X Games.

1214
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,020
- There's been near death experiences. - Near death experiences, yeah.

1215
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,020
- Yeah. - That's none of the--

1216
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,020
- I was there, I saw an angel, I jumped high enough that I saw an angel and a beam of light.

1217
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,860
The near-death experience is like it was always like the X Games it was like

1218
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,380
motocross near-death experience then skateboarding so if you are you saying

1219
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,860
it's like an event at the X Games? No, that's what you're saying. I was also

1220
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,460
completely spaced out I didn't realize you were talking. Oh you were having a

1221
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:54,300
near-death experience? I was looking at my arm. Yeah. Oh were you? Anything new? I thought I was

1222
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,100
wearing a watch but I'm not and I was like it feels like I'm wearing a watch I

1223
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,180
I looked down, I'm not wearing a watch.

1224
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,020
- That's a near death experience.

1225
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,260
- I wasn't checking the time or anything,

1226
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,860
I just was like, I wonder if I'm wearing a watch.

1227
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,860
- Yeah, you feel the world's tiniest

1228
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,580
phantom vibration every second.

1229
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,580
- No, I just felt like there was a watch on my wrist.

1230
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,060
- Yeah, you feel the phantom vibration

1231
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,100
of the second hand moving?

1232
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,940
- No, just like the feeling of a watch.

1233
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,780
- Okay.

1234
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,620
- Like something on your wrist.

1235
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,440
- Yeah.

1236
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,280
- Okay, the round part.

1237
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,020
- Caleb, do you like that part of wearing a watch

1238
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,940
is feeling the second hand move?

1239
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,460
- On my digital watch, motherfucker?

1240
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,300
- Oh, swag.

1241
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,100
- Yeah, shut up, man.

1242
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,620
I've never had a ticker. Oh somebody has died doing a skateboard trick.

1243
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:36,180
Oh, you just knew that for no reason right now. Yeah. Oh, I was about to look up has anybody died. Who was it?

1244
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:38,740
Yeah, some people have died like bombing hills

1245
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:44,300
Yeah, I think that that's a little more dangerous than a normal trick

1246
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,980
Yeah

1247
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,940
Yeah, somebody it's like somebody in San Francisco got like hit by a car. That's actually really did with the press

1248
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,940
I mean, it just really depressed me

1249
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:02,140
That made me so sad thinking about that thing about somebody dying think about somebody dying like we're skateboarding cuz it's like you were

1250
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,480
That's so sad never seen you

1251
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,100
Be like this about death. Yeah, I think about how much fun

1252
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,520
It would be to die doing what you love going fast. I know that's what's so depressing about it

1253
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,900
You know what's depressing is dying a loser getting shot in the brain by a stranger for cash. Yeah

1254
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,300
Yeah, you know what sucks is dying in a fire

1255
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,220
freaking dying in a fire

1256
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,460
We're dying by

1257
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,780
You're the hand of your loved one. Oh my god. That's sad unless you okay

1258
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,740
This is brought my spirits back up because this sounds like my ass

1259
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,260
This is how you would describe it to someone who's never eaten before

1260
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,700
Food is the nicest thing in the world

1261
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:57,660
Is that why sure is that what triple like 3xs it means like pornography and stuff is all kisses no hugs

1262
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,820
It's because you end up saying sex twice

1263
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:07,740
X there's a lot of hugging in port really hard and they barely touch mouths to each other. Yeah

1264
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,340
Not a lot of eye contact

1265
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:15,260
Not in the porn. I watch I only watch the Cinemax porn. Yeah

1266
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,660
They kiss way too much in the cinematics porn man. There used to be one called bikini Frankenstein. He said jack off there was a

1267
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,300
No, Frank is on the entire show a lot of bikinis. I caught I think

1268
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:33,860
the teeny bikini the ghost in the teeny bikini yeah parody of ghost in the shell vibes I

1269
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,540
Caught my brother watching that

1270
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:43,060
Okay, go go back. Oh, I guess she acts a little bit like Frankenstein

1271
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,400
Yeah, but I also didn't have any of the sound on

1272
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:56,480
- So food and then we can just movies in a pretty difficult to explain it's real

1273
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,080
life sounds like the internet on a movie that's what it's like a window window

1274
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,280
window okay but how do you explain cuts it's like two windows where you switch

1275
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,800
the windows it's like watching a window and you're looking into a different

1276
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,400
window yes yeah yes yes yeah there's music and this is what I like to hear

1277
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,760
yeah it's like TV it's like TV longer yeah it's like four to five times as

1278
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,160
long as it is longer yeah the screen is longer the length you know what I love

1279
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,840
it in a theater you know the best part of the Simpsons movie is is when it goes

1280
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:36,360
from normal screen to widescreen yes oh that's good oh and then wait doesn't

1281
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,080
- Doesn't Professor-- - Finkel?

1282
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,400
- Yeah, doesn't he say something?

1283
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,240
- Does that his name?

1284
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,520
- On the big screen! - On the big screen!

1285
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,720
- Movie on the big screen! - Movie on the big screen!

1286
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
- Yeah, he does say that.

1287
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,560
He does say that.

1288
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,380
- Yeah.

1289
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,220
- Yeah.

1290
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,680
- And Homer goes, "Especially you!"

1291
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,880
And he points into the--

1292
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,720
- He points at my mom.

1293
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,860
- Remember, we're doing a Remember show today,

1294
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,920
but you guys remember the Simpsons 4D?

1295
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,760
- Yeah.

1296
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,560
- Remember how many bugs there were in that movie?

1297
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,400
- Yeah.

1298
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,040
- Simpsons 4D is a ride-- - Scary bugs and smells.

1299
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,840
- It's a ride at Broadway at the beach in Myrtle Beach.

1300
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,560
It's like a 40 experience thing where they do,

1301
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,880
they like spray water on you, they shake your seat,

1302
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:09,760
and they have all these effects,

1303
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,920
and they clearly had an effect.

1304
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,920
They have the effect where it feels like bugs or mice

1305
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,760
are running over your feet,

1306
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,000
where it does a little blast of air.

1307
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,840
- Yeah.

1308
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,320
- And they clearly couldn't think of enough uses of it,

1309
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,480
because in the Simpsons 40,

1310
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,640
there are probably seven to 10 scenes of bugs

1311
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,920
jumping out at the screen.

1312
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,760
- Yeah.

1313
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,160
- Swarming home with eyeballs.

1314
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,760
- We're just talking about it being like,

1315
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,160
there are, there are no bugs in the show.

1316
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,000
(laughing)

1317
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,480
There's never once been a bug on screen in The Simpsons.

1318
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,360
In The Simpsons 4D, they have probably 1,000 bugs.

1319
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,320
There's a lot of bugs.

1320
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,080
The most bugs in a Simpsons episode.

1321
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,640
By far.

1322
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,440
Also, that was fun because the guy who ran it was blind.

1323
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,120
And you could tell he was blind.

1324
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,440
But we didn't talk about it.

1325
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,640
And I was sitting in the--

1326
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,900
I could barely even focus on the movie

1327
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,640
because I was so excited to tell you guys

1328
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,440
that I noticed he was blind.

1329
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,060
And we got out, and I mean, he was like,

1330
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,880
that guy was actually blind at the beginning.

1331
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,680
Did you guys notice?

1332
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,640
And he was like, no.

1333
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,520
We all noticed.

1334
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,980
Didn't say anything I was I didn't know it was weird. I was really excited to tell you guys that I think he's blind

1335
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,840
No, I had a duff

1336
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,800
Soda oh wait

1337
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:25,520
He did have really small I did have tiny little shorts and then Pierce said he was a werewolf or something

1338
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,360
- Huh?

1339
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,180
- Maybe I made that up.

1340
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,020
- I remember the name.

1341
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,020
(laughing)

1342
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,160
- I think Pierce did something werewolf-ish.

1343
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,000
- We gotta go back, man.

1344
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,840
- Yeah, I love her to be.

1345
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,660
- Yeah, I really do.

1346
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,460
- You got schooled by a group of little kids.

1347
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,000
- They were so much bigger than me.

1348
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,200
(laughing)

1349
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,560
They said, "Dem some girly shorts."

1350
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,400
- Whoa, really?

1351
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,240
- It's rude.

1352
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,040
Rude-ass kids these days, man.

1353
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,880
(laughing)

1354
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,320
Love is hard to explain.

1355
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,640
- Can we, we don't have to do this.

1356
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,360
- I wanna know.

1357
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,200
I wanna know.

1358
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,020
Love's hard to explain.

1359
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,380
- No, love, something that can hurt us

1360
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,860
or make us feel like someone special

1361
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,380
or that we are really important.

1362
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,820
Love can be in various ways,

1363
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,220
friendship, romance, or in a family way.

1364
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,900
Love can take time to appear,

1365
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,300
but when it does, you might feel a sensation.

1366
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,260
Totally unique that makes us feel the universe

1367
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,980
and the most powerful feeling ever.

1368
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,180
Love can change the world.

1369
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,380
- Facts. - Yeah.

1370
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,540
- I agree. - I fucking love love.

1371
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,620
- Speaking of synesthesia, I think that love is like red

1372
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,500
and pink and maybe a heart shape.

1373
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,300
- With white frills around the edges.

1374
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,140
- And if I had to do a shape, I'd go with heart shape.

1375
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,220
- I don't know why, but to me it tastes like chocolate.

1376
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,180
- Yeah, or a sweet heart-shaped candy.

1377
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,780
- Or a chocolate-covered strawberry.

1378
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,100
- Here's my Neil deGrasse Tyson shit, okay?

1379
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,260
So yeah, love can change the world, 'cause anything can.

1380
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,620
'Cause everything is a thing.

1381
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,980
- Fuck, man. - Yeah, because love is--

1382
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,780
- Everything's a thing. - Everything is matter.

1383
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,860
- Neil deGrasse Tyson, actually,

1384
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,860
technically, everything is a thing.

1385
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,180
- It is. - Things can do things.

1386
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,260
- That's pretty good. - But, when we get

1387
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,020
into things that aren't things,

1388
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,660
that's when it gets very interesting.

1389
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,100
- Some things are things, other things are not things.

1390
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,940
Have you guys seen any of the interviews that Rogan did with him?

1391
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,940
Where he just interrupts him and screams at him.

1392
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,940
It's so funny! Neil deGrasse Tyson will be like, listening, he'll be like,

1393
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,940
"Scientists, like Plato, and Aristotle, Albert Einstein."

1394
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,940
And he'll be like, Rogan will be like, "Carl Sagan."

1395
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,940
He'll just, "No, no, no, no, no."

1396
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,440
It's so funny, dude. He fucking hates him.

1397
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
It's so awesome.

1398
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Yeah, I feel like--

1399
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
They just had him on Theo Vaughn's podcast.

1400
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,440
God bless Theo Vaughn.

1401
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,440
Oh yeah, I think Joe Rogan was like, "Why don't we take the salt out of the ocean?"

1402
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:26,440
and Neil deGrasse Tyson was like, "We can, but Joe, Joe, it costs money."

1403
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,440
And Joe's like, "Yeah, I guess so, but how much money?"

1404
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,440
And then Neil goes, "Think about it. Does it cost more money than doing it the way we're doing it now,

1405
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,440
or does it cost less? I think it costs more."

1406
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
He has an answer for everything, dude.

1407
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
Money is a thing.

1408
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,440
It's how he talks. He also, it's very funny.

1409
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,440
Water is a thing. Salt is a thing.

1410
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:53,040
funny to be to be like now doing all these like podcasts and shit because

1411
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,160
like that's all he does now because he got accused of being like a creep yeah

1412
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,560
that's like he gets accused of being a creep two years ago goes on Rogan like

1413
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,120
ten times in two years yeah and just blabbers about nothing instead of having

1414
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,360
his awesome animated show yeah what I like about a guy like that is always

1415
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:16,000
like I'm there there's scientists they're not like it's not like oh I I

1416
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,720
I know about like gravity and astrophysics.

1417
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,000
Like I'm weighing in on everything.

1418
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,320
- Yeah. - I'm doing it all.

1419
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,160
- Show me the beakers.

1420
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,280
- If you say something about plants,

1421
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,760
I'm calling you out on that.

1422
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,600
I don't study plants, but I, you know,

1423
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,880
plants are actually, they're green because of chlorophyll.

1424
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,720
Just so you know.

1425
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,760
(laughing)

1426
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,040
- He's a genius. - My job is space.

1427
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:35,880
- He's a super genius.

1428
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,960
Yeah, wasn't his entire job, he worked on a telescope?

1429
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,160
- It's gonna cost a lot of money to take salt out of the ocean.

1430
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,280
- Or no, he worked at like a fucking planetarium

1431
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,240
or something. - Yeah.

1432
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,400
- Probably handling like when they would do

1433
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,680
a Metallica light show.

1434
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,180
- He would program the lights.

1435
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,500
- How did he get as big as he did?

1436
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,340
- Funny face.

1437
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,180
- It's like working, it's like--

1438
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,580
- Oh, that was after.

1439
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,420
- No.

1440
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,620
- It's like a guy who works at Wendy's or something

1441
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,260
and he goes and orders at McDonald's and he's like,

1442
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:59,740
just so you know, that's not how you make

1443
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,700
the Wendy's square burgers.

1444
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,540
- Yeah.

1445
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,980
- Those are supposed to be square.

1446
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,820
- He's a man, dude.

1447
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,640
- I love him.

1448
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,480
- He's cool.

1449
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,180
- Love is gravity.

1450
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,020
- Numbers.

1451
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,500
What is numbers?

1452
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Numbers is numbers.

1453
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,660
- Numbers is numbers.

1454
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,500
- Yep.

1455
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,940
you describe it. Don't you dare say seven eight nine right now. Yeah imagine my

1456
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,260
finger doesn't exist but the thing that my finger is representing does exist. How

1457
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:27,020
many of my finger is there? One? That's a number. How did you know that?

1458
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,700
I was gonna say. One two three four. I would say one two three four five and six.

1459
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:37,100
But this is I would say this is maybe the first time that this has to be this does

1460
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,260
have to be explained to people. People get numbers explained to them all the time.

1461
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,740
Yeah as soon as you're a baby. It's not like water you don't have to explain water that much.

1462
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:48,040
but I think you are you recognize that you just need a word for it I think this

1463
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:55,800
is how I would you just have to and then look so to put your put your mug next to

1464
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:01,620
my mug so this is some okay so the things that the thing that the puddings

1465
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:09,740
and the mugs have in common is - but you what's also - is when your cup when you

1466
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,580
- When you hold something.

1467
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,060
- It's not the sarcophagus.

1468
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,780
- When you hold a brown thing in it.

1469
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,620
- Okay.

1470
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,820
- Oh yeah, two is the brown color.

1471
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,660
- Once we get--

1472
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,700
- Oh, it's words.

1473
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,740
- They have words on them.

1474
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,940
- Once we get rid of everything

1475
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,260
that is similar about these things--

1476
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,140
- Oh, uncovered--

1477
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:24,180
- Wait, wait, wait, okay, see how they're similar now.

1478
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,020
- Oh, on the table.

1479
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,980
- Now they're dissimilar.

1480
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,460
- Right, oh right, now the thing that was similar

1481
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,660
about them is no longer similar.

1482
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:31,980
- Yes, I see.

1483
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,820
- Right.

1484
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,460
- So two means when it's in the room with me.

1485
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,700
- This is what, when you guys have beautiful kids,

1486
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,140
this is what Uncle Pierce will help out

1487
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,060
- I like his teaching numbers and things like that.

1488
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,060
- Yeah, thank you.

1489
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,140
- I feel like you would scare my kids.

1490
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,700
- I don't want you to teach my kids anything.

1491
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,580
- What the heck?

1492
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:50,900
You guys can do whatever you want to my kids.

1493
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,260
- But I feel like you would be like the kind of like

1494
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,620
guy who goes like, "Bah!" at the kids all the time.

1495
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,540
- Yeah. - What's wrong with that?

1496
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:57,380
- I mean, it's fine.

1497
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:58,460
- That's what I do. - You need to know to fear.

1498
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,940
- Yeah, I know, these two I think are dangerous.

1499
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,780
- What are you talking about? - I'm an amazing uncle.

1500
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,980
- I'm an amazing uncle too. - I almost got my nephew

1501
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,500
an iron.

1502
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,100
No, you just videoed him talking about it.

1503
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,940
You almost gave a fact shit.

1504
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,780
And then you lied about it.

1505
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,740
You're gonna give him Truman Show Syndrome.

1506
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:13,580
He's gonna grow up and be like,

1507
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,380
"I was on a TV show about an iron."

1508
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,220
Yeah.

1509
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,300
(laughing)

1510
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,220
Are we over time?

1511
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,060
I mean, we can't finish this much.

1512
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,780
No, chill, bro.

1513
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,700
All right, I have to go soon, that's all.

1514
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,620
What do you have to do?

1515
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,700
I have to go to a meeting.

1516
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,540
What meeting?

1517
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,360
I have to meet you.

1518
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,200
For the show tonight?

1519
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,900
No!

1520
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:32,920
How about you eat some meat?

1521
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,760
We can go have a lunch.

1522
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:34,980
I'll have some meetings with you guys.

1523
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,060
- I actually am pretty hungry.

1524
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,100
- Yeah, I'm pretty hungry.

1525
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,540
Well, let's zoom through this list real quick.

1526
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,980
We got the universe, again, easy to explain.

1527
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,780
- Watch out, we got a universe over here.

1528
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,380
(laughing)

1529
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,340
- It's that simple.

1530
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:48,820
It's so easy.

1531
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,540
- All right, let's blow through the rest of these doing that.

1532
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:52,380
- Okay.

1533
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,740
- Watch out, we got a reality over here.

1534
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,940
- Wait, he has a great face for it.

1535
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,380
Look at that, he looks just like him.

1536
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,220
- Yeah.

1537
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,380
- If you did the line art, it would be it.

1538
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,980
- Yeah, you should do a science show called Guess How.

1539
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:05,820
- Hmm.

1540
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,660
(laughing)

1541
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,860
- Guess how this works.

1542
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,700
- Right.

1543
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,520
- No, that's too long.

1544
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,740
- How does this get guessed?

1545
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:11,880
How does this guess?

1546
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:12,720
- Reality.

1547
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,540
- VR guessed.

1548
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:14,380
- Who's guessing?

1549
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,220
- Video game development.

1550
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,020
- Oh, that is hard, that is really hard.

1551
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,860
- That's difficult.

1552
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,680
- Yeah, that one's tough.

1553
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,100
- I would probably say I guess it's what happens

1554
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,940
before the game.

1555
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,780
- A video game.

1556
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:22,600
(laughing)

1557
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,440
- It's how it gets made.

1558
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,280
- Yeah.

1559
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,100
- Yeah.

1560
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,940
- It's how, it's who makes it.

1561
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,780
- It's really hard to explain,

1562
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,500
but know that a video game needs some period.

1563
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,060
- This is something a video game needs.

1564
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,560
I'm playing charades.

1565
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,660
- All right, we all-- - We're taboo.

1566
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,860
- I didn't say. - The Grand Canyon,

1567
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,060
a place that is five hours from Vegas,

1568
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,420
but Asian tour buses force you to go here

1569
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,020
because old Asian people like looking at boring scenery

1570
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,280
more than holes with fountains, volcanoes,

1571
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,260
and a fake Eiffel, oh, hotels with fountains,

1572
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,740
volcanoes, and a fake Eiffel Tower.

1573
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,380
- It's only five hours away.

1574
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,940
- Wait, what? - I gotta get a tour bus

1575
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,260
in Colorado, why are they taking me to Las Vegas?

1576
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:55,340
- Yeah. - Also, yeah,

1577
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,580
why are you getting on a tour bus

1578
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:59,060
if you're just trying to get to Vegas, dude?

1579
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,180
- Take a plane, or a train, or your car.

1580
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,340
- Just don't get on a tour bus.

1581
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,540
- I'm so glad this is on here.

1582
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:06,320
It's cool to know that people can't explain this,

1583
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,420
'cause I can't explain it.

1584
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,260
- Yeah.

1585
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,180
- I can explain it.

1586
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,020
- Well that guy did.

1587
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,180
- A big lump with knobs.

1588
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:12,020
- Yeah.

1589
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:12,860
- Mm.

1590
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:13,680
- Mm.

1591
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,520
- Mm.

1592
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,360
- That's not what it would be.

1593
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,180
- Corn, mm.

1594
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,460
- It is an inverse of that.

1595
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,300
It's a reverse lump.

1596
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,700
- It's small lump.

1597
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,900
- It's a large nump with--

1598
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,740
- Lobs.

1599
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:24,660
- Lobs.

1600
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,100
- Yes.

1601
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,940
- I guess there is a nump.

1602
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:27,860
- Yeah.

1603
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,780
- That kid is so stupid.

1604
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,940
A big, it's not big, it's a piece of corn.

1605
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,100
- Yeah, it's hardly a lump.

1606
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:32,940
- No.

1607
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:33,760
- It definitely has knobs,

1608
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,460
but he should have said a piece of corn.

1609
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:36,300
- Yeah.

1610
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,140
- It's a piece of corn.

1611
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,060
- It's impossible to explain a piece of corn.

1612
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,280
- Yeah.

1613
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,180
- Yeah, well everyone thought corn was hard to explain

1614
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,540
until that kid came along.

1615
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,380
- True.

1616
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,200
- And he kind of cracked the cone.

1617
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,040
- He nailed it.

1618
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,940
- He cracked the cone, if you will.

1619
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,580
- 17 justice.

1620
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,340
That was not so.

1621
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,460
- It's the opposite of injustice.

1622
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,920
- Yeah, well.

1623
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,820
(laughing)

1624
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:56,940
- A little clown.

1625
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,260
- No, he's not little.

1626
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,180
Gravity.

1627
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,180
- It takes you down.

1628
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,180
- Equals MC squared.

1629
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:03,020
- So, music.

1630
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,140
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1631
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:05,980
In what order?

1632
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,060
- It makes you dance.

1633
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,900
It sounds like this.

1634
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:09,820
♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah ♪

1635
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,740
- I have one way to describe music.

1636
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,740
♪ Oh yeah ♪

1637
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,620
And also,

1638
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,700
(beatboxing)

1639
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,280
- No, that's crap.

1640
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,860
- Yeah, that's a rhythm, not music.

1641
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,900
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

1642
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,740
But what makes music?

1643
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,820
- The end, I think.

1644
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,820
- Rhythm and motion, or sounds.

1645
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:29,100
Okay, well, Pierce, thank you for coming on.

1646
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,460
You can eat your snack pack now if you'd like.

1647
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,300
- All right. - Yeah, you can do your thing.

1648
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,940
- Do you have anything you wanted to tell anybody

1649
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,060
about our plugin anyway?

1650
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:37,580
- No, not yet. - No, no, no, he's not.

1651
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,260
No, no, no, no, no, no, thank you.

1652
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,420
Okay, goodbye.

1653
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,940
Goodbye, no, no, no, that's enough of you.

1654
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,700
No, that's enough of that snack pack.

1655
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:48,540
And we're not having any of these.

1656
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,380
What?

1657
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,940
- I was trying to show off how liquidy it got under the heat.

1658
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,100
- Don't do it again.

1659
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,940
What are you doing?

1660
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,780
It's trying to ruin the table.

1661
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,180
Under the heat. What heat do we have here?

1662
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,180
Oh god, dude.

1663
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,180
He's eating it.

1664
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:03,180
You can't even see it. You're doing it in the worst...

1665
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,180
Ugh.

1666
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,180
Now, someone's got a macchiato.

1667
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,180
No, it's over. It's over.

1668
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,180
It's more over than it's ever been.

1669
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,180
It's over.

1670
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,180
...podcast about List, including Jubio and Patches.

1671
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,180
A happy

1672
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,180
season.

1673
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,180
Holiday greeting. Bye bye!
