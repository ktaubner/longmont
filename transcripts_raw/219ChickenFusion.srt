1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(farting)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:11,680
- See I'm getting better at making fake farts.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,340
- So listen to one sound, listen to a sound right now.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,600
(farting)

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,160
- Yeah, that one was, that one was very mouthful.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,720
- I'm gonna close my eyes.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,560
You're gonna do one fake one and one real one

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,920
and I won't know which one is which.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,120
- No I shouldn't, I think it's 'cause I ate

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,620
vegan meatballs last night and I think that's making my gains.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,320
So you decided to ruin my fun last night for dinner?

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,320
That one was... wait, give me the next one.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,220
They both sound real to me.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,720
They were both my mouth.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,820
They were both fake?

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,420
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,020
Well, then you broke the rule of the game.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,820
I thought at least one was real.

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,320
No.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,820
But I thought you broke it the other way.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,820
I thought you said both...

22
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,940
or you did both. What do you think I was going to pick up the mic and put it up

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,560
to my butt? I would have to smell that. I'm not a scientist. I don't I can't

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,860
figure out how you might do stuff. I you weren't in the room. Okay, thank God,

25
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,100
but you were over there and you walked in after I had farted

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,180
and I said to myself, Oh, my goodness,

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,320
you said out loud. Oh, my God, you open the door. I've been farting nasty to

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,640
what do we eat? I don't know the other day. I've been having some of my stomach

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,860
wishes. The other day I took a shit that took that was so violent and horrible

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,960
and wet that when I got up off the toilet and I looked in the bathroom

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,240
mirror, I was two inches shorter.

32
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,500
This is good.

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,960
A minute, a minute, twenty nine, you were the poop talker podcast. I was

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,100
going to go this early in the maybe, maybe somebody

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,900
on listener, a new, a new

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,160
now. I wonder if they talk about anything different on the Patreon. I

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,760
we did it and farted so good, disgustingly. I did the full poop.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,680
This is the poop. That's all I do.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,360
The only stories I have in my life are times that I farted or I should at

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,680
every other day. I don't we sit. We watch movies, eat a banana and I walk

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,440
back and forth twenty five times. That's why we are not good artists. No,

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,480
because we if we were if we we need something trouble, we don't get in

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,940
we don't push any kind of boundary. I'm pushing the boundaries, you pushing the

44
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,680
boundaries, how so pushing the boundaries of how bored I can get. That's right. I

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
get so bored. I get so far last night. I was so bored that the idea of playing a

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
video game was disgusting to me. Yeah, I was like that. It sounds like so much

47
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,840
work to I know I hit the I hit the yeah. I hit the the boredom peak because I

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,360
decided to play a resident evil game. You guys have all been talking about

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,000
resident evil. It's been in my brain. I don't even like it, but it's all I can

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,880
think about and all I can do all I can play fifteen minutes a day of this game.

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,800
I every time I get to the fifteen minute mark, I go

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,940
all I can do in resident. I tried to play it on stream before and everyone got mad

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,020
at every decision I made, so I cannot play. I make a lot of this. Yes, what are

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,420
the decisions like a brain, every decision I made, though every choice that

55
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,660
I made when I played that made people upset, walk like our choices, though.

56
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,540
It's like you go through you just in the joint. You just find keys, you find

57
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,640
keys you back track you put the key in and then you find the next one. I was

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,140
doing that

59
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,220
shaped like an eagle. Oh, this is like a so it's so easy and I was doing it so

60
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,380
wrong that people got upset. Where are these? It's not even in all these

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:31,060
resident, not easy. No, it's hard. No, it's pretty hard. There's all in all

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,860
these resident evil games. You're going into these houses where every key is a

63
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,620
fucking every every door has some has some crazy colitis. I was I'm playing

64
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,700
resident evil seven and it's so funny to me that it's like a it's supposed to be

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,520
like a dilapidated like Texas chainsaw house. It's a house that you find in the

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,060
swamp in Louisiana and it's like okay. We have a door that only opens. If you

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,980
project the shadow of a spider on to this paint, exactly that's what they

68
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,300
became zombies, but before where they were the fucks my eagle key.

69
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,480
I can't get to the Scorpio

70
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,260
fuck. I like my scorpion key behind the spider door. Oh fuck me man. We are

71
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,940
I got back tracked out of the bad. I put that eagle disc God damn it man. I

72
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,500
never finished any of those games. I think I know that there's like a tofu

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,500
character that you can unlock right or is that silent hill tofu character?

74
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,680
There's a piece of that. Oh, you can unlock

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,860
that's Resident Evil two. That's Resident Evil. You can be tofu in this

76
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,340
game. I'm playing a tofu man.

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,940
You okay if you're going to be the expert, you got to chime in. You have to

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,220
like give some yeah. What do you mean you can be a making me sound like a

79
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,100
fucking crazy person like

80
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,760
like a new game plus plus type of thing. I don't like this shit. I think that

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,160
you should only have to play games one time. Yeah, I don't think you should

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,960
that's what I was reading. I don't be actually fun. If you play, I was

83
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,680
reading about Resident Evil games and they're like yeah Resident Evil seven's

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,680
fun, but it has like no replayability. Yeah, why what why are you replaying

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,680
this man? You did it yeah story over monsters and you got out of the house

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
your story. You want to go back in you must hear yourself again. You must be

87
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,520
psycho. Once you know what's actually in the house, which, by the way, are you

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,560
kidding me? Zombies at the beginning of the game, you only go into the house

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,400
because you're looking for your wife. If you go in again and you know that she's

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,680
evil, are you local? You must be a moron. Exactly. It's not safe in there.

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,920
That's how I ever looking mama. You put the video you once you're done with the

92
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,520
game, you sell it. Yes, these are disposable items. That's why digital has

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,360
ruined digitaling. I agree. You gotta play the game on a disc. Same with songs.

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,440
Give it to your friend afterward. Same with albums. Once you're done listening

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,860
to it, give it away. I don't want to hear this stupid shit again. I know what

96
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,220
happens on this album. Yeah, the song gets loud at the end. The song, yeah,

97
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,640
and then it slowly fades away. I've heard this song before, man. I want to

98
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,140
enjoy this song, but it's like from the first second, I know how it's going to

99
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,900
end. I know it's going to fade out. I got spoiled. It's so predictable. I got

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,300
spoiled that it's three minutes and thirty seven seconds long. Oh, and let me

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,080
I saw it by and let me guess. I

102
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,120
accidentally read the book on the back. Well, it's actually I like to read the

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,720
books before the songs, because then I can kind of imagine my own music. Then I

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,060
listen to the song and I go one second, two seconds, three seconds, because if

105
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,520
you listen to the song before you read the book, it's like you just already

106
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,120
have it imagined for you exactly lose a lot, and I also like to read the book

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,280
before I eat the food. Yes, I read the recipe before I eat the food.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,160
imagine how it might taste. I look at all the ingredients and I think how

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,740
could this possibly tell you like that spaghetti and meatballs? Yeah, there's

110
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,680
the cardamom. Oh, you like eating the spaghetti and the meatballs. That's

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
there's the ketchup. I actually

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,480
I actually like

113
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,080
the recipe much more. I actually read the recipe before anybody even made

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,960
recipe was a lot better. I actually like the recipe way, way more. It had

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,740
way more like I get why people like the food. There's actually ingredients.

116
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,900
people had like read the recipe before they ate the food. I feel like they

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,080
would be under well and there's actually ingredients they left out of the

118
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,740
that were

119
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,560
and meal. So

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,520
the recipe is different than the food in the recipe. They actually have to

121
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,720
mix the ingredients together and the yeah they're just you didn't even see

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,060
that in the final for yeah and that's it sucks. It sucks at the fucking recipes

123
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,120
being remade and rebooted every year. Yeah, that's true by J Kenji Lopez and

124
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,000
kind of Muguse rebooting recipes. They're rebooting it. They're making them fucking woke. They

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
literally are. They literally are. They're making chicken marsala. Oh yeah, we're making

126
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,800
a Philly cheesesteak with bulgogi from Korea. What the hell? Get out of here. They woke-ified

127
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,240
a sandwich. I'm sick of them woke-ifying recipes. I didn't think it was fucking possible. Oh

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,360
my God. They used an international palette and applied it to my recipe. Jesus Christ.

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,260
It's not so messed up disgusting fusion. What was that fusion restaurant fusion

130
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,000
belongs in a power plant exactly and keep it the fuck away from my food in a

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,900
frenzy on xbox or in a or in a power up.

132
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,700
What was that fusion restaurant idea you had

133
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,600
text text text text and sushi text max in a or Korean. I was forget what it was

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,040
yeah, yeah, that's a guy that's what Eric would look like a manager of a text

135
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,860
Tex-Mex Korean. No executive chef, executive chef, executive chef at the

136
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,500
Tex-Mex Korean fusion restaurant. Yeah, yeah, yeah, where they make different

137
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,700
they make. They need to start getting to the three, the three fusion, the

138
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,580
try fusion, try fusion, but that's right. I'd be doing too much. Okay,

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,420
what would you know? Because it's like we've done you, you don't get surprised

140
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,780
anymore. When you see the fusion, you go, you see the craziest fusion of all

141
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,500
time and you go like, oh, okay, sure, whatever. Here we go back to your

142
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,460
hometown and someone you know has opened up a terrible fusion restaurant. No,

143
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,240
and it's always like hot sushi like they make like steak and fries sushi

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,940
sandwiches. No, no, I can't say I've experienced everybody from my church

145
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,000
started making disgusting fusion restaurants in the last couple of years.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,700
The only restaurant I know that we made a fried fried chicken egg roll.

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,740
That's some that's like that's an applebee's appetizer. That's what I'm

148
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,180
saying man.

149
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,420
Try fusion. We need a third a third flavor.

150
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,540
most of them is it's like so just think of okay. Give me give me a classic

151
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,860
fusion here. Well, in a classic here, it's always American. You're always

152
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,140
adding American to it. It's always no. Let me just give me a class. He let him

153
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,860
work. Give me a classic fusion. Okay, man, what is a classic fusion? What is

154
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,900
a classic fusion? What fuse? What's the last fusion? I've been trying a lot of

155
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,580
Thai soul food places. Okay, so yeah, Korean fried chicken, that kind of thing,

156
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,340
soul food,

157
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,100
and let's think here

158
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,320
Macedonian adding Indian food into it. Okay, so what that would be butter pad

159
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,480
chicken exactly interesting. Well, chicken is in tie and soul food, but

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,180
okay, let's see

161
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,580
let's see here, maybe a side dish of Mac and cheese that's pad tie Mac and

162
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,020
cheese

163
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,540
with peanut with he not Mac. He not

164
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,900
you know Mac and cheese. That's really listen. I'm no I'm no chef. Well,

165
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,260
recipe developer. Yes, no no recipe scientist recipe side of research. I'm

166
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,340
just I'm provided. I'm the concept. I'm the person they hired to redesign the

167
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,380
logo type, but what if I give them the idea? I say listen, you got to add a

168
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,220
try. This has to be tri fusion. I'll give you a third. You have to figure out

169
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,780
how it works. I can't yeah. You're just drawing the big blue and pink. I'm doing

170
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,300
this. I'm doing a Venn diagram and a triangle you're doing the pink lady that

171
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,860
on the front of the that what faces that you know, you know the the the

172
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
corporate Memphis. That's

173
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
Petford. Smelling the bowl.

174
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
I closed my eyes.

175
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah, why do you have to close the smell?

176
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
Don't say you know what I'm talking about.

177
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
You always close your eyes to smell something really good,

178
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,900
especially in soup commercials.

179
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,900
No, I see it and smell it.

180
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Alright, well, I've stepped on a rake.

181
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I want to be the recipe.

182
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,900
I want to be the

183
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Julia, what's her name? Julia

184
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
Julia Childs.

185
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,560
Julia Childs fellow at the recipe. She's leaking recipes.

186
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,840
She's leaking recipes that we're not supposed to see the public line soup

187
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,880
from above yeah

188
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,420
that's dude they're working on tri fusion. It's a secret tri fusion, yeah,

189
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,520
but maybe they could do met in something beyond food

190
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,820
with the third. The third thing is not food like being like oh, like more of a

191
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,220
maybe a drink culture. Oh my God. Yes, man. They kind of do that here.

192
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,460
Yeah, they do everything in this. Yeah, it's pretty easy. I saw I saw a bar.

193
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,740
You go to a punk bar and they're like, Oh, we have a vegan Korean fried. I got

194
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,460
an ad on my Instagram this morning

195
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:55,500
and piercings. Yeah, they put little bonito flakes on the top. This is

196
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,520
that's actually a good idea. I got an ad for a I got an ad for a gym today on

197
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,140
instagram.

198
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,820
No, this is I just this is fusion

199
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,200
and watch. I guarantee you that there's already a restaurant in New York called

200
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
punk rock dump.

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,240
Wait, there's a play. There's a vegan place called like fuck you burger,

202
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,400
stinky slit burger. There's not a stinky slit burger, stinky slit burger,

203
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,500
stinky slit.

204
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,740
No, it's got searching with quotes, searching punk rock. No, it's somewhere

205
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,480
in like Green Point or some or no in in like Fort Green. They have like I've

206
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,660
been to it before I haven't been into it. It's not called fuck you slit. It's

207
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,460
called slut. Fuck your slut. Fuck your slug. No, no, it's not egg slit. It's

208
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,500
say stink slut burger. It's not stinky and although everything on the menu is

209
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,620
called like the fuck you burger. Is it did you got a dick last resort? No,

210
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,120
no

211
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,380
they don't cuss there. Yeah, they do that's a fusion where not when I go

212
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,940
rudeness yeah true and crad and rudeness disrespect food and rudeness

213
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,580
rude. We're the first people to mix food and rude fruit. Yeah, Dix last

214
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,860
resort. It's more of a food,

215
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
restaurant and rudeness.

216
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:17,380
I saw an amazing fusion today, an instagram ad for a gym. I don't remember

217
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,260
it was called, but it was like have you ever been at the gym and wondered why

218
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:27,120
nobody there wants to party come to this gym in Manhattan. It is a it is a gym in

219
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,440
a nightclub setting and after the after the classes, it's an open bar and the

220
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,620
bartender was hot and he took his shirt off. I think I remember something like

221
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,280
this. It's like a dance for people drinking and goes like can you imagine

222
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,440
like what the hell and working out? Why are people doing this crazy? It was

223
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,640
called like booze club with no vowels,

224
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,880
easy CLB some shit like that. Yeah, I would be worried. I was a bee busy,

225
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,640
busy club, busy club. I was I'd be worried to be a club for be. I think now

226
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,380
that you guys are

227
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,760
now that you guys are. I think beekeepers probably should stick to their

228
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,520
own kind. Yeah, I don't really want to spend. We can't have a beekeeper fusion

229
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,080
place honey. They're going to put bees in everything. Bee food is honey. Is that

230
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,800
their food

231
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,440
tea, a cup of tea is kind of like British bee fusion. If you put honey in it, don't

232
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,280
put that there. Put that on the ground, please. That's disgusting. Bee. When you

233
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,360
use a zen, you're supposed to put it in your pocket and then try to pay for

234
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,640
groceries and then 50 of them fall out. That's what you do? Yeah. I want to put a

235
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,800
wet object in my pocket. Every fucking time I go to the grocery store and I'm

236
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,680
buying a banana and they say, okay, that'll be eight dollars. Well, how many

237
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,120
zens do you think you could buy a banana with? Used? Very few. Used, but I think

238
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,260
stuff like you know you're at the bodega, you pull this in out of your pocket and

239
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,260
maybe the bodega. They already have them there. They already have them there.

240
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,060
Yeah, I know, but what if you... Now that you guys are in the gym and we have been in

241
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,580
the gym, I'm sure that people can tell. I know that we're all wearing long sleeves

242
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,980
right now, but if we were wearing... Check me out. If we were wearing micro bikinis,

243
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,380
you'd see a very big difference in our bodies. Yeah. I think that it is time for

244
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,940
us to join a high-end Equinox style gym with towels and smells. Maybe. That would

245
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,520
would be nice, but I can't do it me neither, but why not

246
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,260
money yeah, it's only an hour away.

247
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,920
I guess I have time, but I don't have the money. It's only an hour time is

248
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,580
money. So my God wow yeah, if you do a little bit of online work from home

249
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,440
style work on the way there, it pays for itself

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,940
right or if they pay you to go to the gym that it does literally pays for

251
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,080
it's okay for itself. Speaking of the gym, we found out yesterday that my left

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,380
side of my body is shorter than my right side. Oh yeah, you weren't...

253
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,940
You said that I was looking at his body and... Yeah. You thought you were

254
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,660
looking at my breasts. You were looking at his body and... Well, Pat was

255
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,820
literally standing like this doing hands over nipples, kind of Monty Python

256
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,640
style. He has a horn. And then Caleb was full leaning hand on chin inspection.

257
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,380
I didn't have my hand on my chin. You were stroking your chin. This thing

258
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,700
makes my like rib cage kind of slanted. So we thought that it was that, but then I

259
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,780
said, you know what?

260
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,340
If you notice, I don't know if you, it's kind of, it's very subtle. You always

261
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,500
exaggerate it when you think about it. Yeah, this is what he was doing yesterday.

262
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,340
He was like, look, one shoulder's higher than the other.

263
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,180
One of my shoulders is bigger than the other.

264
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,860
But I found out yesterday, one of his legs is way longer than the other leg.

265
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,560
Wow, his knees are like this. That's why I got to go to the tailor all the time to

266
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,380
get my pants fixed because you have one leg that is one leg. That is a little

267
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,820
yeah leg. It follows the same thing.

268
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,980
You know, I like pant one leg short one leg pant one leg short. Maybe that's

269
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,640
what I got to do. That is a pants fusion. Yeah, pants fusion fusion shortness and

270
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,260
longness.

271
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,180
That's an incredible idea. The shortness culture of pants meets the longest

272
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,540
culture of pants. They clash. What do you think came first? He's shortness or

273
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,560
longness shorts or because back the you see photos,

274
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:03,960
there's a

275
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,560
cloth right. It's definitely got shorts was first here's well. I

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,660
think that shorts were first because yeah, you have a loin

277
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,660
cloth and then you also have the kind of like caveman leopard

278
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,360
skin toga or it's a slung over the shoulder. Yeah, and that's

279
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,560
completely a romper and a romper is shorts romper is shorts.

280
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,060
So I think it's shorts first and you look at all these photos

281
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,360
of people in like the seventeen hundreds and they're wearing

282
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,660
like shorts and then the high-ass socks.

283
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,780
True, they didn't even think to extend the shorts down to the longs for some time.

284
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,180
They wanted a combination.

285
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Combination?

286
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Combination.

287
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,180
Of longs, longs socks, shorts, shorts.

288
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,120
And that is a huge tenet of being a cholo as well.

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,340
Is longs shorts.

290
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,780
Longs shorts, longs socks, which is I think maybe...

291
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,820
Longs shorts and longs socks is kind of beautiful because it's about two things kind of reaching

292
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,660
and bridging the gap to each other, reaching across the void.

293
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,460
it's an other fusion. It's like it's like a we we don't have anything to cover the

294
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,120
knees. We're just shorts and socks, but we're going to make up for it. You know

295
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,220
what I mean? It's like a family making ends meet when a family member dies.

296
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,700
Have you ever had ends me?

297
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,860
It sucks

298
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,620
from an ends

299
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,580
the ends me. It's so fucking

300
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,420
disgusting. You know you grew up poor. If you were eating ends me,

301
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,540
you know, making ends meet. Oh my goodness,

302
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,240
come on, can't we have the beginnings meet? I'd rather have means yeah

303
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,340
certainly

304
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,440
you know, I fucking hated in me, especially well when it's braised. It's

305
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,240
okay. What was your guys's? Did you guys have this experience? I don't have

306
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,540
this had scrapings of by did you have

307
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,180
Did you get of this experience growing up? You both had siblings. You wake up

308
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,880
in the morning, you sit down at the

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,620
desk where you eat, AKA the dinner table, breakfast table, breakfast table. Oh

310
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,700
okay, I have two tables, one for each meal. No, it changes based on the time

311
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,020
of day. It's only two meals, you're saying? Yeah, dude, we did two mad,

312
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,740
two meals a day.

313
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,580
Anyway, moving on,

314
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,140
you sit down, you're waking up. Oh God, I ate my crust out of my eyes.

315
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,840
your plop biggest, most disgusting bowl of disgusting scrambled eggs of all time

316
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,360
plopped right in front of you, family style, and you wanted to vomit every

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,340
time you looked at the eggs. My dad made eggs good. My mom would make this like

318
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,660
fully brown eggs that she was scraping the Teflon pan into and then just put

319
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,500
them in a big bowl. Fuck. I think I said that at friends houses. Serve yourself.

320
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,720
Serve yourself. Yeah, I never had to serve yourself. Oh, you were served. Oh,

321
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,540
Okay, you were sure served. I mean it's only two kids. I don't think there's a

322
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,940
yeah, we were only three. Yeah, that's the more where you would start doing

323
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,240
serve yourself is where you do the serve yourself. I mean, I guess I'm trying to

324
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
think we would. I don't think we are typically made breakfast very often. I

325
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,040
guess we're a little, but I don't think we're my family's making us eggs. I

326
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,840
think we're having cereal and my dad was making eggs and hash browns on the

327
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,540
weekend and sausage pancakes and yeah, that serve yourself and tell me tell me

328
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:22,540
this. Did dad make the pancakes? My dad did. Why is it that moms make everything and dads

329
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,780
can make pancakes and burgers and grilled cheese? My dad made grilled cheese. Anytime

330
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,940
my mom was out of town, my mom would go on work trips for five days. For five nights

331
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:39,380
in a row, we'd eat grilled cheese and tomato soup, and it was so damn good, man. My dad

332
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:48,900
was the chef in the house. I don't think I've ever really seen my mom cook besides some

333
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,460
kind of chicken thing that she used to make. The only thing that I remember that she would

334
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:04,300
make is the Planet Hollywood Captain Crunch breaded chicken. It was actually good.

335
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,300
actually really good. Your mom made that? She would make copycat recipes. From Planet Hollywood?

336
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,500
That's a fusion. Yeah, that one breakfast and dinner. Restaurant and celebrity. Breakfast

337
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,420
for dinner was one of my faves. Breakfast for dinner is a classic. I still do breakfast

338
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,940
for dinner. I'll make some protein pancakes, a couple of fried eggs. I don't think I liked

339
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,500
breakfast for dinner because I was not a breakfast person. You're still not a breakfast person.

340
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,540
I have become, by the way, you've been fully vindicated by me. I haven't eaten breakfast

341
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:44,720
in maybe like regularly years. I am a lunch, dinner man now. I will eat breakfast foods

342
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,900
at lunch or dinner. But at breakfast, I fast until 2 or 3 p.m.

343
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,940
Yeah, that's what I do. That's what I've always done.

344
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,620
It's wrong. It's the most important meal of the day.

345
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,100
It's not. It's the least important meal of the day. You've been lied to.

346
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm not by nobody told me this. I just the doctor told this. I don't listen to

347
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,340
the doctor. He hates the doctor more than anybody. Oh yeah, you hate the

348
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,220
doctor. I hate the dentist. I think the doctor told me breakfast is the most

349
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,500
important meal of the day and I said, okay, yes, you think I'm that kind of

350
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,620
guy. Hell no, I don't do what the doctor told you this. No man, first of all, my

351
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,420
teacher told me and second of all listens to the teacher.

352
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:27,340
Uh oh, you have been destroyed feeling sluggish and getting high headaches all

353
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,860
No, it actually fasting turns you into a full caveman. Yes, when you wake up, oh

354
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,060
for some hours, yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's really good. It gives you super

355
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,700
human strength. I've been doing this for years. I fast, but then I'll drink

356
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,900
probably 200 mg of caffeine in the morning. Paragon of okay, so yeah,

357
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,060
exactly. I'm sorry to tell you this, that's breakfast breakfast. Drink a

358
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,660
sugar potion in the morning.

359
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,500
There's no sugar in breakfast. There's no sugar in Celsius.

360
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
okay, sorry, an aspartame,

361
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,740
potion, but there's no sugar. It's a milkshake bro. It's not a mill or a

362
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,900
starbucks. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, drink an energy drink every morning.

363
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,340
If you drink a I'm sorry, you cannot be talking shit on breakfast. If you drink

364
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,180
a if you drink a thick in the morning, that's breakfast. If you drink a thin

365
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,900
that is almost similar in texture and shape to water or coffee, that is not

366
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,300
similar in flavor to a starburst or maybe a lollipop. It's similar in

367
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,940
flavor to actually a warhead. If you drink the ghost exhibit a

368
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:31,140
skittles, this is my fasting the skittles see for but that's a

369
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,840
bacon eggs skittles. I want to it's a thin. This is why you're

370
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,040
like yeah. I don't eat breakfast because in your mind breakfast is

371
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,840
like five eggs and a plate of bacon breakfast. You can just

372
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,840
eat a piece of toast and that's breakfast. That's an empty meal.

373
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,340
Do you remember when we were we were at your house in October

374
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,040
for twenty twenty and I made a lion breakfast made Hawaiian breakfast. I

375
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,300
know you talk about it all the time, so it was a great so good, but then I felt

376
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,000
I ate them in the morning and then felt so sick that day that I thought that I

377
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
had contracted the Covid-Nineteen.

378
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,940
Oh, I do remember that, but I think you were just hung over. I think it was a

379
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,440
combination of a lot of things. I'm gonna a shun combination. I like I think

380
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,840
everybody's gripe with breakfast always comes from people that have no self

381
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,900
control and think oh when you have to eat breakfast, that means every day I'm

382
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,640
eating a diner breakfast. Well, that's no, but that's the only thing that is

383
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,140
appealing. That's exactly my man in the morning is breakfast. That's not great.

384
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,120
That's a snack. That's a snack breakfast. You eat it when you wake up. It's

385
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,320
breakfast is a meal. Breakfast is a meal. You're eating a snack. It's barely a

386
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,040
meal. Okay, not if it's a meal, then I'm not eating breakfast, bro, because

387
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,060
that's okay. Then this thing is solved. Then why are we even talking? Let's turn

388
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,620
the cameras off. What are we doing? The episode we decided cut. Nobody likes

389
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,220
breakfast, all the cameras, I was like yeah whenever I break I can't break it,

390
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,220
because I eat in the morning. I feel so sick and it's because they're in

391
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,780
chocolate chip pancakes, a can a

392
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,800
obvious everything,

393
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,100
yeah, you don't need you. I also that stuff also not a big fan of pancakes

394
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,840
because of the chocolate chips pancakes. You have to because of what is it you

395
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,060
think it's on chocolate chips. I never it's a

396
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:14,380
very man. It's a big wet disk of bread covered in shit with sugar and we're all

397
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,320
we're all monkeys on a flying rock and space. You eat that crap gay.

398
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,680
You're lashing out at me. I don't fucking out of pancakes anymore, but you know

399
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,280
what I fuck with waffles? Yes, I've always been. I've always been. You know

400
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,740
what I put on the waffles? What? Butter and syrup. Zero, but I like I like

401
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,740
peanut butter on waffles. New Hampshire syrup is better than Vermont's.

402
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:40,040
They're the same shit. They're not the same. You know what? Oh, you know what

403
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm done with? I've been meaning to talk about these. Vermonters are so proud of

404
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,420
done syrup. I'm done with maple syrup. I'm done with for any I'm done with

405
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,460
pretending it's better than

406
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,820
stupid

407
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,220
with you.

408
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,920
He's a complete idiot.

409
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,540
Maple syrup. That's probably the most the easiest thing to tell the difference

410
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:00,880
between

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,200
so much obviously, but no, no, no, Mrs. Buttersworth. Oh, you're talking,

412
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,520
you're talking to it's candy. You're talking to the you're preaching to the

413
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,040
opposite of the choir to men.

414
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,480
Titanic choir, the syrup capital of the world's

415
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,280
it's so sucks. I'm not even saying that the fake syrup is bad. I would I eat

416
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,560
it, but to say that maple syrup is worse than that is it's worry. Maple

417
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,660
syrup as an ingredient is amazing. It's not no. Oh, well, maybe as an ingredient

418
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,720
sure it's amazing and everything who pulling it as an ingredient. I love

419
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,680
ingredients, but okay, at least at least you said that at least you said you

420
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,140
love ingredients. I think that for my waffle I'm going peanut butter and with

421
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,740
peanut butter. I don't want a butter and syrup yeah bitch. Why to make the flavor

422
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,200
good? This is what this is. You got your

423
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,320
that argument to make a good flavor. You don't have restraint when it comes to

424
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,240
breakfast food. It's a I'm diagnosing you right now. That's not a good time.

425
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,920
Here's your person next time. I've met one topping

426
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,060
you wait. You're saying just put p that be the driest thing ever peanut butter

427
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,260
only on a wall. It's up to you. You don't choose what this is. You're just

428
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,740
siding with it. You would put the syrup on. I know he doesn't like breakfast on

429
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,420
waffles. Yes, I always put syrup on one and peanut butter. That's no, I would

430
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,740
not see anybody do that before. This is the most common thing in the world.

431
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,740
That's what Waffle House does. Waffle House does this peanut butter and syrup.

432
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,260
Yes, it's on the menu. Maybe a waffle with peanut butter chips in it. That's

433
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,660
worse because that's that's that's chocolate chips, but they're peanuts.

434
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah, but that's at least at least that's not a topping. That's an

435
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,500
ingredient. I can accept peanut butter as an ingredient, but as a topping

436
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,620
peanut butter and maple. It's just it's not about the flavor. It's just the

437
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,780
practice is bizarre. Yeah, you think that you you're saying it's bizarre.

438
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,320
Imagine

439
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,720
you're filling the holes of the waffle with the peanut butter. So you're

440
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,800
blocking the hole. It's not incorporating with the waffle. It's

441
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,580
incorporating with the peanut butter. So why don't you just let's get into it

442
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,220
then? Because listen, I have a system for this. It's called checkerboard.

443
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,760
every

444
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,020
you do not do that. Yes, I put a little bit of peanut butter. Okay,

445
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,260
every other square. That's a fucking lie. I'm mediating this. I'm mediating this.

446
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,580
What if you take the peanut butter and you mix it with the maple syrup before

447
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,380
I've done that too? Okay, then why don't you just do that all the time? That

448
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,620
makes more sense. What do you mix it? It gives the peanut butter viscosity. You

449
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,140
get a bowl and you mix the peanut butter and maple syrup. Yeah, it's good, man.

450
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,480
I bet that's really good. I really get a butter maple syrup is very good being

451
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,700
magnetized to my fucking amazing ideas, but you can't you can't put peanut

452
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,140
butter

453
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,000
first. I can do whatever I want maple syrup after that's weird. It's on top.

454
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,460
Weird. It is weird. It's weird because then it's nothing I do is fucking weird.

455
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,260
Everything you do is weird. Okay, how about this guys? You soak the waffle in

456
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,060
the syrup. It takes up all the syrup, sponges it, and then the peanut butter

457
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,100
goes on top. Okay, I can accept that. Okay, well, I'm just missing one. I just

458
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,420
No, I wouldn't put both of those things on. That's too much for me. Do you guys

459
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,680
get weird about your foods touching? No, no, I'm not like that. That's why I

460
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,860
don't like. I mix everything together. That's why I don't like a full...

461
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,380
Not 'cause it's all touching together. That's why you don't like breakfast,

462
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,840
man. The best part of breakfast is mixing all the foods together. Actually,

463
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,420
wait a minute, full English is separated. Yeah. Yeah, but it's like if

464
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,780
you get a side salad for

465
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,120
like spaghetti and meatballs. I mix everything. I save the bread at an

466
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,900
Italian restaurant, save the salad, put everything in a big bowl, mix it up

467
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,260
of spaghetti. That's weird. You don't want your salad to touch your spaghetti.

468
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,180
I don't want salad to touch spaghetti sauce. Yeah. And when I was younger,

469
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,700
they would put it all in the same plate, like the spaghetti and the salad.

470
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,940
I wouldn't eat it together, but if it touches... The salad's gotta be on a

471
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,180
separate plate, but I don't want lettuce touching a red sauce.

472
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:54,360
Well, how about... Give me a red sauce. Oh, there's gotta be some type

473
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,660
of... Maybe chili crisp can touch lettuce. Oh, what about any... But that's

474
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,200
different. There's a bunch of red sauces in Korean food. You know a lot

475
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,280
about Korean food, is there any lettuce in there?

476
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,120
- Gochujang.

477
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,940
- Well that depends.

478
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,560
If it's a salad that has a gochujang vinaigrette.

479
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
- You have been destroyed.

480
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
- We got 'em.

481
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
- Did you guys eat raspberry vinaigrette growing up?

482
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,240
- No.

483
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,160
- This is what we had with every salad,

484
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,360
raspberry vinaigrette 'cause it was sweet like candy.

485
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,480
- It is good, I've had raspberry vinaigrette made homemade.

486
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,440
- It tasted exactly like can we get Newman's own.

487
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,760
- There was a long time this summer

488
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,420
where I was making my own vinaigrettes and salad dressings.

489
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,640
you should try it. It's really good. Get anchovy paste from the store, make your own Caesar

490
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
dressing.

491
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,320
But I don't eat so much salad.

492
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I don't either, but it's good to have on hand. Then you can force yourself to eat salads

493
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
by having all this dressing.

494
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,720
I don't need to force myself to do anything. I like hamburgers. I'll eat a hamburger every

495
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,320
damn day. I much, much, much care for hamburgers.

496
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,800
Making your own Caesar dressing at home.

497
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,160
It sounds nice. It sounds fun.

498
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,240
It's good. It's fun. You can put it in a jar and just shake the shit out of it.

499
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
I'll do that.

500
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah, try it.

501
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,760
to do it. Go get anchovy paste at the store. I need to buy a fucking microwave, man. For

502
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,960
real. You don't have a microwave? I don't have one either. I haven't had one since college.

503
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,560
The microwave is basically my number one friend in the world. I actually hate the microwave

504
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,560
so much. I don't like it very much either. I actually don't want one in my house. This

505
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,320
is something where once I... But it would be convenient to melt butter. If you have

506
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,600
an air fryer, you... It's a microwave? Yeah. I mean, anything you warm up in the microwave,

507
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,160
you can warm up in the air fryer and it won't be soggy. Except for a fucking hungry man.

508
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,600
Well, yeah, but how much are you eating those, though? Not that often. Without a microwave?

509
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,960
four or five days. Yeah. You eat a Hungry Man every four or five days? No. I don't think

510
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,320
you need a microwave in today's world. Yeah, you don't. Especially guys like you who make

511
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,640
food. Yeah. Yeah, but I'm kind of sick of making food. I want to get... I am too. Oh

512
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,560
my God, I hate doing the dishes so much. I kind of like doing the dishes. I hate the

513
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,040
dishes. I love to cook. That's time to listen to Stumpthing. Stumpthing, yeah. Stumpthing.

514
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,400
You put Stumpthing in. I love to cue up my... I go on my big playlist, I press shuffle and

515
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,900
and then I cue it up, I delete all the songs I don't want.

516
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,200
- And I do the dishes to the music.

517
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

518
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,500
Sometimes do a YouTube video about the history of spiders.

519
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,680
(humming)

520
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,520
- History of spiders?

521
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,720
- Yeah, that was one I watched the other day.

522
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,800
- That's good, yeah, see, I watch all these horrible videos.

523
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
- Spiders are mentioned in the Bible, you know.

524
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,800
Did you know spiders used to be synonymous

525
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
with being fragile and weak because of their webs?

526
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
- Really?

527
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,920
- That's in the Bible, every time they're mentioned,

528
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,040
it's like, and they would walk through them

529
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,880
like a spider's web.

530
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,960
- Little do they know the tensile strength of a spider web.

531
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,440
- I think spiders are moving crazy,

532
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,740
the spiders read the Bible and they're like we got to step it up. We got to get

533
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,600
poisonous. Well, it's interesting because you know there's no poisonous spiders in

534
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,400
or venomous should say in like England. So the the folklore of a spider is very

535
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,440
different from where from other places where they're actually dangerous spiders

536
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,440
like a brown recluse. What do they talk about spiders in England like?

537
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,740
Well, they were seeing well here, I guess the interesting thing that was in

538
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,920
this video was that some of there are still things about like people getting

539
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,600
sick from spider bites and like cures to use for a spider bite, but it wouldn't

540
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,680
have made sense necessarily because there probably weren't spiders that made

541
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,280
people really sick. So it was probably from somewhere else that they got like

542
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,560
handed these like remedies that they would use for sicknesses that they didn't

543
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,080
exist.

544
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,400
Very interesting.

545
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,600
What else do they not have in the bloody UK? Bears. No bears. What? That's crazy.

546
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,480
Not many snakes either, I think. Imagine what it was like coming over to the US.

547
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,400
Wait, we have the most fucked up... We're like... Yeah, we're second to Australia,

548
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,820
I feel the most fucked up shit here. You go into the woods, you're going to die a

549
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,100
mountain lion, a mountain lion, bears,

550
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,540
a panther,

551
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,200
I hung out with destiny. I had a dream.

552
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,800
I

553
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,200
took a nap and right before I took a nap, I saw some picture of him cut to my

554
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,640
dream, me and my cousin Matthew hanging out with destiny and he was trying to

555
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,880
fuck my aunt. Wow yeah, you know the dreams you know when you're falling

556
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,040
asleep and you feel like you're falling and you jolt awake yeah every that was

557
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,580
almost every night that I had every almost be almost every night that I was

558
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,780
falling asleep this week. I've had a version of that where, instead of a

559
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,100
falling, I slip on ice and I I'm like whoa and I wake up like I hate that

560
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,780
feeling. It's terrible. I it happens to me probably once a week, but it's because

561
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,060
it got so damn snowy and cold out that now I'm it has been I'm getting ice

562
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,660
versions. They don't they don't salt or shovel in this neighborhood. Do they

563
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,980
thought they do people everybody except us did yeah yeah, well, there's no

564
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,920
My neighborhood, my neck of the woods. I bet we're liable if someone falls and

565
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,920
breaks their head open. Oh crap. Not my problem. No, not mine either.

566
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,720
We'll put it on Pat. I don't know what liable means. So that is not going on me.

567
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,620
Well, that's liable if someone says that we did that shit. Yeah, it's not true.

568
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,620
And they're able to lie. It's Lionel who fell on the ground. Lionel.

569
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,920
Well, that would be sad because Lionel sounds like a little kid. Lionel does

570
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,420
sound like a child. Not anymore. No, I think Lionel's an old man name.

571
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,260
name. Well, I don't know those old names that's coming back. Really? They've been

572
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,780
given little kids old man. Would you guys think I was good? Would you think I was

573
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,180
a whack if I had a kid and I named my daughter Gertrude? That was my great

574
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:01,460
grandmother's name. So you'd like it? I know. I would think it was weird. I guess

575
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,260
I know that you were naming your daughter Gertrude. So she looks normal

576
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,100
holding that damn corn broom back to the corn. It's always all about the corn

577
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,780
I have a broom that I never use. It just sits up just in case of whatever, just as a way

578
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,020
to ward off bad spirits.

579
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Chekhov's broom.

580
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,620
Chekhov's broom, yeah.

581
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,060
Did you guys grow up, well you didn't grow up Christian.

582
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
No.

583
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,780
I think my mom tried to convert.

584
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
We moved recently.

585
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,980
No, no, no. When Passion came out.

586
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,820
We moved a lot. I lived in like 18 or 19 different houses when I was growing up and every time

587
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,180
time we moved, my mom would take a full day and anoint the entire house with

588
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:45,180
I do drawing crosses above every single doorway. That is interesting, you know

589
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,460
that is guess what

590
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,540
nothing bad ever happened to us. I believe it for the moving around for the

591
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,920
moving, getting kicked out of every house, divorce, brothers running away,

592
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,500
but besides all of that, nothing bad happened to the house. Now the house,

593
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,100
no house ever was destroyed or burned, nothing ever burned down. That's good.

594
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,180
Nobody ever passed away one heart attack, but no passing away right just trouble

595
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,340
Yeah, so just a little just like getting in trouble in the road, yeah, but

596
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,820
nothing demonic for sure. No, no negative energies. Yeah, it's not like when you

597
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,020
grow up Irish Catholic, you just believe that anything that is bad is happening to

598
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,180
you is a curse from God, because you did something you said to swear.

599
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,620
I thought they like swearing and they like swearing, but that's the thing

600
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:34,020
that's why they're constantly felt basically the guilt. Let me explain

601
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,740
because I know you didn't grow up. You didn't grow up Catholic, so let me

602
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,820
I'll explain it to you. The basically the way it works is your entire life from

603
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,300
age zero to age about, let's say, sixty five. Okay, you do whatever you want.

604
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:53,300
You hurt everybody in your life. You act like an asshole. You beat women. You

605
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:59,380
drink to excess. Okay, you may commit assault. That's fun. You steal, you lie,

606
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:05,100
you send it at the age around age sixty five. You go like this. Oh my God,

607
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:11,800
look at your hands. I go to hell yeah. I feel so guilty because my mom raised me

608
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,220
bad.

609
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,540
You raised me into a doctor, which is that's crazy, because every one of my

610
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:22,400
done every single member I cussed of my mom's Irish. Oh my God, I watched R rated

611
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,060
movies at the age of fifteen, spend all day beating up every single person in

612
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,860
your family. Oh my God, I cussed and I watched bad movies. This is my fault. I

613
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,100
have to go to a booth and talk. I have to talk to some guy to a pedophile right

614
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,320
no, please, oh God, it's crazy. You said sixty five because it's around every

615
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,600
single like old person on my mom's side passed away before they reach seven.

616
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,920
They all went to hell yeah, they think well sixty five. It's because it's

617
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,080
because as soon as you retire, you finally think for the first time in your

618
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,040
life yeah, a person finally yeah yeah and finally finally sits down and thinks

619
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,120
about something. Oh my God, then I should have a drink and drove busy,

620
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,160
it's busy this season man rats rats. Oh dress my family's screaming again yeah

621
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,240
wait. I'm going too fast. I'm driving to a right now.

622
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,760
The screaming was my fault because I didn't make dinner. I listened to the

623
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,960
other night, the

624
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,000
podcast episode with the nerdist, the Chris Hardwick episode where he

625
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,480
interviews norm. McDonald came up on my YouTube thing and I bet that just like

626
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,880
It just said like comedy interview Norm MacDonald, it was two hours long and I was like I wonder

627
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,040
if I've heard this and I played it and it was the nerdiest and I turned it off because

628
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:43,280
ten minutes in Norm tells some story about how he like went to, he like went and did,

629
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,480
tried to get on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and the Tonight Show guy was like,

630
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,720
"Yeah, you're just not really like a Johnny Carson comedian."

631
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,360
And then he ended up having his first late night appearance with David Letterman and

632
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,000
and it was this like great thing for his career, changed his entire life. He

633
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,080
tells a story very like seriously and then Chris Hardwick goes, yeah, it

634
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,100
sounds like you were sorted into the right house.

635
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:12,200
This was like the second to last interview this guy ever did and that's

636
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,260
what he's getting from Chris

637
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,480
you know and norm just goes like, oh yeah,

638
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,800
he has no idea. Yeah, he's never, I don't think he knows what Harry Potter

639
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,120
is.

640
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,160
Sounds like you were sorted into the right house. Chris Hardwick, if you ever

641
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,400
try to come back. Yeah, no, no, I will set you up. First of all, I will set you up

642
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,600
with so many honey pots of just

643
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:38,280
every woman I know I'll be hiring to walk around you covered in bandages, just so

644
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,320
that you can rip them off.

645
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,960
Second of all, if you'd like to come on the show, you're always welcome. We'd

646
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,840
like, we'd love to talk to you about sketch shows from the 90s that didn't

647
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,760
exist for more than one season, like the Ben Stiller show, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

648
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,400
or the Dana Carvey show.

649
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,680
- I could see you kind of growing

650
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,400
into a Chris Hardwick type of career.

651
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,880
- Why would you say that?

652
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,200
- He wore suits, it was badass.

653
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,440
- Oh, you could see me wearing a suit.

654
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,200
- He wore suits, he did like three comedy specials.

655
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,040
I think you could do that.

656
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,280
- He did, Jesus Christ.

657
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
- He did one where he wore like a--

658
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,800
- I thought he was just a talk show host.

659
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,400
- No, he wore like a $10,000 suit in the special

660
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
and it was called like Da Nerd.

661
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,560
And he's wearing like a giant,

662
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,920
like Chris Rock golden suit or some shit.

663
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,680
- That's actually--

664
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,520
- It was badass.

665
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:26,320
I think that these comedy interviews are the reason why everything in the world is really bad.

666
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,820
Yeah, it's always bad. It's never good.

667
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,720
Why did Mark Maron do this to us?

668
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:38,020
Why did he decide that people need to hear Patton Oswalt talk about...

669
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,120
Like, that's the worst idea ever.

670
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,220
Yeah, they should crack down on it and kind of limit free speech.

671
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,660
They should want an episode or a radio show or a TV interview or something is filmed, the

672
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,940
government should literally send a SWAT team and come and seize the tape.

673
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
100%.

674
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:01,100
Put it in a vault that only opens after 99% of the world is scoured in nuclear flame.

675
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:09,180
There's no reason why anyone should know about what fucking Bill Burr was doing at Open Mic's

676
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
in the 80s.

677
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,580
Oh snap, Bo Burnham has trauma y'all.

678
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,380
I don't need to know about that.

679
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,900
No, no one needs to know that.

680
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,900
I could tell you had trauma.

681
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,100
I could tell because of his art was so affected for art. Yeah.

682
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:25,180
What? How could you make art like this without trauma? No, this guy's full of

683
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,660
trauma and guess what? Literally, literally, you can tell because he raps

684
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,540
rap is literally a genre born out of strife. He

685
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,360
gets what he even says it. He even says it in the end of his

686
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,680
special. He writes a whole thing about how George Carlin would hate him. Wait,

687
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,660
did he grow up in the ghetto? He grew up in the ghetto. Yeah, and he

688
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,160
grew up in the get the streets of

689
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,500
St. John's prep. I wonder what I think he's from. I'm pretty. I think he's from

690
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,240
Boston. I wonder what's a box from. I think he's from

691
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,460
locking in a guess here. My guess is my guess. My guess is hold on before you

692
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,160
say. I won't look it up. My guess is

693
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,020
mass. Beth

694
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,260
okay. That's not Boston. Oh yeah, that's I'm going Brookline. I'm going. I was

695
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:09,680
gonna say

696
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I'll go Brookline as well. Okay, and copier. Okay, I got all Burnham. Where from? I know

697
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,720
that he went to Hamilton, Mass. I know he went to the same Catholic boys school that my cousin

698
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:28,800
did. So did you did your cousin chill with him? No, my cousins my age, my cousin Patrick

699
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,360
who how old is Bo Burnham? He's older. Bo Burnham is 33 years old from my cousin Patrick

700
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,260
who is a year or two weeks older than me.

701
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,760
And he's from Hamilton. No, he's from he's from Somerville.

702
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,460
Whatever man, it's old fucking States. Hamilton is near Wayland.

703
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,460
Hamilton is in the North Shore Essex County.

704
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,660
He was a North Shore kid on the weekends and then went down to

705
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,960
yeah, the parted style. Hamilton also has a rich equestrian heritage.

706
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,660
Oh shit, which remains strong due to the influence.

707
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:10,000
blasted you strong due to the influence of the many horse farms and of myopia

708
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,480
hunt club, which holds frequent equestrian events. Myopia also holds a

709
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,440
thanksgiving day fox hunt each year that the public may attend. Why not a turkey

710
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,840
hunt? Crazy man, Hamilton neighbours, win them, win them. We're done with one

711
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,360
names. We're done with Massachusetts. We had you know what in North Carolina.

712
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,460
Yeah, of course, yeah, it's right next to Manchester by the sea. It's bordered by

713
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,740
by six only by the sea, no short place. We can are allowed to talk about twelve

714
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,140
miles south of Newburyport where it's tough. Now we fuck with we fuck with

715
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:45,100
Plastel Plastel. Yep, New Hampshire. Yeah, Plastel, New Hampshire, New

716
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,300
Hampshire is my number one in New England. What is Plastel just the town?

717
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,660
Yeah, and the beat. I got a shoe barn. They got a really good savers. They used

718
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,940
to have a trump store closed. Why? What is Plastel next to Plastel's next? I

719
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,780
I think it's next to ports near Portsmouth. I know it's near Merrimack

720
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,060
and Haverhill and all that. Oh, then it's way closer to where I'm from.

721
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,440
Portsmouth has my favorite hamburger store. Yeah, it's right by, I think it's

722
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,060
right by, I think that where, yeah.

723
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,380
Portsmouth is what? Has my favorite hamburger store. What place? I don't

724
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,900
remember the name. I've been trying to remember the name for like four years.

725
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,900
There's only like six restaurants in Portsmouth. I've been like three times

726
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,140
and I always leave and I'm like, I'm going to remember the name this time.

727
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,860
Yeah. How often do you go to Portsmouth? I've been, when I lived in Boston, I

728
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,240
go a lot. Oh, I didn't know that. Because it was close and it was like a nice place to go

729
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:34,160
for a day. Yeah, it is a nice place. I do love Portsmouth. It's basically cute. It is basically

730
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,500
cute. And it's also next to the Kiddery Trading Post in Maine. I love all that stuff, man.

731
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,120
We need to take you guys to the Appalachian Mountains. No, we gotta go to... Appalachian

732
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,440
Mountains are fire. We gotta go to New Hampshire, we gotta go to Salem, we gotta go to Canobie

733
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,480
Lake Park. No, you know, we gotta hit the... we do have to hit Canobie Lake Park. You still

734
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,880
never went there, right? Still never been. We gotta get... we don't have to close. We

735
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,980
I close to the Berkshires. What's the Berkshires in Western Mass? Is this a

736
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,800
Norman range, Florida, Massachusetts?

737
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,060
There's also beautiful, beautiful out there, North Adams, Massachusetts. It's

738
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,880
where DJ Lucas is from. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll go to the

739
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,160
Berkshires. The most beautiful part of Massachusetts. Really? Besides the water,

740
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,320
beautiful part of Massachusetts, East and West are both so beautiful in mass

741
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,920
and the middle. It's shite for me. It's the Gucci store at the Prudential is

742
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,560
beautiful part of Massachusetts, a golden store. Oh man, the all tired golden

743
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,260
store. Yeah, the all there's a warby parker there is beautiful. Oh my God,

744
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:32,040
don't even get me started in the fucking made well store. Oh my God, made well jay

745
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,880
crew. That is where that is basically where I grew up in massages and we're

746
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,720
going to a high noon pop up. Oh yeah, we're going to the june shine bar. We

747
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,640
should do a I've been I have had this idea for some time. David port noy will

748
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,840
go on. He'll go to any pizza place. Yeah, he went to the pizza place that up. My

749
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,240
family went to our entire lives. Really? My dad sent me the video. What'd he give

750
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,480
it?

751
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,280
He gave it a bad rating because, because they just got the management, like

752
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,040
change. They just, like, got completely, but it used to be good. It used to be

753
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,800
fire and, like, even in the video, is it Greek? He tries the, he tries to,

754
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,640
it's not house of, I don't know what style you would call it. I'm not a pizza

755
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,480
style. Like, Boston style, Italian. You're just a normal style. They were, they

756
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,200
were like Italian. It was like an Italian family. I'm a normal guy. I

757
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,760
had a very strong Italian accent, but even in the video that people like see

758
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,700
him trying it and they're like you just like if you had come a week ago, it

759
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,460
would have been good like they were like yeah yeah crazy, but I want to get him

760
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,000
to review a pizza that we make yeah. It's not a bad idea. Oh, my God, but I

761
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,440
heard the thing is I'm serious. We could we could put a dominoes pizza in a box,

762
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,280
pretend this was a pizza store, get all of our we do a fake a Google thing and

763
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,300
he just says we're close or whatever. He will come. If we tag enough

764
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,200
comments that say David, please come. He goes to every one of these places.

765
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,400
He's been to Pizza Hut, he goes to all these shitty... The only problem is...

766
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,640
Has he been to Papageno's? He probably doesn't give you a warning that he's

767
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,780
coming. We probably just have to be here with the pizza. It's not a problem.

768
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,640
Yeah, we can just order it and go out the other side. We'll order one pizza

769
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,960
and if he doesn't show up, we eat it. What a fucking tragedy that is. Not a

770
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,560
imagine that is yeah. We make our own box. Oh my God, we put we put some

771
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,440
live box out of wood. You know we do we put the wooden pizza box. Damn, that's

772
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,220
a good place gets us. We only get a seven because of presentation because the

773
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,780
presentation is so good. Exactly. We put a four or five flies in the box and

774
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,740
then close it for this

775
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,300
or yeah, a seven would be a ten for us for this. I don't care what the rating

776
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,460
is. No, I just want to get the rating is important and I want to get in a fight

777
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,540
with him and yeah, I want to walk down and be like a fucker. So you don't like

778
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,600
pizza yeah okay all right David Portnoy.

779
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:49,320
Lick him up and down yeah. I'm gonna start at your toes David Portnoy.

780
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,920
Portnoy's complaint is gonna be that he's too wet from my licking. Yeah

781
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,640
this guy's licking my entire body. Okay so that's something. I like the ones where

782
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,360
I've been watching all these pizza review videos. Didn't think you're a

783
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,360
I'm a Philip Roth fan. I only know the title.

784
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,360
I know.

785
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:17,360
We could also, we could plant homeless people, because he always has interactions with homeless people who walk by and they say, "Let me get a slice of this pizza."

786
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Wasn't one of them a crazy murderer?

787
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
Well, he did the, there was a guy with no arms.

788
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,360
That's what it was, wasn't it? A guy with no arms killed somebody or something?

789
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I don't know if he killed, he got in some kind of trouble.

790
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
There was some trouble he got in.

791
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,960
yeah, but he did one where a guy with no arms walked up and was like I don't

792
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,960
know what he did. He probably not not in at a place. I think all he can do

793
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,060
only rude thing a guy with no arms can do is shake your head and kill

794
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,120
somebody apparently or hurt somebody. It's not like there's something that

795
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:48,800
that guy did, but I don't know what it is, but then he was like slander this

796
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,100
man's name. Well, he'll unless he did something very bad, the guy without arms.

797
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,540
Yeah, the guy without arms. You don't want to slander one slander, even though

798
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,500
apparently an assault or murderer. Yeah, but we don't know. We don't remember what

799
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,800
he did. We don't know who we killed. Yeah, you know, is the truth. We could be

800
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,000
a full family. Hey, that that bread Dave's killer bread. Did he kill? Yeah,

801
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,560
because it says he's an ex inmate, right? But then he went back to jail

802
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,120
recently. Oh, shit. And his name is the name. Why? If you have your whole thing

803
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,640
is that you name the bread killer bread. God, if I was working at like some

804
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,540
some shitty insider trading, horrible click bait online news website yeah and

805
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:35,280
I got wind of a story of a scoop of somebody choking to death on Dave's

806
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,640
killer bread. I would be like literally my family is we're going on a month

807
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,260
long vacation yeah by literally we are getting a tire hitting one hundred

808
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,720
billion clicks on this one. This is going to be the biggest right the

809
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,000
headline as if we I don't think it's funny. I want to pass tweets in the

810
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,000
vertical yeah, yep, say New York man chokes to death on Dave's on piece of

811
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,180
Dave's killer bread. Yeah, would that be what's the great roll in as people say

812
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,040
seriously yeah seriously seriously you could even make this the country

813
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,560
seriously dot dot dot seriously

814
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,500
my grandma loves that bread, but she said she doesn't care for the packaging.

815
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:18,200
I don't like how many seeds there are in it. I'm done with this healthy bread.

816
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,660
Oh, my God, I hate seeds and bread. You know what the only bread people should

817
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,400
be eating is sourdough. I like I've had sourdough or peasant bread. I want to

818
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,280
get some I was just thinking about this. I want to get some bread from a bakery

819
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,400
instead of the grocery store. You got it, but then you got to get home. You

820
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,140
slice it yourself and your whole house becomes crumbs. No, it doesn't matter.

821
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,160
Just clean the crumbs. Yeah, but that's another slice it on the on the cutting

822
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,080
board. So I'm not slicing like on the floor. Yeah, my cutting board is ten by

823
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,680
ten, because that's where the crumbs are getting. You're getting ten by ten

824
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,120
pieces of bread. I'm a very dull loaf. No, the crumbs are going to a ten by ten

825
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,160
area. Why? How are you? Are you cutting with a chainsaw? Ten feet by ten feet?

826
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,720
Yeah, ten feet by ten feet. How are you throwing these crumbs around? What is

827
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,880
this? Because I am really strong. Are you just blowing? Are you going? Yeah, to

828
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,200
get them out of the way. That's a crazy way to cut bread. I think it's fucking

829
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,480
normal. Also, I don't have an ability to cut a really thin slice of bread, which

830
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,440
when I get it pre sliced at the store, it's pretty easy to cut bread thin. Are

831
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,500
not even that serrated blade. How thin do you need it? Do you need it? Yeah, the

832
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,580
thing is, I'll cut a giant lettuce burger, so he probably wants to cut it

833
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:29,860
so thin it's not even again again. I get attacked for just living my life,

834
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:35,380
just living a normal life in a weird way. A lettuce hamburger, a lettuce by

835
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,780
the way, when I say let us hamburger, the burgers, not let us the buns are.

836
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,140
We don't know that you can be chopping. You'll be chopping up lettuce, putting

837
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,840
and maybe you do like an eighty twenty twenty eighty romaine twenty

838
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,400
iceberg

839
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,800
eighty romaine twenty iceberg, twenty meat and then twenty pieces of lettuce

840
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,560
on each side of the burger. No, I don't do that

841
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,000
chunks of lettuce in the burger

842
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,920
salad burger. That's fusion. That's a

843
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,080
salad. That's fusion. You guys like salad. Oh my God. Wait. A burger is

844
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,920
literally tri fusion between meat, cheese and bread. Holy fuck and tomato.

845
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,360
yeah well you can and stop you. Toppings don't get included in top things.

846
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,740
It can be. I think it is

847
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,800
I think they could who invented the salad. What region does the sound or

848
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,200
so let's think Salad France

849
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,400
has to be France. It's got to be France. Who else would invent such a

850
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,320
disgusting food? That's right. A gross green food. It's a way from you know

851
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:39,360
it's fucked up is when you realize like Caesar salad is an eighty year old

852
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,720
convention right. So I would say that this is kind of that's kind of a

853
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,000
thing that it's been around all that you're driving right now forever. This

854
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,640
is kind of air so interesting dot com yeah. Call you when you read the

855
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,880
recipes. They have the article before the rest of you read the recipe for

856
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:57,720
Caesar, Caesar salad dressing, Caesar salad dressing, and you read the

857
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
article. I read a little bit of it.

858
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,480
Yeah, I like some of them. Some of them are nice

859
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
the story at the beginning at the beginning

860
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:16,160
but Caesar salad that's crazy man. There's a story at the beginning. I'm

861
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,880
like what the fuck are they going to say about Caesar salad and then you learn a

862
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,600
little fact and you're like oh that's what they have to say about Caesar.

863
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,880
Every one of those articles is just my

864
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,600
my husband's. My husband is picky. My husband is addicted to Caesar salad

865
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,040
right now. He will only eat Caesar salad. I'm a job, no chicken. I jumped to the

866
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:38,160
recipe. I jump to the recipe every time. I go on reader mode on my phone, man. I

867
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:38,600
jump to that

868
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,800
I jump to the recipe every time, but I wanted to see what these people had to

869
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,920
say was different about Caesar salad. So who invented the Caesar salad if it

870
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,120
wasn't a- Caesar. Caesar who? I don't remember, but it's Caesar and he was

871
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,560
working at some restaurant in,

872
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,000
was it Baja California or somewhere in California? Was it Baja California or

873
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,560
somewhere? It was somewhere in California, but it made me realise that

874
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,680
the Caesar salad, Caesar salad is a Mexican, is Mexican food. Is Baja California

875
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,640
in California? I thought it wasn't. It's in Mexico. Yeah, but it's Mexican food,

876
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,720
Caesar salad is Mexican food. I didn't realize that.

877
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,120
Why do they serve it at an Italiano restaurant?

878
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,120
Exactly. What the hell is going on?

879
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,120
Caesar is Italian.

880
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Caesar is an Italian name.

881
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,120
Italianos are so...

882
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:24,120
I'm pretty sure, I might be misremembering this, but I'm sure the Caesar salad is a Mexican invention

883
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,120
and it was served at a Mexican restaurant and they would make it table side food.

884
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,120
I guess salad is probably...

885
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,120
I mean, because we were hunters first and then we started getting the plants.

886
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,660
gathering, Neolithic era type vibe.

887
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,960
Jumiel, can you pull up the history of Caesar salad?

888
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,820
The first salad was probably berries and animal skin instead of leaves.

889
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,700
I'm sure they didn't invent dressing for some time after.

890
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,920
Yeah, that was probably a long time.

891
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,280
Because hunter-gatherer and dressinger.

892
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,020
Dressinger, chef-er.

893
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,040
Yeah, we didn't...

894
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,540
Is that a gatherer job?

895
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,560
Dressing?

896
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,580
Dressing.

897
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,200
Well, if you find dressing, that can be a gathering.

898
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,220
That's a combination, a combiner.

899
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,240
That'd be great.

900
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:06,320
a bottle of cans out behind a dinosaur's cave. Well, they probably just used blood.

901
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:11,540
Blood was the original dressing for sure. Monkey blood, monkey blood. Would you

902
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,620
get a monkey brain? What? Yeah, I would. I would really want to know it was

903
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,860
prepared right because that you can get some fucked up disease. I'm watching

904
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,020
some very strange videos last night of people eating. We're watching porno

905
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,620
together. We're not watching porno. I have to do or you don't even say that

906
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,260
We're watching porno together on discord alone. What videos

907
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:38,960
pussy destruction. We didn't watch. This is not a tab. She is dressing. You can't

908
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,560
click on pussy destruction on a

909
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:45,060
right. Can you pull up two things for me? Can you pull up the history Caesar salad

910
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:48,660
and pussy destruction? Don't pull up either of these men or just maybe you

911
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,360
could fusion them and look up pussy Caesar salad. It already has anchovies

912
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:53,660
in it.

913
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,060
Down low, down low, down low. Okay, thank you.

914
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,640
Yeah, and that's another thing I want to talk about. Women, wash your

915
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,160
pussies. This shit is starting to taste like disgusting fish and smell like it

916
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,640
too. I can smell you at the movie theater and it makes me want to leave.

917
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,340
I'm trying to watch, I'm trying to watch poor things. I'm getting enough of

918
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,600
that on the screen. I'm trying to watch Wonka and think of sweet candy. All I

919
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,260
smell is your fucking disgusting thing. The nose was a damn 4D movie.

920
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,840
I walked into a fish farm over there. I'm watching the Meg to

921
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,900
that's

922
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:41,980
no, no, you know, you know every showing of the Meg to every matinee. They got

923
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,280
the four D yeah yeah didn't take a shower after the gym. I understand it

924
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,920
happens to guys all the time. The difference is, but the different is for

925
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,760
us. We's on our balls. We smell like cool animals. Yeah, we smell like bulls

926
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,400
wolf in here. We smell like a dog. Is there an alpha dog wolf in here? We

927
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,940
smell like a dog that has never had its teeth brushed. Yep, not washing my

928
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,880
balls, people walking around, thinking there's a- it's on the news. There's a

929
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,040
wild animal wolf around. We can't see him, but we're sure he's here. Everyone

930
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,640
can smell him all over the city. Scaring everybody in the city. People think

931
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,440
that something happened at the zoo. Somebody has smelled a wolf downtown.

932
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,760
Somebody has smelled a wolf downtown. Women are losing their minds, going

933
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,100
crazy. This is what- this is what news reports were like back in the B.C.

934
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:27,020
sometimes yeah that's true back went before we had nobody could really hear

935
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,780
them. Yeah it wasn't that effective. There was a guy to a I smelled a bear.

936
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,300
They had a one rock on a pile of rocks. They pick up a break in rock camcorder

937
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,640
breaking rocks. There is no they would call breaking old

938
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,660
the old

939
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:50,940
breaking old. I was watching the old smell the breaking old. There is a new

940
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:56,960
cave painting of a fish. We found something in the water and we decided

941
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,640
to paint it

942
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:04,280
old is a good idea. This would be an entire sketch video. This is a

943
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,120
sketch right here. The old old old and you would have the instead of the

944
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:14,820
weather man you would have WBC. There we go WBC. Well, that would be woke.

945
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,160
Let's just go WBC yeah, but it's not enough letters to sound like it that

946
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:23,660
launch is for is for entertainment or just bct entertainment portion. Bctv is

947
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,920
good because then we don't have the wokeness and then it has for what the

948
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,580
for the

949
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,460
bc thing is so funny because they try to make it woke, but it's still they

950
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,620
didn't change anything. It's the Christian era. Well, it's common era.

951
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,900
Yeah, I thought it's still like well, you know we're going to change the name,

952
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:42,020
so it's not I know Domini yeah, but it's still going to be all centered around

953
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:42,540
Jesus. Yeah,

954
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:47,740
also, we're going to say that after Jesus born of stuff started being common

955
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:52,860
yeah, I was told growing up that which makes a common Jesus W. The B. C. Was

956
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,420
before Christ and A. D. Was after death. No, that's what I was told. I know

957
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:01,620
Domini. I know Domini year of our Lord. My education was not good after death.

958
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,460
He was boy died in 33 man.

959
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,460
He was born in zero.

960
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,460
So there would have been a kind of no man's land zone in the middle there.

961
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:10,860
Well,

962
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:17,260
that was before Christ was killed. Can you imagine how lit that shit was? Him

963
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,840
is there a birth from zero to thirty three

964
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:25,420
wait. Can you imagine how lit it was the the night of one BC yeah, that's

965
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,800
like God, like for it's like nine to nine and damn I heard all our our

966
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,840
scrolls are going to break

967
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:40,720
all of our abacus is can't handle zero, zero, zero, yeah, I wish we were on a

968
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,500
BC type type year schedule right now. We were just counting down to something I

969
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,560
like of right now. If it was like imagine right now, it's like twenty five

970
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:53,080
be X. That before so and it's like X is like a mystery because then you do the

971
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:57,400
let's do that X, then you go five. This is kind of like the variable

972
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,960
five, four, three, two, one zero

973
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:06,020
people throwing sand in the air. Oh my God, no fireworks yeah yeah, maybe

974
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:09,600
fireworks, maybe throwing throwing flint. So when it falls, another than

975
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,300
the fireworks, trying to hit another piece of flint in the air to make just

976
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:17,140
one tiny spark. They had dragons back then, so fireworks weren't as impressive. I

977
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,140
guess that's a need to invent. I don't really care so much about fireworks at

978
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,340
all. I don't like fireworks. Dude, I saw there's this, maybe I shouldn't talk

979
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:26,780
about this. What? It's kind of sad. Okay, alright, don't talk about it. Oh, I

980
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:33,260
say it. It was a, I was at the, at the dog park with my dog, and these kids

981
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,900
start, like, gathering up, and I'm like, 'Oh, they're going to try to run around

982
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,980
or something. My dog's going to chase one and eat one.' And then they started,

983
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:43,260
Saturday and then they launched a firework and I was like fuck I got out

984
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,320
of here because the dogs gonna go crazy. Yeah, so he's like trying to run to the

985
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:50,580
fireworks, kill himself, Kirk a band shotgun directly to the head and we run

986
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:55,000
away and I was like what are they even celebrating and they were seemed so so

987
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,560
happy they were having like the time of their lives. I saw them setting something

988
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,520
up come back the next day. It was like they set up a memorial photo for like a

989
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:07,100
dead kid who passed on. It's fireworks for it was fine. I was like this is not

990
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,700
not appropriate. That's not yeah. That's an excuse. That's a clever excuse.

991
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,280
None of these kids knew this this kid probably and they were like there's

992
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,740
probably that's probably the friend who's alive. Yeah, true. Are you doing

993
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,980
it as an excuse to launch fire? They just wanted to launch fireworks and now

994
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:21,820
there's a candle

995
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:28,240
that's on or lit. It's not probably not lit for long. It's cold out. That's

996
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,840
what I thought, but then I went yesterday. It's fucking still lit and

997
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,060
invincible candle probably too cold for the one of these prank birthday cake

998
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,720
candles that shoots by the way you guys ever try to get me with that shit. The

999
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,200
one you blow out it comes back. I will blow. I will be the first to blow it out

1000
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:46,120
first try. I won't even know I have to do a spit on it. Yeah. Well, I spit on

1001
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,600
everything yeah, yeah, that's true. So I make my mark on different things,

1002
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,400
especially my birthday. I'm going to spit on my birthday cake. So you can

1003
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,160
have my brother did that my brother did that my aunt yelled at him. Your aunt

1004
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,360
seems like a bit of a party pooper. She is

1005
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,980
Fuck you. Fuck you so much. Okay, so tonight I'm going to be in Tampa with a couple more

1006
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:17,900
shows. We've already done the first two. I'm sure they went so poorly. Hopefully I spent

1007
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,820
the day at Busch Gardens today, Saturday. What else? What else? What's going on?

1008
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:24,820
What else do we got?

1009
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,260
Let's see. The shareholder meeting is what, the 28th?

1010
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,660
Yes. It's a Sunday this time, right?

1011
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,920
Sunday night, the twenty eighth, I think is what we said and Julio will correct me

1012
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,620
right now if I'm wrong, but if not, he'll I guess stay silent because he doesn't

1013
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:42,560
like talking and guys let's let's recruit probably ten to fifty people each

1014
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,560
person who listens to this. Yeah, I just want everyone to send out a blast sign

1015
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:53,780
of text to ten to fifteen of your guys. Yo, what's up? We set a goal a long time

1016
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,980
ago. They removed patron goals. We it took us two years to not hit it of

1017
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,160
$20,000 to make a movie and we will honor this. Yes?

1018
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,160
Yes. Sure, we'll honor it, I guess.

1019
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,120
You don't sound excited to be making an amazing movie.

1020
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,120
Well, just keep your eyes on the news.

1021
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:12,040
When you get kicked all the time

1022
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,040
by people who don't want to see your goals,

1023
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,040
and people who take money away,

1024
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,040
and people who kick you proverbially

1025
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,040
and treat you like absolute ass and shit.

1026
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,040
Who?

1027
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,040
The fans.

1028
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,440
my fans. They kick all three of us and

1029
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,940
I never get kicked. Well, when they people just say down, they keep you down

1030
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:36,900
by not letting you fulfill your dream by not by withholding money by withholding

1031
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,340
money,

1032
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,440

1036
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:57,960
please return it at patreon.com forwards on the on the for real talk, though, basically

1037
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,520
big things as fuck will happen this year, but we can only do if we get $100,000 at the

1038
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:10,200
very minimum. Yeah, I'm sorry to say that, but it's true. Okay, thank you. Bye.

1039
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,480
Well, here's another fast food one. Can I sue McDonald's over there being snot like

1040
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,680
substance in my drink? I don't know if intentional or not still unacceptable during COVID.

1041
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,680
just was getting some hot acts and hot chocolate to start of my morning.

1042
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,480
I've never had any problems before at any other locations till this

1043
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,440
morning. I order hot chocolate with my meal, but when I drank it,

1044
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:36,100
it tasted like a slimy gooby

1045
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:53,980
like a slimy

1046
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:55,780
dude.

1047
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:02,280
That is such an amazing line to be given. I just need to go to court. It

1048
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,320
taste it like a slimy gooby. Your honor, it tasted like a slimy gooby.

1049
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,860
The gooby, please bring out the slimy gooby. The taste was completely

1050
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,540
off and had gooey substance all over it. Really don't have words to

1051
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,920
describe texture. It was same texture like snot, used my fork and scraped

1052
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,620
up lots from the inside. I have photos I can provide if needed,

1053
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:23,320
just need place to send them. I'm never usually that guy, but this is

1054
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,200
my first time ever actually feeling like I have to leave a report.

1055
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,960
I'm open to being tested or whatever to prove it's not my own.

1056
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,580
He kept the slimy gooby?

1057
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,740
He kept the gooby, man.

1058
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,740
He took a photo, but how are you gonna test it?

1059
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,980
Yeah, he's keeping it, man.

1060
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,980
He kept it.

1061
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:42,420
I had so many of this type of thing of finding slime or gooby.

1062
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:43,420
This should be a gooby.

1063
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,420
You looked up gooby?

1064
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,420
No, I didn't.

1065
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,780
It's gooby, you know, the material.

1066
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:49,100
This is not a one for the...

1067
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,780
Everyone keeps it, is what I'm saying.

1068
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,860
I still have it.

1069
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,940
I put it in my fridge.

1070
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,060
I don't think that this is a problem for the United States court system.

1071
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,940
This is a problem for Maury.

1072
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,940
This is a more even...

1073
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:03,940
It is not your gooby!

1074
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,940
*laughter*

1075
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,940
It's not your gooby?

1076
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,940
Ladies and gentlemen, it's not my fucking gooby!

1077
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,940
He does the backflip, yeah.

1078
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,940
50 backflips in a row, not my gooby.

1079
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,940
The gooby does not belong to you!

1080
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,940
