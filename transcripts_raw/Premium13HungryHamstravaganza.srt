00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
Hey everybody, Caleb here. I'm editing the episode this week which is why it sounds like

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:18,400
dog shit. Cameron is busy at the Chocolate Penis Festival. I do not have the premium

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:28,440
theme song on my computer so I will be doing just a rendition of it just to lead into the

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:39,160
episode. Alright, here it goes. If this is premium content, if you are not a premium

00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,700
Okay, here's the episode.

8
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
Nice.

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,200
I found this action figure that I had.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeah?

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
You got a new toy?

12
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, I got a new toy.

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,200
That looks like half Boba Fett, half Chewbacca.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Yeah.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,320
Is that what it is?

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
It's Chewbacca from Shadows of the Empire.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
What's that?

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,880
It's a Nintendo 64 Star Wars game.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Okay.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,600
when Boba Fett disguises, or Chewbacca disguises himself.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,840
- You're already fucking it up.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
- Yeah, I don't care anymore.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,120
- No, no. - You really lost

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,800
- He disguises himself as a bounty hunter.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,520
- At some point, these premium episodes

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,440
just become about Star Wars.

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
- Yeah, no, it's-- - Oh, I did have a question

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080
about Star Wars I was thinking about this morning

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,320
I wanted to ask.

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,200
Did Kylo Ren have a Darth name?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,440
- Darth, Darth, Darth. - No, okay.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,320
- I don't think he did.

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,700
- All right, that's what I thought.

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,840
- Yeah.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,680
- Darth. - Yeah.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Really shows how little they thought out

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,480
the

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:17,480
I

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,340
I'm gonna probably be like Darth the Lonely Island because I'd be like the funny

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,940
I actually I want to change mine to no you can't you're a mind. No -

41
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:33,700
Darth Lucario Darth Luke Skywalker. Oh, oh wait. I'm Darth mew Cameron won't let me use my freaking

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,480
Yeah, I'm already I can't see already because you were shining a fucking flashlight in my eye. I literally still have spots in my vision

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
Dude, you're gonna make him crash the plane. Yeah, you are probably gonna give me a migraine if you do that anymore

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
That's why I threw it over there.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Okay.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Yeah.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
Did you see how bright that thing was?

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,920
Yeah, that thing, you could have knocked a Cameron out of the sky with that.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,280
You could have given Cameron a migraine in the sky.

50
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
Yeah.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
Wow, Cameron da woman.

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Oh my god, Cameron da woman?

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Cameron da woman, he loves to get migraines.

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,680
We have to stop talking about this right now.

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,640
If we talk about this, I have to go.

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,760
Or at least turn my video off.

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
I'll be drooling all over the place.

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Cameron da woman.

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Cameron da woman.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
Don't even say it.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,560
You can say girl Cameron, that doesn't bother me.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,640
But a whole ass woman?

63
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,560
Ooooo.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,280
T minus like three days until I'm back in the greatest city on planet earth.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,280
You're pretending dude, you're not coming back.

66
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm not pretending, I am coming back.

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm coming back. I'm coming back because I have an appointment.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Yeah, an appointment to pretend.

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
You got a dick appointment with the guy.

70
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Yeah, I got a dick appointment with both of your moms.

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
No.

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Yeah, I do. We're meeting up at the rec center.

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
With both of Patrick's moms.

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
No.

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Yeah, with Patrick's two moms.

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
They're going to peg Caleb.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
That's fine.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Both of Patrick's moms are going to peg Caleb.

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
I don't have two moms.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm realizing right now I didn't give the mechanic my key so I don't know if he's gonna be able to get into my car

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,200
but

82
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,960
He could figure it out. Yeah, I don't think good

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:27,760
He's gonna huge. Yeah. Yeah, he's all corn fed boy. Yeah, they don't make them like that up in Boston

84
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,640
Just a big motherfucker. What do you?

85
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,920
What do you mean? It's a just like, you know, just like six six and like

86
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,520
What about my cousin Timmy?

87
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
Your cousin Timmy?

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
My cousin Timmy is 6'8".

89
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
6'8"?

90
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Uh huh.

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
How did you end up 4'1"?

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
His dad is like Swedish or something.

93
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Oh, the Swedes are known for being the tallest kind of people.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Yeah.

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Not...

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Well his dad's not like Swedish, but like...

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
The Vikings, dude.

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
No, the Vikings weren't that big, it's just that the Indians were really small.

99
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,680
I don't know if they're Swedish at all. I just remember they had a thing at their house that said "Schmorgasbord"

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
[laughter]

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,960
I think I just kind of assumed like, "Oh yeah, no, like Jeff's side of the family is Swedish."

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
They just had a bunch of Legos.

103
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Yeah, they're Swedish.

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Actually, the plural is "Lego."

105
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Actually, the plural is "Lego."

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I don't care.

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Shut the fuck up.

108
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
A bunch of people said that recently on, what was it?

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Oh, your toy review video.

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,440
Somebody said that and I was like I never saw somebody be pedantic about that before.

111
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
About Lego?

112
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
Yeah, I never heard that before.

113
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
The plural of Legos is Lego.

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,380
It's like shrimp.

115
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,400
It's like shrimp, fish, or sheeps.

116
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
It's like Xbox.

117
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah.

118
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Yeah.

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
What about Xboxes?

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Would you say Xboxes?

121
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
You would say X-Bi.

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
X-Bi?

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
X-Bi.

124
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
X-Bi.

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
R/X-Bi.

126
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,640
That's the sequel to r/gamers.

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,640
Yeah.

128
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Yeah.

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
X-bye.

130
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
X-bye.

131
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Me and Patrick were laughing about a guy named Mr. Damn Delicious.

132
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Oh yeah.

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
Mr. Damn Delicious.

134
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Mr. Damn Delicious.

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Mr. Damn Delicious Hut Shack.

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
And it's his restaurant.

137
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Hut Shack?

138
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
It's a hut slash shack.

139
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
He can't decide whether or not he wanted it to be a hut or a shack.

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
You know what?

141
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Fuck it.

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
We'll go name it.

143
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm not going to name it.

144
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm not going to name it.

145
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm not going to name it.

146
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I'm not going to name it.

147
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,780
name it both. It's yeah it's a hut and a shack. Mr. Brush my brush my damn teeth.

148
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,300
Mr. Brush that was mean. I'm Mr. Damn Delicious this is my son Mr. Too Damn Delicious and we

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:50,160
had opened this hut slash shack. Yeah and this is my daughter Ruth. Yeah my daughter

150
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,320
daughter girl, Mrs. Girl, Miss Lady.

151
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Mr. Lady.

152
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,560
This is my daughter, Mr. Delicious Pussy.

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,920
Alright, too soon.

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Yeah too soon.

155
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,800
Yeah I forgot that I killed her with all the sex I had with her.

156
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,720
That's why you can't come to Boston, because you have court dates.

157
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,200
The statute of limitations on killing a woman in Massachusetts is about to go out.

158
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,560
It's only three months.

159
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,880
You killed Mrs. Delicious Pussy.

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,600
You killed Mr. Delicious Pussy in an intersection.

161
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,440
That's why you had to get your car repaired.

162
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Yeah.

163
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Yeah.

164
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,520
I was running through an intersection with a huge boner and I ran into her car.

165
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
You were standing there.

166
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,680
You were standing in your car, first of all.

167
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah, I was.

168
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:55,360
I like that you guys have an audience when you're at the cat house.

169
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
And then one day, he might have been a prisoner.

170
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,840
Yeah, he might have been, but Fucker was in the window and he like started slamming his

171
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,080
grabber on the window.

172
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,280
And he was like slamming it at the cat and then like, I don't remember, I wasn't home,

173
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,520
I remember that, but Dom was telling me that like, she like stared at him like, "What the

174
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
fuck are you doing?"

175
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
And he just looked at her and then walked away.

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,800
He was trying to get the cat, dude.

177
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
He was trying to grab it.

178
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,680
He didn't know there was a window there.

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,040
He walks around with a name tag.

187
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Yeah.

188
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,440

corporate record

195
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,080
It's actually bad, because he'd be in there just grabbing every...

196
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,280
Well no, because he can get into CVS because of the automatic doors.

197
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,080
Be like that scene in Good Time where the...

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,680
Where Venny Safdie just runs through the door.

199
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,580
Exactly.

200
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,880
I just found out that the...

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,980
Runs...

202
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,380
Through the window.

203
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,880
Dives through your window.

204
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,780
With the grabber outstretched.

205
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,660
I just found out that he's not mentally retarded, the guy in Good Time.

206
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
Yeah, he's the director of the movie.

207
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,660
Yeah, that really threw me for a loop.

208
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,860
Yeah, he's got, yeah.

209
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,900
I was like, oh, they got this guy from my school.

210
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
I knew this guy.

211
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Yeah, from my classroom.

212
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,900
He was a famous director.

213
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Yeah.

214
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
I thought it was Patrick.

215
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Yeah, it could have been.

216
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
I thought it was Patrick's.

217
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
That was a really good movie.

218
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
That movie's awesome.

219
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,900
I love that movie.

220
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,900
I might like that movie more than I like this movie.

221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
I think it's a good movie.

222
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,380
that I think I like that movie more than uncut gems to be honest I mean hey I

223
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,440
think I don't want to talk about I don't want to talk about uncut gems too much

224
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,720
because I know we'll just get into it with Caleb no it's also it's just like

225
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,280
redundant for pod yeah guys to talk about I enjoy I mean there's something

226
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,560
good time is like enjoyable to watch yeah good time and uncut gems isn't no

227
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,920
good time stressed me out a little bit more but it was I liked it more I liked

228
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,760
I like uncut gems because it wasn't as stressful as good times.

229
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
But then again I saw good time multiple times, I only saw uncut gems once.

230
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
That's true.

231
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I love that movie Waiting.

232
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah.

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
That movie?

234
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,160
You know when Luis Guzman does the chicken skin?

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,240
He's like you gotta play with your nuts.

236
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,280
And Dane Cook puts his balls on the stuff.

237
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:33,020
There's that scene where he's like a little bit of guacamole for the steak and then Louis

238
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,280
Guzman's like, "Hey man, don't mix Mexican and Continental."

239
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
Then he puts his dandruff on it.

240
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,520
Exactly, dude.

241
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,120
That's what working in a restaurant is all about, is just putting all kinds of your balls

242
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,800
in your fucking nuts.

243
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,080
Showing your head chef your penis and balls.

244
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,720
It's about cracking your balls onto the skillet like an egg and then cooking that and serving

245
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,320
it to a nice lady.

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,960
And then you put your dick in balls through the, you take it and you take the jet.

247
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
The tamper, yeah.

248
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,320
You put it through the meat grinder and you grind your dick and your balls into a beef

249
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
patty.

250
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,320
No, no, I was saying the dish washing like jet thing they got.

251
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,680
You know, the handle.

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,240
It's called a sink.

253
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,560
No it's not the sink, the thing that you use to spray the dishes is.

254
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
The nozzle, the hose.

255
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
That's the fucking word I was looking for.

256
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Hoes.

257
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Hoes.

258
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560

277
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Oh. My... My...

Caleb just spilled orange juice all over his laptop.

279
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,760
Well, luckily you're the one. You said you'd edit it today. That's true.

280
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,320
I don't have time. I'm doing stuff after this. That's fine. I think it only cut out for a second anyway.

281
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay. We could still hear you.

You spilled all your juice on your computer. You spilled your juice? I didn't. You spilled your juice.

00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,080
I take it back. You take it back? I... no, no, you take it back. I don't have any juice.

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,120
So you don't take it back. So you don't take it back that you did spill your juice.

286
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm having some of the worst times of my life and I'm gonna blur my background so you guys can't see my house.

287
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,360
I think it makes it slower. Yeah when you blur your background, okay, then I'll undo it. Okay

I'm doing baby hurry up and undo it. Are we standing now we can see

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,200
substance is that? Where does it come from? It comes from your mom.

293
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,400
Nose, mouth, ass. Nose, mouth, ass and front. I don't want to say what the

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,120

I don't, you guys.

301
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
You got a straw from the store.

302
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,200
And it ain't even reusable.

303
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,160
You guys are scaring me.

304
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,760
You guys are seriously terrifying me to a degree that I haven't been terrified in ages.

305
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,680
Yeah, what are you looking in a mirror?

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm not looking in a mirror.

307
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,400
Hey, turn your computer on.

308
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,760
That's why you're terrified.

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,520
Your screen's not on, you're looking into a mirror.

310
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm terrified of you guys.

311
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,360
should be. It's a scary time. Scary time to be a man. It's scary times out here.

312
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,440
Yeah. See, you can't even listen to a podcast nowadays. Without getting scared

313
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,000
immediately. Without being scared and terrified right to your bones. Mm-hmm. All

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,280
the way into your bones. See, I bet whoever's listening to this, you two got

315
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,920
scared even more the second time because you were expecting to never have that

316
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Happen again, I got scared like a

317
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,600
Like a bat flew at me or if I saw a spider crawling along the ground you got coronavirus from a bat

318
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,540
I got beer virus. Yeah, I think this is might be the one coronavirus. I think it might we might know reached it

319
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,800
I think this might be the pandemic to iPhone app game. Oh, no, they won't because if you notice the

320
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,900
The notice only all the videos that people like falling over is all just like really old people

321
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,880
Like that's just who dies. That's yeah people who die when they get the flu. Yeah, I can it's not spreading fast

322
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,120
Like it's not like it airborne. It's just like it's probably just like a root born

323
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,160
It's this morning illness survive this one. You know, if there's ever a poop born illness, I'm going down with the shit

324
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,880
You know, it's not worth taking a break. The coronavirus is poop born

325
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,120
It's um, if it's really from what they're saying it is like a bad Corona China, but oh, yeah

326
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,320
Yeah, what is that? I don't know. I've seen that video a hundred times. The bat soup thing?

327
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,700
Yeah, yeah. It's awesome. I would never eat that. I didn't realize bats had teeth like

328
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:43,160
that. It's badass. It's bat. It's badass. Yeah. I would never eat a bat. I would eat

329
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,440
a bat if it was cooked and covered in chocolate. I don't think there's any meat that I wouldn't

330
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,080
eat. Yeah, that's a bat. I would not eat any brain because I don't want... I think if I

331
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,760
ate an animal's brain that was stupider than me, I would lose intelligence.

332
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,360
What's that brain disease you get if you eat brain?

333
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,800
It's called Cameron disease.

334
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,040
Mad brain disease.

335
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
I think it's mad brain disease.

336
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Yeah.

337
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
No it's not.

338
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Bad brains disease.

339
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,480
I think Bo Burnham must be related to Jeff Dunham.

340
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,360
Bad brains disease and you become a cool black punk.

341
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Just thinking about that.

342
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
They're not related.

343
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,560
Jeff Dunham and Bo Burnham?

344
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Probably his dad.

345
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,200

That was a really good one.

366
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,180
Yeah.

367
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,220
Yeah, I liked Dr. Amputee.

368
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,780
Yeah, Dr. Amputee was great.

369
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,820
Mr.

370
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,780
Gay Black Guy.

371
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,060
Mr. Gay Black Guy was one of Jeff Dunham's original puppets.

372
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,780
Yeah, he was one of the original puppets. He was like the early version of Kermit.

373
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,780
That was like his thing. Sam? Like when Kermit was Sam?

374
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,820
Yeah, exactly.

375
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Yeah, he was the, that was Mr. what was it? Big gay black guy?

376
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,920
Mr. Gay Black Guy.

377
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,800
Jiminy Cripple.

378
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,700
Jiminy Cripple was really good.

379
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Yeah.

380
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,020
It'd be so funny if all of Jeff Dunham's puppets were just like, it wasn't just him just being

381
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,220
like racist, it was just him being ableist.

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
Yeah.

383
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,220
All the possible disabilities.

384
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,220
The puppets in the wheelchair, yeah.

385
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,220
Yeah.

386
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Wheelchair Wally.

387
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,220
It's all wheelchair and then just a name.

388
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
I can't walk.

389
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,020
It's just like, "Jeff, what the fuck?"

390
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,220
"He's still making two million dollars or like a show."

391
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Yeah.

392
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Oh yeah.

393
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,220
It's so funny how like every ventriloquist is a Republican.

394
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,220
Yeah, Terry Fedor.

395
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Terry Fedor, Jeff Dunham.

396
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,220
I think to be a ventriloquist you have to have a certain cutting view of reality that

397
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,220
liberalism just doesn't let you have.

398
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,220
I also think maybe just a certain criticism of society. You know, you're you're you're

399
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,220
We're all the puppets. You have to be, you have to be a good thinker.

400
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:56,220
No, no, the thing is they realize they are like, they are both the puppeteers and sort

401
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,220
of the puppets of like, you know, the Koch brothers and big money from money, money,

402
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
big money guys.

403
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,220
They're the puppets of laugh.

404
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,220
They're the puppets, they're the, they're the Muppets of laughter.

405
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Titans of humor.

406
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
I hate it when people call a puppet a muppet.

407
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,220
Yeah, it's like it's a puppet, not a muppet.

408
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,220
I'm gonna call Dr. Thunder Dr. Pepper.

409
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,220
Yeah, that's like calling RC Cola an RC car.

410
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,220
Yeah, it's like calling Mountain Lightning a Mountain Dew, buddy.

411
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
They are not the same.

412
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
We are not the same.

413
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,220
You drink Mountain Lightning, I drink Baja Blast.

414
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,220
We are not the same guy.

415
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,620
My name is Caleb, your name is Patrick.

416
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,200
We are not the same.

417
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,960
I remembered this morning on the bus when yesterday Patrick was playing video games and wearing

418
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,660
a cowboy hat and I said he's playing Bread Bread Delicious 2.

419
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Oh yeah.

420
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I thought that was funny.

421
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Yeah.

422
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Bread Bread Delicious 2.

423
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
He's Bread Bread Delicious 2.

424
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
He is Bread Bread Delicious 2.

425
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,460
It's a good game.

426
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
That's Patrick's favorite game.

427
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
It's a good game.

428
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:11,460
run around as a cowboy and he just buys food from various Indians.

429
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,460
It's a game where you have to barter to get new bread.

430
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,460
It's an open world game and you go around and collect things to get bread.

431
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,460
You eat bread until your horse can't carry you anymore.

432
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,460
Yeah, and then the horse...

433
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,460
But then you get to ride the mule.

434
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,460
No, the mule is too small.

435
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,500
the mule also because you're so damn hungry.

436
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,740
And then you get rolled around the wild, wild west.

437
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,060
You get rolled around the whole map by a woman named Bonnie.

438
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,700
So it's kind of like a Katamari thing?

439
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

440
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,260
And then she's your wife and she has to dig through sort of a new butthole that's been

441
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,140
created by where your penis and balls are if she wants to touch it.

442
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,500
Yeah, that's in a video game.

443
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,340
And she does not want to touch it.

444
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,540
she doesn't want to touch it, but if you pay her enough bread, she'll do it.

445
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
She's also pretty fat.

446
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:08,500
That's in a video game, so it's not real.

447
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
No that's real.

448
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
That's what you do in real life.

449
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,900
That's in a real video game, but it's not in life.

450
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
No it's in real life.

451
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
It's what you do in real life.

452
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,940
Yeah, that's what you do for your job.

453
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,940
No, not true.

454
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,740
I'm going to come back to Boston.

455
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,180
I think I'm probably going to pick up kriyati.

456
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Kriyati?

457
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Yeah.

458
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
What is that?

459
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,600
It's a new form of creative karate that I have invented.

460
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Yeah.

461
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Karate, yeah.

462
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,380
It's where you can, it's sort of like karate but with more imagination.

463
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
It's basically you're doing karate.

464
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,460
It's karate that you can play.

465
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,620
It's karate, it's half, it's part karate, part play, all fun is what I have pitched it

466
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,620
as to the people we're going to be teaching it to.

467
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,580
I'm going to be doing Kung Fun.

468
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,420
It's like Kung Fu but it's fun.

469
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
You should do...

470
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,820
Yeah, I'm going to be doing Taekwondo, doing something fun.

471
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
That's another one I'm doing.

472
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Toy Chi.

473
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
Yeah, Toy Chi.

474
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Yeah, I'm going to be doing Toy Chi.

475
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,820
(cough)

476
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Just like 30...

477
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Just like 30 people dressed in gi on...

478
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
dressed in gis on the beach

479
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
playing with the...

480
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,820
with a Tonka truck.

481
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,820
(cough)

482
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
You okay?

483
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
What do you fucking think?

484
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Yes.

485
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
He's not doing good.

486
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm going to get back to Boston and I'm going to be doing Krav my favorite toys.

487
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:45,900
I'm going to be doing Hide and Seek.

488
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Let's play some hide and seek.

489
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Akido...

490
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Akido video games.

491
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Akido video games.

492
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
How about Akido?

493
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Akido video games.

494
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
I-v-d-o games.

495
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,900
Capuware running around in the backyard with my brothers.

496
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,900
These are just the most... these are martial funds.

497
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Yeah, these are just a few.

498
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Martial fun.

499
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Yeah.

500
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,900
Yeah.

501
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
Martial fun arts.

502
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
These are martial arts and crafts.

503
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Martial games.

504
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I'm pretty excited.

505
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Krav Maga games.

506
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Krav Maga games. There we go.

507
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Krav Maga games is basically regular Krav Maga but you get to take a nap in the middle.

508
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,900
No, it's um, they're gonna add Krav Maga to the new Call of Duty.

509
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,900
And you can do Krav Maga instead of a gun.

510
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Yeah, I think we should be able to, not only should we be able to play as women in Call of Duty, we should be able to play as IDF women.

511
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:49,380
The IDF should just be, just have like a 10 point like stat buff and be selectable in every

512
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
multiplayer game.

513
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:57,900
And you should, I think Call of Duty, they should make the IDF version of Call of Duty.

514
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,340
Yeah, Call of Shootie.

515
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Call of Shootie.

516
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
Because they shoot.

517
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,900
Yeah, that's what they would call it.

518
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,340
Yeah, no, it'd be a call of Cthulhu because that's

519
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
Don't they worship Cthulhu?

520
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:20,120
Yeah, the whole thing. Yeah, that's the thing. Didn't they make they made a call of Cthulhu game, right? Yeah

521
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,500
Yeah

522
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,140
There's it's like a tabletop RPG and then they I think they made a few video games of it

523
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,300
They're gonna be one that I know is good in but it's an older game what?

524
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,580
What a good call of Cthulhu game? Oh, yeah, they had it on PC

525
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,900
Yeah, it was like 2000 like mid-2000s. Yeah, and you you you like go insane

526
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,820
That's sort of a dance the mechanic, you know, I go insane

527
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,580
On the you have demon in your brain now. I am insane

528
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,660
I've been playing game

529
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,500
Yeah, I hate when I play game till I'm insane me too I'm ready to

530
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,020
Ready to be

531
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,940
Back in the back in the States, you know, I'm ready to be the president

532
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:14,380
When I get back to Boston, I'm also running for the governor of California

533
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,300
Nice. Yeah, like I like the governor cool. Yeah, I

534
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,420
think

535
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,820
Every state should have a governor. Mm-hmm, you know

536
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:31,260
They had a mentor was the Jesse Ventura was the governor

537
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Ace Ventura was the governor of Arizona.

538
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,260
Yeah, he gave animals the right to vote.

539
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,260
Yeah, he was crazy.

540
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,260
And he said "alrighty then" a lot.

541
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,260
He kept saying "alrighty then" and then every time he saw a trans person he vomited.

542
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Yeah.

543
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Him and the entire police force would just vomit for hours.

544
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
What a fucking awesome movie.

545
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,600
movie. Yeah, I loved that movie as a kid. I don't think I've ever seen it. Really?

546
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,480
We should watch it. I think I've seen the end of the second one.

547
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,760
With the vomiting? Yeah. You looked up that, you seeked out that scene. No, I saw the end of it because it was on

548
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,740
before, because it was on in the compilation of people vomiting and

549
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,920
trans people. Yeah. That Patrick watches every time before he goes to bed. That Comedy Central used to play.

550
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:33,640
day before the one hour they would play two Comedy Central presents and then go into Reno

551
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
911.

552
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Yeah.

553
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,840
So it would be vomiting at trans people compilation then two Nick Swartzon specials back to back

554
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,760
which were both called vomiting at trans people.

555
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,760
They should have compilations on TV.

556
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,680
They should have the compilation channel.

557
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,000
That's what Pluto is pretty much.

558
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's true, that is what Pluto is.

559
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah, they have like the... there's an app that is on the Apple TV or my mom's house

560
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,360
that is called... it's called "Don't Think" and you just... you click it and it just plays

561
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,400
videos, just random videos that are like five seconds long and my little brother will just

562
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,280
click that and watch... watch videos on "Don't Think" all day.

563
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,960
And I'm kind of sitting over here and I'm like, "How messed up is this that there's an app

564
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,680
called...

565
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,320
It's literally called Don't Think."

566
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,240
So I have been thinking about an app called Think.

567
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,040
You open it and it's Moby Dick.

568
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,480
It's a blank screen.

569
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
It's a blank screen with a picture.

570
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,700
How come they never made a movie of Moby Dick?

571
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
They did.

572
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
In the heart of the sea.

573
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,480
No, they should have made a movie that's just called Moby Dick.

574
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,320
- They did.

575
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,160
- When?

576
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,980
- They made it yesterday.

577
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,820
- What?

578
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,560
- Yeah, dude, they just made it.

579
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,400
- Then I missed the premiere.

580
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,880
- Your whole thing is, you missed the premiere.

581
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,720
You were invited.

582
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,840
- Not worth seeing it if I missed the premiere.

583
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
If I miss a premiere, I never see a movie.

584
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,480
- I only go to red carpet premieres.

585
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,160
That's the only way I see movies.

586
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,800
- Can we promise that in 10 years,

587
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,740
if we're not all married,

588
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,640
that we will make a Moby Dick movie?

589
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,880
(laughing)

590
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,720
- Yeah.

591
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,680
- Can we promise that?

592
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,240
- Can we make one when you get back to Boston?

593
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,840
We'll make a Moby Dick movie.

594
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
I mean, realistically, what even do we need for that?

595
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,040
A bathtub.

596
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,840
A bathtub.

597
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
A pretty big bathtub.

598
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,880
Not even that big.

599
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
A white whale.

600
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,320
That's Caleb.

601
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,600
No.

602
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,120
Caleb can play the white whale.

603
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,040
No.

604
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,640
I am Ahab.

605
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,000
No, you're not Ahab.

606
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
I'm Captain Ahab.

607
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,160
You're not Captain Ahab.

608
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,360
I'm Captain Ahab.

609
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,840
Make a Moby Dick movie.

610
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,720
Cameron's the peg leg.

611
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
That's Ahab, isn't it?

612
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,040

615
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,520
neither of you know when did you have it

616
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,880
finally yes mail the main character page page two hundred

621
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,640

623

costume. literally ace ventura played the Grinch and you fucking know it. no he played the Grinch's ass

625
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,280
yeah they had it was like a horse costume

626
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,560
Ace Ventura played the top of the Grinch and Dr. Seuss played the ass.

627
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,800
What if the Grinch was 15 feet tall? That movie would just be a kaiju movie.

628
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,640
They should make a kaiju Grinch movie. They should make a horror Grinch movie.

629
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,840
They did. It's called The Blue Grinch.

630
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,800
Oh no!

631
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,720
If they made The Blue Grinch I'd be so scared. Me too.

632
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,000
I would not want... If The Blue Grinch came to my house at 3 a.m.

633
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,820
i would not allow you to do it yet we watch this book in jay station videos

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,200
i don't know what you mean was to get our channel to one million subscribers

639
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,440

that he's already had a little mexican voice yet we have a lot of

654
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,660
but you know what it's so it makes no sense

655
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,660
but he um... so he'll just be like oh my god youtube

656
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,460
look oh who's at the door right now and then they'll open it and it'll just be like

657
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,160
his friend yeah just like their friend who's just like a black guy that they put

658
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,460
like uh... like a halloween and more

659
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,160

660
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,600
and they'll be like look it's a warlord let's make him play xbox one

661
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,600
him and his girlfriend. And his girlfriend, the entire time, his girlfriend is like, "What's

662
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,920
going on? What's happening right now?"

663
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,600
The funniest one was, this is before he had a girlfriend on the channel, but it was, "We

664
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
bought a child predator off the dark web."

665
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,080
Yeah, I love the idea that just the dark web is just only for just like, which I guess is

666
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,040
probably true, it's just for buying people. But not just people, it's for buying like...

667
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:03,560
of people. It's reminding me of Tekken characters. Yeah. Like different kinds of people that have

668
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,360
different movesets that you can just order to your house and they don't show, nobody delivers

669
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,760
them. They just walk over to your house. Right. They just get a notification on their phone and

670
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,200
they're like, "Ah shit, okay." Alright. I guess somebody bought me. Oh, there was a really good

671
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:25,400
one where he bought a copy of Minecraft off the dark web. Yeah. And it ends with Slenderman.

672
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
Oh my god, it's fucking terrifying.

673
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah.

674
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
With Slender Man in real life?

675
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Yeah.

676
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Oh shit.

677
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
No, no, like Slender Man in the game.

678
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Oh.

679
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
But, um, fucking...

680
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,440
Oh, on Amazon Prime.

681
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,400
I found him because on Amazon Prime it has like all of his videos and it says "I'm Jay

682
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Station Season 1."

683
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,320
Okay, so what do we...

684
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,200
So basically he says that his girlfriend is dead.

685
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,200
She died and all she ever wanted was a million subscribers on their channel.

686
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,200
So, I'm wondering, because he's going to bring the girlfriend back at some point.

687
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I'm wondering what...

688
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Oh my god, you guys, a million subscribers brought her back!

689
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Oh my god, she was pretending!

690
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,200
No, I think my theory is that they broke up and he can't run the channel anymore.

691
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Yeah, I mean...

692
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:34,160
I mean, I don't see why he would be lying.

693
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
It's he...

694
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
What the fuck?

695
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,800
These fucking gay ass guys keep coming and looking into the window to look at the cats.

696
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
It's so weird.

697
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,640
You guys look pretty funny in there, huh?

698
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
It's cause they...

699
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,600
I keep the window open cause they like to look out the window.

700
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,720
You should drop the shades on them.

701
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Yeah, I probably should.

702
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,460
person comes up and yell at them. What are you going to say? I'm going to say get the

703
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,460
fuck out of here. That will scare people. That will scare the hell out of people. Get the

704
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:11,800
fuck out of here. I told you get the fuck out of here. It's not worth it. I hope he didn't

705
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,240
take a picture of my house. No he just was looking at me. When he saw me looking at him

706
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,280
I put my hand up to him like that and then he went away. He was just there for a second.

707
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Dude, you have force powers.

708
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Yeah, I force choked him through the window.

709
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Yeah.

710
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
I seriously did.

711
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
We should get a prop challenge.

712
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
He's too far away now to ask, but I did.

713
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
People, whenever they look in the window.

714
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,280
We used to leave, we have like these toy axes, and we used to leave a toy axe in the window in our bedroom.

715
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,280
So it's like, all you can see is the shadow of an axe when you're walking down the alleyway if you look at our blinds.

716
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,700
That's totally think that you were like a murderer. They probably think you're an axe murderer like from Texas Chainsaw and Halloween

717
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,280
And that's that's why I did it so they would know not to come in

718
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,400
Yeah, they don't

719
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,160
You should have done like a gun

720
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,660
Yeah

721
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,760
It would be funnier if it was like you should absolutely get like an airsoft gun and just pointed at people when they

722
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,160
Look at you

723
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,520
Inside your home, it's not illegal. Yeah, it's stand your ground

724
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,320
Yeah, does Boston have stand your ground laws like New Hampshire?

725
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,040
No, no, Boston is like one of the one of the strictest. They don't have castles in cities

726
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Yeah, you can't you can't even have a knife in Boston. Yeah, that's true

727
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,840
Fucking New Hampshire though like if you even walk on someone's property

728
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,440
Like someone can have like someone could have like 500 acres of land and they could just drive around on an ATV

729
00:37:41,520 --> 00:38:03,640
the

730
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,640
You can just do whatever you want.

731
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
It doesn't really matter.

732
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,640
In England you can go on other people's property.

733
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
In England what?

734
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
In England you can go on other people's property.

735
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,640
You're allowed to walk through their property.

736
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
And they can't do anything?

737
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Yeah.

738
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,640
What if you go so slowly that you basically just live there?

739
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Then you get to live there.

740
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Yeah, no, because squatters' rights laws.

741
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Yeah.

742
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
I think it's a...

743
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,640
What if you move through their property at a rate of one inch per year?

744
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,800
Well, their property is only one inch. That's the maximum amount of property you're allowed

745
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
to have over there.

746
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
That's the max lot. Well, then that's even better because that means that you can just

747
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,320
hop from property to property one inch at a time.

748
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Yeah.

749
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
I would totally agree.

750
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
Oh, yeah. Today we are going to announce something very special.

751
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,160
Oh, yeah.

752
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
This is a huge addition to the Hamsterverse.

753
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah, we're announcing the lineup for the for the 2020 Hungry Hamster Hamstravaganza.

754
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Hamstravaganza, formerly known as Hamsterpalooza.

755
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Yeah, Hamsterpalooza.

756
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Hamsterpalooza, but we all know what happened to Palooza.

757
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Yeah.

758
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
The co-founder of the festival.

759
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Palooza.

760
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Palooza the whale.

761
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Yeah, Palooza the whale, who he was supposed to be on the lineup, but

762
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,160
He got stabbed in the eye. He was stabbed in the eye by a giant whale.

763
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,160
He was eaten by a bigger whale like in Phantom Menace.

764
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,160
Qui-Gon Jinn said that. Qui-Gon Jinn said that we're going to need a bigger whale.

765
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Yeah, there's always a bigger whale.

766
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,160
So anyway, that Hamstravaganza lineup.

767
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,160
"Hungry Hamster" is headlining, obviously.

768
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,160
"Hungry Hamster" is headlining, obviously.

769
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:04,160
It's kind of like Maddie Fest, the Maddie Matheson Festival in Toronto.

770
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
Yeah.

771
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,160
Except there's an even fatter guy and he's a hamster.

772
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
Yeah, and his name's Patrick.

773
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
No.

774
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
Patrick the Hamster.

775
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
No, it's not you, it's just a guy named, it's a hamster named Patrick the Hamster.

776
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Yeah, Patrick Doran the Hamster.

777
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,160
That's not who's there.

778
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
That is.

779
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
That's not who's there.

780
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
That is who's there.

781
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
That's who's there.

782
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
I'm looking at the lineup right now.

783
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,760
It's Patrick, Doren the Hamster, and then it's Dobrik the Dinosaur.

784
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,640
Yeah, Dobrik the Dinosaur will not be coming to Hamsterpalooza this year.

785
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
He's not Hamsterpalooza.

786
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
I just received the news.

787
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Yeah, it's not Hamsterpalooza.

788
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
What happened?

789
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
He isn't coming to Hamsterpalooza.

790
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
He's going to Hamstravaganza.

791
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Oh.

792
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Dumbass.

793
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Idiot.

794
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Okay.

795
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I thought that.

796
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Dobrik the Dinosaur will be there.

797
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
That's right.

798
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,600
And a lot of, there's been a lot of, it's been a bit tumultuous because yes, we do realize

799
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:56,320
Dobrik the dinosaur is technically a villain and technically in episode 6 of the Hungry

800
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,080
Hamster animated series he did betray the Hungry Hamster.

801
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:07,240
But he's trying to reform his image, he's trying to realize the error of his ways.

802
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,280
He's trying to reform his image, yeah exactly.

803
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,920
And we think he's probably back on the, he's trying to earn his spot back on the legion

804
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,920
He is the anti-hero of the season.

805
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
On the legion of animals.

806
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,920
He has nothing to do with the candy hamster, we can't stress that enough.

807
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,920
The candy hamster, he is completely cut off ties to the candy hamster.

808
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Although I am getting a little worried because I'm getting his request for tech for the show.

809
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,560
And Dobrik the dinosaur, it looks like he's asking, he's requesting in the green room

810
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,280
150 pieces of candy.

811
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Oh no.

812
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
Maybe he's just hungry.

813
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I don't know.

814
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Yeah, you're right.

815
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
He could just be hungry.

816
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
I don't know.

817
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm going to be...

818
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,520
And also, he also is asking for 50 pounds of C4.

819
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,920
Oh, he might be really hungry.

820
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,000
I mean, I hope so.

821
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,320
That's what, that's candy four, right?

822
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,280
That's candy four, which is the fourth level of candy.

823
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,040
Yeah, he's asking for 50 pounds.

824
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,160
Back to the lineup, another one of the headliners, Stained.

825
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Stained, yeah.

826
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,160
Making a big comeback this year.

827
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Yeah, it's gonna be awesome.

828
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,680
One of the few musical acts on the festival.

Yeah, and Disturbed.

They have their own little stage, a little section.

833
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160

00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,820
He'll eat one of you will replace one of your songs with the song a weird al parody of the song

854
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,060
Completely and and that song the original song will be erased from existence

855
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,080
Yeah, there's never gonna be another version of unless you saved it to your files

856
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:11,020
Yeah, unless you saved it to your hungry hamster SSD. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yes, we'll be on sale at the merch booth

857
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,920
Yeah, I heard that the tadpole twins are gonna make an appearance

858
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,820
on the Saturday

859
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,940
of the festival? The Saturday?

860
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,420
The Saturday day? Oh Saturday is Tuesday. With Rodney the fucking

861
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,340
rhino

862
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,300
is performing. Rodney the fucking rhino, one of the adult

863
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,020
one of the adult. He's the stand up comedian in the Hungry Hamster

864
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,380
but he does not get along with the tadpole. Rodney the fucking rhino is doing

865
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,480
he's doing like an after dark show

866
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,460
like you know

867
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,380
like uh... He shows his penis in the stadium. Hungry Hamster are uncensored

868
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:50,140
And so what they have is basically, it's like, you know how you have like the Muppets, right?

869
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,100
Imagine the Muppets but dirty.

870
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,620
But then you have like, you know, Cranky Anchors.

871
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,460
This is like the Cranky Anchors version of Hungry Hamster.

872
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,340
Hungry Hamster's After Dark.

873
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:07,380
And so what we're going to have is we're going to have, we're going to have, Adam Carolla

874
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,900
is going to host it.

875
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,740
he's hosting it and he's gonna come out and be like, "Ah, fuck you, hungry hamster!"

876
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:21,300
And then we're gonna have the hungry hamster, we're gonna let him let loose a little bit.

877
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,340
Sometimes he gets tired of doing all the stuff for the kids.

878
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,940
He's gotta do something for his mama bad.

879
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,380
Before the After Dark show, the Tadpole Twins will be there.

880
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,380
They're holding a raffle.

881
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,780
You can enter to win.

882
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,540
I believe the grand prize is a present, I think.

883
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,820
I'm sick of the Tadpole Twins already.

884
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,500
Okay, we're announcing the...

885
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,500
You don't have to...

886
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,280
I know, it's my show.

887
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Why don't you like them?

888
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,280
I can express my opinions on the Tadpole Twins.

889
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
Alright, go ahead, express it then.

890
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,280
No, I think I've said enough.

891
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,280
No, go ahead.

892
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,280
I think I've said enough.

893
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,280
No, go ahead, come on.

894
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,280
Say it.

895
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I've said enough.

896
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,280
What's your problem with it?

897
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,100
Patrick had sex with one of the Tadpole Twins, that's right, the guy one, and now it ended

898
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,100
on a bad note.

899
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
No, no, no, we have a history.

900
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Terrence Tadpole and Tina Tadpole have a history.

901
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
And I don't want to delve into that right now.

902
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,100
Yeah, the history is that you fucked with the guy one.

903
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Okay, well it's not that bad.

904
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,100
I mean, I don't know.

905
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,980
really mad and I don't want to delve into that right now.

906
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,420
Okay, well it doesn't, so what I'm saying is they're holding the Tadpole raffle, grand

907
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,420
prize is a present.

908
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,260
Ooh, that's all they could get?

909
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,620
And then they're- Oh, I'm sorry, Patrick, are you on the lineup?

910
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,620
No.

911
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,620
Guess who is?

912
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
The Tadpole twins.

913
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Yeah, and- So how about you humble yourself?

914
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,340
Yeah, well they're just having a raffle, it doesn't matter.

915
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,020
Well they're having a raffle and then they're performing slam poetry.

916
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:43,060
And I bet you, based on the way you're acting, I can imagine that Terrence Tadpole probably

917
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,100
has a pretty fucked up poetry piece about you.

918
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,620
He has no poems about me.

919
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
He does.

920
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,620
Terrence the Tadpole has zero.

921
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,620
He is zilch.

922
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,620
He has nothing.

923
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
He's called My Ugly Boyfriend.

924
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,780
My Ugly Boyfriend by Terrence the Tadpole.

925
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,740
And it's about Patrick.

926
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,740
It's not about me.

927
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,460
Oh, oh, who's it about then?

928
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
I don't know.

929
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,380
talk about it. I haven't talked to them in years. Years? They're tadpoles. That's the

930
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:14,740
other thing. Tadpoles are children. I'm not going to say what they did, but... What'd they

931
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:23,500
do? I'm just going to say that if Trodney the tadpole comes near my toys... Comes near

932
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:36,720
your pole. It comes near my fish pole and my toys. It is also BYOT, bring your own toys.

933
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,740
If you want, there will not be toys for sale at Hamstravaganza. We could not get a license.

934
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:53,460
But as I said, all toys are welcome. Bring whatever toys you want. There will be toys

935
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,140
one beach ball

936
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,520
there will be one beach ball that uh... everybody can have a ten minute turn

937
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,240
with

938
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,200
we're trying to emphasize terms

939
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,980
and taking turns this whole thing is about teaching sharing

940
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,160
we're trying to teach sharing terms

941
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,940
and uh... and also so basically like there's going to be a sharing hour which

942
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,740
is it an hour of the day where everybody gets to share everybody's toys so make

943
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,340
sure you label everything

944
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:25,020
not on and then there's going to be free play free play is two hours long

945
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,260
shut up patrick we shut up

946
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,060
we shut the fuck up

947
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,060
okay free play is two hours long and it's basically we're gonna have a bunch

948
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
of playmats out

949
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,020
and a bunch of animal crackers

950
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,500
and you can just play your heart out

951
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,700
uh... and then there's a nap time

952
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,500
from one thirty to two thirty

953
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,380
and then basically and i i know that this is spoiling but the headlining the

954
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,600

tons of times during the show

964
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,060
you know i'm just gonna say if he's gonna

965
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,060

966
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,300

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,140

969
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,780
the tuna

970
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,700
the two-day

971
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,700
to that movie

972
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:46,700
the

973
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,020
and uh... and everyone's invited

974
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:54,100
it's gonna be crazy year

975
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,540
for a hundred years

976
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,820
uh... working security we have peter policeman and his crazy cops

977
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,740
they're gonna be walking around doing candy tests just to make sure candy

978
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,060
hamster doesn't get his

979
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,900
people are worried that

980
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:15,820
Peter Policeman and his crazy cops are gonna do an Altamont on the motherfuckers, but we're

981
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,500
not gonna let that happen.

982
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,700
Yeah, and people are...

983
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,780
One thing we're really trying to mitigate this year as opposed to Hamsteravaganza's past

984
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,500
is playing and driving.

985
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,660
So basically you're gonna have to lock your toys up before you get behind the wheel.

986
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:40,140
Or bring a designated adult who can drive for you.

987
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,740
And if you've got toy keys, just forget it.

988
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:45,740
Just forget it.

989
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:51,340
If you have a toy car that runs on your feet, then you'll be okay.

990
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,340
We'll let you use that.

991
00:50:52,340 --> 00:51:00,020
But if you have a big boy car or truck, then buddy, the fun stops here.

992
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:09,700
Last year we had over 150 playing while driving casualties.

993
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:17,860
It really wiped out, and we only had 200 visitors last year.

994
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:23,340
And then the rest of the visitors were actually killed overzealously by a Peter Policeman

995
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:27,700
and his crazy cops when he was trying to prevent them from playing while driving.

996
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,540
- Yeah.

997
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,360
- That was actually--

998
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,440
- No, 'cause that's what everyone said about last year.

999
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,120
They said, "Oh, they did an Altamont on these motherfuckers."

1000
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,340
And I'm trying to say, we will not do an Altamont

1001
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,180
on these motherfuckers. - Yeah, that was actually--

1002
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,020
- We're not doing it.

1003
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,340
- Palooza the whale actually was tragically taken from us

1004
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,100
in a playing while driving accident.

1005
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,660
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

1006
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,500
- Let's have a moment of silence for Palooza.

1007
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,880
- He just couldn't keep his hands off the toys.

1008
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,380
- Yeah, let's take a moment of silence for Palooza.

1009
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,760
- We'll do it at the Stravaganza.

1010
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,200
- Okay. - Okay, all right.

1011
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,660
- That's a good idea. - And then,

1012
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,540
A lot of people have been questioning, like,

1013
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,260
is the hungry hamster himself really gonna be there,

1014
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:04,940
or is it gonna be, you're gonna send an imposter

1015
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,100
wearing a hungry hamster mask, like MF Doom?

1016
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,700
- Mm-hmm, first of all,

1017
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,900
hungry hamster does not wear a mask.

1018
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,660
- He doesn't, yeah, you might be able to tell.

1019
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,420
- That's just what the hungry hamster's face looks like.

1020
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,100
- He just has a hamster face.

1021
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,780
I don't know how many times we can stress this to you people.

1022
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,780
He is a hamster with a giant mouth,

1023
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,500
because that's why he's so hungry.

1024
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,300
He has to fill that thing.

1025
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,580
He feeds himself.

1026
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,380
So we definitely recommend bringing tons of food for the hungry hamster so he doesn't

1027
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,100
try to eat your toys.

1028
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,820
If he eats the stage again.

1029
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,060
If he eats the stage again.

1030
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:44,740
Last year was, we went through so many stages because the hungry hamster kept, he could

1031
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,760
eat them in one bite is the issue.

1032
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,820
So you don't even have time to stop him.

1033
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,300
Yeah, he gets that idea in his little hamster head.

1034
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,020
You see the wheels in his head spinning.

1035
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,020
You see his hamster wheel spinning.

1036
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,900
You see the hamster wheel spin and his head that has another hamster on it.

1037
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,980
And he just starts munching.

1038
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,260
But he is going to be doing a meet and greet on the last day, on day 15.

1039
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,260
Day 15.

1040
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,060
And that's the day that Stained will be doing their Q&A as well.

1041
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,700
Stained will be doing a solo Q&A that is not a part of Hamster.fm.

1042
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:21,820
It's about their new biography that was just released by Penguin Publishing called It's

1043
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,820
Been Awhile.

1044
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:30,100
called yeah and it's still stained yeah it's been a while the story of stained

1045
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,620
still stand is the subtitle and then the other subtitle is how we got stay how we

1046
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:42,540
got stained go go away god damn it dude we got to close the blinds we have

1047
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,940
minutes left yeah all right they just want to hear they heard us talking about

1048
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,860
about the lineup and they want a sneak peek before we upload the episode. It's just people

1049
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:59,860
who are just a couple hungry hamsters themselves who are hungry for a little content.

1050
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:06,860
Yeah. They want to see the hungry hamster shine.

1051
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,660
They're trying to leak the lineup.

1052
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,780
So let's get down to brass tacks. I know what everybody's asking.

1053
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,940
How much is this going to cost?

1054
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,460
Is it going to run you?

1055
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:23,180
Well, luckily for you, we have day passes that are only going to be like 15 toys each.

1056
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,980
But then we have a two day pass, we have a three day pass, a four day pass, a five day

1057
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:32,140
pass, a six day pass, a seven day pass, an eight day pass, a nine day pass, a 10 day

1058
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,980
pass, and then a 15 day pass.

1059
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,180
We also have the whole enchilada package, which comes with one of each pass.

1060
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:47,180
with one of every single kind of pass and as whole enchilada, which is part of the package.

1061
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,420
The whole thing comes in a bag. You don't get a plate for the enchilada, we take it off

1062
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,420
of the enchilada maker and we put it in the bag.

1063
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,780
We put the passes in the enchilada.

1064
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,020
What you can do is, we recommend you portion the enchilada out so you have 15 bites basically

1065
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,660
and you take one bite a day.

1066
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,460
There's actually an RFID chip in each byte.

1067
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,660
Yeah, so we'll always know where you are and that's because one thing that we're trying

1068
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,100
to emphasize a lot this year is no re-entry.

1069
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,540
Yeah, absolutely not.

1070
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,260
Not even between days.

1071
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,260
Not between days.

1072
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,820
Once you are in, you are in.

1073
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,820
You don't leave.

1074
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:30,060
And once you leave, you can't get back in or I'm going to tell you what, those crazy cops

1075
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,980
are going to fuck you up.

1076
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,620
They're going to tell on you.

1077
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,700
They're going to tell on you to the teacher.

1078
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,500
Every zone, there's six zones, every zone is going to have a teacher who will be there

1079
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,260
to enforce that times and if anybody's getting rowdy during free play, basically it's going

1080
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,260
to be the teacher's job to break up those skirmishes.

1081
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,460
I know last year we had over 150 fights.

1082
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,340
We did not have as many teachers as we needed.

1083
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,220
We had barely any teachers.

1084
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:08,940
There was an off-duty teacher, luckily, thank God, who was there just enjoying the festival.

1085
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,380
But now we're going to have full-time teachers.

1086
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:14,580
That teacher's name was Robert Jewell.

1087
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:20,620
Robert Jewell, and he tragically passed away in a plane while driving accident when driving

1088
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,620
back.

1089
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,780
So we're going to have different teachers.

1090
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:28,540
We also, and I'm sorry, but you guys forced our hand, there's going to be a principal.

1091
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,700
There's going to be a headmaster.

1092
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:39,180
gonna be a principal and if you if you play with someone else's toys that and

1093
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:44,340
not during this the toy sharing hour the principal is gonna have to put you in

1094
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:51,180
detention. Which is actually under the stage. Yeah, it's very loud and scary.

1095
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,860
It's very loud, it's super scary and you don't get a parent to come with you.

1096
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,540
You have to go alone.

1097
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:08,700
So just keep that in mind, that we do have a principle, which means, you know, I don't

1098
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:14,300
want to hear you guys, we have a strict no bully policy this year.

1099
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,140
And only one crying per hour.

1100
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:23,220
Everybody gets one good cry, but it can't be during the concerts because we won't be

1101
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,220
able to hear.

1102
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:43,700
you

1103
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,220
- We hit you in the head with a pipe.

1104
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,060
- On day--

1105
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,300
- As many times until it makes you stop crying

1106
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,820
or having a bad sound. - Until you stop crying.

1107
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,100
- On day 12 though, we are actually having

1108
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,420
a tantrum workshop,

1109
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,380
to where we workshop different ways

1110
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,260
to kind of control or improve our tantrums.

1111
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:03,620
Whether you wanna have fewer tantrums or more tantrums.

1112
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,300
- The problem with tantrums is,

1113
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,580
you don't usually get what you want.

1114
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,900
If you go to this workshop, we will teach you--

1115
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,380
- That's it, you don't get what you want

1116
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,120
when you throw a tantrum.

1117
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,720
- You go to this workshop,

1118
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,080
we will teach you the secret to get what you want

1119
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,020
with a tantrum.

1120
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:22,180
- It's all about, so basically,

1121
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,080
think of parents as prey.

1122
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,360
And when you--

1123
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,280
- Well, don't give it away, don't give it away.

1124
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,320
- You're right, okay, but I'll give a little preview.

1125
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,720
When you're throwing a tantrum, it's a game, basically.

1126
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,040
And your parents are the mark.

1127
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,960
And you gotta think, what are you trying to get out of them?

1128
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,320
Usually it's goldfish.

1129
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,440
- Well, okay, all right, hey, hey.

1130
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,440
Alright, I may be giving away a little too much at this point.

1131
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,200
But we'll let the Hungry Hamster tell you the rest of that one.

1132
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,920
It is a one-on-one Hungry Hamster workshop.

1133
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,360
It's not cheap, but we'll be announcing the price of those tickets.

1134
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,360
We will not announce...

1135
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,640
That's actually a separate ticket to go to the Tantrum Workshop.

1136
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,440
We will not announce the price of the festival until the end of your stay.

1137
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Yeah, we're basically...

1138
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,440
You can stay in the Hungry Hamster.

1139
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
We have a baseline price.

1140
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,640
We're going to do a baseline price and then we're going to add on, every time you have

1141
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,880
a tantrum, every time you use somebody else's toy outside of sharing time, any time a teacher

1142
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,840
has to talk to you, any time you go to the principal, how many goldfish and animal crackers

1143
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:32,480
you eat, and then you get deducted off the price for every minute that you nap.

1144
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,640
So we're going to emphasize napping a lot.

1145
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,960
Yeah, and here's another thing.

1146
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,880
the first to implement the pay when you leave festival. We are, yeah, and that's why

1147
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,080
there's no re-entry because as soon as you leave, you know, we're gonna be hitting

1148
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:53,920
you with a big bill, you know, and that's why I, you know, check to see if

1149
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,560
Hamstravaganza is covered under your medical policy because you're gonna need

1150
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:02,880
some help, I'll tell you that much. You know, not even James Toy

1151
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,720
himself has enough money to pay out of pocket for this thing. For lodging you

1152
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,040
could you have two options you can stay in the Hungry Hamster Hotel or the

1153
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,500
Hungry Hamster Hostel. The hostel is actually modeled after the one from the

1154
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,560
movie Hostel. Yeah. It has a similar kind of consequence to staying there. And the

1155
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:24,480
hotel is modeled after the Haunted Mansion. But they're both the same price.

1156
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,400
They're the same price, they're equally scary, but one has Eddie Murphy which I

1157
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,880
guess we probably should have been now Eddie Murphy is headlining day three and

1158
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:42,400
he's doing his raw act. He's doing his raw act. He's completely nude and he's saying I

1159
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,040
don't want faggots looking at my butt. Yeah yeah he's saying faggots sit in the

1160
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,680
front so don't sit in the front because you're gonna catch you're gonna catch

1161
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,560
Eddie Murphy's raw power. Yeah was that raw? Did he say that in raw or delirious?

1162
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:00,720
They're exactly the same. He walks out both times and he's like "gay people suck so bad."

1163
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,720
That's true.

1164
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:07,320
That's like the whole joke of both of those specials. It's like "look how gay I look and

1165
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:13,320
gay people suck." Because he's wearing the two gayest outfits I've ever seen.

1166
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,240
Yeah, he said something about getting AIDS on your lip.

1167
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:24,000
Yeah, you get AIDS on your lip. He said the people in the front were fags because they

1168
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
sit in the front.

1169
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
They're sitting in the front and they're looking at his ass.

1170
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah, they're looking at his...

1171
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yeah, it's like, well maybe because you're dressed like a fucking...

1172
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Like a fucking...

1173
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Like a dominatrix that might have something to do with the fact that there's gay men sitting in the front looking at your ass.

1174
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
But he's gonna be there.

1175
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Yeah, he's gonna be at Hungry Ham's... Ham's Faganza.

1176
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And he's gonna say F-A-G-I-T.

1177
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah, he's gonna say F-A-G-E-T.

1178
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Uh-huh.

1179
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,100
Like the Korn song.

1180
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,100
Just like the Korn song.

1181
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,800
Yeah, he's going to be doing Korn covers.

1182
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,800
Yeah, but just that song.

1183
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,800
Yeah.

1184
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:05,080
Anyway, is there anybody else on?

1185
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,160
I'll be there, but I won't be performing.

1186
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,480
Yeah, I can't make it to this.

1187
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,280
I'll be wearing my special shirt.

1188
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,520
If you find me and you give me my QR code card, I'll be able to scan it and give you

1189
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,600
a free drink.

1190
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,080
Johnny Bravo will be there.

1191
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,080
and he will be walking around.

1192
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,080
That Johnny Bravo cosplayer we saw at PAX.

1193
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:26,080
Yeah, he'll be there. Johnny Javo.

1194
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,080
He'll be there. He'll be saying what's up to people.

1195
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,080
He'll be saying, "What's up?"

1196
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:35,080
"What's up, bitch? I'm Johnny Javo."

1197
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,080
That's his catchphrase. You know, you remember his catchphrase.

1198
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:40,080
You all know it. You all love it.

1199
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,080
He's going to be there. He's going to be showing off his muscles.

1200
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,080
So, keep your toys away from him because he might crush them

1201
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,200
crush them maybe in one quick feat of strength. With one crush. Yeah. One crush.

1202
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:58,440
Probably one quick crush. But yeah, I think that's about it. Yeah. Right, so that's the show.

screenshot from the review, I will give you a secret Hungry Hamster emoticon that you can

1212
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:58,720
use to react to people's different messages.

1213
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:04,000
So I highly recommend doing that and grabbing this beautiful piece of history.

1214
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,520
Yeah, and if you can't find the Discord, just message the pod about LIST.

1215
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,520
I don't know how to...

1216
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,240
Message Cameron and say Cameron.

1217
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,240
I don't respond to... I need to get your money.

1218
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,240
I don't respond to message requests. That's not true. I do.

1219
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,240
Cameron will respond to all of your DMs. I'll respond to all of your DMs.

1220
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
If you say you're a blissful to the podcast, I'll respond to them.

1221
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,240
But if you say, "Hey, tell me the fucking cards and milk thing,

1222
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,240
and I'll pay you in dank memes," I'll block you. And multiple people have said that to me.

1223
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,240
Yeah. Okay. I gotta go.

1224
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,240
Bye everybody, Hungry Hamsters for life.

1225
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,320
