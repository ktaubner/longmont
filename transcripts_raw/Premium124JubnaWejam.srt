91
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,020
these. I can put anything on it.

92
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,540
What was y'all's first ringtone that you bought? First ringtone I never bought a

93
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,260
ringtone. Yeah yeah I figured out there's my phone my phone my first flip

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,660
phone that I got. You could record a sound and just part turn into a

95
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,960
a ringtone, so I made my ringtone. I recorded my clock radio playing

96
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:02,020
Linkin Park "Numb" and I made that my ringtone and it sounded like shit. I

97
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,360
think I bought one ringtone and it was a clip song and then I changed it

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,600
to-- I figured out you could just record things. I used to do that with

99
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,980
music. I used to record-- I couldn't figure out how to get music on my iPod, so I

100
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,580
I would record or in I really I couldn't get it.

101
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,380
I could YouTube to mp3.

102
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
Yeah dude.

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380

Yeah.

106
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Well, I didn't do that though.

107
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,380
I would mediafire.com.

108
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,380
I would record into my headset.

109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,460
I would turn on the speaker record into like my gaming headset microphone and then put

110
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,860
that on my on my iPod.

111
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:45,300
I saw there's this website there it was like you could just get like a it was like YouTube

Okay. All right. Fine. What'd you masturbate to?

142
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,620
Father I've seen my father

143
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,740
I am masturbating to you right now

144
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:28,180
Father I have to admit I'm jacking off to you right now and I'm looking through the little holes. Yep

145
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,980
And no matter what you say, I will continue.

146
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,180
And I'm going to keep continuing.

147
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,580
And if I hear your voice even one more time, I will get harder and harder.

148
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,980
And also, if you move, I'm going to get super hard.

149
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,980
And I'm pretending I'm going to get even harder.

150
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
I'm pretending you're Carmen Electra back there.

151
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
And there's nothing you can do.

152
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
I'm imagining, Father, I've sinned.

153
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,980
I'm imagining you with big boobs.

154
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Father, I'm using this as a toilet right now.

155
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Yep. I'm going to come shot you through this divider thing, and it's going to be like a shower.

156
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,820
- Exactly.

157
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,660
- I don't know why that word.

158
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,020
- That word's been getting me a lot lately.

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,860
- Cumshot?

160
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,680
- Cumshot.

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,820
- I was laughing a lot about a guy

162
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,180
whose last name is Cumshot.

163
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,700
But I think that's a really funny last name.

164
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
Josh Cumshot?

165
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,140
- Joshua Cumshot.

166
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,420
- Joshua, Joshua Cumshot.

167
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,900
- Joshua Cumshot.

168
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,740
- Why do people like cum all the, like cum?

169
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,100
- It's less about the cum, it's more about the shot.

170
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,700
- But why do people like a cumshot?

171
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,540
Like why do you want--

172
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,260
- I'm telling you, people like it being shot with things.

173
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,740
- Why do people want cum on their face?

174
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,580
- I don't know.

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,400
- People love cum.

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
some wires crossed somewhere.

177
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
- What's up with cumming on someone's face though?

178
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,080
- It must be like the brain wire that's like,

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,640
you know, I like soda, and then it's like,

180
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,240
the one where it's like, you know,

181
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,880
the different liquid gets switched out,

182
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,600
and I think it's, they think that soda is common,

183
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,440
so they like it.

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,400
- What kind of evolutionary, 'cause you know,

185
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm a very science-minded guy.

186
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,120
What kind of evolutionary, and nice phone.

187
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
How's your phone, Patrick?

188
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,120
- I wasn't gonna say anything, I was just gonna do that.

189
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,600
- Talking to my mom.

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
- And this is the time to talk to her.

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,600
my whole family just died. Oh, so how are you talking to your mom? Yeah, she's

192
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,300
the only a survivor. Okay, you're a liar through a medium. Yeah, and she

193
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
killed all of them. My mom killed my whole family and she's texting you.

194
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,500
Yep. She's saying you're next. She's running at you right now. She said

195
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,000
she's running all the way here. Okay with a big side knife. The big sword

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,900
sign knife besides a psychic knife. She's running at me with a sign to

197
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,500
a film that says I'm going to kill you. That would be terrifying if a killer

198
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,220
started running towards me, I'd be like okay, but if you had a sign that said

199
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,560
I'm going to kill you, I knew that I'd be I'd be in bad shape that would scare

200
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,180
the crap out of me. The living daylights even which monster, which movie monster

201
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,300
or serial killer do you think would be the easiest to defeat Godzilla

202
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,300
step on his toe

203
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,420
get in his toe like like one of the like one of those one of the monsters

204
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,240
from the Athlete's Foot commercials,

205
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,920
the little orange guy just living his toenail.

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,760
- Yeah.

207
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,580
- I would do that.

208
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,560
I would become a bacteria in his body.

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,900
That's probably how you kill something that big.

210
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,520
- Yeah, I think going inside of a Godzilla

211
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,800
would be probably a very life-changing experience.

212
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,920
- Yeah, it would probably open a lot of doors

213
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,460
for me sexually as well.

214
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,080
I'd probably realize a lot of stuff.

215
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,320
- I'd be down, like once he's dead,

216
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
I'd be down to do whatever after that.

217
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,500
but once godzilla's dead i'd be so like

218
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,960
i'd just be walking up to people being like eat me eat me

219
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,560
i don't think you'd be doing it. I wouldn't want to be eaten though

220
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,480
i would only want to go in through the toenail

221
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,560
do you think it would... let me in your toenail! let me live in your toenail!

222
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,640
let me in your toenail! let me in! let me in!

223
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
hiring a prostitute drilling

224
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,520
could be a hundred dollars to go inside your toenail

225
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:50,000
I talked about this last night. I definitely do understand the giant, the giant woman

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,200
fetish. Oh yeah, for sure. I completely get it dude. Why? I mean the thing is, people

227
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,320
who have those giant woman fetishes, they get them because they watch cartoons with

228
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
giant women in them. Yeah. And we all watch the same cartoons as a kid. Absolutely. Like

229
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,080
we all, it's all in there somewhere. The end of doodlers by car? Like at least some amount.

230
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,180
We all got a little bit of something in there.

231
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,020
- Yeah, but what if it's like a giant--

232
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,280
- For me, wasps.

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,920
(laughing)

234
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,640
- For me, I'm really attracted to my gym partner

235
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,480
being a monkey.

236
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,940
(laughing)

237
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
It's just all early childhood stuff.

238
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,720
- I wanna put, yeah, my biggest sexual fantasy

239
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,680
is a giant jawbreaker.

240
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
- Oh, just sitting in her mouth.

241
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
- Oh my God.

242
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,320
- A girl walks up to you, huge jawbreaker,

243
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,560
twice the size of her body.

244
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,400
- Yeah.

245
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
- She asks you for a quarter.

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,240
- Yep.

247
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,060
- Oh my God.

248
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,040
- Similar for me, Willy Wonka.

249
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,440
- Getting stuck in a tube.

250
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,280
- There's so many people.

251
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,260
it's a bunch of dancing brooms. I bet Augustus Gloop was big for the like the

252
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,560
latex seal people. Oh yeah. Latex seal stuff. I bust this gloop. That scares me. I

253
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,760
bust this gloop. The what? I bet Augustus Gloop was terrified before he died.

254
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:58,760
died. Yeah, that's gotta be the worst way to go. Have you ever seen it?

255
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,560
Being Augustus Gloop. Yeah. Oh man, that's tragic. Hear about Augustus

256
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,760
Gloop. His friends at home be like, "Did you hear about Augustus Gloop?

257
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,360
He got psyched into a chocolate tube and died." They're all just

258
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
normal. They don't know about the Chocolate Factory storyline or

259
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,360
anything. Yeah, that was like probably the worst day back at school

260
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,460
forever. Just four empty chairs, you know, they all come from the same four

261
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,260
desks. They did. They all grow up, but they only talk about it when they when

262
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,100
they're drunk. They're like yeah. Do you remember a guy Augustus? This is

263
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,800
got to do a chocolate tube and died in chocolate.

264
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,260
He's trying to drink from a chocolate river. He won a contest and was killed

265
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,060
by some go fund me page. We're heartbroken to announce that our son

266
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,940
Augustus Gloop was killed by a chocolate tube.

267
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,140
Sucked into a tube and killed.

268
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,540
I think if you're the parents of Augustus Gloop, you leave the chocolate part out.

269
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,940
That kid's getting bullied at school enough for being fat.

270
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,740
But how do you explain, but people will ask questions.

271
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
No that's the type of thing where.

272
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
A tube, what kind of tube?

273
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Airplane.

274
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Just a tube.

275
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
Airplane tube.

276
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Just a normal tube.

277
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,380
That's the thing though, no where the people who bullied him at school would hear like

278
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,220
like damn like he died from a chocolate to like maybe we should have been been

279
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,660
easier on little glue. They can say that he killed himself.

280
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,180
The old Gus Gloop. Yeah, that's what they would think. They would think, oh we

281
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,540
made him kill himself by calling him the Gloopster. He drowned in a chocolate

282
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,140
river on purpose. Worst last name to have when drowning in chocolate. Yeah, yeah, he

283
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,900
did. He tied a cinder block to his foot and he jumped into the...

284
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,800
- He's just loop looking at Willy Wonka

285
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,200
before he gets in the river and he's like,

286
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,340
before I do this I want to say

287
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,800
that I'm doing this on purpose.

288
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,000
- Willy Wonka, like coordinating with the Oompa Loompas,

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,240
setting up the whole like, you know,

290
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,720
oh we're gonna get rid of one kid at each room

291
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,040
and they're like, okay well who's gonna drown

292
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,360
in the chocolate, is it gonna be,

293
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,680
will it be Mike TV?

294
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,920
(laughing)

295
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,320
Will it be Veruca Salt?

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,480
Let me think.

297
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,480
with the

298
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,560
that's it

299
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,080
who had a little

300
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,800
what about charlie bucket

301
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
this is not a lot of

302
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,240
this is the hardest bucket they we've ever had to think about the people who

303
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,400
have got that little swedish what about the group

304
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,560
no

305
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,960
i would never work no no no no no i'm not talking about the other people

306
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,680
makes no sense and what are the people who was like

307
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,240
uh... crap

308
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I got gloops of chocolate all over me.

309
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,240
What did you just say?

310
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
[Laughter]

311
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Yeah, well no, what they did was like,

312
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
they were like, "Oh, we got it. Let's, let's like, let's,

313
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
maybe the Augustus Kit could work. Let's take a look

314
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
at his like application or whatever and then it's just a page

315
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
covered in chocolate sticks."

316
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
[Laughter]

317
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
That might work. I do feel like that's probably

318
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
the worst chocolate in the world, in that river.

319
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Yeah. Can you imagine? That can't be good.

320
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
No, I mean, chocolate like flowing like that.

321
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
It's probably the kind that they use in the shitty

322
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,440
animals in there yeah there is fish probably animals eating and probably

323
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
chocolate a chocolate bass there's a Swedish fish mm-hmm yeah that's actually

324
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,040
pretty good yeah but why would you mix gummies with chocolate you can do a very

325
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,480
flavor there's a Japanese or Korean little fish fish things beta fish no the

326
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,280

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,420
spoiled as hell. No, her attitude is salty and hey, if I was named grandpa,

338
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,280
forget about it.

339
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,920
there's no way I'm going to put in there. No shot

340
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,160
well. That was what I was like okay, okay, Augustus gloop he'll get killed by

341
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,640
the chocolate, Mike TV, the TV obviously. What about this great

342
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,040
I guess he has to survive till the end. Yeah, I can't I guess we come up with a

343
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,560
good old that room doesn't make any sense. Time will get him. It's fine.

344
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,040
Yeah, the grandpa, the grandpa room did yeah, the worthers originals room, yo

345
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,320
true. Nowadays what kind of factory do you think Willy Wonka would have nowadays? What

346
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
do you think? Yeah.

347
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,720
Was some kind of Foxconn factory?

348
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Yep.

350
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,520
Yep, he would be making weapons and stuff.

351
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Mm-hmm.

352
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Nah.

353
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
That'd be pretty cool.

354
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
That can't be true though.

355
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I think he probably would have a Foxconn factory.

356
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
I think he would make cell phones.

357
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think he would.

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
And the Oompa Loompas, all of them would be children.

359
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Mm-hmm.

360
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Nah, from China.

361
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Mm-hmm.

362
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,200
And the four kids who come in?

363
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
They would be grown men.

364
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
From China.

365
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,040
would be taking investors from China and they would all die in a you know some

366
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,720
kind of a lave room mm-hmm maybe we're told it's good they'd all just get

367
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,920
sucked into a lathe and and you and de-gloved is it you who showed me that

368
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,280
video that video that guy getting de-gloved that's one of the worst

369
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,080
videos I've ever seen yeah yeah it's his entire skin entire skin comes off like a

370
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,000
cartoon and his skeleton flies I thought his gloves just came off yeah well he's

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,600
being degloved is like the scary that's so scary to me. Especially if it's cold

372
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,440
out. Especially if I'm a Chinese man in a factory because I know that video is

373
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,080
getting posted online. I will never know peace. Who do you think is the person who

374
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,880
watches these videos and is like this shit funny as hell and everyone needs to see this. I would be fine if I got

375
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,920
degloved in the comfort of my own home that's fine yeah but if I'm out in

376
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,360
public oh yeah I will never live it down. So embarrassing. You ever think about how

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Well, you can call a hamburger something.

501
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
You can call a cheeseburger a vegan.

502
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Oh, the pizza with the cheese and the crust?

503
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Yeah, there's some pizza that doesn't have cheese and crust.

504
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
You need one kind of pizza that doesn't have cheese and crust.

505
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
Tomato soup.

506
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
Sauce pizza.

507
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
Sauce pizza is not...

508
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Sauce bowl, yeah.

509
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,460
spaghetti spaghetti meatballs you turn my tomato leather no yeah no talking

510
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,260
about pepperoni talking about pepperoni pepperoni that's you know how you said

511
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,460
that it's not how I said that what's the best job no we jam you ever had

512
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,580
probably the one we just had yeah I definitely do want to go back and get

513
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,300
another another job no we I want to get another job no we jam I just make job

514
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,460
no we jam at home it's not gonna be the same they have the best job no we jam

515
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,020
they do make good job no we jam they do have the best job I have locally sourced

516
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,620
job. No, they do. I think they make the we jam in house. Yeah, I think I think

517
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,880
it's free range job knows

518
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:29,260
the job is that they melt it's grass. It's grass fed job. No, I just love that

519
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:33,480
you have a ship man. Unfortunately, it's human fed. We do jam is the my

520
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,380
favorite part. The we do they do. I know they have they have they do they try

521
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,340
not to cage the job knows, but the we jams I've seen video. I've seen video

522
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,140
footage of the the the Wee Jam

523
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
slaughterhouse and they it's it's

524
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,740
not great. Tell you what those

525
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,640
damn Mediterranean. So they have

526
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
a guy to rainians are weird.

527
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,140
Yeah, they know they have a guy

528
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
at the slaughterhouse whose whole

529
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,940
job it is to stick a stick up the

530
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,540
Wee Jams, but before it dies

531
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,840
really yeah, does that do it

532
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,760
makes it scared.

533
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,240
It is funny. It hurts it. Do you

534
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,940
guys eat veal? No, no, I mean I

535
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,640
would probably like I'd not like

536
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,940
I would be that look. I don't

537
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,040
know what kind of question. I

538
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
feel like most people if you ask

539
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,060
I went, "Do you eat veal?"

540
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,900
I mean, I guess--

541
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,580
- What do you mean, what kind of question is that?

542
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,420
- Well, you know that we're--

543
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,140
- It's a fucking yes or no question.

544
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,900
- You know we're not vegetarian.

545
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,740
- Yeah.

546
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,540
- Yeah, but some people still just don't eat veal.

547
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
- Veal is like the--

548
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,740
- I feel like I don't know if I've ever had

549
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,180
an opportunity to eat veal, though.

550
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,540
- Pretty much any time you go to an Italian restaurant,

551
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,580
the meat sauce is gonna be veal.

552
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,700
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

553
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,220
- Then I love veal.

554
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,060
- That's the thing, dude.

555
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,020
It's like--

556
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,580
- It's good, but it's like the most--

557
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,900
- They break all the cow's legs,

558
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,780
and they feed them butter,

559
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,520
And then they put them in a giant hot dog maker.

560
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,980
- Yeah, the baby cows too.

561
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
- And it's the best tasting meat.

562
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,880
- It is, yeah.

563
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,440
- It tastes so good.

564
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,240
- I've never had veal straight up.

565
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,120
- It's damn good.

566
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,960
- But I've definitely had veal by accident.

567
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,820
- The best meat is always when they just take

568
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,680
like a one day old animal and they just hit it

569
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,520
with a bunch of hammers.

570
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
- Dude, lamb, lamb is so good.

571
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,280
- They hit it with hammers like those little--

572
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,120
- I eat so much lamb.

573
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,940
- Those like--

574
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,780
- It feels so good.

575
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,620
- You know what you never have,

576
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,460
'cause it's probably shit?

577
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,640
Sheep, but you know what's damn good?

578
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,480
Lamb.

579
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,340
- Lamb is good as fuck.

580
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,180
Sheep is fucking gotta be terrible.

581
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,300
Lamb on a spit.

582
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,940
Yeah, just a child.

583
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,140
Sheep used to be fire though, back in the Viking days.

584
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,980
Mutton.

585
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,860
True, they did used to eat hella mutton.

586
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,700
But then they were like,

587
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,300
you know what's better than this is the baby version.

588
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,620
It's when we take a baby and we hit it with baseball bats

589
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,920
like hungry, hungry hippos.

590
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,900
(laughing)

591
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,780
Yeah, we'd use it like a live pinata

592
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,420
and then we'd turn it into Euro meat.

593
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,140
you know i uh... another thing that proves my point

594
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,100
fish eggs

595
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,660
yeah dude, caviar. people love that shit. eggs too

596
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:49,220
eggs are probably better than any meat. eggs are way better than any meat. eggs are fuckin' number one

597
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,300
oh my god, cow eggs

598
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,720
you just swan

599
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,180
oh my god, yeah. yeah, i almost asked if a swan lays an egg

600
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,620
i wanna get an ostrich egg

601
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,340
dude, they sell 'em at

602
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,380
city fresh. really?

603
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,180
yeah. the big ass ones?

604
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,980
they sell the no no they sell the ostrich eggs i'm sorry what the fuck

605
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,260
dude an ostrich egg is the size of a football man come on fuck you you suck that was too much

606
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,300
i can't let that one slide and they sell quail eggs too everywhere sells quail eggs man i'm

607
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,980
done with you did you just hit stop on the recorder yeah it's over oh thank god i did

608
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,940
not hit stop i want to eat an ostrich egg so badly yeah i wanted to eat the duck egg but i was like

609
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,540
there's probably no point in me doing that. What do you mean you eat it?

610
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,540
Making a duck egg like an egg. I wanted to eat the duck egg but there was no point.

611
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,260
It's all gonna taste like an egg. Yeah I guess. Quail eggs are good. I guess it

612
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,140
just would taste like a bigger egg but I feel like the flavor profile would be

613
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:55,100
different. The flavor might be different but not the flavor profile. No. I don't know I feel like a duck egg.

614
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,860
It's all the same profile. But the flavors are different. The flavor is.

615
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:04,300
is with the yoke is the yoke bigger in a duck egg. It's green. It's green. That's

616
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,300
where Dr. Seuss got the idea. Yeah, it's got feathers in it to quail eggs are so

617
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,260
small. It makes you feel bad eating them. It makes me feel great eating them. It

618
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,260
makes me feel like I'm a giant evil monster. Yeah, it's ruining the life of a

619
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,900
thousand babies. It was the thing. I mean a bouncy ball. That's what I like about

620
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,660
they got a cool pattern. You know what they do. That's why that's why that's

621
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,380
why eating animal hearts is good because it's like I am. I am like I'm putting an

622
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,420
and to every animal soul right now. The second I have ten animals in a bowl in

623
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:37,220
front of me, I anything like that where it's like you're eating fifty like fifty

624
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:41,900
animals died for this. Yeah, so funny dude. I am the chicken Jeffrey Dahmer.

625
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,340
Yeah,

626
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,780
because when you eat when you eat like a rotisserie chicken, you're just one

627
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,980
chicken. Yeah, I haven't had one in so long. You and four friends split a

628
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,780
forty eight piece. I know dude that's yeah, it's like a room full of time. I'm

629
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,620
devourer yeah yeah I'll just died so that I could watch yeah or or instead of

630
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,360
getting the the 48 piece chicken hearts you could get one chicken McNugget I'd

631
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,480
get the same effect that's true am i right am that is true millions of

632
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,540
chickens died for my one chicken they take one molecule of meat from every

633
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,860
chicken ever seen the video packed with flavor you ever seen the video we

634
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,740
totally talked about in the video that the chicks going into like the fucking

635
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,360
food yeah I said that video everybody yeah I was the guy who's doing it yeah

636
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,320
yeah I'm one I was a guy with my mouth under the grinder one of chicks going

637
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,180
peepee people damn but the boy chicks they just turn them into mush yeah they

638
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,400
turn them into pink goo that's kind of suck man yeah to be crushed it into you

639
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,400
I was literally thinking about just like like it's so it's it's like so just got

640
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,720
like the process of eating that's got to be rather unpleasant it's crazy that

641
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,880
they're literally up there alive for like 90s the entire yeah and immediately

642
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,680
they get thrown into a big processor that's gotta be the worst man no no

643
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,440
seriously I got a suck man I think they do like it though there is a study that

644
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,920
says that there's a study that's a like that chicks actually like it yeah I saw

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,540
Don't they have a Burger King jr. Sandwich. I'm sure I think they do

669
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,600
All right, just doesn't matter to me cuz I'm ordinary

670
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm checking to sandwich every time they do have check-in sandwiches - they have check-in

671
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,240
Check-in oh my god the Mac check-in

672
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,720
It's good

673
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Ordering it like that, but like clearly like you're being like yeah

674
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
I want a chicken so bad.

675
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
I want a chicken so bad.

676
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,560
You can say you pronounce everything else completely normal.

677
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
And a mac chicken.

678
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Oh my god, a chicken sandwich?

679
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
A mac chicken.

680
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Speaking of chicken, I just got a place around, I haven't seen like a grocery store selling rotisserie chickens in a while.

681
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I love rotisserie chickens.

682
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,560
In a grocery store, I'm not going to, I'm gatekeeping this, I'm not telling anybody.

683
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,560
But, on the corner.

684
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,060
The one right next to me has rotisserie chicken.

685
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
What?

686
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,060
You've been holding that out on me?

687
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,360
The one that's, the grocery store that's right near my apartment has a giant sign that says

688
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,880
rotisserie chickens and every time I've gone in there and asked if they had a rotisserie

689
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,880
chicken they said no, come back tomorrow and they never had it.

690
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Fuckers man.

691
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
I was so pissed.

692
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,880
You gotta go to the one.

693
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,880
Literally a giant sign that says it outside.

694
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
You gotta go to the one.

695
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,580
Like I'm not talking like a sign like on the, like a pole with a big sign on top.

696
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,320
Like a giant sign that says rotisserie chicken.

697
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,580
You gotta go to the one.

698
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I'll go there.

699
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I want a rotisserie chicken so bad.

700
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,580
They have them next to the fucking register.

701
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Damn.

702
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,580
What, like a candy bar?

703
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,580
I'm getting that.

704
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Yeah, I'm getting three.

705
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Yeah, you oughta get this too.

706
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Yeah.

707
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
I'll get a couple.

708
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
That's literally what I would do.

709
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I love it.

710
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:58,140
I was going, when I left the office yesterday, I came to the office to get my headphones.

711
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
I was here for ten minutes.

712
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,780
I took a shit, got my headphones, and left.

713
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,900
That's your full day's work.

714
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
It was very, very funny.

715
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,900
You're fucked out.

716
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Yeah.

717
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,100
story that I was like I like he like came in. He grabbed his headphones,

718
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,120
went into the bathroom. He came out of the bathroom and I started I was like,

719
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,260
Oh, do you want will you like take a look at this thing like this video that

720
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,620
I'm work and then he just like he just what he didn't say a word looked at me

721
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,900
just walked out of the door and left yeah. I was like yeah nice to go all

722
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,740
the way to green point, but if I wasn't like literally I got a red bull on the

723
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,940
way there just because I was like fucking tired and then I looked at the

724
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,520
rotisserie chicken at the counter and I was like, well, it's here. I should

725
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,640
yeah, that's just get one to go. I forgot how you're going to get lunch.

726
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,120
Gus and Gus and his dad apparently like anytime they drive together in a car for more than like

727
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,040
30 minutes, they just get a rotisserie chicken, put it on the center console and just eat it

728
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,000
together. That's so romantic to do with your dad. It's such a good gone out to a meal. Just you and

729
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,060
and your dad yeah really yeah I've never done dude I was like eight years old I

730
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,940
was really obsessed with toasted subs

731
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:24,580
I don't I'd never had a toasted sub before like a like a like a subway or

732
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,980
anything like that I'd never had it before at a first time when I was eight I

733
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,900
I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing!"

734
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,620
And I made my dad, I went on a father-son date,

735
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,780
and we went to Quiznos because I liked

736
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,620
the Quiznos commercials with the baby.

737
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,340
- I feel like I had a similar toasted sub experience,

738
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,440
but specifically where I was like,

739
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,340
I got for the first time, I had like a steak and cheese sub.

740
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,180
- Yeah. - Which is like,

741
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,340
this has to be like illegal.

742
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,540
It can't be this much of all this stuff in here.

743
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,140
- How come Subway's sandwiches at restaurants

744
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,940
taste so much better than the shit I make at home?

745
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
I make shit sandwiches.

746
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,380
Dude, Subway all the meat is turkey.

747
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Sandwiches are terrible at home.

748
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Yeah.

749
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Yeah.

750
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,060
What you have to get is one of those counters that has all the ingredients.

751
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,060
I think I need a big plastic counter and I need a disgusting bath for every knife I have.

752
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
Well, you know what it is?

753
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
It's the sneeze guard.

754
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,700
You've been sneezing into your sandwiches without realizing it.

755
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Instead of having a teenager sneeze into it.

756
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Yeah.

757
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
Well, the amateurs sneeze so bad at home.

758
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
They do.

759
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Young sneeze.

760
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
It's like the veal thing.

761
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Uh-huh.

762
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Yeah, their sneezes taste better.

763
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,300
They sneeze better than you hit them with a hammer.

764
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,900
long time I was working at a sandwich shop. I cut my finger and didn't know it

765
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,800
cutting tomatoes up, cutting tiny tomatoes, cut my finger and then yeah and

766
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,500
yeah and I got blood in the glove. Uh-huh I was selling sandwiches with

767
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,000
blood in my glove. It's like why is my wasn't on your glove right like why is

768
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,400
my hand stinging and I look so okay. Let me really let me let me let me cutting

769
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,600
of a tomato and you're like my hand started stinging and you didn't look to

770
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:03,360
if you were bleeding. It was a lunch rush. And I just want to say your hand was in

771
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,480
the glove so the blood was just in the glove. I thought it was tomato juice. So

772
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,520
this is a story about you cut your finger. It's not a story of I put blood

773
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,280
in people's sandwiches. It's a story I cut my finger and it hurt. I cut my finger at

774
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,240
work. That's a great story Patrick. Last night when we were at the bar I'm

775
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,240
still thinking about this. I'm so hungover. I went to the bathroom and there's a

776
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,920
the bathroom with a single sink and I was washing my hands after using the

777
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,800
urinal. The guy who was using the year all next to me start like plus the

778
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,680
urinal. I was washing my hands. He walks over puts his hands under the water

779
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,640
with my hands. They like it touches my hands and then he just like walks out

780
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,560
of the bathroom. I was so fuck. Do you realize I'm like still mad about you

781
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,640
realize what that says about you what it means it's people like that just see

782
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,260
you as just like just an easy target. Yeah, you just are like people like that,

783
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,020
like what just a guy who just has nothing to lose. What do you think the motive

784
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,540
of that action is? That's what I can't figure out. He just wanted to dominate

785
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,140
you. I feel like he saw you and he was like, I can dominate this a wimp and I'm

786
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,900
going to dominate you project in a bathroom, washing your hands. You wash

787
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,380
your hands like a wimp. Sure. Yeah, because he knew that he could, he could

788
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,900
just alpha dog. Yeah, he was. Okay, here's the thing though. That bar,

789
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,900
there's a sign in the front of the bar that says no wimps. Here's the thing

790
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,280
though, letting is salty. Yeah, he's short and he was fat, so I like one

791
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,220
regardless, no matter what he did to me, he could have he could have bent me

792
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,720
over at that sink and I would have walked out of there. The victor

793
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,820
she's come dripping out of your face and but another win for me

794
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,420
because I'm I'm the

795
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,540
that's the only way you can go through life as a wimp. If I don't if I don't

796
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,220
think that to myself every day of my life, it's over.

797
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,720
Uh-huh.

798
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,500
[LAUGHTER]

799
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,620
It's so funny.

800
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:55,580
There just is a little guy who thought you were such a wimp

801
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,500
that he could wash his hands on your hands.

802
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,260
It was crazy.

803
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,620
I think it probably will change my life forever.

804
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,140
I didn't do anything, no.

805
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,300
I let him walk all over me.

806
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,380
You didn't even smack his hands out?

807
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,940
I went like, whoa.

808
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,260
That was pretty much all I did.

809
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,140
None of us would slap his hands out.

810
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,060
I would.

811
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,660
You would not.

812
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,380
No, you would not.

813
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,220
I started fighting.

814
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,700
You're an even bigger wimp than him.

815
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,940
You're the biggest wimp here.

816
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,100
You would have been silent.

817
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
I at least said, I at least, I at least reflexively said, "Whoa!"

818
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
You would have said, "Oh, sorry!" and moved your hands out of the way.

819
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
That is actually what you would have done.

820
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Probably. Yeah.

821
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
What I do is, I'm too much of a wimp to start a fight,

822
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,100
but the second that the person is more than six inches away from me,

823
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,100
I'll start going like, "Oh, cool! Great!"

824
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Yeah, thanks for doing that!

825
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,100
And it really shows them.

826
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,100
Yeah, I know that bit. Yeah.

827
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Yeah, just being like... Talk really loudly. When they cut you in line and then be like,

828
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:53,500
"Oh, awesome." "I love waiting in line here." Yeah. Remember that same bar, the fucking

829
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,980
bouncer, like a little person walked in. The bouncer walked up to him and just said, "Hey,

830
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:02,420
you can't be in here." "Nah, I'm just kidding." Yeah. Like he followed him into the bathroom.

831
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,220
Yeah, he followed a little guy into the bathroom and while the dude is pissing, he says, "Oh,

832
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:15,480
can't be in here now I'm just playing that guy's rules dude he's so sick every

833
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,260
time he like you got fingerless gloves on yeah every time I go in and I'm wearing

834
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,660
a shirt that like so every time you're going wearing a shirt every time I go

835
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,820
around a shirt like this he like points it and goes what band is that it's never

836
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:36,260
a band it'd be cool if you were walking in with like Nirvana sure yeah what band

837
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,100
- What band?

838
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
- Hmm, what band is that?

839
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,920
- Yeah.

840
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,560
- That is a funny question to ask too,

841
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,400
'cause it usually just, a band shirt is one

842
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,500
that says the band's name.

843
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,340
- Right.

844
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,980
- Like I don't know what answer you'd expect

845
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,740
when you ask someone what band is that.

846
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,580
- Right.

847
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,420
- Yeah.

848
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,780
- You should ask what band is that to his leather vest.

849
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,060
- Yeah.

850
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,180
- I'm gonna start asking people what band it is

851
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,520
when they're wearing tuxedos and dresses.

852
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,020
- When a bouncer dresses up like that, it's always so sick.

853
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,860
- Bouncers are almost exclusively crazy people.

854
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,700
- Yeah.

855
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, dude. They dread like the the one I told you about the guy

856
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,300
that dresses up like Mad Max.

857
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,300
A friend of mine used to be a bouncer and he would and kids would try to get him

858
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,800
with like fake IDs and he'd be like listen, if you give me $50, I'll let you

859
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,400
in and then you have $50 like and he would just keep their ID and the money

860
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,900
and not let him.

861
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,100
And be like, what are you gonna go tell the cops that I mean a bouncer is like

862
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,400
the perfect that's like a you can you can have power over people and it's

863
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,160
- Exactly on the axis between being a serial killer

864
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,360
or like a local politician.

865
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,200
- Exactly.

866
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,020
- It's just like Dexter.

867
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,080
- You don't have to work at all

868
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,680
and you also don't have to go to jail.

869
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,520
- Yeah.

870
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,360
- It's like--

871
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,540
- You pretty much have immunity in every fight.

872
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,380
- Yeah.

873
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,200
- It's pretty cool.

874
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,040
- Yeah.

875
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,340
- Even if you lose, you still win.

876
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,180
- Mm-hmm.

877
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,000
- It is fun.

- How?

882
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,320

I've show up at work in a sleeping bag. Oh, you notice my outfit yeah. My gay

995
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,560

996
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,840
school of New York City we're pretty much already planning it mm-hmm my

997
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,360
extremely stylish gay son he redid our kitchen it's all plastic now yeah he did

998
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,400
my makeup too look it's just like sharpie on my face

999
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,000
yeah it's just like lipstick up to your nose and chin

1000
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,120
yeah you're walking through the- and sharpie on eyebrows and devil horns on your head

1001
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,320
you're walking through the kitchen that he remodeled and it's like okay oh now

1002
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,260
Now these now these drawers here at knee level. These are the candy drawers and

1003
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,280
then up here in these cabinets up here. Those are vegetables. This is my

1004
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,500
metro sexual son.

1005
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:06,100
He remodeled the entire house. He put up all this amazing artwork. Can you see a

1006
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,760
bunch of hand turkeys? We think he's a gay artist.

1007
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:15,080
He's like Keith Haring basically. Yeah, he's just hoping he does not get that

1008
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,640
though. He's pretty much a gay artist from the day he was born. I mean look at

1009
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:23,860
this amazing art. Look at this here. Yeah. That's called Squidward. Mm-hmm. And he drew that.

1010
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:30,020
This one, yeah, this one is called Blue and there's a lot of squiggles.

1011
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:34,980
And this one is Blue Squidward. It's drawing after drawing of like, like, stick figure

1012
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,220
your son, like, like stabbing your cat to death, like ripping the cat's head off.

1013
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,260
We think he's kind of an artist, kind of gay artist type. As you can tell, he's

1014
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,500
very interesting the way that he is. He seems to be also very into our cat.

1015
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:54,420
Yeah, see and this this piece right here really speaks to me. It's called dad's private parts. Mm-hmm dad's private parts

1016
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:00,060
That's private. Yeah, that's private parts. I saw it by accident when I opened the door in the shower. Mm-hmm

1017
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:06,060
It's very kind of one of those really long titles that you see. Yeah, we actually he's actually remodeled our shower, too

1018
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,780
It's actually it's it's 10 feet long and it's 10 feet wide and there's a hundred rubber ducks in

1019
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,460
And it's filled with bubbles. Yeah, he remodeled the living. Yeah. Oh my god

1020
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,120
but my we can tell he's gay. He loves bubble baths.

1021
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,820
He always wants those he wants those pink bubbles yeah yeah my son he's two

1022
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,120
weeks old he's pretty much as gay as can be because he loves his mama. Tell you

1023
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,420
what yeah, I think my son's straight man. He'd be sucking on fucking tits all

1024
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:40,020
day. Yeah, I guess straight son. Thank you. My son is watch this get me a beer

1025
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:46,220
that's right. He doesn't even listen to me. He can't hear a damn thing this kid

1026
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,680
you know, son's death.

1027
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,720
This kid's so straight, he can't hear a damn thing. I say

1028
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,720
that's right.

1029
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,820
And then and then like the person who's like who's over to his house that he's

1030
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,620
talking to about his son. This is like this says something to son. His son is

1031
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,720
instantly response.

1032
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,720
Yeah, that's my straight son. Not listening to a damn thing. I saw my God

1033
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,620
if if I was smart enough to pretend I was deaf from the second. I was born.

1034
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,780
that'll be the greatest prank of all time. Best prank ever, dude. Yeah, he

1035
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,340
pretended he was dead. Stevie Wonder waited to start pretending that he was

1036
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,740
dead until yesterday. Right before- you wait until, you wait until, like, your

1037
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,220
parents are on- your last parent is on their death bed, and you say, "What's up,

1038
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,860
bitch?" Bye, bitch! And they're like, "What?" But you haven't yet, but you

1039
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:41,180
also- you've never spoken before, so you actually go, "Duh, duh, duh!" No, you

1040
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,760
You'd sit and practice in your in your cause. I wouldn't

1041
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,360
you and I got to keep up the illusion.

1042
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:52,060
A doctor if if you went to the doctor, the doctor would see your mouth and be

1043
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,560
like that a mouth has talked before

1044
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:59,260
you know, be annoying is not you know, be annoying as hell. I used to have

1045
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:03,460
this like nightmare when I was a kid that both of my parents had no arms and

1046
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,780
I said it do everything for them. That would suck that would suck if you if

1047
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,000
your parents had no arms. Yeah, you're like a you're like an arm like they just

1048
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,740
like you for your arms at some point. It's true. You know you're basically like

1049
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,600
a spoon to them that would put a new wrinkle in a parent child relationship.

1050
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,000
I know you just love me because I have arms also like if I do something wrong,

1051
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,080
I dare you to do anything about it. Well, it's worse because they'll kick

1052
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,760
you. It hurts more if they can catch me. Well, they have no oh, that's good. I

1053
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,280
still I thought they had no legs. You know what okay, both your parents are

1054
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,320
their heads. What if they have really sharp teeth? They can bite you if you misbehave.

1055
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, that would be a problem. Yeah. Okay, I'm not going to admit that. Yeah. Yeah. What

1056
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,800
if they had fins and gills? And they were gray white. Yeah. They're gray and white.

1057
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,680
Yeah. I'll say it, my parents are gray and white. Two gray white parents. My parents

1058
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,720
are hammer and head. Nope, they do not. They don't have gills. No, they're not sharp. Let's

1059
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,160
hit the checklist here. If you were pretending to be deaf too to prank your parents, you'd

1060
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,240
have to figure something out like if they try to catch you by like startling you

1061
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,640
or something like I probably like if they try and figure out if you you know

1062
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,280
because you'd you'd kind of tell you see a twinkle if I if my kid was deaf and I

1063
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,360
saw twinkle in his eye I'd be I'd be clapping behind his head there would be

1064
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,720
some point where I would be like maybe he's fake like that way yeah through the

1065
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,000
kids entire life that would come across my mind one time yeah what I would do is

1066
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,600
my parents would come up behind me and scream boo to try and catch me faking

1067
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,040
being deaf and I jump and they'd be like I got you and I'd write down no like

1068
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,720
like I'm an empath, I could feel the fear in the room.

1069
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,560
- I felt the vibration behind me.

1070
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,140
- Yeah, or maybe I pretend to be Daredevil.

1071
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,000
(laughing)

1072
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,880
- I saw like a blue version of the world.

1073
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
- No, I have super powers.

1074
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,040
- This is my super power.

1075
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,120
- Yeah, my super power is jumping when I'm startled.

1076
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:51,960
- That's the thing, Daredevil--

1077
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,080
- All my other senses are--

1078
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,120
- Daredevil doesn't work if he's deaf but can see.

1079
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,960
- Yeah.

1080
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,800
- Right?

1081
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,620
- Just less interesting.

1082
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,000
- Well, you don't get like really good at seeing

1083
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,560
you're deaf right you do do you yeah you get you can see the speech bubbles in

1084
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:10,980
the air that's what I don't think that'd be as helpful for a superhero that'd be

1085
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,720
rude no because you could see like say somebody was sneaking up behind you and

1086
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,680
saying we're gonna sneak up behind him you could see the shadow of the speech

1087
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,840
bubble on the ground that's the thing about room daredevil is he's got sonar

1088
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,520
he does I think you're thinking of a submarine no I'm thinking of a man now

1089
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,440
thing you have a submarine no that's a more what the submarine the submariner

1090
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:37,400
you guys know so much superhero bullshit you're you know you guys should try to

1091
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,780
learn a little bit about rap and hip-hop they should put name more in a movie why

1092
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,940
haven't they done put their God as you put a black man through a seam or he's

1093
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:47,960
in Black Panther - yeah we talked about name more on the on the pod one time and

1094
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,640
then the next day fucking damn a more it was crazy that they have a lady to be in

1095
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,400
Black Panther - they should put see we're gonna try to kill all the black people

1096
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,800
Yes, because he's a bad guy on it. That's kind of that's kind of not fair this

1097
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,040
there's a Marvel character that everyone loves and everyone's waiting for him.

1098
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,760
Well he's sometimes bad. Everyone's waiting for him to be in a movie and then he's gonna be the

1099
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,880
villain in Black Panther. Who is this guy? Namor? He's gonna try to destroy Wakanda. What the hell?

1100
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,080
Yeah he's like Marvel's Aquaman. Yeah he's a ripoff of Aquaman. I think he came before Aquaman.

1101
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,800
It's the same he's a ripoff of Aquaman. And he's a racist. They're apparently making him racist.

1102
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,040
that's that's really funny. They're like yeah, like we're excited and we're

1103
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,760
finally bringing spider man into the mcu and he won't be trying to destroy what

1104
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:42,480
that just doesn't seem fair, because he's not like a he's like a bad guy.

1105
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,360
Half the time, they shouldn't make him the like the race war.

1106
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:53,960
You guys, we finally secured the rights to the incredible hulk, but we had to

1107
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:59,380
I'm a pedophile. We're sorry. We're sorry. Yes, he turns green when he sees he

1108
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,980
turns green and big when he sees a kid. It's to destroy the version of Wakanda

1109
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:15,620
that's all kid the kid city. It's in the middle of Disneyland. It's where all

1110
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:21,140
the small world kids come from. I'm gonna I'm going to I'm gonna fucking me.

1111
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,540
I'm going to fly over to Wakanda like the guys volunteering for Ukraine.

1112
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:27,540
I'm going to save Wakanda.

1113
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,300
I'm going to go over there and they're going to use me like a cannonball.

1114
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,100
Well, I breathe Wakanda will not fall.

1115
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,100
That's right.

1116
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,100
That's right.

1117
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Wakanda forever.

1118
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,100
Yep.

1119
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,100
I'm going to go over there.

1120
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,860
I will not let this fucking fish freak destroy the blackest city in the world.

1121
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,500
I'm going to go protect it.

1122
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,540
It is cool that if anyone listening knows the exact coordinates of Wakanda,

1123
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,700
please send them in. Cause I have to go there. Yep. I gotta tell,

1124
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:00,220
I gotta figure out what to put in my GPS cause I'm on the way and yeah,

1125
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,740
I'm bringing in fucking snacks from America and they're going to lose their

1126
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:07,020
minds. We're going to trade, you know, I do. Can you imagine what like,

1127
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,500
you know,

1128
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,460
scientists try try American snacks for the first time. Yeah,

1129
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:12,820
that's going to go over there.

1130
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,940
I'm going to go over there with sour cream and onion chips.

1131
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,580
I gave you the Mexican ruffles. Can you imagine what the Wakanda ruffles taste

1132
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,220
like? Oh my God, I bet they're crazy. They're probably so good. They probably

1133
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,220
and I bet they have that I bet. Can you imagine how many warnings are on it

1134
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,800
because they're like mega healthy with the amount of people, the amount of

1135
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,000
with the amount of technology in that city? I'd think they'd they care less

1136
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,960
about potato chips and more about computer chips. Exactly I'd say yeah,

1137
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,560
there's there's heaven, there's chips, you know and they'd say what micro

1138
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,240
chips yeah, we already have enough of these. I mean like microchips that's

1139
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,560
barely enough to eat. I prefer mega chips

1140
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
microchips.

1141
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,460
