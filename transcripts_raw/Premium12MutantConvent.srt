21
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
The cat's getting into your face.

22
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,700
Why do you not just put the cat in somewhere while you record?

23
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
I will never understand.

24
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,700

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
What is that? How can you tell a cat gets freaked out?

29
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
He scratches at the door.

30
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700

31
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700

32
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,700

200
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,800
penis books looking at the penises he sees the equation on the board and then he just goes over

201
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,800
to the equal side and draws a three and a close parenthesis.

202
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,300
Yeah, good Caleb hunting.

203
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,300
And then he hooked me up with gay Robin Williams.

00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Oh, I'm gay! I'm gay!

205

Ooh, ooh, I'm gay!

206
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Yeah, and he talks about his husband all the time, my dead husband.

207
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,300
He used to, it was so beautiful, he used to come on my face.

208
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
It was amazing, the little idiosyncrasies.

209
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,660
Like when he would come on my face after I'd jack him off.

210
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,900
Throbbin Williams, that's what he's in that movie.

211
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,380
That's your professor.

212
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,860
And then Good Will Hunting, which is his name.

213
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,420
Good Caleb Hunting.

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,380
His name was, no, no, his name was Wood Will Hunting, his name of the movie.

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,460
Oh, okay.

216
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,020
Hunting for wood.

217
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,460
He's hunting for a guy's penis.

218
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,820
This is a good movie we're writing.

219
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,020
Yeah, and he goes to, instead of Harvard, or instead of MIT.

220
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,820
Matt Gaiman.

221
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,080
(laughing)

222
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,420
Matt Gaiman.

223
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,240

- Ben Assfuck.

231
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,420
And the girl is a guy.

232
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,820
(laughing)

233
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,120
So, pretty genius. - Manny Driver.

234
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,780
- Manny Driver, there we go.

235
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,020
(laughing)

236
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,320
And--

237
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I'd see this movie.

238
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
And that's the end of the movie.

239
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
Yeah, that's how the movie ends, is with the credits.

240
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeah.

241
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:58,200
And Ben Assfuck is like, "I drive by your house every morning and I knock on your door

242
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:05,560
and I just hope to God that you're in there having sex with a guy.

243
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,360
And every day that I walk up there and you're not, it breaks my fucking heart."

244
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,840
And then Matt Gaiman is like, "Can I suck your penis?"

245
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,320
I've never watched that entire movie.

246
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I only ever seen that entire movie.

247
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
That movie's about Boston.

248
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I know.

249
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,240
That movie is a love letter to Boston.

250
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
That movie's a love...

251
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
How do you like them assholes?

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
How do you like them assholes?

253
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
You like assholes?

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, of course I like assholes.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How do you like them assholes?

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Just spreading his butt against the window.

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,960
the fight on the in the basketball court is just just about the guys are fucking

261
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,720
wood Caleb well then I'm I'm this is a different movie that you would Caleb

262
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,080
hunting would Caleb hunting is about is about me hunting for around the the

263
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,720
forest like Elmer Fudd and I'm shooting a tree you're looking for big chungus no

264
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,240
yeah I'm looking for big chungus the animal yeah I'm looking for freaking big

265
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,500
chungus because you want them to have sex with you like an animals mm-hmm would

266
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:31,640
you want him to get you like a gorilla penis you want him to climb into your

267
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,980
hole like a monkey. Is he throwing up? I'm not throwing up. I'm just, I'm coughing up

268
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:42,080
shit and I'm just spitting it out. He's coughing up the cum from, from the gorilla. From Ben

269
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Assfuck. You wanna, you want a little monkey to explore you all over? No I don't. No. Um,

270
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,960
no that doesn't make any sense. Unless he was my doctor and he was doing a checkup.

271
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:59,920
And he was a. And he was also a monkey. Still. He was a doctor but he's still a monkey. I

272
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
I feel like we could teach doctor or we could teach doctors to be monkeys.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,280
I think pretty easily.

274
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,960
You want to be explored by a wild boar.

275
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
No I don't.

276
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,960
You want to.

277
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
No.

278
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
That would hurt.

279
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
They don't have a pose for thumbs.

280
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,320
You want a wild boar to ram into your tunnels.

281
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,700
That doesn't make any sense because they don't have any tunnels first of all and also wild

282
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,520
boar don't ram.

283
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Okay, you want to you want a billy goat to ram your tunnels?

284
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
No, I don't.

285
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
I feel like sometimes you guys just make stuff up.

286
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
You want to ram a billy goat's tunnels?

287
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Um, maybe if I was a veterinarian, which I've thought about.

288
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,520
You've thought about it because you wanted to test out different animals.

289
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
No, no, I don't want to test them out for what exactly?

290
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Sex. For having sex with you.

291
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,720
Why would I need to test him?

292
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Why couldn't I just have sex with him?

293
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,520
No, I don't. I wouldn't, first of all.

294
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,720
And I wouldn't need to, because I would be able to tell if I wanted to have sex with an animal just by looking at him.

295
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,520
But I would not want to have sex with an animal. I need to make that clear.

296
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
You want to touch a baboon's thing.

297
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:20,520
A baboon. So there, when you're talking about a baboon, most people think it's penis, but it also has an astonishing ass piece.

298
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,880
So, ask me, so which one would I be thinking of?

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,560
Yeah, Caleb's thinking about a baboon's-

300
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Before you fucking say anything, you never think them out!

301
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
You're thinking about a baboon's astonishing ass.

302
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
It doesn't have an astonishing ass.

303
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
You just said that!

304
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
No, I didn't. It's a miracle of nature.

305
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,560
You're thinking about a baboon's astonishing ass.

306
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,280
I don't think about a baboon's whatever anytime.

307
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,780
Yeah.

308
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,040
I think about women's big red asses.

309
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,540
Yeah.

310
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,880
Women humans!

311
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:59,920
No. No. Not women monkeys. No and if I was to have sex with a kind of monkey I would have

312
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,360
sex with a chimpanzee because they have beautiful breasts, the women chimpanzees.

313
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:14,040
You want to do a fish animal style? No I don't want to. All right then what do you

314
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,080
want to do? I want to. He just said he wants to have sex with a chimpanzee. Oh

315
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,000
yeah right okay I don't say I don't want to I said if I if you would want to have

316
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,280
somebody put a banana to my head like a gun and said you have to have sex with

317
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,640
one of these you have to sex have sex with a monkey I would have sex with a

318
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,320
chimpanzee you'd probably go chimpanzee on an orangutan an orangutan would

319
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,840
probably be my second choice because even the men have big floppy boobies and

320
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,640
I could do as I please did they name them that cuz they're orange nope no why

321
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,040
They would have named him Orange Champagne.

322
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Orange Tang.

323
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
That's...

324
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,760
I believe Orang is the name for ape in um...

325
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
In ape.

326
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
One of those languages.

327
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,080
Yeah.

328
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,640
In that language.

329
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,400
I know that language.

330
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Latin.

331
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
I got a job in Boston.

332
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Yeah, where?

333
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
I'm excited.

334
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
Say the address, the name of your new manager.

335
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
Okay, um, I'm just doing...

336
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,680
I'm just babysitting.

337
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I told...

338
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,960
a good babysitter. Oh you can hang out with Dom you guys can become nannies

339
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,960
together. She's already a nanny and I'm already a nanny though so why would we

340
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,800
hang out? We're not nannying the same family. Speaking of jobs in one of my classes because-

341
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,960
You gave a guy a blowjob in your class? Oh yeah. Yeah you did. No listen to this story.

342
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,680
Listen this is an important story. I went to visit that day. He was the guest

343
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,840
speaker. We went, the teacher had us go around and say what we did for work and

344
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:53,140
this kid, like, what class? It's this, it's a class about the writings of Marx.

345
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:02,640
Penisonomics. I'm in freakonomics. Yeah. Weinernomics. This kid was like

346
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,040
talking about his job and he had a voice, he had like this kind of voice you know

347
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,360
and he like said this whole thing. I wasn't really paying attention. He had, he

348
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,120
he talked about his job and at the end he was like,

349
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,480
and I wouldn't usually talk about this,

350
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,600
but I feel like this is becoming more and more normal

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,200
in today's society.

352
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,740
I actually go on dates with older men for money.

353
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,280
(laughing)

354
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,120
- Whoa.

355
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,520
- And the whole class was just silent

356
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,920
and then just went to the next person.

357
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,480
It was so awkward.

358
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,440
- That's cool.

359
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,480
- That's just a crazy thing to say to a whole class,

360
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,320
I feel like.

361
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,140
- That's a normal thing to say.

362
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,440
- On like the first day.

363
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,560
- That's a normal thing to say on the first day.

364
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,400
- And I, yeah.

365
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,680
- You gotta get all of the ice broken.

366
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:49,600
Gus told me that like the first class he ever took in college he um the

367
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
professor's like let's go around and say your name and then the name that you

368
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,240
want to be called during this class and then like a fun fact about yourself and

369
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,880
Gus was like my name is Gus I prefer to be called the wolf and my fun fact is my

370
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:15,880
My nickname is the wolf and the professor called him the wolf for the whole semester.

371
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,120
That's awesome.

372
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
The wolf is a name of a demon virus that's going to come from space and infect the earth

373
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,880
according to ExoPolitics Ohio radio show.

374
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,880
What is that?

375
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
Really?

376
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,520
That's this radio show I found online that's this guy who just calls like he just picks

I'm thinking of Halloween pig.

389
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Who's a pig that eats people.

390
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,600
I'm trying to think of what this could possibly be.

391
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
I think the Halloween pig freaks me the fuck out. I'm gonna say it.

392
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I'm terrified of the Halloween pig and his big orange pig face.

393
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I'm scared of that pig. I'm searching the Halloween pig. I don't fear much.

394
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
But I fear that pig. Fear the Halloween pig.

395
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,280
Yeah, it comes knocking at your door. If you hear a knock and then an oink, you do not want

396
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
to answer.

397
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
No.

398
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
On Halloween night.

399
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,400
Yeah, knock knock, who's there? Oink oink.

400
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,920
The Halloween pig.

401
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,000
It's me, the Halloween pig. Lock your doors, lock your windows.

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,680
I'm looking at terrifying photos of the Halloween pig.

403
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,960
Mutant pig person.

404
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,720
Show, look up pig Dracula.

405
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,800
Pig Dracula. More like pigula.

406
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Yeah.

407
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,480
Now you guys are both on your phones, so I'll talk more about...

408
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,640
So that guy, the Ohio ExoPolitics Radio, it's really good.

409
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
You should check it out.

410
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,100
I haven't listened to it in a long time.

411
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,840
There's like over a thousand episodes.

412
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,180
It's really fun to listen to.

413
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,160
He does a break in the middle where he just plays soothing...

414
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,840
Oh, there's Pig Dracula.

415
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Yeah.

416
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
"Hampire," it says.

417
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Oh, shit.

418
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
"Hampire?"

419
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,560
He plays soothing nature music for like five full minutes and is like, "Just use this time

420
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,800
to relax and reclaim your mind or something like that.

421
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,560
And then he goes back to being like, "And also there was a man who was taken far away from

422
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,840
the earth and came back and knew everything!"

423
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,240
And shit like that.

424
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
Are you guys off the computer yet?

425
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,520
Can- Dracula Pig and Farmville.

426
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
Dracula Pig.

427
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Farmville.

428
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,620
I'm getting news that Farmville added a Dracula Pig.

429
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,360
And everybody is freaking out.

430
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,160
Everybody's frightened as hell and getting really afraid.

431
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,960
Oh my god.

432
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
Oh, it's that Danny Trejo...

433
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
Uh...

434
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,560
There's a movie where Danny Trejo fights the pig people.

435
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,060
*laughs*

436
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,260
That's what I'm thinking of.

437
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Uh, it's called "Bullets Justice" or something?

438
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,760
Okay.

439
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,260
Bullets... that's his name.

440
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
*laughs*

441
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
"Bullets of Justice."

442
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,060
My name is "Bullets Justice."

443
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,060
*laughs*

444
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,560
I'm reading "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" right now.

445
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,060
Yeah.

446
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,560
Yeah.

447
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,660
And Mr. Hyde, the first thing that he does that's evil,

448
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:51,380
is he just walking and he just runs over a kid like with his feet and he just

449
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,540
walks over a kid and the kid goes like "AHHHHH" and then he just stands there and then the

450
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,980
people come up and go "What the hell are you doing?" and he's like "I'm really sorry"

451
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,340
and then he pays them a lot of money to not tell anyone

452
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,060
that he stepped on a kid. So he just steps on a kid he doesn't like... Yeah that's

453
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,540
the he does that and then he kills a guy those are the two bad things he does.

454
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,860
first night no the first night he steps on a pig and then he's really ready steps

455
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:24,900
on a kid I'm a kid sorry same thing in my mind you do call a baby pig a kid no

456
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,660
that's a goat nope all right you wouldn't know and then yeah the only

457
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,060
things bad he does is he's rude he steps on a kid and he kills an old guy which

458
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,540
none of those are that bad yeah yeah cuz let's go through it

459
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,500
- Old guy. - Steps on a kid.

460
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,660
So did he kill the kid?

461
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,500
- No. - He step-sons a kid?

462
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,140
- He just steps on the kid.

463
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,700
- He step-sons a kid? - Until,

464
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,900
what, is the kid okay?

465
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,100
- Yeah, 'cause step-fathers are evil.

466
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,480
- The kid definitely doesn't die,

467
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,140
but it says the kid cried and was hurt.

468
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,540
- Oh, that's fine. - Yeah, kids always cry.

469
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,980
- Yeah. - And then being rude

470
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,820
to somebody, I feel like he kinda,

471
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,020
he just did that by stepping on a kid.

472
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,100
- Yeah, well no, he's rude 'cause someone asks him

473
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,220
if he knows Dr. Jekyll, and he's like,

474
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,420
"Leave me alone," and closes the door.

475
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,340
And the guy was like, "I'd never encountered such an ugly and rude man in my life."

476
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,300
Dang, Mr. Hyde, he's off the sauce.

477
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Yeah.

478
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
And then he kills who?

479
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,900
Why does he kill the old man?

480
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I don't know.

481
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
It's not clear.

482
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,260
He meets up with the...

483
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Somebody sees out the window.

484
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,020
He meets up with an old guy in the street and is talking and then takes a cane and hits

485
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
him with the cane until he dies.

486
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,700
Yeah, so that's by far the worst part of the thing that he's done.

487
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,700
But it's still not that bad.

488
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
And then he runs away.

489
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
He vanishes.

490
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Well, he vanishes.

491
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,680
- He vanishes, but Dr. Jekyll is still around.

492
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,580
- What the hell?

493
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,360
- Interesting.

494
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,840
Yeah, those are the bad things he does.

495
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,100
And then he kills himself, I think,

496
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:48,940
which is also pretty bad.

497
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,140
- Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are kind of like the Hulk.

498
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,340
- They're kind of like the Hulk and the Red Hulk.

499
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,620
- It's kind of like Cameron who at night turns into a girl

500
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
and he walks around downtown and he says,

501
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,900
"Oh, someone give me a kiss."

502
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,900
*laughter*

503
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,400
That took so much out of him.

504
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, he's dying now.

505
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah, Caleb's fucking dying.

506
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm not dying.

507
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,900
I'm... yeah.

508
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,900
If you guys could turn into the Hulk, what color Hulk would you be?

509
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
The brown Hulk?

511
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Interesting choice, why?

512
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,900
All the same powers as the brown lightsaber.

513
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
Which are?

514
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900

I'm gonna have to sleep on the floor tonight.

521
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,400
- It was your sharp little clit.

522
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,380
- It's my sharp little nub that sticks off of my penis.

523
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,320
I do have a razor sharp penis.

524
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,160
- Yeah.

525
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,820
- It's like seven, it's like that thing in seven,

526
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,980
but it's really small.

527
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,700
- It's like seven centimeters.

528
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,380
- It's seven millimeters, yeah.

529
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,440
- It's seven.

530
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,380
- It's seven, it's a seven out of 10.

531
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,780
- It's seven degrees Celsius at all times.

532
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:11,960
It's pretty cold. Yeah. It's seven degrees Kelvin. I have the coldest penis. It gives you frostbite if you touch it.

533
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,820
I one time met a bodyguard, or not a bodyguard, a bouncer named Kelvin. Yeah, it's a name.

534
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,420
Yeah, it's a funny name. My brother and his friends in middle school

535
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,920
added some guy on Facebook named Agbanya Kelvin.

536
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,660
Agbanya Kelvin? Agbanya.

537
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,220
Would it be?

538
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:40,220
They forgot that he was still friends with them on Facebook and every year they forget and then every year on their birthdays

539
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:47,740
They get a birthday wish from a bug bong. Yeah, Elvin, dude. I have that from Shaheed Ali, you know, she's really no

540
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:54,660
He's classic. Have you said really old Indian guy who was adding a bunch of people in like 2016?

541
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,200
No still sir, maybe probably earlier than he tried to get the most friends

542
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,180
Well, you can only get five thousand a lot of people like there's no yeah, that's all yeah

543
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,500
So if you have 5,000, you have the most Facebook friends.

544
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Exactly.

545
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,460
He's a very nice guy, but sometimes he comments on my stuff very rarely, but then every time

546
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,060
it's my birthday, he sends me a long message.

547
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,900
What does he comment on your stuff?

548
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:25,660
He's just commented stuff like, "Very cool, inshallah," stuff like that.

549
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,660
I'll find it, but there's a, my girlfriend's parents' church,

550
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:39,700
their church went to South Africa, I think,

551
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,620
on some missions trip.

552
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:45,880
And in Africa, everybody loves Facebook.

553
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,780
And so all of these people that they met in Africa

554
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,180
started friending everybody who was on their friends list,

555
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,360
like all the missionaries' friends on Facebook,

556
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,600
and started messaging us

557
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,920

558
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,180

it was definitely not gay kevin i thought that you added him because his name was gay kevin

564
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,000
No, he added me and started talking to me and then called me a few times.

565
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,640
Sorry, they were in Zambibia.

566
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,080
There's a guy named Malou Ngouni who just sent me a wave and then just sent me all these different

567
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,280
photos of him next to some elephants.

Yeah, nice.

569
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,680
And then I just heart reacted and he said, "Thank you, brother."

570
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,600
Yeah, they all call you brother.

571

Let me get a...

593
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,640
I've been doing like weird smiles to people when I cross the street.

594
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,280
When somebody stops for me in their car, I turn to them and do like a really like weird

595
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
smile.

596
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
It's like it doesn't...

597
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
It's funny.

598
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Yeah.

599
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
It makes me laugh.

600
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:07,960
Just imagining if I do a really good one and someone in the car is just like, "What the

601
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
fuck?"

602
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
It flips you off.

603
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,960
It starts driving and runs me over.

604
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:22,800
My oldest Facebook message is from Kevin Feranto, who is this giant autistic kid that was my

605
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,280
best friend in middle school.

606
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,400
It was in 2009 and he says, "Are you Duck Caleb Pitts from CFCI?"

607
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,900
Which was our school.

608
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
And I said, "Yeah."

609
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
What does that stand for?

610
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,120
Kentucky Fried Science Chicken?

611
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,360
Kentucky Fried Chicken Institute.

612
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,560
Oh, here's Shaheed Ali.

613
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
He said, "I wish you very..."

614
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,840
My last birthday, he said, "I wish you very, very happy birthday to you.

615
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
You are always happiness and smiling.

616
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,640
May Allah bless you forever."

617
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
And then sent me a video.

618
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
And then sent me a video.

619
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:04,640
So right now, it's a video with multiple cakes.

620
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,140
And it's a British woman singing happy birthday.

621
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,860
it's just pictures of different cakes cartoon cakes they don't even look appetizing

622
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,060
yeah it's 30 seconds long. They don't even look like tasty cakes.

623
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,380
So and then he sent that and i said thank you so much good friend Shahid and he said

624
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,780
may Allah bless your days and your long life.

625
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,020
That's a really nice guy. Yeah sounds nice.

626
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,420
Trying to find it there's like a... I got a bunch of weirdos last year.

627
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:38,300
Oh dude i got that lady that uh you remember that fucking message where she's like

629
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:50,100
I have Desmaine blu-ray messages. Oh, yeah, dude. Desmaine blu-ray is the best

630
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,540
Have we ever talked about Desmaine blu-ray? I don't think we have cool. Abaco. Isaac was the guy who I wanted

631
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
Oh, yeah, not gay Kevin cool about

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,340

633
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,700
Confused those sound similar this guy this guy named

634
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Klein Hal just sent me random

635
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,320
Farside comics for like weeks and then videos of Jeff Dunham

636
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,220
And then a picture of kiss and I said, thank you. Is that kiss and he said yes

637
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:25,020
You tell me he sent you free farside comics. That's a come up and then he he sent me another farside

638
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,980
Where he circled the word dang and I said why is dang circled and he said I do that to words

639
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980
I read trying to put it into a creative place

640
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:37,740
So it comes out like improvisation when I create or tell stories or make humor when I talk or work in this creative process

641
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,500
As an art of sorts it lots of fun mixing and blending material automatically. I am playing I

642
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,900
am playing and

643
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,420
Then he he sent a picture of a bear shooting a bow and arrow at a heart and said want to move that heart down

644
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
For me a little my friend

645
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Yeah, he's pretty awesome

646
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,080
Desmond blu-ray was this guy that was in a Facebook group that me and

647
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,460
cam were in

648
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,540
That was cool. Was it which one was it?

649
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,820
Ascension fifth dimension ascension fifth dimension, which was just like a crazy like

650
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,660
basically like a conspiracy group and

651
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,300
Desmond would post stuff all the time about

652
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,900
Oh, I remember Ascension Fifth Dimension.

653
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:32,500
He was ascending and he was gonna go to, he was gonna like join a star and like become

654
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,000
one with a star.

655
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,760
And just, he would post this sort of like long drivel that didn't make a lot of sense.

656
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,100
And then people would say like, "Yeah, Desmond, awesome."

657
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,740
But then at some point, they kind of explicitly sounded like he was gonna kill himself.

658
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Yeah, he was, yeah.

659
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:58,500
So it would be like, I'm gonna leave my corporeal form and join my place among the heavens.

660
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,060
And like I'm finally ascending.

661
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,020
And then people were just like, "Woo!

662
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,140
You go Desmond!"

663
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,980
And me and Cameron just were like, "Please don't kill yourself."

664
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
And then he disappeared.

665
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
He was gone for like six months.

666
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,700
Yeah, he was gone for a long time.

667
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,460
Then he came back.

668
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,580
Like the legend of the phoenix.

669
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Like Jesus Christ.

670
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Yeah, he came back, I remember that.

671
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Like Jesus Christ from Superstar.

672
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
I just remember I got that message from that woman

673
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
and then it said "Mutual Friends

674
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
Desme and Blu-Ray."

675
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,580
Yes, you know that that's about

676
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
to be one wild ass

677
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
best friendship forever when Desme

678
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
and Blu-Ray is a mutual.

679
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
We gotta get Desme on.

680
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,580
I agree, I said we should try to

681
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,580
and then you said no.

682
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,580
I remember that.

683
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,100
Hold a grudge much, bitch?

684
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,100
Yeah.

685
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,140
Yeah, Ascension Fifth Dimension was a good page.

686
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
I stopped looking at it.

687
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,420
I still highly recommend.

688
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,820
My recent obsession has been with targeted individuals and gang stalking groups.

689
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,800
Those ones are scary though.

690
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,180
People in those are legitimately crazy and I'm afraid that most of them are going to

691
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,340
kill themselves or kill the people around them.

692
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,580
Those do border on like, these are the kind of people who do...

693
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,740
There was a I found a picture that someone posted that was literally just

694
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,400
trying to get like people who think they're being gang stalked to do mass

695
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,840
shootings like somebody posted a thing that was like it remember it is

696
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,640
completely okay and legal to kill the people who are stalking you like and if

697
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,000
you believe you are being watched by government hand handlers around your

698
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,220
life like just attack them and cause as much harm as you can it was like scary

699
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,260
as fuck is crazy yeah and it's just like this is all on Facebook right don't they

700
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,020
They don't crack down on this at all.

701
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,780
Yeah, no, Facebook, they don't crack down on shit.

702
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,820
They just have like one million groups that are just full of just like crazy people like

703
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
that.

704
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,380
Yeah, fucking meanwhile, I'm banned from Twitter for a week because I said that I wanted to

705
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,260
see Jameela Jamil's giant boobies.

706
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,860
God damn this fucking world.

707
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,420
The world's fucking this world now.

708
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
Literally a hell site.

709
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Uh huh, literally.

710
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
Yeah.

711
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,980
I'm being gang stalked by Jameela Jamil's big titties.

712
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,300
I would like to gang stalk her giant big boobie bubbies.

713
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,660
I she she's she's a bitch for that.

714
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,620
For real.

715
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,300
Jamila if you're listening fuck you.

716
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,180
You're a fucking bitch.

717
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,460
There was one in one of the gang stalking groups there's a person who believes there's

718
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:39,420
a like a thing called um called rare females which is like a special species of woman that

719
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,500
has telepathy and tries to like destroy men and gang stalks men and they're

720
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,580
called and he wrote this huge manifesto about rare females that he posted about

721
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,460
all the time. It's a rare female manifesto. Yeah we should read about rare females one of

722
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,340
these episodes. I completely agree with this guy. Haven't even read it but I'm

723
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:03,060
with him. Shiny females. Mm-hmm shining blue eyes shining females. That's

724
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,140
terrifying. A blue eyes shining female? That'd be crazy. Yeah I know who she's

725
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:19,940
voting for. That lying bitch. What's her name? The one from TV. Blue Eyes White Dragon? Blue

726
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:30,500
Eyes Red Skin. What's her name? Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren? Yeah. Nice. Blue Eyes Red

727
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,540
Skin. Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, dude when I get unlocked from Twitter I'm gonna so fucking

728
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,380
own her with that one? Yeah. I feel like that doesn't make much sense out of the context

729
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:49,040
of Blue Eyes Shining female. Yeah, it does. Alright. Yeah. Stupid. What if it's like a

730
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,940
Yu-Gi-Oh card that says Blue Eyes Red Skin Dragon? What if there is a Yu-Gi-Oh card? And

731
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,780
it's Liz Warren Khaleesi? Yeah. What if there's a Yu-Gi-Oh card and you could... This is my

732
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,060
daughter Elizabeth Warren Khaleesi. There's a Yu-Gi-Oh card that's called like

733
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,340
ultimate friendship and on the picture and the card is a picture of Yu-Gi-Oh and

734
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,700
Joey shaking hands and the card is like ask your opponent if they want to

735
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:25,140
handshake and if they shake your hand you get like 1,000 life points and they

736
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:39,300
the

737
00:41:39,300 --> 00:42:04,300
have

738
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,440
all the leftover chips from all the other bags and put them in one bag okay all

739
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,520
right you listening yeah they go into the trash can they find all the chips I

740
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,520
didn't eat the crumbs and stuff and they stitch them together into big full chips

741
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,660
and make a band together with with with thread with edible floss yeah no not

742
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,800
just regular no with edible for edible floss that's mint flavored because I like

743
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:34,840
the mint flavored floss. But then everything would just be mint flavored. Just eating floss.

744
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,440
Just pulling floss out of the container just swallowing it. That's pretty good. Swallowing

745
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,840
one long strand of floss. What is floss made out of? String. Really? Yeah. Yeah it's string

746
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,480
that they uh. String and flavor. They brush the strings teeth and then they give it to

747
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,960
you. It's actually, it's tooth, you know toothbrush bristles? Yeah. It's from the same plant.

748
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,800
The tooth plant. See that's what I was wondering. The dentist's plant. There's a dentist, it's

749
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,980
called dentata hydrania and it's actually, that's the name of it. That's actually the

750
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,520
name of it I've just discovered. This is a science podcast now. Yeah let's do some science.

751
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I fucking love science. Let's do some science. Let's do a science experiment.

752
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,020
No, that's the first time I ever...

753
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,020
Podcast about list science experiment.

754
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:32,020
First time I ever interacted with Patrick was from Caleb starting fights on "I fucking love science."

755
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,520
[laughter]

756
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,020
That's true.

757
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,020
I don't remember that.

758
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,520
I was at work. I was at...

759
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,020
That's too long ago.

760
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,520
I was at... working at Clover at the time, and I was...

761
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
Uh...

762
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Yeah, you were arguing with that guy, and then I was arguing with him too.

763
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
And then I was too.

764
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
What were we arguing about?

765
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,000
about you said but I was literally doing it like while taking people's orders at

766
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,240
work you like posted something and I fucking love science it was like yeah

767
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,840
this isn't true I work in a lab with this every day and this doesn't happen

768
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,520
and then like somebody responded like you were an idiot and you said like your

769
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,720
mind is is empty you brainless lepton and he went to your profile and his comment

770
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,040
on every post I do remember that that was my move what I would I would anytime

771
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,700
time there was a like a story posted about a scientific discovery I would just

772
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,320
comment and be like "Wrong! I work in this field in a lab daily and we have never

773
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,640
heard of this!" and people would just comment. And I remember you had one

774
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,960
about how dogs couldn't dream because they were too low IQ.

775
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:39,840
Yeah that's true. Yeah and then you have to have an IQ of 80 to dream. Dogs have a 40 IQ.

776
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,840
People got mad. I got in trouble in the Live PD Facebook group because there's a

777
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,560
"Everyone keeps posting about this dog that's dying, this canine unit that's dying, named

778
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,120
LORE, spelled L-O-R-E."

779
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,120
I didn't know it was a canine unit dog.

780
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Yeah, yeah.

781
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,200
And I kept commenting, "I would never name a dog LORE."

782
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,680
And I was arguing with this woman who it turned out was the admin of the group that I did

783
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
not realize was.

784
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,800
But she was like, "You're being rude."

785
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,120
And I was like, "I don't get why anyone cares about this dog.

786
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,520
It's such a stupid name."

787
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Shit like that.

788
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,720
I got a week-long ban.

789
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,720
If it's over I'm going to go back and comment.

790
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,920
I've changed my mind.

791
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,720
Laura's actually a great name for a dog and then when she replies I'm going to say "Not!"

792
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,880
and hopefully get banned permanently.

793
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,300
It's funny to dole out a week-long ban in a Facebook group like that when somebody's

794
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,600
clearly just being like a dumbass.

795
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,240
They're like, "Well, give them a week and they'll straighten out."

796
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,720
I'm actually going to check if the ban is up right now.

797
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
It might be.

798
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,760
Because that's, yeah, I do want to comment that.

799
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,200
Or I just want to go back and comment "Coward."

800
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,200
Which one's better?

801
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,200
No, not funnier.

802
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
Okay.

803
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Let's see.

804
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,400
I have, uh, looks like for me I have five days, three hours left on my ban.

805
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Damn.

806
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
Damn.

807
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
That sucks.

808
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Come on, son.

809
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
That's effed up.

810
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
One more day on my ban, baby.

811
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I don't even give a fuck.

812
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,400
Damn, one more day on the ban.

813
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
One more day on the ban.

814
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,840
One more day until I can comment in Live PD and say I love lore.

815
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,840
I

816
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:16,080
Name for a dog though. I was thinking I was trying to figure out if it might be short for Lorenzo

817
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,760
That'd be a good dog like a girl or instead of Enzo

818
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,560
Yeah, yeah, well cuz I was just trying to figure out what it could possibly be short for Laura

819
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,760
Short for the Gore Burger show

820
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,120
Short for Lorman filler shut up doorman near

821
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Yes

822
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:47,240
Lormann I keep getting emails because I forgot to drop all my classes when I took the leave of absence. Yeah, I

823
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:54,200
Forgot to drop them and I keep getting emails about this Norman Lear seminar class. I signed up for

824
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,880
Because I had signed up for a class about Norman Lear

825
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,680
Yep, because he gave the school enough money that they were like, well, we got to teach this fucker now

826
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:10,940
That's they have to teach about him. Yeah, that is truly nuts. I know that's a nut so stupido

827
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,440
It's a math class. Yeah

828
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
But it's you it uses Lear math

829
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,320
What is that nor mathematics nor mathematics where you have

830
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,400
You have laughs and giggles laughs plus giggles equals t8 equals primetime television. Yep, and

831
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:36,280
And that's how we made so much money. That's why we got famous. Yeah, he got a million dollars using

832
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,700
We it's a whole it's a whole like like

833
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,920
textbook that is just a bunch of like algebra questions where it's like

834
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,760
like laughs plus black character equals X and

835
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,520
You have to find out what X is equals dynamite dynamite

836
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:58,700
That's the truth was he did Norman Lear write good times. I don't yeah, I'll say yeah

837

He did the one, the show with Archie Bunker, right?

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:07,100
Yeah, yeah, Archie Bunker, who's like, now that I think about it, a total Donald Trump.

839
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,100
Yeah.

00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,100
Oh, yeah.

841
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,100

No

864
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260

Oh, I got like a cover of I'm on a boat by the Lonely Island and yesterday

00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:51,540
Like so there was one that was like a bachelor party and they just recreated the music video

- Podcast about Lisko's pop punk

882
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,160
and we changed it from a 99 to 2003.

883
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,740
- Eminem had a new album today.

884
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,060
- Eminem goes pop punk.

885
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,620
- Apparently he says the N word three times on it.

886
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,900
- Really? - Whoa.

887
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,140
- I saw a post about all the different lyrics.

888
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,260
He has some crazy lyrics on here.

889
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,100
- I'll say.

890
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,060
- I just finished fucking a fish.

891
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,320
(laughter)

892
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,300
- Let's see.

893
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,140
- Well.

894
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,920
- What?

895
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,020
- I knew Eminem was gonna say it one day.

896
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,500
- Say what?

897
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,340
- The N word.

898
00:50:58,340 --> 00:50:59,820
- Oh yeah.

899
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,620
Here's one, but I'm contemplating yelling bombs away

900
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,420
on the game like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande

901
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,560
concert waiting.

902
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,860
- Whoa, that's insane.

903
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,940
- Damn, is Slim Shady back?

904
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:22,300
I think Slim Shady may have resurfaced after many years hiding in Dr. Dre's ass.

905
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,140
In Dr. Dre's ass, yeah.

906
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,380
He looks to me, Eminem, I know this doesn't make any sense, but to me Eminem looks like

907
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:35,700
Will Smith.

908
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,340
Do you know what I'm talking about?

909
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,540
Yeah, a little bit.

910
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,900
Honestly, a little bit.

911
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:50,260
he looks like iRobot Will Smith you know yeah yeah yeah cuz Will Smith is part

912
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,260
robot and that's Eminem's whole thing and that's how he raps so fast because he has a

913
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:01,000
computer chip and they plug a computer chip into his into the his his spinal

914
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,060
cord you plug Eminem into a Commodore 64 with a ribbon cable yeah he sits there

915
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,060
and he goes *makes weird noises*

916
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:17,060
They put a game shark in Eminem's brain so that he can rap like that.

917
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,060
Truly a rap god.

918
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:28,060
Yeah, the code for the game shark, just type in "rap god" and you can change Eminem's rap stat to 99.

919
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,060
Yeah, and you can unlock the n-word.

920
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,060
Yeah, which he just did apparently.

921
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:35,060
He just unlocked the n-word for his music.

922
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:42,060
it

923
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:47,260
Yeah, he uh, maybe he didn't I just saw I saw it was one of those those, you know, those genius things

924
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:51,620
Oh, then maybe someone had a feature. I'm sure it's a feature. Yeah that somebody oh

925
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:57,100
That's probably what it is. Yeah. Yeah, cuz that'd be a that'd be an insane late career

926
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:03,680
Move, that would be a pretty funny late career. I could see him doing it

927
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,020
Really really it would be funny

928
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:12,020
I mean if he's trying to like go back to his like if he's trying to be like that crazy-ass white boy again

929
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:16,080
You know that is that's the next step right? You know that's why it's funny like

930
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:23,000
He's trying to be like like an absent father now. Well the new album is called music to be murdered - oh

931
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,380
That is crazy white boy shit

932
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:32,880
Speaking of crazy white boy shit did I send you the the cipher from my hometown?

933
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Yeah, the white rappers in high school.

934
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Grind mode.

935
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
Yeah, I've seen some grind modes in my day.

936
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,880
Yeah. Yeah, that guy, the rapper from my high school does grind mode too.

937
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,880
Really? Yeah.

938
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,880
Shit. Was he in the video I sent you?

939
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:46,880
No, he's M.A.

940
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
Oh.

941
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,880
He does the boss in grind mode.

942
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Oh, okay. Yeah, they did New Hampshire grind mode.

943
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,880
Is there any good rappers from y'all's high schools?

944
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,880
No.

945
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,880
I don't want to plug them because, uh...

946
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
There is one crazy people.

947
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
Do you still hang out with them?

948
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,960
with them. Yeah, my friends do hang out with him. And he keeps trying to get me to and I

949
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,680
don't really want to. There was a kid who became a rapper like this year that I used to sit

950
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,960
in the lunchroom with and he taught me this thing that if you take the Powerade label

951
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,560
off and you like glue it back together, you use like, you heat up the glue and put it

952
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,560
back together, if you slam it down hard enough on the lunch table it sounds like a gunshot.

953
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,820
(laughter)

954
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,120
- Yeah, he taught me how to do that,

955
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,100
and then we just used to do that in the lunchroom

956
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,500
as like a fun prank.

957
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,820
(laughter)

958
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,660
- That's cool.

959
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,820
What's perfect about that is that

960
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,620
everybody gets so used to that,

961
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,380
and so when they hear a real gunshot,

962
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,180
they're like, "Oh, it's just a Gatorade label."

963
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,580
(laughter)

964
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,700
We don't have to worry.

965
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,860
- Yeah, wow, there's a lot of Gatorade labels.

966
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:54,100
- Whoa, somebody's fucking popping off the Gatorade labels.

967
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,660
- That, and then you can do that with milk cartons, too.

968
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,500
if you say it is an automatic gatorade label if you slam the milk carton hard

969
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,720
enough it makes a pretty good sound

970
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,720
i don't know if he's the guy i got no no i got in front of i got in trouble with

971
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:12,280
my friends for throwing gummies on the ceiling in making them stick

972
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,480
uh... yeah that's a people class people do that you do with paper towels and

973
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,740
water and soap

974
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,320
uh... the at that point that was fun yeah i just did i did that a couple times

975
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,220
with those hand things you get from an arcade

976
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,140
or like a, you know those sticky hands?

977
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,880
You could just, they would live up there.

978
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,020
- Yeah.

979
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,860
- They'd just be gone forever.

980
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,620
- They'd like fall into someone's food,

981
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,380
like, three years later.

982
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,300
- Yeah, and those people thought that it was a real hand.

983
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,940
- Yeah, I just remember--

984
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:39,780
- Ah!

985
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,620
- 'Cause my--

986
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,780
- Fucking idiot.

987
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,740
- My, fucking, my lunchroom in high school was like,

988
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,560
part, like, they used it as the gym sometimes,

989
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,500
so it had a really high ceiling,

990
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,680
so when we got the gummies stuck to the ceiling,

991
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,600
It was like up there for like two weeks.

992
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,500
'Cause we got us stuck up there during,

993
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,120
like we had some standardized tests

994
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,760
so the schedule was different.

995
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
So we went and it was like,

996
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,380
we had lunch a period earlier,

997
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,400
so we were like, oh, why don't we just dick around

998
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,480
'cause we have lunch after this period.

999
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,960
- You have periods in your school?

1000
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,800
- Yeah. - Girl.

1001
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
- What? - No.

1002
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,640
- Girl.

1003
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,280
- But so we had like lunch at C period,

1004
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,120
but then we originally had lunch D period,

name was Bruce Rumshottle, and I remember I got it stuck up there and then I pointed it

1030
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,160
out two weeks later because I was like, "Oh my god, you guys, it's still fucking up there!"

1031
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,720
And one of my assistant principal, who ran the Twitter account that I got in trouble

1032
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,000

1063
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,160
I mean if you don't. Yeah, when did that develop?

1064
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:30,800
I don't. They don't explain how he went through like most of his life. Just keeping his eyes closed.

1065
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,220
Yeah, he should have been blind. Do you think he came out the womb?

1066
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:39,100
He killed his mom. Came out the womb with the eyes gone? He killed his mom, yeah.

1068
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:51,080
I bet are mutants born don't mutants develop their powers? Yeah, I think it's like I think he probably developed it through puberty then.

1069
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:57,080
Yeah, like 13 or something. 13 or 14. Yeah, like 18, like puberty. Yeah, puberty at 18.

1070
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,320
Yeah, like puberty at 18, right guys? Yeah. I think I hit puberty at 18.

1071
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:08,040
They develop it whenever you can, they're legally allowed to have sex. So, changes by state.

1072
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,040
So, like in Louisiana, you develop a power when you're 16.

1073
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,080
Yeah. It's the age of mutant.

1074
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,520
Yeah, the age of mutant.

1075
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
