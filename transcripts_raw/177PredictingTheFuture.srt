1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,320
- We're in a rush today, so let's try to do the episode

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,400
really, really fast.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,240
- Why are we in a rush?

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,060
- Half the time.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,280
- 'Cause if your fucking butt was stinking up the room,

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,320
we're gonna die if we're gonna be here longer than an hour.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,560
Listen, I've been chill lately, Pat.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,400
I've been chillin'.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,240
- He has not been chill.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,880
- But today, I'm gonna tear you down.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,680
- Wait, wait, wait.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,680
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no!

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,160
No, that is not what we do around here.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,360
You do not tear him down.

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm gonna put you in the dirt today.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,040
Don't you dare put him in the dirt.

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
But, if you had to give an example

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,160
of what that would look like,

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,080
I'd like to see it so that I can condemn it.

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,640
I don't wanna handle this right now.

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,480
I don't think I can handle this right now.

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,520
You're gonna handle your, a boy's cock.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,360
Yeah.

25
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
So that's a comment. He said yeah.

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,560
I'm gonna handle a cock, I'm gonna be gay, I'm gonna--

28
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,000
No, okay, I'm just, listen.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Really? Can I just,

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
I had a bad set last night.

31
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,920
you have to stop bullying me.

32
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,080
- That's your plan is to handle a cock and be gay?

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
- That's a plan?

34
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,360
- Wait.

35
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,000
- Can I just say something really quick though?

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,840
- Yeah, go ahead.

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
- I know we like to, we joke around.

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,960
We do, we put each other down.

39
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,220
We do the flop joke.

40
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,700
We do the fail joke.

41
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,560
And it's fun.

42
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,760
But if you guys ever say the flop thing about me,

43
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,880
I'm flying off the handle.

44
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,480
I'm tearing down this whole set.

45
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
- Yeah.

46
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,240
- I'm windmill kicking you in the face and I'm leaving.

47
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,580
- I would say that even just you saying that

48
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,320
is the beginning of a giant flop for you.

49
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,200
- Watch what you say.

50
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
I think that you're flopping and failing.

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,360
Because you don't know what I'm capable of.

52
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
We're two minutes in and this is your--

53
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,480
I know what you're capable of.

54
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
You don't know what I'm capable of.

55
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,240
I know that if you do this--

56
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,520
Nobody knows what I'm capable of.

57
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,120
I know, I've seen him in the gym.

58
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,760
He's capable of a lot.

59
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah?

60
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,420
Yeah.

61
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,600
Is he doing like the tire thing

62
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
that's supposed to be exercise?

63
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,520
I do deadlifts and I throw it up in the air

64
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,480
and I catch it.

65
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,960
He's one-armed snatching 400 kilograms.

66
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,260
Yeah, what I do, I walk over to someone else

67
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,040
who's deadlifting, I grab it out of their hand

68
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,440
and I throw it across the gym and it hits the other wall,

69
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,200
it goes through, it goes out into the street,

70
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
it crashes a car.

71
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
And you know what a car is?

72
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
The damn ice cream truck.

73
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,240
That's a bigger car than normal.

74
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,360
- What his workout is, is he goes into places

75
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
and he starts stealing stuff just so he can

76
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,640
lift the security up and fight the security.

77
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,720
He gets the security on each arm.

78
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
- And it's also to practice my stealth too.

79
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,880
- Yeah, and also, that's actually a pretty good workout.

80
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720
That's like a CrossFit workout.

81
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
- A stealth workout.

82
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,720
- You fight the security.

83
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Just doing stealth stuff.

84
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,520
- Yeah, you go to a gym in the Elder Scrolls world

85
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,640
and it's like there's a section where you do stealth

86
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,960
to level up your stealth stat,

87
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,760
there's a staff you can pick up to do--

88
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,160
- It's trained by a Bosmer.

89
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,160
- Yeah, yeah, it's just all the different skill,

90
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,480
they have a bunch of little setups

91
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,640
of all the different skills.

92
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
Why don't they just do that in that universe,

93
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,400
instead of leveling up by adventuring?

94
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,240
- They don't need the gym 'cause they have adventures.

95
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
- But adventures are harder than the gym.

96
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,640
- But you can pay probably like 1,000 gold to somebody

97
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,800
if your barter is high enough to--

98
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
- Well see, that's the gym,

99
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
you'd be able to level up your barter too.

100
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,760
There's magic and potions in that and there's probably a potion that you can take that makes you buff as shit

101
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah, they're you can't just say probably the games out there. It doesn't exist

102
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,440
No that exists

103
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
I don't think a

104
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,540
500 gold to learn how to make potions and then I don't know if I was in the gym

105
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,840
Kind of is the closest thing that we have to adventure in our our

106
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,260
Yeah, the gym and Pam's adventure to love adventure

107
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,360
their adventure through their life and

108
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,380
That's actually a good point people say I'm going to the gym. I'm like

109
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,700
He's not real

110
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,360
Mm-hmm. I'm not smart me neither. Yeah when people say stuff. I get pretty easily. I'm pretty hungover today you guys I'm gonna

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,500
Level with you. I'm gonna hang you over my knee and slap

112
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,980
G VIX in the past 24 hours

113
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:55,260
This one or the drink the beer the beer nice Polish beer is you wake you pull them off

114
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,260
I polished off some G-Vec.

115
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,260
That's, that is, you have just stumbled into the, we need, in our neighborhood.

116
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Let's check this one out.

117
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,260
In our neighborhood, we have to sell that shirt.

118
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Check this one out really quick.

119
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,260
99 bottles of G-Vec on the wall, 99 bottles of G-Vec.

120
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Take one down, pass around, 100 bottles of G-Vec on the wall.

121
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,260
Hey, hey, whoa, okay.

122
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,260
These Polish people are not too bright, if you ask me.

123
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Speaking of I

124
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,820
There's like all those Polish like delis and stuff in the around where I live

125
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,920
And I went into one and I saw that they had

126
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:38,240
Lay's beef goulash chips, they're stupid you ever have some crazy ass those stores are actually so good

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,920
Though you're gonna Polish. I try to have an idea

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,300
You ever seen that

129
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,980
Have you ever seen that yes be careful wait. He's Polish. I don't remember. Yeah, oh damn it never know it's okay

130
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm like a race traitor or something

131
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:00,700
Polish guy having something about the light bulb

132
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, yeah, I was just thinking you were saying you stupid no no no, but something about the light

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How to get the light bulb above his head

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,700
They have a village or cave

135
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,340
- A triangle. - A pierogi.

136
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,180
That they all live in.

137
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,160
- Never had a pierogi. - I think they live

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,620
in grocery stores. - I think they change

139
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,620
your tune. - I do think they live

140
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,260
in little tiny grocery stores

141
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,860
that are the size of this room.

142
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,700
- In meat markets that you walk in,

143
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,700
and they have an empty case,

144
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,180
and every single meat is hanging from the ceiling, right?

145
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,340
That's nasty, I don't wanna eat these meats.

146
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,820
These hanging meats. - Every time I will go

147
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,540
to the Polish grocery store, they follow me around

148
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,580
like I'm in a shoplift.

149
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,420
They're pickled, disgusting food.

150
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,720
- I'm getting pretty, I was racially profiled the other day.

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,560
- Yeah?

152
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,380
- How?

153
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,860
- I walked into a, I'm not gonna say what 99 cent store,

154
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,300
but I walked into a 99 cent store.

155
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,060
I don't wanna put them on blast for being scared.

156
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,500
- You need to choose your words carefully

157
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,800
'cause there's not a lot of them in New York.

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
(laughing)

159
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
- That's a good point.

160
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,780
- You could be putting this place on blast.

161
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,580
- Yeah, I know, I don't wanna put them out of business

162
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,540
so I'm not gonna say what was going on

163
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,680
- Or what it was called.

164
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,400
- Don't tell them if it was 99 cents and up.

165
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,700
- It was 99 cents and up.

166
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
It wasn't just 99 cents.

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,340
So that's--

168
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,540
- You are putting this small business on blast.

169
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,380
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

170
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,700
- Only in New York would they have a store called 99 cents

171
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,140
and up. - It's actually the largest

172
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,140
one I've been, yeah, actually it wasn't even in New York.

173
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,060
- It wasn't New York.

174
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,900
- I went in and the guy--

175
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,460
- Was it the one by Stop and Shop?

176
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,940
- It's the one right across from my house.

177
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,100
I went in and the guy, that's the thing,

178
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,980
I go into this place probably every single day.

179
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,340
and I get something or I get something for the show.

180
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,700
I'll get, that's where I get all the toys.

181
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,060
All the toys are from there.

182
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,860
They know me as a toy guy.

183
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,140
And I walk in and the guy's talking to the lady

184
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,380
at the register, the owner, manager dude.

185
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,060
And then he sees me and he looks at me,

186
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,900
gives me a stinky, stinky eye.

187
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,780
He's like, okay, I'm not liking this guy so much.

188
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,860
And then I turn a corner into one of the aisles

189
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,500
and I'm getting like a sheet of paper or some shit.

190
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,340
Prank guest vibes.

191
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,180
And I see him.

192
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,420
99 cent paper.

193
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,420
Maybe, yeah, maybe they've seen prank casting.

194
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
(laughing)

195
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,580
They're just kind of scared.

196
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,020
- It's like walking up to the register

197
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,860
with a piece of paper.

198
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,300
- Oh no, I know what this guy's about to do.

199
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,140
- If you see--

200
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,820
- One piece of paper, sir.

201
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,240
- If you see bad grandpa walk into your store,

202
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,420
you're like, that's, I would say, no, no, no, bad grandpa.

203
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,260
- You'd have to be 86.

204
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,300
- Yeah, if bad grandpa had just come out

205
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,500
and I was a store owner, I saw any old guy walking in.

206
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,340
- Dude, I'd have--

207
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,160
- I'm kicking his shit.

208
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,540
- I'm trying to rip your skin off

209
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,940
'cause I know what's underneath that.

210
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,940
I'd have a sign in front of the store that says, "Grandpas need not apply."

211
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
Yeah.

212
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,440
"Grandpa's entrance around the back."

213
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,340
Because you know that he's going to put a turd in a wheelbarrow or something.

214
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,540
Yeah, his nuts are going to get stuck in my vending machine.

215
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Exactly.

216
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
And I don't even own that.

217
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
Exactly.

218
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,140
Some guy paid to put that in here and he collects the coins at the end of the week.

219
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Some poor dude.

220
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,140
And I'm going to have to sign a release.

221
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,380
If that grandpa came into my store and he did a thing where he rode a motorcycle through

222
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,820
a plate class window or something, I'd be like, "Oh, great job, dude.

223
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,820
You hurt yourself."

224
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
Yeah.

225
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Where's the part where I care?

226
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,260
Hey, nice job, douche.

227
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
You fucking hurt yourself.

228
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
You fucking douche-tabash, grandpa.

229
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,760
You pranked yourself, you dumbass.

230
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,260
Yeah.

231
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,260
You hurt yourself.

232
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
What do I care?

233
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,760
Yeah.

234
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,260
All you did was break my window.

235
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,260
I don't care about my window.

236
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
Oh, no, my window!

237
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
No!

238
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,760
Oh, no!

239
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,260
Boo-hoo!

240
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,760
Fuck you, douchebag!

241
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,760
That's what I would be like to my grandpa.

242
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
You farting douche-nozzle.

243
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,260
But basically, this guy, I saw him.

244
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
I watched him the entire time.

245
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,760
He was watching me on the TV, because they have all the security cameras right there.

246
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
Were you wearing a hoodie?

247
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
He just sat there.

248
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,760
I was wearing a hoodie.

249
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,120
- I did, thought that I was a gangster.

250
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,520
- Oh shit.

251
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
Hood up?

252
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,840
- Hood up with the shysty.

253
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
- Shysty?

254
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,500
- I had my--

255
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
- Spiked gauntlets?

256
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,640
- I had my shysty on, I had my brass knuckles on.

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
- And my spiked shysty.

258
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,000
- Riding boots?

259
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
- Had my riding boots, I had a flamethrower.

260
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,840
- I have my spiked shysty on, it's got spikes

261
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
all over the damn thing.

262
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,080
- I had a big canvas bag with a dollar sign on it

263
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,040
and I was walking around and he was just being a bitch to me

264
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,580
and then when I left, here's the worst part,

265
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,280
I didn't buy anything.

266
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,580
So when I left, he's giving me the stink eye

267
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,420
all the way through.

268
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,860
He's thinking, if this guy--

269
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,580
- I hate leaving a place and not buying something.

270
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,420
- Me too, because I always--

271
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,660
- I feel bad.

272
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,500
- I don't feel bad.

273
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
I think I'm gonna go to jail all the time.

274
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,660
- Yeah, no, that's why I feel--

275
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,980
- They're gonna accuse me of stealing.

276
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,340
Okay, if I go into a place, I either,

277
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,460
which this doesn't make any sense,

278
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,900
I either want to, I have to buy something,

279
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,220
or I have to use the bathroom there.

280
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,820
And if I don't, 'cause if somebody sees me use the bathroom,

281
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,200
they say, well, he didn't buy anything,

282
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,800
but at least he put the most disgusting shit in the world

283
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,640
that I have to clean up.

284
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
- You know what I think?

285
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,960
When I walk into a place and I walk around for a while

286
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
and I walk out without buying anything,

287
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,600
I feel like I'm a ghost.

288
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,520
I feel like I'm like a lost spirit.

289
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,360
- You know what I'm saying?

290
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
- Going into a store.

291
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
- I feel like I'm going past everyone,

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,840
they can't see me,

293
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,120
but they feel like a breath of wind on their cheek

294
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
as I walk past.

295
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,400
- Going into a store, not buying anything,

296
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,920
but just going around like.

297
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,000
- Yeah, that's what I feel like.

298
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,720
- One of my worst feelings,

299
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,040
which I don't know, I'm a grown man,

300
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,960
I shouldn't feel like this,

301
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,440
is when I go into a store and I have something in my hand

302
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,560
from a different store and I walk around and I'm like--

303
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
- I hide the can in my pocket.

304
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,240
- Yeah, I do the same thing and then it looks

305
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
like I'm stealing it.

306
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
- I put like a half--

307
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
- Especially if they sit, like if I walk around

308
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,120
with this kombucha and I see the kombucha on the shelf,

309
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,360
it's the worst moment of my life.

310
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,280
- I had like a Celsius in my pocket

311
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,800
walking around the store one day.

312
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,720
- 'Cause I-- - Just like already

313
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
drank everything.

314
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,240
- Well 'cause-- - Like I'm like really bad

315
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,520
at stealing. - Guys like us,

316
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,520
we say no to receipts.

317
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,680
We don't get the receipt from the bodega.

318
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,520
Exactly, I'm not gonna walk around with a receipt.

319
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,360
And then we go to the dollar store,

320
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
and I say, "Did you get that chopped cheese

321
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
"from the shelf over there?"

322
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
I say, "No, I didn't, but I don't have a way to prove it."

323
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,960
What the fuck, I'm not a founding father.

324
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,760
I'm not gonna walk around with a fucking scroll.

325
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Yeah, go, "Oh, well."

326
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,080
My certificate of claim.

327
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,360
Here it is, there's my signature there at the bottom.

328
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,920
There's the last four digits of my credit card.

329
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,760
And I'm not signing any receipt that I get.

330
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,720
I don't keep any receipts.

331
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Never, never. It's really bad.

332
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,800
You don't need to keep receipts,

333
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,040
it's not that big of a deal.

334
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,620
- Most computers handle--

335
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,460
- That's true.

336
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,280
- Most computers--

337
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,120
(laughing)

338
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
- Why am I calculating?

339
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,780
- Hand movements.

340
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,620
(laughing)

341
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,460
- Most computers--

342
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,280
- I'm inventing a new--

343
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
- Computers have handled most of the receipts.

344
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,460
- I'm inventing a new, we've all been doing

345
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,560
the same hand movements for a couple years now.

346
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,400
- Yeah.

347
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,220
- We need to break out, we need to get more--

348
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,420
- Do you know which one was introduced

349
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,380
by Pierce that I can't stop?

350
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,220
- This one.

351
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,040
- Yeah, it's this.

352
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,880
- It's this, this, this.

353
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,720
- I do this all the time.

354
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,260
- You shake your hand back and forth like,

355
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,100
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

356
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,020
- Yeah, 'cause he just does that.

357
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,700
- Yeah, yeah, you definitely stole that one.

358
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,020
- I think it's so funny that I started doing it

359
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,860
and now I just do it naturally.

360
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
- Being in the car with him for like 12 hours.

361
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,300
- It's true, 12 hours a day.

362
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,660
- We did a 12 hour tour. - 12 hours a day.

363
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,500
- Yeah.

364
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,320
(laughing)

365
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,540
- For 12 hours. - For 12 hours.

366
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,300
- A day, 12 hours a day we were in the game car.

367
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,580
- Yeah, we did that for 12 hours.

368
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,980
- Yeah, see, now we can use the hands on.

369
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,180
- Yeah. - Yeah.

370
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,900
- I'm gonna use my hands on you.

371
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,980
- Do you guys think that we should join the creator clash?

372
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,820
- Maybe.

373
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,580
- Yeah, actually, what is that though?

374
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,580
- That's the, he just wants more excuses for him to,

375
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,780
He's looking for an excuse to do steroids.

376
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
He wants a juice.

377
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Yeah.

378
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
He wants to go on trend.

379
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,260
I'm literally drinking the juice.

380
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,920
I'm actually drinking a...

381
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,880
Why are you guys jealous of my health these days?

382
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,380
Ginger Lemon Health Aid Kombucha.

383
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
Because you're not supposed to...

384
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:17,260
The thing that people like is when we show up hungover and we show up depressed as fuck

385
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,180
and then we say how much we want to kill ourselves and stuff.

386
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,180
Cameron, go ahead.

387
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Something philosophical.

388
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Something philosophical.

389
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,180
Sorry, he had his...

390
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
Philosophical?

391
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Mm-hmm.

392
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
The myth of Hercules.

393
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Yeah.

394
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
What do you know about Hercules?

395
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
Right now, what did he do?

396
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
He was strong.

397
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,180
What, did he fight anybody?

398
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,180
He fought...

399
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,180
Achilles.

400
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,180
Shut up.

401
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,180
He fought a couple of monsters.

402
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Yeah, okay.

403
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
He fought the Minotaur.

404
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Who did he have a friend who was the same strength as him or who kind of gassed him up?

405
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
No, he did.

406
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,180
No, so what, and how strong was Hercules?

407
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Very.

408
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,180
So, do you need friends or do you need monsters?

409
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,180
Wait a second.

410
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,180
And also you're ugly and weak

411
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,280
Okay, and middle finger to the face. I think that I will be ripping your head off

412
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm about to have a creator clash. Yeah. Yeah, I'm about to create a bunch of sperms. Yeah my creators

413
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,060
I call them because they create babies. Oh, yeah, and they're clashing with you with each other. I

414
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,460
Think I would I would

415
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,340
Like a year ago when Matt did it he was like do you want to fight me in the next one?

416
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,380
and I was like, I don't think I wanna do that.

417
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,220
- Yeah, I think I would be--

418
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,060
- There's still time.

419
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,880
- I think I'd be scared of who I would become.

420
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,220
- Or is it not, is there no time?

421
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,660
- Yeah, no, you're not, I'm saying right now,

422
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,900
you're not allowed to do that for me and Cameron's safety.

423
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,820
- I think I'm too much of an evil psycho to do that.

424
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,740
- You would literally, it would be like

425
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,100
when you started taking Propecia or whatever

426
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,500
and you just became a monster.

427
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,460
- Well, I just started crying all the time when I did that.

428
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,980
When I took, what was it called?

429
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,620
- Finasteride. - Finasteride, yeah.

430
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,460
I would just sit at my house and I'd be like--

431
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,420
- Same thing, same thing.

432
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,620
- What the fuck is going on?

433
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,460
- Yeah.

434
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
- And it really scared me so I stopped taking it.

435
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,780
- Yeah, that shit is nuts.

436
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,900
That shit makes you not nut,

437
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,420
and it's like butane in a pill or something.

438
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,380
- I do remember I nutted one time,

439
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,220
and then it--

440
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,380
- You nutted once?

441
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,560
- Not to brag.

442
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,180
I nutted one time,

443
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,020
okay, I bragged.

444
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,520
I nutted one time when I was on Propecia,

445
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,360
maybe just one time in like the whole month

446
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,200
that I was on it.

447
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,020
- Yeah.

448
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,740
- And it was literally like water clear.

449
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,060
There was no swimmers.

450
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
- There's nothing.

451
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,460
swimmers were, they checked out.

452
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,740
They were checked out of the building, the ball zing.

453
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,580
- That must be, it must,

454
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,700
Propecia or Finasteride or whatever,

455
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,660
I think Propecia is the, not the,

456
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,220
Finasteride is the pill and then Propecia is the brand name.

457
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,100
But whatever that is, that must be like fucking

458
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,180
weed to sperms.

459
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,660
Makes them all lazy and shit.

460
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,500
- Whoa.

461
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,060
Wait, you're kind of making me want to go back on it.

462
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,560
Yeah.

463
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,060
Oh, no.

464
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Weed for sperm.

465
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
There's a possibility--

466
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,660
There must be weed for sperms.

467
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,460
Think about it.

468
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,960
Although--

469
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,780
That's why Chompy Chong has so much hair.

470
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,380
Listen.

471
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,220
You had no swimmers come out, right?

472
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,020
You're shooting straight liquid, like, clear jizz.

473
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah.

474
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,380
And it was basically--

475
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,140
Your sperms are sitting in your nutsack.

476
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,460
If you guys are talking about--

477
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,300
Your sperms are sitting in there just--

478
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,380
yeah, I don't think I'm going to go to work today.

479
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah.

480
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,340
I'm calling out snake.

481
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,580
Your sperms are in your nutsack eating Cheetos.

482
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,900
- You guys are taking weed for sperms.

483
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,740
- On your pube couch.

484
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,380
- I gotta get some damn crocodile for sperms.

485
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,220
- Yeah.

486
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,860
- I gotta get my things hungry.

487
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,100
- 'Cause your sperms are too,

488
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
they're too excited. - What is crocodile?

489
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,140
- It turns their skin completely dark.

490
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,100
- Yeah, it makes it, it turns them into a monster.

491
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,740
- You wanna have crocodile sperm?

492
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,580
- Yeah.

493
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,460
- No, crocodile.

494
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
- I wanna give them--

495
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,220
- I don't think that's a real drug.

496
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,060
- It's a real drug.

497
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,880
- It's a real drug.

498
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,820
- I don't believe it.

499
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,940
- I need some damn bath salts for my sperms.

500
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,780
- That's right.

501
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,620
- The high on face--

502
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,660
(laughing)

503
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,700
The high on Crocodile was like, it was like so good

504
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,260
that people were like, fuck it, I'll turn into like Tree Bark.

505
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,140
I don't give a fuck.

506
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,580
It turned people into monsters.

507
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,420
Yeah.

508
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,700
It's like a Batman drug.

509
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,540
Really?

510
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Yeah.

511
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,300
I always thought that was like a fake middle schooler drug.

512
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,820
I think that's the only time you ever hear about it.

513
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,660
'Cause it's too extreme for adults.

514
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,220
'Cause it's the perfect drug

515
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,620
for a middle schooler to talk about.

516
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,780
Yeah, it is so funny.

517
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah.

518
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,980
I've talked about before the guy that would sell us weed

519
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:20,260
told us that if you put your finger on your taint and then smell it, it is potent enough

520
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:26,900
that it can make you hallucinate. Wow, that guy was so dumb. I kind of get that. He said

521
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,580
that if you smell poop hard enough... Do you know, it's not poop. You got poop on your taint?

522
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,500
What the hell, it's kind of wiping... Wait, hold on. He said it. Well, he maybe made a

523
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,380
mistake that I made until I was 15, which is I used to wipe back to front. Yeah, well,

524
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,340
- Well I would just scoop all the poop onto my tank

525
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,180
and just leave it there.

526
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,000
- Yeah.

527
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,840
- Well I pretty much--

528
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,780
- That's why it's called the loading dock for a reason.

529
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,940
(laughing)

530
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,780
- Nature's loading dock.

531
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,940
- It's called the tank 'cause you taint it with poop.

532
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,500
- I actually did wipe back the front.

533
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,340
(laughing)

534
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,100
I had one of the most embarrassing moments

535
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,540
of my entire life was I was in the car

536
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,700
with my dad and my brother and I was like--

537
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,540
- You told us this.

538
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,360
- I've told you this?

539
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,940
Okay, I just, okay, thank God.

540
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,500
- I'm saving you from saying it again,

541
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,380
but also you don't have to say it, man.

542
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,580
- Yeah, I don't need to say that.

543
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,140
That's too embarrassing, I'm sorry.

544
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,780
What's the worst day of your lives?

545
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,260
Worst day of my lives?

546
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,180
I mean, I had a pretty--

547
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,000
Of your lives?

548
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,140
I had a bad set last night.

549
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:16,980
So that'll do it.

550
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,420
And then I drank a bunch,

551
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,380
and then came home and ate a bunch of ice cream.

552
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,220
Sounds lit.

553
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,040
That does sound litty.

554
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,820
Actually was kind of fucking sick.

555
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,620
Who cares about bombing, dude?

556
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,660
Bombing's fun.

557
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,260
I'm still in a phase where I'm like,

558
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,700
damn, I don't know if I suck or not still.

559
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,900
So every bomb I take to heart.

560
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,180
But once I get over that, I'll be good.

561
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,700
I pretty much bombed the entire weekend in North Carolina.

562
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,220
Yeah.

563
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,380
And it was just--

564
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,940
I didn't bomb when I did my birthright show.

565
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,300
So that was good.

566
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,940
Yeah.

567
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,500
Unless I did--

568
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,380
See, better.

569
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,420
Unless everyone who went and saw me in Boston

570
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,260
thinks that I had the worst set of my whole life.

571
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,420
It's OK to bomb, dude.

572
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,980
That's part-- that's the same--

573
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,060
nobody gets-- it's not more enjoyable to see

574
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,460
a comedian be good.

575
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,260
Yeah, that's true.

576
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,460
They just want to see you just say something.

577
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,580
You know what gets more--

578
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,380
- That just, I'm gonna become the random comedian.

579
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,220
- You could be the random one.

580
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,580
- The random cringe comedian.

581
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,420
- You could do that.

582
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,260
- You could be.

583
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,380
- Then, what's your thing?

584
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,180
'Cause he's like racist and like bald.

585
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,020
- Whoa, I'm not racist or bald.

586
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,340
- And I'm the random cringe comedian.

587
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,780
- I mean, I've always been kind of intellectual humor.

588
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,620
- Yeah.

589
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,440
- That's my alley.

590
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,280
- He's a humorist.

591
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,120
- I've always been like.

592
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,940
- He's the humorist.

593
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,660
- No, I'm the humorist.

594
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,160
I am.

595
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,620
I am very humorist.

596
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,900
- You're not a humorist.

597
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,000
- I do kind of jokes that are like more set ups

598
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
to like riddles and stuff.

599
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,040
And I just go like.

600
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,040
- So I was at a bar last night and I saw an elf.

601
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
- See you were being random.

602
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,400
- Yeah.

603
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,220
- And a little bit cringy.

604
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,800
- But I'm trying to set up a riddle as well.

605
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
So I'm trying to blend two things.

606
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,160
- I don't know how many riddles involve elves.

607
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,000
- And I don't know how many--

608
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,080
- Well the elf gives you the riddle.

609
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,280
- Riddles aren't usually random save for interrupting Cal.

610
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
- I have a riddle for you.

611
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,760
What does the narwhal do at midnight?

612
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,720
- That's a random riddle.

613
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
What does the fox say?

614
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,720
That is certainly a random riddle.

615
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,680
- What does the narwhal do at midnight?

616
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,800
- Bloody hell if I know.

617
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,920
- Yeah, I don't even, that must be completely random.

618
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,040
- That's what we should do with it.

619
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,880
We should ask our, you know those videos

620
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,280
where they ask a hundred year old veteran

621
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,560
what it was like growing up?

622
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,880
- Dude, that video that's going around

623
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,800
of that old man where they put like--

624
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,400
- They need to ask him that question.

625
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,080
- You know what they should be asking that guy?

626
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,000
Why the fuck are they putting HDR filters on you?

627
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,920
That video is disgusting looking.

628
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,920
That 100 year old guy, they have like two or three HDR filters

629
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,200
on that thing. - He looks like he's

630
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
made out of a brain.

631
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
Yeah, I really don't like that.

632
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,160
I hate people with wrinkles, I hate people

633
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,920
that have bad skin.

634
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,240
- I hate old people.

635
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,960
- Yeah, oldies. - I talk about it often.

636
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,760
- I hate when you, you know like old people,

637
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,840
when you meet them and you touch their arm,

638
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,040
you can like put your finger here

639
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,440
and then without lifting your finger

640
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,600
you can move their skin down to their wrist.

641
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,160
- Or you touch an old person on the arm

642
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,800
and you see them again three years later

643
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
and the indent from your finger is still there.

644
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,520
- It's just a bruise.

645
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,240
- It's a bruise that's straight through your arm.

646
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
- Throughout the whole arm.

647
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,120
- I can't wait to get like that.

648
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,840
What I'm really scared of recently is some weird disease.

649
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
- Yeah.

650
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
- That I can't remember the name of.

651
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,560
- Ebola.

652
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,320
- No, not Ebola.

653
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,440
- Let's go back to 2014 and get random with it.

654
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,080
You basically never left 2014.

655
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,840
No, I did.

656
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,960
Look at your hat.

657
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,280
That's not 2014.

658
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
This is 2014, I am.

659
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,680
That is 2014-ish.

660
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,640
The colors.

661
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,600
I just like the fit of it.

662
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,640
Maybe it's more 2016.

663
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,480
Yeah.

664
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
I'll give you the benefit.

665
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,800
I can handle that.

666
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,300
Yeah.

667
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,840
2016, though, bro.

668
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,560
When Vine--

669
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,440
That was the golden age.

670
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,640
Dude, when Vine was at its peak and King Bach

671
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,520
was doing backflips.

672
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,440
Do you guys remember--

673
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:56,940
Oh.

674
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,440
I fucking miss King Bach.

675
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,280
You remember there was--

676
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,800
You miss Curtis Lepore?

677
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,720
Yeah, there was.

678
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
That's so weird.

679
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,520
My buddy Chowder would retweet it, or re-vine it,

680
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,960
and people would get mad at him,

681
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,320
and he just thought it was funny.

682
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,160
Really?

683
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,980
I'd just whack off to it.

684
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,820
Yeah?

685
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,660
Yeah.

686
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,480
It's only six seconds.

687
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,320
That's all you need.

688
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,000
No.

689
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,440
That was your cringe randomness.

690
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,880
That's all you need is six seconds.

691
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,720
Wait.

692
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,560
That's not true.

693
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,000
Why are you roasting me?

694
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,840
That's so quick.

695
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,040
They don't call me Mr. Nut so quick.

696
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,000
Mr. Nut so quick?

697
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,360
- When I go into the 99 cent store?

698
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,920
Oh, Mr. Nut so quick.

699
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
- Yeah, you're like, yeah, I really want them

700
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,420
to bring Vine back so I can finally have a video

701
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,640
short enough for me to cut.

702
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,120
- No, that doesn't make any sense.

703
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,360
(laughing)

704
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,200
- That makes sense.

705
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,520
- That doesn't make any sense at all.

706
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
You guys are bitches.

707
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,760
- I'm not a bitch.

708
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,180
- I'm not a bitch either.

709
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,280
So who are you talking about?

710
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
- I'm sorry.

711
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,320
- I must have been talking about two--

712
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,680
- Imagine if he was on steroids acting like this.

713
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,520
- Oh my God.

714
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,680
- If he said, "You're a bitch!"

715
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,640
- That's not how steroids are.

716
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,860
- That was my bad, I'm sorry to the listeners real quick.

717
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,980
- I probably will get on TRT when I'm 35.

718
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,900
- You're gonna get on HRT, get your hair back.

719
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,740
- That's what that is.

720
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,560
- That's what that is.

721
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,400
- But I would get the other one.

722
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,700
I would get the one that gets even less hair away from me.

723
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,540
- Oh yeah.

724
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,940
- Or even more. - Less hair away from you.

725
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,980
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

726
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
What are you, a grammar fucking genius?

727
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,860
- I'm an intellectual, you already went over this.

728
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,580
- Grammar Nazi. - It's proof you're not an I.M.

729
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,660
- That's the funniest, I mean, I guess it's just Seinfeld

730
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,300
bringing the word Nazi into the public,

731
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,820
like you can just call somebody blank Nazi.

732
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,940
- Yeah, so I feel like I kind of normalize being a Nazi

733
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,420
in a way that I'm not so happy with.

734
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,260
- I'm pretty uncomfortable with it.

735
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,460
- And he also, get this, just learned this

736
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,980
from a photo on Twitter, dated a 17 year old.

737
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,420
- You're kind of like a neo-Nazi.

738
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,180
- What?

739
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,220
- Yeah, you kind of remind me of neo-Nazis.

740
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,040
- No.

741
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,100
- And like people who kill minorities.

742
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,300
- For what reason?

743
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,620
- Just like the way that you talk

744
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,020
when the cameras are off and stuff.

745
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,520
just kind of reminds me a little bit of that kind of stuff.

746
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,020
Yeah.

747
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah.

748
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,900
Do you think that it was more Jerry Seinfeld's fault

749
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,980
or Larry David's fault?

750
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,140
Because I just learned for the first time ever

751
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,260
from watching season seven of Curb Your Enthusiasm

752
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,900
that actually Larry David was kind

753
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,100
of the mind behind Seinfeld.

754
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,340
Larry was definitely the mind.

755
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,380
So maybe he was the one.

756
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,380
And he does seem like the kind of guy to like the nuts.

757
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,820
Well, Jerry was the body.

758
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
He's bald.

759
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,320
Yeah.

760
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,140
Larry David's bald.

761
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,640
Skinhead.

762
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,380
Yeah, skinhead.

763
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,780
Wait.

764
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,820
And he's rude.

765
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,940
He's rude, too.

766
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,060
- Does that remind you of any kind of Nazi?

767
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,900
Yeah.

768
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,740
- All of them.

769
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,780
- They're all pretty fucking rude if you ask me.

770
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,420
- But it's the ones who aren't

771
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,660
who you have to really be scared of.

772
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,140
- The nice Nazis?

773
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
'Cause you go, oh.

774
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,820
- You ever seen Inglourious Basterds?

775
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,660
- Oh, you're so sweet.

776
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,480
Wait, hold on a second.

777
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
- The polite one?

778
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,820
The polite one is the most evil.

779
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,760
- Yeah.

780
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,700
The polite one.

781
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,620
- Destin.

782
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,140
- Mr. Destin.

783
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,020
- Mr. Destin.

784
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,860
Mr. Destin was the worst character.

785
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
- His name is something.

786
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,700
- It's on.

787
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,540
- Landa.

788
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,360
- Landa.

789
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
Colonel Landa.

790
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,660
- Oh, oh, I thought you were talking about

791
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,220
the sniper.

792
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,060
- Oh, the guy who-- - That's another example.

793
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,980
- But he's not so nice, he's kind of trying to--

794
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,460
- He's a bit rude. - He's a bit of a pick up artist.

795
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,900
- You thought he was polite and nice.

796
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,980
- Yeah, because you-- - I thought you were

797
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
talking about that guy.

798
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,220
- Patrick got rizzed by the Nazi and Inglourious Bastard.

799
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,060
- I got rizzed up by him. - Patrick is watching

800
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,340
the movie going, oh.

801
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,220
- Patrick got Nazi-rizzed. - Batting his eyes at the TV.

802
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,580
- Oh, he knows about French cinema, okay.

803
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,460
- That's you.

804
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,420
- And here's me, shut up you Nazi bastard.

805
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,580
- Yeah, me getting rizzed by all the Inglourious Bastard

806
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,580
themselves.

807
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,580
That's right. I got rizzed by every Jew in the movie though.

808
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
BJ Novak.

809
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Oh, okay.

810
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,580
He got that BJ Novak rizz.

811
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,580
That's right. I'm liking the rizz coming off all these chosen people.

812
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,580
Remember when BJ Novak tried to make a movie of himself and nobody cared about it?

813
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Vengeance?

814
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Yeah.

815
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
Oh, speaking of movie.

816
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580
What?

817
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
What?

818
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
What?

819
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
I've never seen you so excited.

820
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,580
What do you need to tell us?

821
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,580
So we've been talking about how we would do downsizing.

822
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
Yes.

823
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
By the way, it's already picked up.

824
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Shrinkers has re-entered the conversation.

825
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,580
It's back in the lexicon.

826
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Shrinkers is back in the zeitgeist, our zeitgeist.

827
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
Of course.

828
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,580
We've influenced Hollywood before.

829
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
No fucking way.

830
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
It is.

831
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Tell me.

832
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
I already have chills.

833
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,580
I saw this bus on the way here.

834
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,580
Huge ad across the bus.

835
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,580
I think I've seen this one.

836
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,580
Jason Segel, Harrison Ford, shrinking, now streaming.

837
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
- No!

838
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,740
- Quote, "Best new show on TV, variety, Apple TV Plus."

839
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,580
- Oh my God.

840
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,180
- Look at what Hollywood does to--

841
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,020
- Shrinking.

842
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,740
- They have stolen so much.

843
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,620
We have predicted the future on this show so many times.

844
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,460
- Let's put it right here.

845
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,660
- We have predicted every single TV show and movie

846
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,060
that's basically ever come out.

847
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,300
We predicted, what I saw the other day,

848
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,500
we predicted that Kanye was gonna see a funny Jewish guy

849
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,540
and get rid of all the police.

850
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,460
I predicted they were going to do John Wick 4.

851
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,280
Yeah, you predicted John Wick 4.

852
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,660
I predicted that weeks ago.

853
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,920
And I will probably pretty soon predict something,

854
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,660
but I haven't done that yet.

855
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,800
No, we've all predicted.

856
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,380
There's going to be a compilation in the future,

857
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
and that's a prediction.

858
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,540
While we're kind of just like patting ourselves

859
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,060
on the back of our predictions, I

860
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,180
think our best prediction ever was

861
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,220
there was an old tweet on our Twitter account

862
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,380
that somebody retweeted that said, the virus spreads,

863
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,580
dot, dot, dot.

864
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,040
- When was that? - That was before COVID.

865
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,880
I don't remember.

866
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,600
- That was like two years before COVID.

867
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
- The virus spread.

868
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,680
- I have no idea who tweeted it or why.

869
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,480
(laughing)

870
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,400
- Chris Lucero did.

871
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,160
It's kind of funny. - The virus spread.

872
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
- Pretty good.

873
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,720
- That's my favorite prediction that we did.

874
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,560
- I didn't really.

875
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,440
- We accidentally predicted COVID.

876
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,880
We may or may not have been directly responsible for,

877
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,920
I mean, think about our meteoric rise.

878
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
- I have a prediction.

879
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,520
We did predict this wait wait fuck can we just make this a whole prediction?

880
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:53,480
I think in it. I think we have to do a prediction minute. I predict that Sidney Sweeney is gonna die in a car accident

881
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,760
There's pretty much like one of the thick like when she's fixing one of her like Model T's or whatever

882
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,480
It's I forgot she liked her head cut so fucking sexy to me

883
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,040
Yeah, imagine perfect for the next Transformers movie imagine her using her

884
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,880
Bay like grabbers to unscrew something yeah, you know

885
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,420
Or not or imagine if she was made out of clay, and she and she could chop her boobs off

886
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420
She could chop off her and she could

887
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,160
Okay, I have a dog friend all right all right

888
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Green okay, I have a prediction guys go ahead there will be in New York City a new statue will be built

889
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,800
in the next 10 years.

890
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,640
- What will it be representing?

891
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
- I'm about to fucking cry 'cause of how scary that is.

892
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,160
- I don't wanna say too much,

893
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,040
but it will be a historical icon.

894
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,960
- I have another prediction.

895
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,800
- Okay.

896
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,400
- We will be seeing a lot more

897
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,120
artificial intelligence in the future.

898
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,480
- And we will be seeing a lot more,

899
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,800
a lot more, which we already see a lot.

900
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,720
- Yeah.

901
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,040
- But we will be seeing a lot more of Timothée Chalamet,

902
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,520
an indie movie that's in film.

903
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,360
- Timothée Chalamet.

904
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
- As well as big budget studio artists.

905
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,920
- He's gonna have a Marlon Brando style giant fat body

906
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,880
at one day.

907
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,200
By the time he's like 30,

908
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,480
and people are gonna be the same thing.

909
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,360
Have you guys read all these stories about Marlon Brando

910
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,940
where he would, when he was losing weight

911
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,520
for whatever movie he was in,

912
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,080
whatever war movie he was in,

913
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,080
he would have the pizza guys come and throw pizza

914
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,440
into his house so that his wife wouldn't see it.

915
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
- That's like the whale.

916
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,040
- He's a true, he was a true whale.

917
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,240
The other guy, the real whale movie, he's wearing makeup.

918
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,600
Marlon Brando was a human whale.

919
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,000
Here's a prediction that I have.

920
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
Uh-huh.

921
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,460
The whale is going to, one of the actors, no.

922
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,200
You're gonna be seeing more of one of the whale actors

923
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
now that he's won an Academy Award.

924
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,280
Oh wow.

925
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,960
You're gonna see him in a lot more movies too.

926
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,800
True, okay.

927
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
But basically, we've done a lot of movie predictions.

928
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah, here's a non-movie prediction.

929
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,920
Okay.

930
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,920
World War 3 will be fought on the plane of the mind.

931
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Wow. I've always thought that ever since I was a kid.

932
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Why isn't World War 3 just like a video game?

933
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
World War 3 will be fought on the plane of the mind.

934
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
World War 4 will involve dinosaurs.

935
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,920
There will be reanimated new mobile game.

936
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,920
What are you doing?

937
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,920
That's just my prediction. There's going to be a new mobile game.

938
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:32,440
2062 that sweeps. Okay. Dr. Yeah, there's new mobile. Dr. Sue. Dr. Seuss has prediction over here. Okay, 2062 humans shall be blue

939
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Okay, keep going, but there's there's new mobile games every day short

940
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,880
But there's gonna be a new one that takes the country by storm Pokemon go style

941
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,240
It's gonna be like everyone's like have you played this one yet? And you're like no, I wrote down

942
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't I don't do that. Mm-hmm. Let me read this. I can't remember what it was

943
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,640
You know what I did predict? That Betty White was gonna die before New Year's.

944
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Really?

945
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Yeah. Me and my friend Greer both said that Betty White was gonna die.

946
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
Speaking of Pokemon...

947
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,640
I think I said Betty White will not live to see 100.

948
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Well that's... yeah.

949
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Here's the other one. Pokemon Garlic and Violence.

950
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Garlic and Violence.

951
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
That'll be the name of it.

952
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Garlic and Violence?

953
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Isn't the new one called Garlic something?

954
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
- Scarlet? - Scarlet.

955
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,560
- Oh, garlic and vine, that's why I thought it was funny,

956
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,800
that's why I wrote it down.

957
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,100
I was smoking weed.

958
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,940
- Yeah. - Okay.

959
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,080
- What's-- - Here's a prediction

960
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,320
I wrote down. - That's your foam corner.

961
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,600
- Here's a prediction that I wrote down.

962
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,280
- Wait, no, here's another good one, actually.

963
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,760
- Caleb's foam corner.

964
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,060
- Here's another one.

965
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,000
Dude, these are so crazy.

966
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,720
- Yeah? - Oh my God.

967
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,560
- Let me look through my predictions.

968
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,560
- I wrote a book called "The Santa Delusion."

969
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,800
(laughing)

970
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,440
What the fuck?

971
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,840
- That's a good one.

972
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Oh, I remember what this one was.

973
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,840
Whoever we were with said we weren't going to remember it, and we wrote it down.

974
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
This is an idea me and Patrick had.

975
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Here's a note on my phone. Pizza alert.

976
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Oh my god! Wait, wait, wait.

977
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Oh, what was pizza alert?

978
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Pizza alert is you walk into a pizza store, and your phone starts going off, and it goes like,

979
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,840
"Alert! Alert! This guy is very hungry, and he needs pizza!"

980
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,840
And you go, "Sorry, I have to go to the front of the line. Sorry, look, my pizza alert."

981
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Oh, that's pretty smart. I cut the line yesterday at Madison Square Garden.

982
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,860
(laughing)

983
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,620
- Pizza alert, pizza alert.

984
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,940
This phone belongs to a very hungry man.

985
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
- That's good.

986
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,600
How does it determine your hungriness?

987
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Do you just press a button that says I'm hungry?

988
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,740
- It just plays the alert.

989
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,580
- Yeah.

990
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,700
- I forgot about pizza.

991
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,740
- Okay, so it's not like a system.

992
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,660
- I don't know if it's like a prank or a trick

993
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,500
or just a thing that happens.

994
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,060
- Well, I think, what was the--

995
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,700
- I think that literally the whole thing

996
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,540
was a pizza alert going on.

997
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,360
- We were in his car.

998
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
- It'd be better if it was a--

999
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,820
- We were in his car, we thought about that, right?

1000
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,780
And then-- - I don't even know.

1001
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,620
- I remember, 'cause it started out with like you making,

1002
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,020
I think I had to go somewhere or something,

1003
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,100
and you were saying, like, I'm gonna call you.

1004
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,200
- Oh yeah, that's what, calling someone,

1005
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,020
setting their ringtone to like pizza alert and calling them.

1006
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,940
So they're waiting in line at the store,

1007
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,460
and their phone goes off, and so it's going,

1008
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,580
pizza alert, pizza alert, this man needs pizza.

1009
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,500
That's what it was.

1010
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,220
- An even better system would be

1011
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,080
if we could somehow hack the Amber Alert system.

1012
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,920
And we do it so that people are sitting in a pizzeria

1013
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,560
and then they get an alert that says,

1014
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,620
that says pizza alert, a guy wearing gray shorts

1015
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,560
and a UNCW t-shirt is about to walk in.

1016
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,960
He's very, very hungry.

1017
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,800
- Yeah.

1018
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
- He needs pizza right now.

1019
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,560
Other one that I wrote down was,

1020
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,760
imagine trying the toilet water

1021
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,640
and finding out the dogs are right.

1022
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,480
- Yeah.

1023
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,300
- Okay.

1024
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,140
- Which would be kinda.

1025
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,120
- Oh yeah, 'cause dogs like it.

1026
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
- Yeah.

1027
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,520
- I had a similar prediction I wrote.

1028
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,000
Parsnip, sweet potato, red onion, syrup, chicken, pecans.

1029
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,760
- I had a similar prediction actually.

1030
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,600
- That one did come true.

1031
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,560
- Tilapia, asparagus, peanut butter, jelly,

1032
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,880
bread, hummus, pita crackers.

1033
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
- Tilapia?

1034
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,840
- I like tilapia.

1035
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,660
- Look at you go.

1036
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,500
- Look at me go.

1037
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,080
- Look at you go.

1038
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,280
- Why are you getting offended?

1039
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,920
Why are you getting offended by him saying look at me go?

1040
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,520
You're looking a little offended.

1041
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,360
- What does it mean though?

1042
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,180
I'm confused.

1043
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,020
- It doesn't matter.

1044
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,920
- It means you're eating fucking good bro.

1045
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,200
- Yeah, you're eating healthy.

1046
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,040
- You wouldn't get that?

1047
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,860
- Is tilapia healthy?

1048
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,780
- It's the healthiest fish you can get.

1049
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,380
- Yeah, 'cause it costs so little money.

1050
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,820
- Yeah, and poor people are usually healthier.

1051
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,860
- Poor people usually get the best food first

1052
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,100
because rich people think that it's dog shit.

1053
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,500
- Also, they're farmers.

1054
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,740
Rich people eat so bad for you.

1055
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,240
Rich people eat fish eggs.

1056
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,500
That is not good for you.

1057
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,340
There's nothing in a fish egg.

1058
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,540
- We had caviar that one time.

1059
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,300
- Did you, when you ate caviar?

1060
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,140
- At the ball?

1061
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,960
- The last time we were at it.

1062
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,820
- I did forget about the ball.

1063
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,420
- At the ball, we had caviar.

1064
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,260
- Whenever you eat something--

1065
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,020
- And it got on my gown.

1066
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,260
- Oh, I forgot about that.

1067
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
- It was awful.

1068
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,980
Luckily I had a tide to go.

1069
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,500
But when you're at a thing and there's caviar,

1070
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,380
or I guess that's the only time I've ever had caviar,

1071
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,700
was that time that that guy brought some caviar to the park.

1072
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,380
But when you eat-- - It was warm.

1073
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,980
- You're supposed to eat it really cold.

1074
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,860
- You're supposed to eat it cold?

1075
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,180
I don't think I've ever had caviar.

1076
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,100
- Also, what an awful vibe to show up with,

1077
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,660
is like you just have caviar in your hand.

1078
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,140
- Was it a joking thing?

1079
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,020
- I think that they worked it at like a fish market

1080
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,860
and they just put a bunch of--

1081
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,540
- Oh, I'm bringing caviar, look at me.

1082
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,380
- It kinda was, it kinda was.

1083
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,220
- It was, yeah.

1084
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,900
- It kinda pissed me off, if I'm being honest.

1085
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,980
- Bringing food as a joke is so fucked up.

1086
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,060
- It wasn't even a joke, he was just like,

1087
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,180
I think he was trying to be like,

1088
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,020
look how cool this is, I have caviar.

1089
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,500
It's like, bro, I'm a millionaire.

1090
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,980
I don't give a fuck about six pieces of shit.

1091
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,500
- I don't give a fuck about caviar,

1092
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,340
'cause I'm a fucking millionaire.

1093
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,740
- Bro, these pieces of food are fucking tiny.

1094
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,020
- Look at my clothes, you couldn't tell I'm a millionaire.

1095
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
- I eat ham hocks.

1096
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,060
- Yeah, I don't like eating a thousand of something.

1097
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,180
I like eating one big one.

1098
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,900
So call me when the egg is this big

1099
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,780
and it comes out of a giant or fish.

1100
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,900
I want one pig trotter for lunch every day.

1101
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,740
Is that a foot?

1102
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,560
Yep.

1103
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,400
There's four of them.

1104
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,240
That's too many.

1105
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,060
Yeah.

1106
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,300
I want a brain.

1107
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,660
Listen, I'm a vegetarian,

1108
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,160
so I'm the type of guy to pull the apple

1109
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,700
out of the pig's mouth at the banquet.

1110
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,540
Yeah.

1111
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,360
And take a big bite.

1112
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,580
Or you could also be, Eve would do that.

1113
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,420
Yeah.

1114
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,820
I saw a trotter at the butcher the other day.

1115
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,500
The butcher at the grocery store I've been going to.

1116
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I showed you guys those kind of impaled.

1117
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,420
Oh yeah, the koi.

1118
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,180
Yeah, the koi.

1119
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,460
Yeah, they have koi on the street.

1120
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
They're kind of big.

1121
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,780
I said that we should do it.

1122
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,740
We should like buy one off the street.

1123
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,820
It's a fried guinea pig.

1124
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,660
Oh wait, that's that?

1125
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,260
I really...

1126
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,420
They were making them on the street in front of the Popeyes.

1127
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,460
Yeah, they just have them on a big spit and they're like impaled all the way through their body and they're like this and it goes through their mouth.

1128
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,100
I would not.

1129
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,900
I really, I do. I don't know how they give it to you when you buy it, but I really want that you buy it and they give it to you in just a big hot dog bun.

1130
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,800
- Yeah. (laughing)

1131
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,700
- It was a really long hot dog bun with a--

1132
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,340
- Well, that's not too far from here.

1133
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,220
We could go, if they're back out there right now,

1134
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,900
we could go get that koi. - It's cold and a little rainy.

1135
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
- We could get some koi, put it on a big plate.

1136
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,340
- I'm already full.

1137
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,460
- The koi tasting episode. - I have beef jerky.

1138
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,520
- Yeah, I don't need it. - 'Cause we did,

1139
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,140
we talked about koi. - I don't think that,

1140
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
I honestly think that that is,

1141
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,100
that would disgust people too much.

1142
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,340
- It would cause a discussion is what it would cause.

1143
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,420
- It would disgust people.

1144
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,260
- Yeah. - People would disgust.

1145
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,100
- But I guess, remember we just said it tastes like chicken.

1146
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,620
- If we have a Peruvian fan, it would disgust them.

1147
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,180
- Tastes like chicken is such a cop out, man.

1148
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,940
Everything doesn't taste like chicken.

1149
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,600
And I've tried only chicken for the most part.

1150
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,100
I've pretty much eaten mostly chicken as far as meat.

1151
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,700
- Some chicken doesn't taste like chicken.

1152
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,220
- Plenty of chicken doesn't taste like chicken.

1153
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,100
Have you guys seen that video where the lady

1154
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,540
cuts open the chicken that she bought

1155
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,840
and it has yellow in it?

1156
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,820
- No. - No.

1157
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,060
- Oh God. - What's the yellow?

1158
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,540
- What kind of yellow? - Who gives a fuck?

1159
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,540
Is it just yellow? - Is it just fat?

1160
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,220
- No, it's like weird tumors.

1161
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
- A moomis. - A moomis.

1162
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,740
- I don't know why that--

1163
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,580
- I don't know what word I was looking for.

1164
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,700
- That almost made me gag thinking about that.

1165
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,460
- It's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

1166
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,300
But I've been showing it to random, random people.

1167
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,460
- That, we have to move on, I can't.

1168
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,460
- You have to move on?

1169
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,260
'Cause cancer is so disgusting to you?

1170
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,100
- No, just that--

1171
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,300
- So you walk into the St. Jude's and you say--

1172
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,860
- He's throwing up, bro, stop, he's throwing up.

1173
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,060
- That was, I'm picturing when they cut open the Tauntaun.

1174
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,620
- Well that's you.

1175
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,980
I didn't say shit about a fucking,

1176
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
Why is it Star Wars?

1177
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,980
Imagine you cut open a chicken and it's got all that fucking guts and shit.

1178
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Imagine you cut open a chicken and it's got Luke Skywalker in there trying to keep fucking

1179
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,980
warm with the frozen food.

1180
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I'd say okay.

1181
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Luke Skywalker who's five inches tall and he's shivering inside the chicken.

1182
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,980
He's like, "What planet am I on now?"

1183
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,980
You're talking from Hoth to the house planet.

1184
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
I'm recording him with my phone.

1185
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,080
Nah, nah.

1186
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,040
Only in Brooklyn.

1187
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,080
Only in Brooklyn, only in New York.

1188
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,120
I have Luke in my chicken.

1189
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,880
They put a Luke Skywalker in my motherfucking chicken.

1190
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,120
Holy shit.

1191
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,480
I mean, little too.

1192
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,560
I'm on live.

1193
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,480
Yeah, I'm on IV live.

1194
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,120
You cut open the chicken and he's like, ugh.

1195
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,040
Yeah.

1196
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,160
Like he's awake.

1197
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,440
And I'm just like shoving a camera in his--

1198
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,200
oh, nah.

1199
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Wait, Luke Skywalker's in the fucking chicken.

1200
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,800
- When you wake up like a dog or a cat.

1201
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,560
- They put Luke in the middle of the butter ball.

1202
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,040
What the hell's going on?

1203
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,540
- He's stretching.

1204
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,440
(laughing)

1205
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,440
- Yeah, he's doing a full downward dog.

1206
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,160
(laughing)

1207
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
- Yeah, you have the chicken on a baking sheet,

1208
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,960
you have him next to it, just completely spread out.

1209
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,120
- Well, and also I would cut all his skin off,

1210
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,160
like a crocodile, leave it on his head,

1211
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,920
so that people could know that it was him.

1212
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,000
And then I would cook him and I would eat him in two bites.

1213
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,400
- Yeah, two bites, get like a Gochujang barbecue.

1214
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,040
- Let's suck his clothes off first.

1215
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,640
(laughing)

1216
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,800
- Oh no, Luke Skywalker in my chicken.

1217
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,640
- You suck the clothes off like an oyster.

1218
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,760
- You're supposed to boil a loop in his clothes

1219
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
for the flavor.

1220
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,780
- You put a little bit of just vinegar

1221
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,500
and like hot sauce on Luke's clothes

1222
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
and you suck 'em up.

1223
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,800
- Yeah.

1224
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Well you're supposed to do like when you poach an egg

1225
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
and you swirl it.

1226
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,480
- Yeah.

1227
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,300
- You're supposed to do that with his clothes.

1228
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,140
- The tornado.

1229
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,240
- Yeah, you're supposed to tornado his clothes.

1230
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,400
- I think the more I thought about it guys,

1231
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,660
I don't think he would be in a chicken,

1232
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,520
I think that he would be in a frozen turkey.

1233
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
I think that makes sense.

1234
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,320
Because there's more room in a frozen turkey

1235
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,000
and they're more common.

1236
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,280
You'd be like, "Nah, dude, they put Luke in my turkey."

1237
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,360
(groans)

1238
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,200
I do.

1239
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,480
- That is so funny to me that there's a tiny

1240
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,640
Luke Skywalker in a turkey.

1241
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,280
(laughing)

1242
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,360
- Yeah, those are kind of the only two that you could get.

1243
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,520
Not a lot of cavernous meats sitting in the,

1244
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,360
not stuff that you can cut and chew at all.

1245
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,520
- Yeah, you get these in-between slices of ham.

1246
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,360
- Oh, no, man.

1247
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,200
Oh no, man.

1248
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,400
- You zip locked Ellie back, you're like,

1249
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,440
"That's a little heavier than I thought it was."

1250
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,320
- Facebook, I hate to show you this, but.

1251
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,520
- This is at the Walmart.

1252
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,360
- You lift up the corner.

1253
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,200
- This is at the fucking Walmart.

1254
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,560
- You lift up the corner of like a slice of ham

1255
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
and it's like his little hand is there

1256
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,720
and it like pulls back.

1257
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,600
(laughing)

1258
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,360
- Or he pulls a slice of ham over him like a blade.

1259
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,560
- Yeah, you lift it up, he's completely tucked in

1260
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,360
and it's rolled over like a duvet.

1261
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,040
He's just smiling.

1262
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,880
- He's got his fingers up.

1263
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,720
- Oh no.

1264
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,160
- I can't do anything but--

1265
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
- Luke, get out of my fucking hand.

1266
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,000
- Stay out of my ham.

1267
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,840
- What are you doing in my oven?

1268
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,660
- I love a gold roast turkey.

1269
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,320
- Stay out of my ham.

1270
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,480
- Yeah, he got stuck in the Oscar Mayer,

1271
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,680
and he's just, that actually--

1272
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,120
- Bro, there's a Luke in my popsicle, bro.

1273
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,960
- No.

1274
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,920
- He's in the plastic.

1275
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,200
- Nah, I would kick him the fuck out of my shit, though.

1276
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,120
- Yeah, definitely.

1277
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,200
- Would you, if you were eating like a rat, right?

1278
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,980
Like you accidentally, you got like a ramen or something,

1279
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,160
like that recent story, you know the recent story,

1280
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,000
where the person found the ramen--

1281
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,820
- Rat found in beans.

1282
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,660
- Where there was the, yeah, rats in the beans.

1283
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,920
- Remember that picture?

1284
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
- That's the funniest picture ever.

1285
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,400
- If you search rat-founded beans

1286
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,600
and just do that while we talk.

1287
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,040
- If you ate it and you were like,

1288
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,760
like those people that found the salamanders

1289
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,160
in their rice cooker and they were like,

1290
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,840
this is some of the best tasting rice

1291
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,600
I've ever had in my life.

1292
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,560
Would you even care?

1293
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,960
Like would you, 'cause if it's the best,

1294
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,040
that was the best rice they've ever had

1295
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,720
and there was dead salamanders in it.

1296
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
- Julio fell asleep at the work.

1297
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,120
- He completely is asleep right now.

1298
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,680
- He's asleep at work right now.

1299
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,400
He's asleep.

1300
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,240
- So yeah, this is the one time that I want him to--

1301
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,960
He's like, "Oh shit, oh shit, wait, what am I doing?"

1302
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,640
You're looking for a picture of a rat in some beans.

1303
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,120
- Rat in beans.

1304
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,200
- No, not eating beans! - No, no!

1305
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,160
- Oh my god. - No!

1306
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,360
- Rat in beans.

1307
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,080
- This is a fucking YouTube video, you asshole.

1308
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,200
- I actually do wanna watch a little bit of this.

1309
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,920
- I don't wanna see those, that's too much.

1310
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,220
- Rat in beans, right?

1311
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,060
I need to see.

1312
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,460
- Do you guys like rats as pets?

1313
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,280
- I actually do. - I think they're cute.

1314
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,560
- I like them too. - There it is.

1315
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,840
(laughing)

1316
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,680
- No, it's that one.

1317
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
- Yeah, this is the one.

1318
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,760
(laughing)

1319
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
- Ratt found a tin of baked beans.

1320
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,280
(laughing)

1321
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,120
- Wow.

1322
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,960
- Oh man.

1323
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,920
- Oh, this is the kind of shit that I'm getting into

1324
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,920
as a comedian now.

1325
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,760
- That's a pretty good idea.

1326
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,720
- Despite all my beans, I'm still just a rat in some jeans.

1327
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,560
Some meme stuff.

1328
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,360
- So I'm going up on stage, I'm saying stuff like that.

1329
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,800
This is why I'm bombing every single night.

1330
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
I go up and I say like,

1331
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,200
flippity floppity, this meme is now my property.

1332
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,040
- Yeah.

1333
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,680
(laughing)

1334
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,160
That's how I feel comedians.

1335
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,440
I'm going up on stage.

1336
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,920
I'm saying that.

1337
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,040
And people are really not

1338
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,440
being receptive to my comedy

1339
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,480
because I'm like.

1340
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,400
I go up there and I'm just like.

1341
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
There's no context.

1342
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,040
Yeah. That's what I do.

1343
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,480
I go. I do this thing.

1344
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,120
I pointed a guy and I have a JPEG

1345
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
of a gun printed out like

1346
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,440
the fist. And I say spell

1347
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
whomstive.

1348
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,960
Yeah.

1349
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,960
And people are.

1350
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,840
Swiggity swooty.

1351
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm coming for that booty.

1352
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,720
Yeah. And people would really

1353
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,920
don't like all this stuff that I do.

1354
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,760
I guess maybe it's just a little dated,

1355
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,880
but I am trying to be the first r/dankmemes comedian.

1356
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Yeah.

1357
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,640
I've got that little RuneScape elf.

1358
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,600
I would say that you're more of a--

1359
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,520
I would say that you're more of a late stage

1360
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
capitalism comedian.

1361
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,280
Here come dat boi.

1362
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,720
And I did make a, there is on my website,

1363
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,680
Patrick.business, there is a t-shirt

1364
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,440
that's gonna be out for sale.

1365
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
It's here come dat boi, right?

1366
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,400
Oh shit.

1367
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,160
- But, oh shit, here come dat boi.

1368
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,800
But it's gritty.

1369
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,640
- Uh-huh. - Wow.

1370
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,280
- And he's riding a sickle instead of a unicycle.

1371
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,780
- Okay, oh.

1372
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,620
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1373
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,440
- How does he ride it?

1374
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,360
- It's on a shirt, on a red shirt,

1375
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,420
printed with yellow. - Uh-huh.

1376
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,760
- Oh yeah, China colors.

1377
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,000
- And it looks distressed and vintage.

1378
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,700
- Is it deep fried, the image?

1379
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,840
- Bro, I wish I thought of that.

1380
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,120
(laughing)

1381
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,220
I bought 1,500 of these,

1382
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,640
'cause I know they're gonna sell out.

1383
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,480
- Yeah, you should've done a deep fried image.

1384
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,680
- You should do a deep fried special edition.

1385
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,400
- Dude, imagine a deep fried meme t-shirt.

1386
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,240
- Fuck.

1387
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,060
- Yeah. - Big Chungus

1388
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,400
on a t-shirt, deep fried.

1389
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,240
- Dude, what if you deep fried it,

1390
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,160
and you put maybe some kind of Carlos,

1391
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,440
or Carlos Marx on the fucking thing, right?

1392
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
And then Carlos-- - Carlos Marques.

1393
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,260
- Yeah, that's right.

1394
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,160
Carl Marx on the thing.

1395
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,660
- That's the guy, that's the red guy on the shirt.

1396
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,900
(laughing)

1397
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,000
Calling Che Guevara like,

1398
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,280
oh yeah, that red guy on the shirt.

1399
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,100
- It's Carlos Marquez.

1400
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,440
- Carlos Marquez.

1401
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,700
(laughing)

1402
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,280
- There needs to be,

1403
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,800
(laughing)

1404
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,800
there needs to be a Karl Marx or Che Guevara type guy

1405
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,160
for us normal Republicans.

1406
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,000
- Yeah.

1407
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,840
- Like we can't really--

1408
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,000
- There is, bro.

1409
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,840
There is.

1410
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,160
- Fuckin' top G.

1411
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,920
- No, like a guy who was in charge of a bunch of people

1412
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,440
and maybe killed millions.

1413
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,280
- Yeah.

1414
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,120
- Yeah.

1415
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,640
- Karl Marx was in charge of,

1416
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,840
Karl Marx killed millions?

1417
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,280
- Hitler was a communist.

1418
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,120
- Yeah.

1419
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,200
- This guy doesn't know anything about politics.

1420
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,040
- I really don't.

1421
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,880
- He's a socialist.

1422
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,680
- I keep my hands and toes out of politics.

1423
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,520
- Yeah.

1424
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,120
- I don't look into history, politics.

1425
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,880
- But you're in there throwing elbows at the women's parade.

1426
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,720
(laughing)

1427
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,560
- Ah, fuck you!

1428
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,380
- I'm crowd killing you.

1429
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,960
- I'm trying to go to Subway!

1430
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,460
Yeah.

1431
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:39,960
[GROWLING]

1432
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,460
Yeah.

1433
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,840
I'm doing it whenever someone picks me up, and I--

1434
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,520
Am I making that up, or was there a woman's parade?

1435
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,800
There was a woman's march.

1436
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,880
That's what it was.

1437
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,280
And they had some hats.

1438
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,780
I got--

1439
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,240
Come on, yeah.

1440
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,720
I remember I went to the--

1441
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,680
As if there's a difference between a march and a parade.

1442
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,180
Yeah.

1443
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,800
What's a parade?

1444
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,760
I went to the--

1445
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,280
Fuck off.

1446
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,920
I got women.

1447
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,360
I had to go to the women's march.

1448
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,480
Parade?

1449
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
I had to go to the women's march.

1450
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,980
You had to?

1451
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,480
Yeah.

1452
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,920
I didn't want to go.

1453
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,120
Wait, why were you there?

1454
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,320
My ex made me go.

1455
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,000
Really?

1456
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:05,500
Yeah.

1457
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,000
Wow.

1458
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,160
You are whipped.

1459
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
I was. This guy wasn't real.

1460
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
And I got lost.

1461
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,160
How old were you?

1462
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
And I got lost.

1463
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
I was like 18.

1464
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
You got lost at 18?

1465
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
I got lost. I got separated from the group somehow.

1466
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
19 years old lost.

1467
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,160
I think I went to go pee and then I got separated from my group.

1468
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Can you please help me? I'm a lost 19 year old and I need to find my girlfriend.

1469
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
I was like.

1470
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,160
That is literally me at the mall.

1471
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,160
I was trying to. I went to the front of the one in Cambridge.

1472
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,420
I like went to the front mr. Bean didn't know you're leading the

1473
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:46,720
Pussy hat on your face like a face hugger for you're doing the mr. Beans big vacation thing you're still you're goose stepping

1474
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:57,600
God can you imagine the the the freaking prankster would put on Nazi uniform March of the women

1475
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,080
- Yeah, well that's what I would be like,

1476
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,320
oh my god, wait, they're all Nazis.

1477
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,640
I would fall for it pretty fast.

1478
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,480
- Yeah.

1479
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,680
- But I was trying to find my ex and her friends,

1480
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,320
and I was just going through every single,

1481
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,040
I was like walking by, I'm like,

1482
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,880
excuse me, I'm sorry.

1483
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,600
Just saying I'm sorry to each,

1484
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,920
it looked like I was saying I'm sorry to each individual.

1485
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,960
(laughing)

1486
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,320
'Cause I was trying to like go through.

1487
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,160
- Damn.

1488
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,420
I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. I'm sorry. That must have been hard because I'll have the same fucking haircut. Yeah

1489
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:42,660
Who's here I was about to say I don't think I was trying to think of the last time I've been lost and I was

1490
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,260
Gonna say I haven't been lost in a long time, but I actually did get lost recently and I didn't even realize I was lost

1491
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,320
I was at the doctor

1492
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,040
And I basically I had to get a shot.

1493
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,160
And then I got the shot and I was like,

1494
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,000
okay, am I good to go?

1495
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,880
And they're like, yeah, you're good to go.

1496
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,700
So then I started walking out

1497
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,800
and I left the doctor's office

1498
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,560
and I was walking out of the place

1499
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,840
and I was like almost out of the doors.

1500
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,960
It was like, it's in like a big hospital.

1501
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,860
And I was like at the main part of the hospital

1502
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,520
and I got a phone call from a random number.

1503
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,360
I was like, who is this?

1504
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,760
And I picked it up and my doctor,

1505
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,320
she's like, where are you?

1506
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,160
- Damn.

1507
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,280
- You're supposed to be here.

1508
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,120
Did you leave?

1509
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,720
And I said, yeah.

1510
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,840
So I accidentally got lost and they were looking for me.

1511
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,680
- Wow.

1512
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,520
- That's scary. - His patients escaped.

1513
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,360
(laughing)

1514
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,960
Isn't that so funny?

1515
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,480
You just walk out and they call you and say,

1516
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,820
"Where are you?"

1517
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,360
(laughing)

1518
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,120
- My big recent fear recently has been

1519
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,920
I'm afraid of stuff falling off of buildings and killing me.

1520
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,800
- I was at Borough Hall, I was skating,

1521
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,040
I saw a lady get fucking like,

1522
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,720
decked out by this piece of a,

1523
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,560
like a slab of a building.

1524
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,560
- Like that big? - Yeah, it hit her and she--

1525
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,560
- It hit her and she went-- - It landed around her neck

1526
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,560
- and it started glittering and shining. - No, it hit her right here

1527
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
- on her neck. - And it landed around her fingers too.

1528
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,560
- Damn, I got blinged up! Holy! - It was so fucked up.

1529
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
'Cause there was people working on scaffolding.

1530
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,560
You're the second person in one month who's told me that they've seen that happen.

1531
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,560
- They probably were at around Borough Hall. - No, no, no, it was somebody else.

1532
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,560
- It might have been me telling you that I saw that. - He's definitely said that before.

1533
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,560
I know, but I'm telling you-- You guys don't trust me?

1534
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,700
- I know exactly who the other person is.

1535
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,560
My wife told me that she saw that happen.

1536
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,440
- I'm his wife.

1537
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,280
- No.

1538
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,440
- Work wife.

1539
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,280
- Little bit.

1540
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,100
- Yeah.

1541
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,940
- Little bit.

1542
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,200
But yeah, and then I saw the video of a guy

1543
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,040
who he almost gets split in two by a piece of glass,

1544
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,080
but it just barely goes on the left side of his head.

1545
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,200
And so the piece of glass, like the edge misses his skull.

1546
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,800
So the like, the pain hits right here

1547
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,480
and goes like, and like slides down.

1548
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,320
- And the pain probably hit all over.

1549
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,840
- And the pain probably felt everywhere.

1550
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,800
- Okay, you guys are stupid.

1551
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,640
And I'm done talking now,

1552
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,760
so I hope you guys enjoy explaining your--

1553
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,840
- All right, his mic's off.

1554
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,680
Now we can-- - Now--

1555
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,720
- Now we can cook.

1556
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,880
- Now it's gonna get crazy.

1557
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,080
- So you can't talk unless you turn it on.

1558
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,600
- You can't talk if your microphone is off.

1559
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,240
- Okay, stop talking.

1560
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,080
- Not anymore of that. - Garfield Corner.

1561
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,120
- Oh my God.

1562
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,760
- Please can I be part of the Garfield Corner?

1563
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,920
- Yeah, you lead it. - Yes, fine.

1564
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
Prove yourself. Prove your worth.

1565
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,920
(laughter)

1566
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Imagine...

1567
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,920
Garfield.

1568
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
In an...

1569
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,920
different... In the Oval Office?

1570
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,920
No.

1571
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
We gotta have Garfield colored microphones.

1572
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,920
You guys have had the worst bumps of all time today, by the way.

1573
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
I'm protecting against the bump because my last microphone broke.

1574
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Yeah, that's a good point.

1575
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
I'm pulling back every time I do the "might have broke his microphone"

1576
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,920
with bumps.

1577
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,360
- I might have broke his microphone with bumps.

1578
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
- We're like G.G. Allen, okay?

1579
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,520
We're putting the microphones in our asses and our teeth.

1580
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,840
- I lived in Manchester.

1581
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,520
He was the bad man of Manchester.

1582
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,960
- Yeah, you live in--

1583
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,800
- There's correlations in all of the--

1584
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,760
- I say G.G. Allen, I see G.G. Allen,

1585
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,320
I say G.G., good grief.

1586
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,160
- Yep.

1587
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,280
- Yeah, good grief, Allen.

1588
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,840
- What's that all in his body?

1589
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,960
- Oh my God, it's poop!

1590
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,440
It's poop and blood!

1591
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,800
- Pee and blood.

1592
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,920
- Good gracious, Allen.

1593
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,760
- Golly gee.

1594
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:23,200
His name was Jesus Christ. Wow. His name was Jesus Christ Allen. I don't give a fuck about him. Yeah

1595
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,680
No, I don't really care about him either. He made rap. I would have liked it

1596
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,320
Yeah, I don't like rock if you don't like that kind of music if he was alive right now

1597
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,040
I'd try to straighten him out. Probably you don't like his song

1598
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,980
Fucking I'm a giant rapist

1599
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:43,240
No, I never that was pretty much like all of his music. I'm a giant rapist

1600

No one can hear that at all.

1620
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,620
He went, "Hey!"

1621
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:08,620
If you're watching March Madness.

1622
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,620
Is the bassist from Anal Cunt or one of the...

1623
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,620
It's not Seth Putnam because he died somehow else,

1624
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:20,900
but at the there's a mall in Rhode Island where he was doing like elevator pranks

1625
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,260
or something what and he was like doing that thing where you like hold the side

1626
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:29,220
of it and like go up or something the basis died in or an escalator he was

1627
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:34,340

1628
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:41,220

1629
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,420

1630
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:42,720
Yeah.

1631
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,520
And he was telling me he was like,

1632
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,120
Brag.

1633
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,720
He was like,

1634
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,620
Yeah, I'd love to be on the phone with his dad.

1635
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,720
Yeah, I don't even want to, I don't even want to tell you this

1636
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,520
because it's so horrible, but you know, you know, however long,

1637
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,720
I don't even remember how long ago it was.

1638
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,220
He was like, yeah, so recently a bunch of people, they died on

1639
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,820
an escalator.

1640
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,920
Yeah, they all just got sucked in and ground up.

1641
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,320
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.

1642
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:06,820
But yeah, you know, one lady got like caught in the bottom

1643
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,920
of it, then it just kept pushing, pushing him down into it.

1644
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,320
They were just getting ground up like meat.

1645
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,160
- Yeah. - Oh, God,

1646
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,980
what am I saying? - It's so horrible,

1647
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,820
I don't even know why I'm saying this to you.

1648
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,200
(laughing)

1649
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,040
- That's such an awesome way to tell me no.

1650
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,240
- And it truly has scared me so bad.

1651
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,080
- Of escalator?

1652
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,120
- It was like in the past few weeks,

1653
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,480
he said that, and now I get so scared

1654
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,320
whenever I ride an escalator.

1655
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,200
- You know what I think will kill me?

1656
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,040
- What?

1657
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,760
- Is the faster walker at the airport.

1658
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
- Yeah, faster walker. - It's gonna go too fast

1659
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,040
and it shoots, flings you forward.

1660
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,560
- Oh my God, I have a strong suspicion.

1661
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,580
- I didn't know what you were talking about until,

1662
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,760
I thought you meant just the people

1663
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,840
who walk fast at the airport.

1664
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,940
No, no, no. Here's my suspicion. I think that it will be wildly accelerated by a Final Destination

1665
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:53,120
style Grim Reaper. I will shoot forward off of it and I will die from rug burn. Imagine

1666
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
dying from rug burn.

1667
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
Dude, that'd be sick.

1668
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
I imagine it all the time.

1669
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,840
It shoots you forward and you don't even fall down, but you're going across the rug and

1670
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,960
it grinds your shoes off your feet, then it starts on your feet.

1671
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,960
And I'm just grounded nothing.

1672
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,480
And you're getting shorter and shorter as you go.

1673
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,880
And I'm going, "Whee!"

1674
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,720
- It would be kind of fun.

1675
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,540
- Yeah.

1676
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:09,380
- But that is how I'm imagining it,

1677
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,540
is that I would be going so fast

1678
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,860
that the floor would grind me completely to pieces

1679
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,380
over the course of the entire terminal.

1680
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,660
- Yeah, I'm probably gonna die

1681
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,200
from just too many body modifications

1682
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,900
and different types of punk attitudes.

1683
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,620
- Like, you have hidden piercings

1684
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,820
that you don't talk about.

1685
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,660
- It's true.

1686
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,500
- Yeah.

1687
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,060
- And not like the funny ones on your balls.

1688
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,900
- No, no, no, no, no.

1689
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,740
- No, no, no, no.

1690
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,380
- You have a piercing that just goes straight

1691
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,100
through your abdomen all the way around,

1692
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,980
like at the handle on the side of a carry-on.

1693
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,820
- Yeah.

1694
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,640
- I have heard--

1695
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,480
- Like a air force on the bus.

1696
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,320
Something's like a picker up, or I don't think I've ever shown you guys

1697
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,600
But if you've ever heard like a clank or a noise like that when I sit down actually got a full curtain of chainmail

1698
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,440
Across my butt so I can protect myself with a gym shower. I believe that there's like a there's like a dude

1699
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,980
That happened a lot in gym chair people try to fuck you yeah

1700
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,780
What gym do you go to fuck?

1701
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:59,920
It's just how I look yeah, you do it like a hole

1702
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,320
Yeah, you think a slut yeah, but people stop trying once. I see that chainmail once

1703
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
- This guy is a psycho.

1704
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,320
- Boy, I don't even wanna fucking fuck this guy's butt

1705
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,160
in the shower.

1706
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,320
- I don't wanna be involved with this guy's life at all

1707
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,160
in any way.

1708
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,000
- This guy's crazy.

1709
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,320
- That guy freaks me out for some reason.

1710
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,320
- I don't wanna sexually attack this guy anymore.

1711
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,820
He's crazy, he has a chain butt.

1712
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,320
- That's what I go to the gym, when I go to the gym

1713
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,320
and I'm planning to lift weights or something,

1714
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,320
I put in yellow snake eye contacts and someone comes up

1715
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
and I say, "Hey, how many sets do you have left?"

1716
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,280
How many sets do you have left to go,

1717
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,120
and turn around and open my eyes really wide?

1718
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,440
- Six sets left.

1719
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,800
(laughing)

1720
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,280
- Just going to the gym and clocking in

1721
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,160
to be a snake guy for one hour.

1722
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,260
- You're on the treadmill on your body like this.

1723
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,520
(laughing)

1724
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,020
- Your stomach slithering on the treadmill.

1725
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,580
- I'm straining for a marathon.

1726
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,180
(laughing)

1727
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,240
Like snake skin boots and like pants and shit.

1728
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,400
Just full snake outfit,

1729
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,120
trying to be as realistic as possible on a treadmill.

1730
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:07,960
- You're in the treadmill and you're like,

1731
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,400
I'm training for a 6K.

1732
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
Don't you mean a 5K?

1733
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,840
And you're like, yes.

1734
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,000
(laughing)

1735
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,600
I'm going to, I made a masonic.

1736
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,280
- You're doing curls or you're just doing,

1737
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,000
you put the weight in your hand,

1738
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,840
you just kind of do the worm.

1739
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,760
- I'm lifting all the weights with my mouth.

1740
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,600
- Yeah.

1741
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,420
(laughing)

1742
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,420
- 'Cause you're wearing a shirt that connects to pants

1743
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,640
so your arms are just not existent.

1744
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,480
- Yeah.

1745
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,780
- And your feet can't even like,

1746
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,340
it's just a full tube of snake skin that you're in.

1747
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,180
It's going like.

1748
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,020
(laughing)

1749
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,020
- Yeah, I'm not allowed to shed my skin at the gym anymore.

1750
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,180
- Pretending to be a snake guy just would be so much fun.

1751
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,100
- I mean, there is that snake guy.

1752
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,060
- No, but really going for it.

1753
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:49,900
- Like going for it, yeah.

1754
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,980
- Pretending to be a guy snake.

1755
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,740
- Getting your arms chopped off.

1756
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,820
and then getting-- - That's not pretending

1757
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,960
anymore, you're a snake. - Amputated arms

1758
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,900
and then getting your fucking foot,

1759
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,240
your feet and legs fused together

1760
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,900
so you're a full snake guy.

1761
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,220
- Well, yeah.

1762
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,060
- Well, yeah.

1763
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,420
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah, but then

1764
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,500
you're almost mermaid-esque.

1765
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,060
- Well, no, 'cause mermaids have arms.

1766
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,540
- Damn, that's some real shit.

1767
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,700
- And you also, at this point,

1768
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,420
your eyes are tattooed to be completely snake-like

1769
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,820
and your tongue is split.

1770
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,620
- And you have a snake brain implanted into your brain.

1771
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,140
- I think it'd be pretty hard to get a job

1772
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,660
if you were a snake, though.

1773
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,660
You don't need a job. People just give you money. If there's a...

1774
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:32,940
If I see a normal homeless guy on the street and he's stinky and he's dressed in tattered

1775
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:36,080
clothes and he's just sitting there, I'm not going to give him money because I've seen

1776
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
a million of them.

1777
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,080
Yeah.

1778
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,540
But if you see a homeless guy who has $600,000 worth of cosmetic surgery to make him look

1779
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,540
exactly like a snake...

1780
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,540
He stands out.

1781
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,640
And he's in character too. And he's saying, "Please, help me."

1782
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
Need money for mice.

1783
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,640
Yeah, exactly.

1784
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
Exactly yeah

1785
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,340
If I give you if I give you a dollar you're gonna go out and you're gonna spend it on alcohol

1786
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,340
So I'm just gonna give you a map

1787
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,380
Need money for mice or mice

1788
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,540
And you can just walk up and you can feel a little

1789
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:10,660
I'm kind of falling in love with more. I think about

1790
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:18,420
I've shown you guys black alien right yeah the black alien project. Oh, yeah the guy who's turning into an alien

1791
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:23,420
- He said that he's only like 13% complete.

1792
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,580
- That can't be true.

1793
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,820
- He got his fingers removed and shit.

1794
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,660
- Ugh!

1795
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,100
Removed forever?

1796
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:30,940
- Yeah.

1797
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,860
- Oh!

1798
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,180
- His hand is like--

1799
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,540
- I hate that people do that, man.

1800
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,380
- Why?

1801
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:39,100
- Cutting off the parts of them that are really good,

1802
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,180
like fingers.

1803
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,180
- You didn't care when I said cutting off your arms

1804
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,700
and fusing your legs together to become a snake.

1805
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,060
- But fingers are how you play video games.

1806
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,500
- Oh my god, you're right.

1807
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,700
I can never do it again.

1808
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,380
Imagine if you-- well, you could still--

1809
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,140
you don't need your pinkies.

1810
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,760
If you had just like a claw like this--

1811
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,300
I do, the way I play.

1812
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,060
I play GameCubes like this with one hand.

1813
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,860
This is actually-- if you're a stoner,

1814
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,900
you should get two of these two fingers removed.

1815
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,380
I think if you're a stoner, you--

1816
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,820
Perfect joint holding fingers.

1817
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,380
If you're a stoner, you don't need to get anything removed.

1818
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,900
You already got your brain removed.

1819
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,500
Exactly, yeah.

1820
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,900
Perfect joint holding fingers, my dude.

1821
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,780
I got some guy who lost his hand.

1822
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,180
He's got like full acid third degree burns.

1823
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,260
He has no eyelids.

1824
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,180
Whoa, nice joint holding fingers, brother.

1825
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,860
Can you imagine you walk up, you see--

1826
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,020
Joint holding fingers, my dude.

1827
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,820
Looking cool.

1828
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,980
Imagine you see the black alien on the street.

1829
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,580
And he's maybe at this point, he's maybe 75% complete.

1830
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,780
He looks inhuman.

1831
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,900
And he's got the three fingers.

1832
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,460
And you're kind of like, I need to figure out

1833
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,340
what's going on with this guy.

1834
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,420
And you're like, are you trying to turn into an alien?

1835
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:39,980
Like, what is this?

1836
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,380
What are you?

1837
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,260
Are you a black alien?

1838
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,420
And he says, perfect joint holding fingers, my dude.

1839
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,420
- Oh, and then you say, "Wait."

1840
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,260
- "My dude."

1841
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,080
- "My dude."

1842
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,920
- "My dude."

1843
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:49,760
- "My dude."

1844
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,680
- "Perfect joint holding fingers, my dude."

1845
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,680
- And then you go, "Okay, I think body modification

1846
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,460
is actually getting cooler by the second.

1847
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,220
I wanna have 10 fingers on both hands."

1848
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,820
- You know what, the body mod that I would get

1849
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,860
probably make my nose bigger for more smells.

1850
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,900
- Yeah, I know I said it.

1851
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,820
- I have a bigger nose than you and I can't smell more.

1852
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,140
- Just last episode, but I've been really fixated

1853
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,940
on completely sewing shut one of my eyes

1854
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,860
and having the stitches in front of it.

1855
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,900
You want a vagina.

1856
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:15,960
No, I don't.

1857
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,500
You do.

1858
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:16,980
No, I don't.

1859
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,740
I can just tell.

1860
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,660
Yeah, to have to use.

1861
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,340
But not my body.

1862
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,420
To let my boys hit.

1863
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,180
All right, wait, we have to go.

1864
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,180
We said that already.

1865
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,060
We have one hour and it's over.

1866
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,860
I know that this was-

1867
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,540
Who is this?

1868
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:32,260
This is your uncle.

1869
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:32,740
Bye.

1870
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,700
Uncle Steve.

1871
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:34,780
This is Patrick Business.

1872
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,580
Patrick Business.

1873
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,420
Oh, wait, shareholder meet-

1874
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,380
Nope.

1875
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,060
Nothing.

1876
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:39,420
Nope.

1877
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:39,940
Bye.

1878
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,180
(laughing)
