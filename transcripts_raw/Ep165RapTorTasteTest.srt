1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
[Music]

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[Explosion]

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh man, oh man, oh man.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have a big discovery here.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our sommelier here, sommelier Duran.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Who's, who's, I think he's, what are you going to be training him?

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've acquired, I've acquired two.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Monkha?

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Monkha?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Huh?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Monkha?

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is that?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Monster.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Monster.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,760
And what's next on the tasting menu, Ossemelier?

20
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,360
Well, hold on, let me just...

21
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Un Lois?

22
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
Le Biste?

23
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,360
Oh, you said...

24
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,760
I thought you were saying what's next as in the other drink I have here.

25
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
No, what's next on the tasting menu?

26
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,200
Well, here we have a 2015 Monster Energy.

27
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Oh, that's lovely.

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
And where was it grown?

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,280
This was grown in South Africa in 2015.

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,960
Oh, they have beautiful monsters there.

31
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,520
Have you been to Monster Valley in South Africa?

32
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,520
It's so arid. It gives so many... and could you have a sip for us?

33
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,520
You gotta...

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,520
That's right. And how is it? Is it earthy?

35
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,520
It's... it tastes like I'm gonna throw up.

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
And what are the notes?

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
Notes of expired.

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
Okay, and the tannins?

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:45,440
in

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,480
layer. There's no way I am not going to get... Do you mind if I try, if I partake? You can

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:02:01,280
have some. Let's see. Yeah. I mean it tastes like regular Monster. It tastes like they're

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,400
hiding something. Yeah. I would say. It's very syrupy. Yeah. No, it's definitely, I can tell

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,600
that I got one of the sips at the bottom, I can tell that's where a lot of the flavor is condensed.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Yeah. And this...

45
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
Wait, listen to how thick it is.

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,660
Sure, let's hear.

47
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,960
It has a very syrupy kind of attribute.

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
To be clear, this is...

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,080
I think maybe I'm going to stop drinking this.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,160
Yeah, this is actually a 2015 Monster from South Africa that Patrick found in the bodega.

51
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,200
Yeah, I picked it up and I was like, "This can feels a little bit taller."

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,240
And the tab didn't have any logo on it.

53
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
No marking on it.

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,440
No markings on it. No texture on the can.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
Luckily, you did yourself a big favor.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
I did myself a big favor because I thought that this was a normal can and I thought it

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
would be funny if we did a taste test.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Yeah.

59
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,880
Well, what happened with the monster though is you went into the bodega and you were like,

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,560
can I see your South African room?

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,920
And they took you to the back and there was a room with paintings on the wall.

62
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
They walked into a cellar.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,640
Like a mural on the wall, like a forest.

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,880
They pulled one off the rack.

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,080
He held it on his forearm like this, the can.

66
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,480
He said, here we have a beautiful 2015 invention.

67
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,160
There's a huge painting, Nelson Mandela in that basement.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,400
But I thought this would be great for the show if we review...

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
Let's take a picture of this can here.

70
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
This is Raptor.

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,880
I believe it's Raptor.

72
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Raptor.

73
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Raptor.

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
Raptor.

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,880
Raptor Energy.

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Sparkling energy drink.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,180
And does that, correct me if I'm wrong, does that say that this can costs $99?

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,600
This can costs actually 99 cents.

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,440
- No way. - This has got to be

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,400
the steal of the century.

81
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
- Oh my goodness. - Sorry, oh my God.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
South African monsters attack.

83
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,640
- You're in trouble.

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,960
- Yeah, that's not, that would not come up good.

85
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,520
- No, I saw, I've never seen you burp like that.

86
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360
- Yeah. - Yeah.

87
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,180
- Oh man. - That was like

88
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,600
when your mouth wiggled like in a cartoon burp.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,280
- Yeah, you can see the air rippling

90
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,000
like a screaming superpower.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,960
- Let me read the ingredients of Raptor here.

92
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,440
Carbonated water, sugar, taurine, citric acid,

93
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,560
maltodextrin. - It has esterate in it.

94
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,080
natural and artificial flavors, caffeine,

95
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,580
D-glucoronusnate,

96
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,720
inositol,

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,120
sodium citrate,

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
caramel color,

99
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
niacin,

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,280
- Hey, that's like an apple.

101
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,880
That's pretty close to an apple.

102
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,160
- Pyridoxine, hydrochloride,

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,000
calcium, okay, vitamin, okay,

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,200
it says next to their names,

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,320
it's the vitamins that they are.

106
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,200
So vitamin B5, sodium benzoate.

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
It's a healthy one.

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Yeah, it's got vitamins in it.

109
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Cyanide.

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Cyanocobalamin.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,320
I know, all right, I know that you're not supposed to eat many things that start with

112
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
cyan.

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Cyanocobalamin.

114
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Yeah.

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
That's probably fine though.

116
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
That's vitamin B12.

117
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Oh.

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Yeah, it's not cyanide, it's cyanara powder.

119
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,880
Which makes you say cyanara.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:15,680
Each serving of Raptor contains 1,419 milligrams of taurine and 141 milligrams of caffeine.

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,560
So and can you tell me what is there any kind of symbol on this that indicates how safe it

122
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
is?

123
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,140
There is a triangle with an exclamation point in it.

124
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,680
And that usually, so I drive a lot.

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,120
I know you guys don't drive but basically that's like, you know there's a stop sign?

126
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,400
That's like the go sign.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
That's like exciting.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah.

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
That's like, that means here we go.

130
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
That means you can go really fast, very safely.

131
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
It says that it is a product of Guatemala.

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Guatemala?

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Oh!

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
They have great raptor plants there.

136
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Alright, now we need to get a taste here. Taste test it for me.

137
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm not kidding, that tastes like sweet tarts.

138
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Give me a fucking sip of this.

139
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
It tastes exactly like sweet tarts.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's try this thing out.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right.

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I would like to...

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,560
It's the exact color of piss and pee.

144
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Yeah.

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Piss and pee.

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
That's crazy.

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
That tastes exactly like a sweet tart.

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,680
Honestly, it's not too sweet.

149
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Damn good energy drink.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm not going to lie about Raptor.

151
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
Honestly, I had my doubts going into this.

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,000
I was like, "Oh, this has an emergency label on it."

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's sour.

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a little sour.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,440
It's got a Raptor on it.

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,840
also says on it says serve chilled with Tori yeah yeah you put a little

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,080
closer to you yeah I'm sure those are supposed to be separate things yeah

158
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,160
there's supposed to be an extra tour in the fucking thing there's so much

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,440
touring in this what the fuck is touring what is to know why do we let that why

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,040
do we let that be in every drink now but nobody knows what it is I think touring

161
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,540
is like...

162
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Siri, what's taurine?

163
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,540
It's easier than Google.

164
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
That's why Red Bull is called Red Bull.

165
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,040
It's an organic compound that is widely distributed in animal tissues.

166
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
That's great, thank you Siri.

167
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,040
They're putting fucking meat glue in the shit now?

168
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Is it...

169
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,540
What? I don't know.

170
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,040
Is it meat glue?

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't know.

172
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Sounds like meat glue.

173
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,540
Damn.

174
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,040
That means that like...

175
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,540
It's not vegetarian.

176
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
What's it supposed to do for me though?

177
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,040
Right.

178
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Like caffeine makes me go...

179
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Oh, it must be from the raptor.

180
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,800
Oh, it must be the blood of the raptor.

181
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah.

182
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,360
I mean for 99 cents.

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,580
Caffeine?

184
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,200
With that much taurine for 99 cents?

185
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,160
Ginseng gives you boners, caffeine makes you shit.

186
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,840
What is taurine doing for me though?

187
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Taurine I think is the energy.

188
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah, the strength and agility of a monster or a raptor.

189
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
Really? It turns you into a new beast?

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah.

191
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,200
The second sip was not as good as the first.

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
Really? It's one of those?

193
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,160
It coats your tongue once?

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,640
Uh-huh.

195
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Let's see.

196
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Oh, by God.

197
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,640
What's going on in the bottom of the can there?

198
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Can you tilt that back slightly again?

199
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Energy drink.

200
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
What is that?

201
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
That is a dent.

202
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
There's a huge dent.

203
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
There's a huge dent.

204
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Okay.

205
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
It looked like a bulge when I saw it at first.

206
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,640
I was like, "Oh, you guys are going to die."

207
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
See bottom of can for lot number and expiration date.

208
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
All right.

209
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
When did this expire?

210
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Check the EXP.

211
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
EXP, BBD.

212
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,640
It's not a day.

213
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
24.

214
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
The year 24

215
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:31,480
Makes way more. Oh, yeah, it's for fucking cavemen. Yeah back when dinosaurs are alive in the year 24

216
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,180
My teeth do not feel good right now. Yeah. No, I feel brush my teeth so hard after this

217
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,360
I feel like you know that guy who pitched a no-hitter on LSD. Yeah, we're about to do that

218
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,800
Yeah, this might be the best episode ever be no jokes. We're gonna be completely just like yeah, it's gonna be revelation

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
See I'm already fucking myself up man.

220
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,080
Revelation.

221
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Revolutionary.

222
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Revolutionary.

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Revolutionary.

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
It won't be a revolution but it's going to be a revelation.

225
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
It's a sparkling energy drink.

226
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah.

227
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
What is it though?

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,840
That first sip I will say, that was good.

229
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,920
Yeah, if they could replicate that first sip for like 60 more sips, it might be a pretty

230
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
alright energy drink.

231
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Stop burping dude.

232
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
I'm going to call 911 if you keep burping for the monster.

233
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,960
It also says, I'm going to start floating.

234
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,320
It says refrigerate after opening.

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Immediately after opening.

236
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
It says refrigerator after opening.

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Do not microwave.

238
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Oh, that's what the exclamation point is.

239
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Yeah.

240
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Man, it's always good when it has like a...

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,320
Do not introduce bacteria into this.

242
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,320
That's like, have you seen the Arizona energy drinks?

243
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
The other ones that are also a dollar.

244
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
The ones that say RX on them, like they're medicine?

245
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,320
And they have, but they have medicine, the RX medicine thing,

246
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Rx medicine thing but then the label is like the fucking like red and or the

247
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,880
yellow and black stripes like yeah yeah yeah that's all I like that as the new

248
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,000
that's the energy drink drink branding is like this is dangerous this will kill

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,040
you yeah gonna fucking Red Bulls the only one that is classy look yeah red bull

250
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,360
tries to class it up I'm reading the the nutrition facts on rap tour what do you

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,040
got um well it's got for a daily daily values wise this is a hundred and six

252
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,840
percent of your daily value for sugar.

253
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,840
Oh, but what's making me laugh here is that it's vitamin B6.

254
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
It's 420%

255
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,740
That's a funny things about the energy drinks because I'm getting

256
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,440
so many vitamin B and shit is like insanely cheap.

257
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,340
So they just dump like a crazy amount like it should it's

258
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,640
probably like a toxic amount of vitamins.

259
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,840
Yeah, like it always will be like a thousand percent of your

260
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,340
vitamin D for the day.

261
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,740
Yeah.

262
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,980
Oh, but here's a good thing if you have like an allergy.

263
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,860
If you're deficient on...

264
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
Zero vitamin D.

265
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Oh.

266
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Yeah.

267
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,700
If you're deficient on taurine, this is one of the best drinks you can get.

268
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,780
Or if you're anemic, it has zero iron in it.

269
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
Nice.

270
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,700
Yeah, they take care of that with a can.

271
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,580
Oh, if you're anemic, you eat the can when you're done.

272
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,580
Yeah.

273
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Well, no.

274
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
It's a cast iron can.

275
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
You can swallow the tab.

276
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,580
Yeah, it's like a pill.

277
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,940
or just you know the the liquid in the can is corroding the the can it's

278
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,060
you know you're getting this done we're like if you cook in it you're supposed

279
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,260
to get what gives you iron so weird that we need to eat a metal I don't think

280
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,260
that's true about cast iron I think that is true that's like one of the things

281
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,460
about it is it likes put some iron in your food I don't think that is true I

282
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,500
think it's true like it's good I think so I feel like whoever I feel like

283
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,020
whoever's right I could say I was on their side well okay so like with with

284
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,380
like a pie with Teflon pans like a nonstick pan yeah that shit's that makes

285
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,380
you proof yeah so it's the same thing with cast-iron third sip not bad let me

286
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,060
try the third hold on we got a real we're rethinking this as we you know we're

287
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:04,900
about evolutions here that's true well I'll be damned yeah you waited longer

288
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,260
yeah yeah that's true I think maybe there's gases being expunged from the

289
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,060
can yeah this is it I can there's something in the air in this apartment

290
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,580
since you open that can yeah give it a really strong is the spirit of the

291
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,260
Raptor the Raptor gave its life yeah it's very Native American style drink

292
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:29,860
I'm saying Raptor a bunch it what it is Raptor it's Nate what are you talking

293
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,820
about you stupid Native Americans yeah that's he runs with rock oh come on dude

294
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:44,280
I forgot it really is called rap tour because there's a line break between rap and tour and the like the little trademark symbols after rap

295
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,860
Oh, yeah, it is two words. Yeah, that's rap tour

296
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,300
Man, it's not rap. You're good

297
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,940
No, that makes sense

298
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,820
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna revolutionize the world with the rap tour episode. Yeah, I think I think I gotta pour these out

299
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,260
Don't waste the the ambrosia. Just go refrigerate it. Waste the ambrosia. Ambrosia is nectar of the gods.

300
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,020
Well, I drank two energy drinks back-to-back now. Why?

301
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Hey, it's okay. Coffee. You need to drink coffee?

302
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,380
Yeah, can you make me some coffee? No, that's not tasty. I don't have any coffee. I'm sorry.

303
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,940
That's great for me right now. Some coffee. A third drink.

304
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,440
Yeah, some green tea. A third drink to put in my body. I have a five-hour energy you could chug. Really? No.

305
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,040
That one I think is most diabolical one. Yeah. Yeah, it's all the same shit, but they they mini-meet it

306
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,360
They made it and made it stronger somehow like mini-me exactly strong package small package

307
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,860
Yeah

308
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:49,000
Think about five hour energy to me is it looks like you know those those tiny little like party popper things you pull the string

309
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,960
And I like shoots out confetti and like yeah, it kind of look the container kind of looks like that to me

310
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
So I feel like that's how it should be

311
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,920
It also looks like poppers.

312
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,800
You should pull a string and it should shoot the drink into your mouth.

313
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
That's a good idea.

314
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,080
You should be able to load it into a gun and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

315
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,040
Because that's really what you want to do.

316
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
Anytime you buy a 5-hour energy.

317
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,320
If you have to buy 5-hour energy, you've got to get your life.

318
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,120
I feel like you've got to turn your life around at some point.

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,160
Monster would genuinely make a killing if they made tiny containers of monster.

320
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,120
They're shaped exactly like bullets.

321
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Definitely.

322
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,200
would be more of a I would say that would be like a bang kind of product.

323
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,760
You've seen like you see a monster monster does the the army themed one.

324
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Oh yeah.

325
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,000
And then that's like yeah monster assault and it's like this is not political.

326
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
We don't we don't have any opinions about war or soldiers.

328
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
The entire thing is Israel themed.

329
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Yeah yeah.

330
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,160
Like no it's not political at all.

331
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
It's actually meh.

332
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Yeah.

333
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
That's cool.

334
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
We just think it's awesome.

335
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,800
Do you guys ever know anybody took caffeine pills?

336
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,720
No but I've been thinking about it.

337
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,440
do it dude. Why would you do that? You're so bad. I've been thinking about it. Dude, I want to go full

338
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,560
Jesse Spanos. I want to get like, take a bunch of caffeine pills. You guys come over my house,

339
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,280
I'm in my living room just like singing. Well somebody's cord is fucking... Mine? Freaking

340
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,040
out again. I don't know. I have the good cord I think. Oh, I guess I just have to watch the

341
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,040
recorder until someone messes up again. Alright, I'm not going to mess up, I promise you. I knew

342
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,000
some like like a trucker guy who would take caffeine pills that seems to be the

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,080
main thing that they sell them for yeah yeah have you seen that episode of save

344
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,240
by the bell? That's also what like diet pills are right? For truckers? No.

345
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,080
It's just caffeine right isn't it? Yeah. It's just like stimulants and shit.

346
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,160
Yeah. I gotta drive fucking six hours tomorrow but I'll be damned if I didn't

347
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,320
take my hydroxycut. People wonder how I do it. I think it's Caleb who's

348
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,200
Who's fucking, who's cord is fucked up?

349
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,900
Maybe it's your mic, whatever.

350
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,480
Not much we can do.

351
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,720
- Well, fuck you everyone.

352
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,040
- Wait, did you get rid of the bad cord?

353
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,920
- No, it's right there.

354
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,200
- You're probably using it.

355
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,680
- No, 'cause this is the rigid one.

356
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,640
I know that this is the good one.

357
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,480
- All right, whatever.

358
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
- I mean, we can switch 'em.

359
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,400
- Nah, it doesn't matter.

360
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,680
- This guy don't give a fuck.

361
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,440
If it does it again, we'll switch 'em, try 'em out.

362
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,280
- Okay.

363
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
- Have you seen the, you haven't seen

364
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,160
the Saved by the Bell episode?

365
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,840
- Why have you watched Saved by the Bell?

366
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
- I watch Saved by the Bell every morning

367
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,400
23 year old man. I was like eight. What? Yeah. It was on TBS. They played two episodes of Saved by

368
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,480
the Bell. I would finish my breakfast and then watch Saved by the Bell. In the morning before

369
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,480
school? That's a dangerous before school show. Any school show, put you in the wrong headspace.

370
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
That's right. You go to school, you think that you can talk to the camera. Yeah. You're sitting

371
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,280
there in class, just like. Or on flipping over people's lunch trays. You know? Yeah,

372
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah, you think you can freeze time like Zack Morris?

373
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Exactly, yeah, no.

374
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:52,400
Now, with that episode, Jesse starts taking caffeine pills so she can study for like the

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,120
SATs or some bullshit, but she also has a big concert at the Max.

376
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
No.

377
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,280
And so she gets addicted to caffeine pills and she passes out and Zack goes to her house

378
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,040
and is like, "Oh, Jesse, where were you?

379
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,440
You missed the big concert."

380
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,440
like no I oh no I need more pills and it's supposed to like it was the episode

381
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,920
that was supposed to tackle addiction but she's addicted to fucking caffeine pills

382
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,880
she's in her bedroom just like there's like a really funny scene where she's

383
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,840
like screaming scream singing yeah you're right they should have done that

384
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,800
episode with heroin instead there was a couple of shows like that like yeah like

385
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,840
see like ABC family shows about where like the middle schooler comes home and

386
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,420
like yeah out of his backpack like a heroin needle drops out yeah it's

387
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,520
pretty like are you serious man yeah yeah it's like that's how you would react

388
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,000
there was a that's not cool yeah no yeah this ends today yeah there was that's

389
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,840
are all gonna think you're lame that's like you have to stop with reverse

390
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,400
psychology yeah your friends are gonna make funny because you're so skinny now

391
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,760
do they so none of your friends know what the velvet underground is I think

392
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,600
that's cool at all. There's an episode of... man, they don't have those anymore.

393
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,920
PSA episodes? Yeah. Like that was a big Reagan era. They still do. They do.

394
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,320
No, they still do. They just don't watch the shows that have them anymore.

395
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,280
I think like... What, all of them now are like PSAs for like parents who don't

396
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,080
understand like what a transgendered person is? Yeah, yeah. You're right. Yeah,

397
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,240
it's always like, it's like way like weirder issues now than like...

398
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
- Well the thing, the thing, the thing.

399
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
- Like the yells are like transgender issues.

400
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
- You said that, not me.

401
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,360
- No, no, you said it.

402
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,180
- You said it.

403
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,020
- You said it.

404
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,440
- The PSA episodes I've seen are ones on like Netflix shows

405
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,540
where it'll be like somebody wants to commit suicide

406
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,740
in the episode and then at the end of the episode,

407
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,680
it'll be like, it'll be like,

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,520
if you or someone you know is contemplating suicide,

409
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,800

- It's all, yeah.

416
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,520
- It's, it is, it does feel like the PSAs used to be like,

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,260
like uh... yeah this is that this is the order is it smoking correct no they're

418
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,080

00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,420
smoking crack in his parents

420
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,320
uh... don't know what to do or whatever

421
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,940
like this kid wants to kill himself

422
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,060
and now there will be like a netflix cartoon like made for babies and then

423
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,440
there at the end of the more will be like

424
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,060
sometimes it's okay to be grumpy

425
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,880
yeah

426
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,760
sometimes you know anybody anything you can be grumpy sometimes

427
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,960
you know that you're most it's not okay to be grumpy though

428
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,920
You don't have to be your best self all the time.

429
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,640
And also, meditation is very valid.

430
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,600
- Therapy is good.

431
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,400
- Yeah, it's like, "Shut up, you pussy."

432
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
- Yeah, "Grow up."

433
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,960
- "Make the kid smoke crack again."

434
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,020
- Dude, I missed that.

435
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,420

439
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,120
- Man, there's a different Strokes episode

440
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,900
my mom's friend used to talk about

441
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,580
where like

442
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,220
encounter a pedophile

443
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,360
that's

444
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,220
yeah i mean that's crazy that is crazy but i think that like back in the seventies

445
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,180
like they just had like a

446
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,620
but they put pedophiles on t_v_ now you know i was happy again some work though

447
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,100
fuck you

448
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,780
what you play think i was in the i was in a row in the seventies yeah yeah

449
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,700
yeah yeah you were you are

450
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
You were a pedophile.

451
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
No.

452
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
You didn't know that you were on the show.

453
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,300
I mean, you know, I just thank God that they had, you know, back then they had people like,

454
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,300
you know, Jimmy Savile on TV to like pick up the slack, to, you know, tell people that

455
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,480
those things aren't real.

456
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,420
I mean, the thing about the 70s is back then they couldn't, they had to teach like anti-pedophile

457
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,940
rhetoric on TV shows because like they only hired pedophiles to be teachers.

458
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,440
like they would just they would just omit it from the curriculum yeah they would

459
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,980
just be like I don't feel like teaching this do you think someone like Jimmy

460
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,860
Savile like saw that different strokes episode and was like I was saying oh

461
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,660
wow this is bullcrap did he sound like that yeah he's British I don't think he

462
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,180
sounded like that though yeah what's always seen I was I don't think he did

463
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,500
that it's crazy that that guy looked that scary and people were like what

464
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
"Jimmy Savile's a pedophile? No!"

465
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
It's like, "What are you fucking... that guy looks like he kidnapped kids."

467
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Not Slimer from Ghostbusters.

469
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
You're telling me he's bad?

470
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,500
You're telling me that he's going around the city scaring people?

471
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Wait, Slimer's sliming people?

472
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
No.

473
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Are you fucking kidding me, dude?

474
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
That can't be true.

475
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Yeah, he just eats hot dogs.

476
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, I thought he was just, I don't know, green?

477
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I guess that's more of a hindsight thing.

478
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, and then they do all the... and then Bill Murray comes out and says, "Slimer

479
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,460
slimed me on the set of Ghostbusters." I was actually slimed. The director didn't

480
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,340
stop us. It was directed by Vincent Gallo. He actually let him slime him. He was

481
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,940
really fucked up. Yeah. I was talking to Cam about this earlier, so like Emily

482
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,900
Radajowski said that that guy Robin Thicke like groped her on the set of

483
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,680
Blurred Lines, right? That's the music video. You remember that song?

484
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Yeah.

485
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,420
So I read that story and I was like, "Oh my God, that's fucking awful." I read that this

486
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,580
morning and I was walking around doing the dishes the entire morning like, "I hate that

487
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,700
Blurred Lines." It's such a good song.

488
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
I mean, you know.

489
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,260
It's like the best song ever, dude.

490
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,340
Pharrell is an amazing producer.

491
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Dude, it's so fucked up.

492
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,660
He knows how to write a fucking hit.

493
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,460
Dude, it's the same thing with R. Kelly. We're like, "Anytime anybody brings up R. Kelly,"

494
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
and they're like, "Oh, it's horrible."

495
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
It's like, "Oh, fuck him."

496
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,700
I'm at dinner talking about, "Oh, God, what a horrible story."

497
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,260
Go to the bathroom, "Is that Reema doing this?"

498
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,900
I mean, fucking, what was that other R. Kelly song?

499
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,860
I remember, dude, in college we had a class where we just watched the R. Kelly documentary.

500
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,540
Yeah, trapped in the closet?

501
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,580
That's so funny.

502
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:16,000
That's so funny. We watched the R. Kelly documentary and then like immediately after we watched

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,600
like 15 R. Kelly music videos in a row. And then that was like where we started the discussion

504
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,940
was like okay you saw one side now you see the other. Now let's watch double up. Let's

505
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,140
watch same girl. Yeah. I mean pretty you know. Dude that fucking that video of him I think

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,260

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,380
They will go to Ethiopia and raise all this money and be like, "We're gonna go to

536
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,660
Ethiopia and build a well, a water well." And they'll go to like the middle of a

537
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,380
city and then just put like a well in the street. In the middle of traffic.

00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Running water. Every single house. Just put a well in the middle of a park.

540
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
We did something great here today.

541
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Yeah, or they'll buy a family a goat

542
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,300
in the middle of like fucking Mozambique or something.

543
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
Right.

544
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
It's like a family that lives in like an apartment.

545
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
Yeah, exactly.

546
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,300
They're like, "Great, now we have a fucking goat. Thanks a lot. Cool."

547
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,300
"You don't even have a fucking room to put..."

548
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
"This is a two bedroom."

549
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,300
"Thanks a lot. Yeah, no, I'm gonna pray to God now. Thanks for the goat, you fucking asshole."

550
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,300
"Thank you Christ for giving me this fucking goat. It's gonna eat all my shit."

551
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,300
"Yeah, he takes shit the size of an Xbox. Thank you very much."

552
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,300
Oh great, the goat got into the pantry and ate a whole can of beans.

553
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,300
Cool, yeah, the goat ate my kid's hat.

554
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,300
And his hair.

They need to be sending, missionaries should be sent to like, like Mars and Jupiter.

559
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,300
They gotta go to Antarctica in case the thing, we gotta teach the thing about Christ.

560
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,300
If we got the thing on Christ's side, that might be a huge weapon against the enemies.

561
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:59,340
you know? Yeah. All of Christ's enemies. Did you guys, no one ever tried to trick you into going

562
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:08,220
on a missions trip growing up? I mean, not yet. No? No. They tried to ship me out. I'm sure somebody

563
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,900
was like... They tried to ship me out to China, bro. I'm sure if somebody was like, you know,

564
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:20,140

565
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,340

566
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,060

- Yeah? - Yeah.

568
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,480
They said, "Caleb, you're one of the best agents we have.

569
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,140
"We're gonna send you on an extremely dangerous mission."

570
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,980
- Yeah. - And I said,

571
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
"And where am I going?

572
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,880
"Am I going to Syria?" - Yeah, there's this guy

573
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,700
named Jack Ma.

574
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,540
- They said, well, no, they said that they wanted me

575
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,020

576
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,980
- Wow. - They wanted me

577
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,820
to do the honors.

578
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,900
They said, "You're almost, if we could get Jackie Chan

579
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,400
"on our side, the devil, no weapon forged

580
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,380
"against Jackie Chan shall prosper."

581
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
That's true.

582
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,940
I mean, think about it.

583
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,940

You have two Jaycees on your side?

I think we've already seen the second coming.

589
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,140
Every Jaycee is one of the greatest men of all time.

658
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,420
man white chicks double feature double feature. Holy **** with

659
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,260
the DVD logo. Imagine watching those two back to back. I mean

660
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,620
it's crazy how good white chicks is and then how terrible

661
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,940
little man is. Well because white chicks is a perfect comedy, like perfect idea for

662
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,020
comedy right? Yeah. Is Wayne's guys pretending to be white women. White women.

663
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:34,220
So funny. And then little man is just like... Did you kind of think they were a

664
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:43,860
little hot growing up? Who? The white chicks? Shit. But I mean I don't know

665
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,300
there's something fundamentally missing from little man. I think it may be there's

666
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,140
no white there's no white chicks aren't in it. No. That could be it. I think it's

667
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,580
turning a grown man into a baby. It freaked me out. White chicks if the white chicks

668
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:04,340
showed up at like if I was seeing like a fucking like turnstile right the only

669
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,460
thing cooler than like like just seeing like a band that you really like is

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,780
seeing a band you really like and they're like we have a very special guest.

671
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,620
So white chicks come out and start dancing.

672
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,120
That would be the sickest shit ever dude.

673
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
That would be cool.

674
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,420
You'd be like, you'd be losing your mind.

675
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
Yeah.

676
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Oh my god.

677
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
Is that the white chick?

678
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, one of the white chicks is playing bass.

679
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
Yeah dude, yeah.

680
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Oh man.

681
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
Yeah.

682
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
He's so cool.

683
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
He's so bassist.

684
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
They're beatboxing?

685
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
Yeah.

686
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
How are those white chicks doing that?

687
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
How are those white chicks doing that?

688
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I don't think you're allowed to do that.

689
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
I don't think a white chick can beatbox.

690
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,660
He's got no rhythm.

691
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:44,040
Yeah, that I've identified the problem with a little man is my my fear of adult babies. Yeah, yeah

692
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,320
Yeah, true. Yeah, I guess we have done a lot of a BDL shit. Yeah, it must have been a

693
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:57,020
Fear into you. I've always been afraid of adult babies. You've been afraid. Yeah, my mom's scared about like a fucking guy

694
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,860
I was yeah, I was terrified of that guy

695
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,580
You're scared of adult babies. Yes, you're scared

696
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,660
It was I mean if I showed you my diaper right now, would you get freaked I would I think I know what we're doing for

697
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:19,240
Patrick's birthday next year. We're hiring an entertainer. We're gonna walk in with a big cake and it smells like shit

698
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,380
Big ass fake cake smells like shit

699
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,220
Baby biscuits on the side of it. Yeah, it's a boy

700
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,780
No, go ahead. There's nobody in that definitely

701
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:40,820
I think seeing like an adult in a diaper and sucking on a binky is a very weird thing.

702
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,660
I'm going to make sure you see that every day of your life.

703
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
We're setting you up.

704
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
We're going to hire one to follow you around.

705
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
I should exposure therapy.

706
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm getting rid of your phobia.

707
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,260
This is like the thing where they put Bam Margera in the snake tank.

708
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,620
Oh yeah, and he actually freaks out.

709
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,580
That is like a heartbreaking part of that movie where you're like, "Oh no, these guys are

710
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,300
like really hurting their friend."

711
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,300
Yeah.

712
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Yeah.

713
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,660
Well, number one, dirty public toilets.

714
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,140
Dirty public toilets.

715
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,500
So I was just walking into my local Target bathroom.

716
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,960
I was with my mom, and we walk in and we nearly scream due to the nastiness.

717
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,100
There is a baby coughing, a woman with her kids running around, can I speak to the manager?

718
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,500
Period pads and blood are everywhere, a bloody tissue, poop marks on the seat, pee on the

719
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,100
floor ice. I don't know why and just more crap a few stalls away. I hear my mom

720
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,900
shaking and cringe. Then I realized when I get up from the seat. I was sitting

721
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,500
right next to some sticky poop stuck to the ball. I scream but quietly we were

722
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,200
going to meet up with my cousin at the store. So when we walk out, she says I

723
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,000
have to pee. We look at her and just say hey look, it's that makeup you were

724
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,800
looking for. Thank goodness. You didn't go in there are times when I go into a

725
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,600
public toilet and I you see something so just like something that just doesn't

726
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,280
make any sense to your brain, right? And so I wish that I could do like Curse of the

727
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,800
Obra Dinn, just like relive that person's shit, to like know what happened.

728
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,600
The other day I was eating dinner out with my girlfriend. We were at

729
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,040
like some like vegetarian place that was like nice, and it had like

730
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,280
paintings on the wall and like music playing. It was like a nice place, and I

731
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,960
had to go to the bathroom. I got up and they literally had like a dive bars

732
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,800
bathroom in the back. It was like the craziest. I was like, "This, what is going

733
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,640
out like what are you doing world what did this place like used to be like how why

734
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,440
do they have this and they ran out of money remodeling yeah they just couldn't

735
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,280
get all keep the bathrooms the same it was so bizarre into a bathroom in a gas

736
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,800
station once where someone had just completely missed the toilet and shit on

737
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:47,280
the toilet seat I was like you're so was it that wasn't a miss you're right that's

738
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,240
actually pinpoint accurate yeah yeah but I was like what is it what are you doing

739
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,120
here. So somebody runs in and sits on the shit. As if you're gonna run in so fast

740
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,040
you don't notice a huge brown shit. That's true. On the toilet seat. I went to, you know what, I went to a

741
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,240
I went to a. I think I took a photo of it somewhere. Yeah. I have a photo, oh no I used to, I don't anymore. I had a

742
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,720
photo of, I went to a Buffalo Wild Wings in a mall. Mm-hmm.

743
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,840
I forget which mall, I think it was in, I don't know, it doesn't matter. Went into a Buffalo

744
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,680
Wild Wings bathroom in a mall, open up the stall door, blood on the seat. Oh my

745
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
God, dude.

746
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,240
Blood on the seat and in the water.

747
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
I was like, "Man."

748
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Blood on the seat.

749
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I should have said that.

750
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,040
That guy did the six-minute wing challenge, and he lost.

751
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Yeah.

752
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
He lost.

753
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
He lost for sure.

754
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,360
It is funny, every time you open a bathroom stall in a men's bathroom, you really brace

755
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,320
yourself for the worst one.

756
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Oh, yeah.

757
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
You go to any bar.

758
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,240
You open it, you're just like, "I'm prepared."

759
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,960
You have to be ready, because if it catches you off guard, you're going to upchuck.

760
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Yeah, absolutely.

761
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,760
Or you're going to fucking eat it up.

762
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Oh, God.

763
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,680
- We went to, when I was in Seattle, we went to a bar

764
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,340
and somebody, I forget the name, oh, the chieftain.

765
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,700
Went to the chieftain and we went into the bathroom

766
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,340
and someone was like, "Yo, someone pissed in the sink."

767
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,620
We're all like, "What?"

768
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,100
And then we all went in and it was not piss, but puke.

769
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,180
- Oh, that guy trolled you.

770
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,500
- I know. - Wow.

771
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,340
- Yeah.

772
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,100
- The toilet might have AIDS on it, yo.

773
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,960
Never know, I mean, God, yo could die.

774
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,360
That's a PSA episode waiting to happen.

775
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Yeah.

776
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Yeah.

777
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
Don't sit on a toilet.

778
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
It could have AIDS on it.

779
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:32,520
7th Heaven, like the priest dad's like, "I've contracted AIDS from a toilet."

780
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
The home improvement.

781
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Yeah.

782
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
Yeah.

783
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
One of the kids gets an AIDS.

784
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Dad?

785
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,000
Dad, I remember the other day when we were at CVS and I used the bathroom.

786
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, yeah, son.

787
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
Of course I remember that.

788
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,320
i have aids

789
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,480
from the toilet who blew up

790
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,680
the

791
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,120
what i tell you that's in on a

792
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,280
on aids

793
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,840
are are pretty smart once at the mall i saw some poop on the floor

794
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,440
the reason why i hate this is because chinese toilets that have no flushes no

795
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,760
doors and no toilet paper and once i saw a turd just lying in the floor and

796
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,920
didn't got to the toilet in a week until i got back home i almost threw up fat

797
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,160
your score is going crazy i press possible switch

798
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,580
okay

799
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,840
number two fat people in skimpy clothes

800
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,760
the hell no

801
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,000
but i should not have uh... fucking somewhere sleeping bag

802
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,720
policy all that

803
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,480
it's not

804
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,640
my mom is over two hundred pounds

805
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,160
and then to think it's attractive to walk around a sports bra with a massive

806
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,920
gut hanging over pants

807
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,280
when i ask you to put a shirt on she yells that she's pretty and smiles at my

808
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,720
my dad with her double chin. He says "ooh mama" and I literally want to puke my guts out.

809
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,680
My mom is such a fat piece of shit and guess what?

810
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
And my dad loves her!

811
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,680
She fucks my dad, dude. It's so gross.

812
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Ugh.

813
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Ugh.

814
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Do you think she wouldn't do that?

815
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Nasty.

816
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,040
Look, if you're going to be fat, at least get a license first and then consult your

817
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,240
fashion stylist. You've got to be aware of your current body state. Also, please refrain

818
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,480
from McDonald's or Burger King. Wendy's is also not acceptable.

819
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Wendy's is the healthier option.

820
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Uh, yeah.

821
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Wendy's has a salad that has mandarin oranges in it.

822
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Pretty fucking good salad too.

823
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
But they have a salad with strawberries in it, right?

824
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,480
They got like literally five salads on the menu, bro.

825
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Damn, and they got chili too?

826
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
It's a healthy option.

827
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Do they still have chili at Wendy's?

828
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,480
It's a damn good chili.

829
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
After that woman pretended to put her thumb in it or something?

830
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
What?

831
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Or who cut off their finger and put it in a Chili's?

832
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Or a Wendy's Chili?

833
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,480
I don't know. Someone cut off their finger and then placed it in a Wendy's Chili. I don't think so.

834
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Yeah, I've never heard about that.

835
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,980
What?

836
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,480
Yeah.

837
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Are their toe or something?

838
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Or a band-aid or something?

839
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
A band-aid?

840
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Downgraded to a band-aid?

841
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,480
I remember there was some body part in Wendy's Chili.

842
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
A band-aid's not a body part.

843
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Band-aid is a body part when you put it on, but when you take it off it no longer is.

844
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
So, checkmate.

845
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,480
He just said checkmate. I think he won.

846
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,360
I think I think the Raptors is controlling his brain dude. Yeah

847
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,720
Dude he's been acting so much like a raptor since he had the Raptors

848
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,640
Arms just shrank. Oh, yeah, he's so much. He's so fast. No Raptors have tiny arms. No

849
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,480
Rex no

850
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,960
Not that's

851
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,360
Big toes they have the bigger bigger legs and arms, which I don't have hmm. What are you talking about?

852
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,920
Yes, you do. No, my arms are way bigger my legs. No, they're not

853
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
I walk around on my arms.

854
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Hold your arm out.

855
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,920
Hold your arms out to your side right now.

856
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,920
See, if I do this it looks like it's bending.

857
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
You can't even measure.

858
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,920
Look at this.

859
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Alright, look at this.

860
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Ready?

861
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Abracadabra.

862
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
Whoa.

863
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Whoa.

864
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,920
It looks like your arm is moving up and down.

865
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
I know.

866
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,920
But he's holding it still.

867
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,920
How do you do that?

868
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,920
It's magic.

869
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I learned it at school.

870
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,920
What school?

871
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Magic school.

872
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
School for the giftedly magic.

873
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
School for the clinically magic.

874
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Yeah.

875
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
magic.

876
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Go for the clinically magic.

877
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,920
Yeah.

878
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,920
Uh, number three, vomit.

879
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
P-U.

880
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
P-U.

881
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,420
I think vomit's funny.

882
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,680
It doesn't really gross me out that much.

883
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Yeah.

884
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Yeah.

885
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Except like, that's a lie.

886
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,920
Wendy's chili finger lady comes clean.

887
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,760
It was a lady put her finger in a chili.

888
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,200
I put my finger in chili before.

889
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,680
Yeah, it's how else you eat it.

890
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
True.

891
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Eat it one finger at a time.

892
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,280
Well, no, she cut off her finger and put it in chili.

893
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,920
that over and over again. Yeah puke is funny sometimes. There's some types of puke that

894
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,760
are funny and sometimes a puke is really disgusting. A chunky puke is going to put me in the dust.

895
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,200
But a fucking, if someone pukes out like a white puke, and as long as they don't make

896
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,360
a crazy noise, I'm golden. I'm fine. I'm not going to freak out that much. If somebody

897
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:57,360
pukes like vile, not for me. A puke that shoots out is one of the funniest things in the world.

898
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,760
A dribbling puke is disgusting.

899
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,260
Horrible.

900
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,760
A shooting fire hose puke.

901
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,120
A fountain or like a magic missile puke.

902
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,400
That is really funny.

903
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Yeah, a shit-seeking.

904
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,080
If you have like a puke after a Thanksgiving meal, funny as hell.

905
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,480
Yeah.

906
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,400
A puke after like...

907
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,320
That video I sent you where a guy takes one drag of a cigarette and then pukes all over his entire body.

908
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,440
It's not weed.

909
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,800
He's lying on his back and he goes like, "Bleah!" and it shoots out like a fountain.

910
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,300
Immediately.

911
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,200
It's all over him.

912
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,040
He pukes like up into the air.

913
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,400
It's so fucking good.

914
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,080
Oh, Jerry Hits the Bong and Spews, that's a good, that's a classic video.

915
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
Never seen it?

916
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah, you have.

917
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
It's that fat British guy.

918
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080
Oh yeah, okay.

919
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,160
He's sitting on his couch, he hits a bong and spews.

920
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,960
I've seen it, he hits a bong and spews.

921
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,000
And then it's like now in slow-mo and then it puts it in like the rainbow like Windows

922
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Movie Maker.

923
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What's his name?

924
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,240
LA Beast Crystal Pepsi Puke?

925
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Yep.

926
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Funny.

927
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
Oh yeah.

928
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
That is a perfect puke.

929
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
LA Beast One Month Old Milk Puke?

930
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Funny.

931
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
LA Beast has perfect pukes.

932
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,280
puke is the faded family modelo chug. That is like the best puke of all time. I think

933
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,560
those videos are offline. No, Will got someone to like upload a backup. Oh sick. I'll find

934
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,320
it for you guys. I guess that's pretty tough to get a job if you search your name and you

935
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,000
get faded family and it's you drinking modelos till you vomit. Puking literally like more

936
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
modelo than you drink. 32 ounce modelo challenge. I said $32. That'd be a big ass modelo. Yeah.

937
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,020
Yeah, yeah, hell I could drink. No, I have one right now though. Yeah

938
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,600
Yeah, I love to number four is people not flushing the toilet. This is nasty again. That is pretty nasty

939
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,800
This is the same one

940
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,440
I feel like I mean but if you if you're like sitting down to pee and you forget because you're on your phone and you're playing

941
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,440
like

942
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,960
No playing that I think people who forget to flush the toilet should be like executed. That's like I agree

943
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,620
yeah, that's like if it's literally you should be like in like a

944
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,060
special program. If you forget to flush the toilet. That's one of the most

945
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:56,180
pathetic and disgusting things you could possibly do in this world.

946
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,380
I forget to flush when I pee all the time.

947
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,820
When you pee it's not that bad when it's pee.

948
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,620
But in general if you forget that's like the come on. Flush it's not hard to do.

949
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,620
You know what else is fucked up now? Those like top flusher toilets.

950
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,540
If you don't push that thing hard enough.

951
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,660
Yeah. I do hate going to someone's house and they have like every toilet has a different

952
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,180
like handle that you have to hold down a different amount of time or else it won't flush.

953
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,780
When someone has a fancy handle...

954
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,660
The two button ones, those ones are the worst because you think you can just press the button

955
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,100
once but no, it's not all going down. So it's going to come back up. You got to hold that

956
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,700
thing down till you see it go down.

957
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,500
Yeah. There's a technique to it.

958
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,820
Yeah. Oh yeah. Don't fucking... don't put a technique into your flush thing.

959
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,260
No, it should be like... it should be the perfect flusher, handle in a public restroom.

960
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:44,820
Those fucking...

961
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,620
Super flusher.

962
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,500
Those ones now that are like, that have like pressure in them, and it shoots like a gun,

963
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,300
those ones are perfect. Gets everything gone.

964
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,500
Strong toilet.

965
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:54,980
Here's a comment.

966
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,580
Those top button ones, fuck that shit.

967
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,220
Here's a comment.

968
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:57,860
Disgusting.

969
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,100
It's annoying and plus don't want to look at somebody's poop. I mean really people?

970
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,900
Some people who I know who does it. Xander, Gladath, and the worst, Sarkanda.

971
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,500
Really Sarkanda? Really?

972
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,900
Sarkanda, you fucker.

973
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,220
Fucking Gladath never flushes the toilet.

974
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,020
My boy Gladath and Sarkander, they be fuckin'

975
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,420
going in one after the other for getting a flush in the toilet.

976
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,020
And Voldemort too, he's always doing that shit.

977
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,520
Don't even get me started on fuckin'

978
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,820
My boy Bowser, this guy tears it up when he comes over.

979
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,620
Dry bones.

980
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,420
Dry bones, he...

981
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,520
Dry bones is the worst 'cause it's all dust.

982
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,820
Yeah, what's that in the toilet? I ain't never seen a shit like that.

983
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,220
I ain't never seen a shit like that.

984
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,620
You gotta send that boy to the... Stop trying to get me to use Seinfeld.

985
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,520
Stop, dude.

986
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,820
He poops, and it's dust!

987
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,120
Stop, dude.

988
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,120
I didn't know poop had a bone in it!

989
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
Stop.

990
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
Stop trying to make me do...

991
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
He wouldn't eat bones.

992
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
He wouldn't...

993
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,120
He is bones.

994
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Yeah, but what does he eat?

995
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
He shits.

996
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
He eats bones too.

997
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,120
He eats dust, yeah, but he wouldn't eat a bone.

998
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,120
He literally eats bones.

999
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
He wouldn't be a bone in his poop.

1000
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
He literally eats bones.

1001
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,120
He wouldn't eat bones.

1002
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,520
You wouldn't eat like an arm.

1003
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
I'd eat meat.

1004
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,520
I eat meat every day.

1005
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
Checkmate.

1006
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
I also checkmated you.

1007
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,520
Oh my god.

1008
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
You've been checkmated twice in one episode.

1009
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520
No.

1010
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,120
I'm made out of meat, I eat meat.

1011
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,800
But you're not just made out of meat.

1012
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
He's just made out of bones.

1013
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,120
- Wings are not just made out of meat,

1014
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,960
they're made out of bones and meat, checkmate.

1015
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,080
- But he wouldn't eat an arm, that's, come on.

1016
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:15,920
- Literally what a wing is.

1017
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,760
- Wings is a bone, checkmate.

1018
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,280
- Dude, you are getting fucking destroyed.

1019
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,120
- You don't eat the bone.

1020
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,400
- Oh my God, dude, he's--

1021
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,240
- I eat bones.

1022
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,060
- I eat bones.

1023
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,800
- What about bone marrow, you can eat bones from bone marrow?

1024
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,640
- Dude, you're getting taken down and he's getting mad.

1025
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,480
- I'm not getting mad.

1026
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,300
- He's getting so checkmated.

1027
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,960
- You guys sound stupid right now.

1028
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,800
- You're just mad, you're literally--

1029
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,640
- You're just mad that you're eating an arm.

1030
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,460
- You're literally eating an arm.

1031
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,300
- I've eaten tons of arms.

1032
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,700
- You don't eat an arm.

1033
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,740
- Chicken wing.

1034
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,220
- No, you don't eat the bone there.

1035
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,060
- Chicken leg.

1036
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,900
- I've eaten a bone.

1037
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,720
- You don't eat the bone.

1038
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,560
- I've eaten a bone hole.

1039
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,400
- I ate the bone.

1040
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,220
- You don't eat a bone hole.

1041
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,060
That's not true.

1042
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,140
That's false.

1043
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,620
You guys are lying to try and make me look stupid.

1044
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,460
- If you get a microwave,

1045
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:48,280
you can eat the bone.

1046
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,120
- You guys are sounding stupider and stupider

1047
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:49,960
by the second.

1048
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,780
- I agree.

1049
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,620
- You can chew on that bone.

1050
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,460
- Yeah, you can eat the bone.

1051
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:53,280
- You can chew the marrow out of the bone

1052
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,120
and put it in the microwave.

1053
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,960
- But it wouldn't go in your poop.

1054
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,320
poop. No it wouldn't. Let's eat a bone right now. Go eat a bone right now. Yep you can inspect

1055
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,000
my poop. Okay go do it. No it's not a checkmate until you eat the bone. Hey how about a dog

1056
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,800
eats meat and a bone. Yep. Not together. A dog also doesn't eat the bone. Dogs eat the

1057
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:15,120
bone. No they don't. Yes they do. No they don't. You've never been around pit bulls.

1058
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,280
I've been checkmated. You've not been checkmated. Stand your ground. Alright yeah. You know what?

1059
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,640
a bitch. Double checkmate. Double checkmate, well how? He'd eat the bones! He'd get the

1060
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,640
bones out! It's too easy. But a dog wouldn't eat a dog leg. A dog would probably eat another

1061
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:41,800
dog. Have you ever been to a dog fight? No. They eat the other dog. Have you been to a

1062
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,680
dog fight? Yeah. Okay, checkmate dude, you're going to jail. No. Looks like we're in a Mexican

1063
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,560
Checkmate here this the statute of limitations checkmate. What's the statute of limitations on going to a dogfight? I?

1064
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,400
Don't know like ten minutes, right? Yeah

1065
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:09,040
Gone so there's no evidence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Where's the dog? Yeah, these two dogs weren't fighting one of them

1066
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,100
See if the cops pull up to if the cops pull up to your dog fight if you're having a dog fight

1067
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,720
Yeah, all you have to do is just say hey officer

1068
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:27,200
Maybe there's something that we can work out and then you point to the dogs and just start doing like a gun

1069
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,600
Yeah

1070
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:37,080
Cops love to shoot dogs. They do you owned them take that cops number

1071
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,040
Some of those that work forces are the same some of those that walk dogs is are the same that

1072
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:56,120
Fuck, what would the fuck dog dogs is I don't like that. I don't like it either. Here's number five is Justin Bieber

1073
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:02,420
We went from poop and pee to Justin B. This guy is monstrously disgusting

1074
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,480
Here's a just a little here's a comment from a Justin Bieber fan. I think you should put dirty water on your mom's head

1075
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Shit, oh man

1076
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,320
Justin Bieber dry hair and clean it yeah

1077
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,280
Yeah, want to see pictures of the back of him with no clothes on and covering his private parts, lol

1078
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:30,920
Nakey pic of Justin Bieber like yesterday didn't he shows cock and something

1079
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,920
It's funny that like if you're famous for more than you

1080
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,040
He peed into a bucket and said "Fuck Bill Clinton."

1081
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,400
If you're famous for more than like five years, people will see your cock.

1082
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,400
Yeah.

1083
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,400
That's true.

1084
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
It's kind of inevitable.

1085
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Someone's going to iCloud hack you.

1086
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
Someone's going to like fucking...

1087
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,760
If you're like super famous, your cock is going public.

1088
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,760
Yep.

1089
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,760
Yeah.

1090
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:57,200
I mean, maybe we can do something about that.

1091
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Yeah?

1092
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
What would we do?

1093
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Like maybe some kind of cyber security thing we could invent.

1094
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
Why would we do that?

1095
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,200
- Like a cock destroyer?

1096
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,400
- A cock lock.

1097
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,240
- Cock lock?

1098
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,600
- It's like an encryption.

1099
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,440
- Yeah.

1100
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,400
- So you just destroy their cocks.

1101
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,040
- It's an app, right?

1102
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,320
- That encrypts your cock?

1103
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,820
- Yeah.

1104
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,660
- Okay.

1105
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,480
- So every photo--

1106
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,320
- So it's just like a matrix,

1107
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,160
one's a zero outline of your cock?

1108
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,600
- Okay, so you know those AI things

1109
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,480
where you take a, you upload a photo of yourself

1110
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,440
and then it describes your face.

1111
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,520
It says like, this is what the AI thinks of you.

1112
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,240
It says like, a lot of them said like,

1113
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,080
you're a buck or whatever.

1114
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,400
- Oh, I do remember the description that Caleb got

1115
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
when he put his face into that. What was it? I don't remember.

1116
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,420
Oh, it was like predator. It was worse than that.

1117
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,440
Oh, right.

1118
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,460
I don't remember what it was. Oh, well, yeah, never mind. What did you think I was? You have to tell me.

1119
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,480
You don't remember? I don't remember. It said "rapist".

1120
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,500
Oh, that is funny.

1121
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,520
Yeah, the AI said that. Okay, so it's that. Everyone's posting their face of their thing, their screenshot

1122
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,340
the AI thing online, it was like, "It said I'm a cowboy!"

1123
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
[Laughter]

1124
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,340
"It said I'm an IT worker!"

1125
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,140
Yeah, no, that was definitely...

1126
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,140
The thing is, yeah, I mean...

1127
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,740
It's so funny, they put that into their, like, their AI knowledge bag.

1128
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,540
And also, they uploaded, they were like, "Hmm, should we disable this one for the website?"

1129
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,380
Nah, nah, we'll use that one.

1130
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,380
People love that one.

1131
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,500
Yeah, nah, that was a dark day.

1132
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Mine said "Young Buck" every time.

1133
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,260
I don't remember what mine said, to be honest.

1134
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,860
- Okay, so that one.

1135
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,420
So we use that same technology, right?

1136
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,700
And then we use that AI thing

1137
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,780
to write detailed descriptions of penises.

1138
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,940
- Uh-huh. - Okay.

1139
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,280
- And then if a celebrity takes a,

1140
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,300
they take a photo in the app,

1141
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,540
and then the photo, the penis is removed from the photo.

1142
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,500
- Okay. - Content-aware fill style.

1143
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,820
- Soft nub. - Ken doll.

1144
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,340
- Ken doll, soft nub.

1145
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,360
- Okay. - And then at the bottom,

1146
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,920
just has a very vivid description of what the penis would look like.

1147
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,920
Oh, that's a good idea.

1148
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,920
Yeah, that is actually clever.

1149
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,560
So anytime a celebrity takes a cock pic, they do it with this app.

1150
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Yes.

1151
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,920
Send it to whatever, like...

1152
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
Send it to Selena Gomez.

1153
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,680
Yeah, send it to Selena Gomez and then she can imagine it, right?

1154
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
And then there's no...

1155
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,440
And she's getting 99% of the experience of cock photo.

1156
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Because women like words, too.

1157
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,440
Yeah, exactly.

1158
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,800
And it'll get people to read again.

1159
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,800
That's a big thing.

1160
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
None of these kids are reading.

1161
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,800
They're all too busy looking at cocks.

1162
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
And here's the thing.

1163
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
It doesn't get sent over your phone.

1164
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
It gets sent in a book.

1165
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,600
- Yeah, it's like a pamphlet and then you have to read it.

1166
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,560
- And the app is celebrities only.

1167
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,720
- Yeah. - Like Raya.

1168
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,840
- Yeah, it's like Raya.

1169
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,560
And then also, it would need to be,

1170
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,200
so we'd work on this, right?

1171
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,320
So probably it's gonna be grueling hours

1172
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,120
of us looking at cots and writing the descriptions.

1173
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,520
And probably getting really good at it too.

1174
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,800
By the end we might be able to--

1175
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,360
- We'll be the Joyce Carol Oates of--

1176
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,280
- Well, here's the end game.

1177
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,440
Then once a bunch of celebrities join,

1178
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,180
they don't realize what they accepted

1179
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,480
in the terms of service.

1180
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,600
we turn all of them into a coffee table book.

1181
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,920

1194
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,360
like the background of a celebrity home.

1222
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,800
I can't wait to see him.

1223
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,800
You have Grandpa Roly?

1224
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
Seen him in a couple weeks.

1225
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Roly Poly.

1226
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,800
Can't wait to see him.

1227
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,840
As soon as I get to his house every single time, he's like, I haven't seen him in like

1228
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,960
a year or something, he's like, "Oh, great to see you.

1229
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,160
Can you move 400 boxes from my garage to my bedroom?"

1230
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,520
And I go, "Yeah, yeah, Grandad, no problem."

1231
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,560
Then he makes me the worst food ever.

1232
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,560
Yeah.

1233
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
He's an absolute pimp.

1234
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,680
My grandpa, when my grandpa lived with me, he would make his own food, but he would make

1235
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,680
it too hot.

1236
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Grandpa food is--

1237
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Or too spicy.

1238
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,160
you make it to some of the worst food of all time

1239
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,320
we would hear him eating it in the other room and he'd just be like

1240
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,400
my grandpa made uh... he would make this thing called it was egg mcpits

1241
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,400
oh god that doesn't sound good at all

1242
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,160
my last name is pits

1243
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,320
so it's like an egg mcmuffin but it's egg mcpits

1244
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,540
and it's all the ingredients of an egg mcmuffin

1245
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,000
but he chops them all up and puts them in a bowl

1246
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,900
he makes like eggs, bacon,

1247
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,160
cheese, an english muffin and he just chops it all up

1248
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,160
It's horrible.

1249
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,160
Why does he chop up the egg?

1250
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,160
It makes no sense.

1251
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
Why does he chop up the bread?

1252
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,760
He has all the ingredients, he's making egg sandwich, chops everything up, puts it in

1253
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,760
a bowl, calls it an Egg McPitz.

1254
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
That's a horrible name too.

1255
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
I mean, wouldn't it be like an Egg Pitz Muffin?

1256
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,240
Well, he uses his last name when he makes it for himself, but when he makes it for me.

1257
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,240
But I'm saying-

1258
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,640
Egg Pitz Muffin makes a lot more sense.

1259
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,640
Yeah, but it's like McPitz.

1260
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
You see what I'm saying?

1261
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,640
No.

1262
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,640
Because it's McDonald's.

1263
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,640
Yeah, oh yeah.

1264
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
It's a McMuffin, so it would be like-

1265
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,640
No, he's not smart.

1266
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
It should be like a Pitz Muffin.

1267
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,600
Yeah, no, he thinks that the guy's name is Donald and it's like

1268
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,720
Like MC is like some kind of like like old Donald like it's like

1269
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,320
McDonald Ronald

1270
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:31,400
Mick Donald it's he thinks it's a name. He thinks his name is Ronald middle name Mick last name Donald

1271
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,640
Yeah, MC Donald Ronald Donald. Yeah, he's made a lot of fucked up food

1272
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:42,720
He used to make a thing where he would just make he would just boil olive oil and then put and then pour it over pasta

1273
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Like a soup.

1274
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,280
Soup?

1275
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,280
What the fuck?

1276
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,280
You wouldn't put any seasoning in it?

1277
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
I mean like salt.

1278
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
That's it?

1279
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Yeah, he individually salts.

1280
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,280
You put cracked red pepper and garlic in it.

1281
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,280
And parsley, that's pasta di gillo.

1282
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,280
That's from Chef.

1283
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,280
Listen to this.

1284
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,280
We go to a Mexican restaurant, they serve chips beforehand.

1285
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
Individually salts every single chip that goes into his mouth.

1286
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,280
Sits there, just salts them.

1287
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,640
salt some. Not even the good flaky salt they already have on them. Nah dude he's putting

1288
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:24,520
table salt on them. This is called an egg Mcchip. It's a chip Mcme. It's really good, it's the

1289
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,520
best thing ever. He also goes to Mexican restaurants, he's a hamburger at the Mexican restaurant

1290
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,760
guy. Oh yeah. Always, and when I was a kid he used to bring, we didn't have milk at our

1291
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,920
house, he would come over for dinner, he'd bring a gallon of milk, just pour, he'd drink

1292
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,920
a half gallon of milk at dinner. He's alive. Incredible. How old is he? He's like 78 maybe?

1293
