00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the heartless.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Where is the lamb who was slain?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Isn't awesome God he lambs.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We need a rest of the boat.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, yeah, right away.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First things first.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so let's think of the elements of a worship song.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
of a song first of all I need a melody so we can just use twinkle twinkle little

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,360
star for that that's that works that's a love you I love God I am so in love with

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:46,320
God I'm married to God God is my husband or my wife nuns aren't allowed to make

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,320
worship song my song is about my love with God no all of the evangelical songs

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,720
have to be about like how big God is. God so big. God is the biggest man I've ever seen.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah like God. Yeah God you're the tallest guy. God is bigger than the Empire State Building.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,800
He's bigger than a car and he's bigger than a hippo. I was writing my own melody. I was writing

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,560
a appeal to like kids nowadays so we could have a rap verse where it's like "yo my God is immense

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,720
in size when I saw him I couldn't believe my eyes I went to heaven he was so tall

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,680
standing next to him I felt so small I got his love I felt his power I was only

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,160
in heaven for one hour I came back to life on the operating table and that is

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,880
the story and the moral of my fable that could be a good yeah that's good God is

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,560
big as as King Kong God he chose me to write the song God is bigger than the

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Titanic if I didn't make the song then God would panic I had to go to the God

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:05,560
store to now I always go to the store and all my freestyle I'm like I think I

26
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,440
think I maybe lost my touch with rapping dude I might get kicked out of the

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
cipher soon I think you might I think you know what dude there's nothing more

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,080
embarrassing than getting kicked out of the cipher where they the head of the

29
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,360
Cypher walks up to you and he turns your hat back forwards and he says, "You're out."

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
Yeah, he uncrooked your hat.

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Yeah, and you say, "Play a what?"

32
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,840
Yeah, and you know what? I'm gonna be 100% with you.

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
You keep it 100% with me?

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
I'm gonna keep it 300% with you.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,040
You honestly have not been rapping as much as you should.

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,080
And then the guy comes up to you to try and kick you out of the Cypher

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,520
and he turns your hat back around and everything and you're panicking and you're like

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,960
"No I wanna stay in the cypher, you look like you have a dirty diaper, by the way I'm gonna

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,680
go to the store" and then you know it's...

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
It's all yeah.

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:04,400
You know you've been, you have been going to the store so much that you have store fixation

42
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
with

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,120
You've turned your back on hip hop.

44
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
The store can be hip hop.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh really?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Supreme store.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Really?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,660
I had to go to the Supreme store, get some clothes for my whore, and then she was a bore,

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,400
so I went back to the store, and I got more.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,700
So I went to a shrink, he analyzed my dreams, he said it's lack of sex that's bringing me

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
down.

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:35,300
Yeah, yeah, and then he went to a whore, said my life's a bore, so quit your whining or

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,860
your God is awesomely large.

54
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:47,940
Sometimes I give myself the faith, sometimes God puts me in my place.

55
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,700
It all keeps adding up.

56
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,340
I think Christ is coming up.

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,540
Out of the ground.

58
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
Out of the cave.

59
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:05,020
Am I here to praise the Lord or am I...

60
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,500
Fuck.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,060

Pray to take me to paradise. I've been sleeping in my dad and wife

67
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,860
I had a dream last night

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,460
That I was with you guys and we were trying to buy Green Day t-shirts

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,780
I straight up you just remind me. I did have a dream last night about a rap battle. That was on the beach

70
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,980
Oh my god, this is like some this is very little but Caleb was there, but he is not so yet

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,820
We're all we're all talking about our dream. I wasn't battling wait what I think I remember

72
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,200
I don't realize that means that you're like subconscious mind and shit doesn't see me as a battle rapper

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,520
I the I remember it was it was people at the beach

74
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,240
And then there was like a like a kid who was trying to start a rap battle like it was a young kid who was trying

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,300
to like

76
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah, just a one kid. You just want a one-man rap battle. Well. I know that's why that's why that was kind of the crux

77
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Of the dream that's why it was like what is this? Yeah?

78
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,100
Because you were promised a rap battle that didn't happen.

79
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,220
No, we were just like at the beach and then a kid came up and he was you know trying to

80
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
start a rap battle.

81
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
You spit heat?

82
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Yeah.

83
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,140
And was everybody just like, "No dude, I can't battle you."

84
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,140
I don't remember.

85
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
I'm at the beach.

86
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,500
I think I woke up going, "Ahh!" at that point, covered in sweat.

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,860
"There was nobody to battle that little boy!"

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,860
That's the worst.

89
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,620
Dude, I've been, this is my first week.

90
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,340
We should start a charity for kids who won't.

91
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,860
It's a Big Brothers Big Sisters program.

92
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
No battler left behind, dude.

93
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,360
Yeah.

94
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,860
You get assigned a cipher partner.

95
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah.

96
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Oh my god, dude, if I seriously get M&M, I'm gonna lose.

97
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,860
Oh, no.

98
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,860
That's the worst part about it is, obviously, they're older than you, so they know way more about magic.

99
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,860
So they have more knowledge of the-- more street knowledge.

100
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,860
Maybe they assign, like, really young orphans that are younger than the kids who have no opponents, so that the kids can easily defeat them.

101
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,860
Yeah, so it's like big brothers, big sisters, but you're the big brother.

102
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,660
So the kid's like, like comes in and is like, "Hey little orphan, I'm gonna battle you.

103
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,460
You're so ugly and that's why I'm mad at you."

104
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,740
And then the orphan, you know, tries to do a verse and he's like, "I'm so hungry!

105
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm so hungry!

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
I'm so hungry!

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
It's cold!

108
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm so hungry!

109
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
I want more food!

110
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
I need food!

111
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,980
May I have some more, sir?"

112
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,020
Oh my god, he flopped.

113
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,500
Yo, he flopped hard.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
What the fuck?

115
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,700
Dude, I've been having the most insane dreams.

116
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
This is my first week ever taking melatonin.

117
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,240
Yeah, yeah, and it's giving me the most the fucking craziest dreams

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,380
I had last they're like like I'll wake up and like see the real world and then my brain is like you're not done yet

119
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,660
Buddy, and it'll put I feel hands just pulling me back down into a dream like my dad is a lot of

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,260

00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,300
I had there was this one time me and my ex-girlfriend like both took melatonin and you trips together

122
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
We both

123
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,340
Around each other

124
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,880
It's like it's like the like every acid yeah movies you on the other side

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,620
I dude I like we both woke up from having like like a night terror like we both woke up at the same time like

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,420
And like I just remember like like at the same time just like we we can never take

127
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,940
Dude, I had a really scary dream the night before last. I've had two. I had two. I don't remember my dreams that often

128
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
But I had two in a row. The one from

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,900
The night before last night was I had this dream that I was in like this dorm thing where everyone was like packing up to

130
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,960
Leave and and I was like outside and it started like blizzarding all of a sudden and I was like trying to walk back to the dorm

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,000
But it was like it's hard to walk in the snow

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then there were these like big like just like

133
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,740
Stick figure creature things that were just like peeking around corners and trying to follow me back

134
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,460
And I finally got inside and I took the elevator up and I got to my dorm room and I like went around the corner and

135
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,180
The door was already open and I was like in the gym

136
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,700
I was like, oh that means something's waiting for me in there and then I woke up it was

137
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,220
And then I went on my phone I checked Instagram and then I looked at my Twitter notifications

138
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,620
And then I got up and I had a bowl of cereal and I made some coffee

139
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,620
and I went on my laptop. It's funny when someone tells you about a dream like

140
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,800
nobody cares about your dream but the person who had the dream but it's funny

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,260
pretend you're like insanely interested you're like please continue please no

142
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,260
no don't end it now. Who else showed up? What did your father look like? Yeah no I'm

143
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,060
fine. I'll never talk about a dream again it's okay. I don't know that I've ever had a

144
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,220
good dream. Yeah. Yeah. All my dreams are about like, like, it's like, just, it might as

145
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,300
well be a memory of like me going to like middle school and like forgetting that to

146
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,340
pack a lunch and that's like the entire dream. I mostly have stress dreams like that.

147
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,580
Have you ever had a night terror? Yeah, dude, I think I've talked about it before. What's the difference between a night terror and a nightmare?

148
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,500
Couldn't tell you, that's why I'm asking. Or I think it was sleep paralysis is what I had.

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,580
That's not a night terror, dude. Well, you wake up fucking terror, you feel like

150
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:42,020
you're glued to the bed. I saw a scary movie at night that could be a night terror.

151
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,540
That is a kind of night terror. I saw it. I probably talked about it before but I was

152
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,380
watching on because I used to have that like CRTV CRT TV with like the the VCR

153
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,660
DVD combo thing. Oh yeah. I would watch like I had just a shit ton of VHS tapes

154
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,100
and I just watched those before bed and I was watching the first Star Trek movie

155
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,560
and I like went to bed and then like at the end of that like tape was just like

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,060
a gray screen I remember looking at the gray screen falling asleep my light was

157
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,860
on and then I like felt like I woke up I was in my bed in complete darkness and

158
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,420
I was like oh there's somebody like right at the foot of my bed huh there's

159
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,140
somebody like right there and he's like gonna kill me yeah I remember like I

160
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,860
getting up like like I remember like like I have to lunge forward or something

161
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,540
like if I get up he'll go away and I like got up and then like I woke up in my bed

162
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,620
in the same position and like the light all that happened was like the lights turned on.

163
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,460
It was funny. Yeah I've had I've only had sleep paralysis a few times so one of the times I did

164
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,340
was when I was at school and I was like a like a standardized test day and like it was like oh

165
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,940
when you finish your test you can't leave so you can just like sleep at your desk or like read or

166
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,540
something and I fell asleep on my desk yeah and then I got sleep paralysis and I like couldn't

167
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,420
move with my head on my desk and I like thought there was somebody just like

168
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,460
standing over me it was so fucked up.

169
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,940
Dude I like uh I've had sleep paralysis a couple times but I never really noticed

170
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,980
that I can't move because like if somebody was in my room

171
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,100
I just yeah I wouldn't move anyway. I don't want to like have to like I'd

172
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,140
rather die than like have to fight a monster dude.

173
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,780
Like fuck that dude. Yeah dreams suck also because it's like I feel like

174
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,020
people talk about dreams like it's like a free like virtual reality

175
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:34,140
But like, it's not. No, every dream is like you're in church and then you look down at your feet and

176
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,780
you realize you're a bug. Yeah. It's like, that's not like fun. It's kind of nothing to me.

177
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,260
All my dreams are like either stress related or anxiety related. And it's just like...

178
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,620
It's also, it's funny to me like to like be really into lucid dreaming when like,

179
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,820
like, like when you're asleep is like the one time and you don't have to think about everything,

180
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,860
anything at all. And you just be like, I have to control this and I have to create stories

181
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,940
every night. Dude, I used to be a big time fucking lucid dreaming brain hacker.

182
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,340
I've had weird dreams where it's like I know it's a dream and then I'm like, well,

183
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,540
I could just do this right now and they're all skateboarding related.

184
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,020
So like, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna land that trick that I thought of.

185
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,780
Just like shit like that. Like I landed a varial heel flip in a dream and I was like,

186
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm gonna do that tomorrow. You're in a dream and you're doing like a real trick. Like why not have

187
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:35,860
like a like a right jump I just like I feel like I'm not gonna lose man every

188
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,100
time I've like realized I was in a dream I didn't like control anything I just be

189
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,300
like damn this is a dream that's crazy it just keeps like everything just keeps

190
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,900
going yeah yeah yeah no nothing I tried to I tried to astral project when I was

191
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,240
in high school cuz I was - yeah I never a lot of drugs and also I heard sin bad

192
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,100
talk about it yeah Sinbad really into astral projection he claimed that he

193
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,120
went to China in the astral world that's not the same as lucid dreaming right

194
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,980
because I guess astral projection is people believe that you leave your

195
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,140
body and I never really believed it but I was like I mean might as well try

196
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,560
like whatever. Sinbad's doing it. Sinbad's like a normal guy right he wouldn't believe something crazy so I

197
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,240
like would just sit and I would just like sit up in my bed and try to fall

198
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,480
asleep while like sitting up and then like right before you fall asleep you

199
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,060
try to like grab something in front of you and he claimed that yeah he did that

200
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,960
one time and he put a rock on his bed and he like reached out grabbed the rock and

201
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,580
he was in like an astral world and then he's like I'm going to China and he flew

202
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:46,680
to China. Damn I know Ray Romano is really into lucid dreaming because of an

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,640
interview. That makes sense, he changes his voice to be normal in the dream. It's an interview on the Pete Holmes show that I saw in high

204
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
school.

205
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Awesome dude.

206
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Yeah.

207
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,760
He's like, "I love lucid dreaming."

208
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
So cool.

209
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,520
"I love getting away from my nagging wife."

210
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,800
I'm a bit of a psychonaut.

211
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I do like a lot of acid.

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I do a lot of...

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,360
Is this the guy from Bob's Burgers?

214
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,480
This isn't even Ray Romano.

215
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
That's all Ray Romano dude.

216
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
That's true.

217
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
That counts.

218
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Just hold your nose.

219
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
It's Ray Romano.

220
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Squidward is Ray Romano.

221
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Hey Spongebob, you gotta flip the burgers.

222
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840

223
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,720
Bob you got it flip the burgers come on come on Spongebob have you guys seen

224
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,200

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,480

228
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
From Monk.

229
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Yeah.

230
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
From Monk, yeah.

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah, a lot of this show is very Monk inspired.

232
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,960
Yeah, we do a lot of Monk shit.

233
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Yeah.

234
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,000
You know, I'm always smelling my hands and shit.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh, it's raining now.

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,640
Just a quick update for my friends.

238
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Thanks, man.

239
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640

240
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
I really appreciate that.

241
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Cool.

242
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
It's an update for Caleb.

243
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,400
Caleb, I'm supposed to deliver a shirt to you that John gave me.

244
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,880
And you're gonna not do it 'cause it's raining.

245
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Yeah, I'm not doing it 'cause it's raining.

246
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Yeah, no, that's fine.

247
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
I don't expect you to do that.

248
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I have the shirt right here.

249
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
I believe you.

250
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
You can tell me this at any time.

251
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,800
Yeah, this is not...

252
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,920
We were just on a phone call before this, and you're still showing me my future FUBU shirt.

253
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
It is cool.

254
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
Yeah.

255
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,540
It is really, really cool, and I'll look good in it.

256
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,720
Check right here, NBA logo on the sleeve.

257
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay.

258
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
All right.

259
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Yeah.

260
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Aren't you excited now?

261
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Yeah.

262
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
I mean, I've been excited.

263
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
I just don't know that this is the platform to talk about the shirt that you're giving

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
me.

265
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Well, I'm trying to...

266
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
For John.

267
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,920
how good of friends we are.

268
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,400
- You know, I was probably gonna post a photo

269
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,520
in that shirt at some point.

270
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,120
- Yeah, well now people are gonna get excited for sure.

271
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,000
- They've already gotten a spoiler about it

272
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,960
and you've kinda fucked up my entire plan.

273
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,480
- I didn't fuck up anything.

274
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I made, I drew up hype.

275
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,720
- Dude, the other day I bought like a pack of white t-shirts

276
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
and a pack of black t-shirts 'cause I was like,

277
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
I like looked in the mirror and I had on like a,

278
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,280
this like El Chapo shirt I got from a fucking like

279
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,600
flea market about like the drug dealer

280
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,880
and I was wearing like big ass shorts

281
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,260
and my like camel cigarettes, like windbreaker.

282
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,940
And I was like, I dress like a fucking cartoon character, dude.

283
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,520
I need to get like just some normal clothes.

284
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,460
- I dress like that.

285
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,220
- I'm like a grown man, I'm dressing like I'm a baby.

286
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,720
So now it's all gonna be white tees and black tees for me.

287
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,520
- I did that in high school.

288
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,400
I did the exact opposite. - And a propeller hat.

289
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,840
- When I got older, I started wearing more goofy shit.

290
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,200
This morning I was out to breakfast at a diner.

291
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,800
I was sitting at the counter and this old lady came in

292
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,680
and was sitting next to me, me and my girlfriend.

293
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,840
And she, near the end of our meal,

294
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,440
she turned to me and she asked what it said

295
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
on the back of my shirt,

296
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,920
'cause I'm wearing my cemetery shirt,

297
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,880
which says, "Come with me to hell"

298
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,120
in gothic letters, old English.

299
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,000
- Yeah. - You know?

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,320
And I was like, "Oh, it says, 'Come with me to hell.'

301
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
"It's the name of a song."

302
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,280
and she's like, she just like didn't care what it said.

303
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,720
And was just like, oh, see, that's interesting.

304
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,920
You know, I grew up in Switzerland

305
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
and I had to learn to read Gothic letters

306
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,080
when I was growing up.

307
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,920
(laughing)

308
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,680
I was like, oh really?

309
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,120
And she was like, yep, but not in school.

310
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,960
And I was like, okay.

311
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,100
And then she said, I bet COVID's really bad for bands.

312
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,320
Do you play instruments?

313
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
And I said, nope, I'm just wearing a band shirt.

314
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,080
And then she stopped talking to me.

315
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,560
I hate old ladies with a past, dude.

316
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,200
I don't give a fuck, dude.

317
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,120
I don't give a fuck that you used to fucking eat canned fucking piss in the depression.

318
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Shut up, dude.

319
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
You grew up in Switzerland?

320
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Well, you're in Watertown now, so fuck you.

321
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,240
Yeah, that's a true town.

322
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
The town, baby!

323
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
The town from the town!

324
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,920
That's right, Watertown Strong, baby.

325
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Yeah!

326
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Suck my balls, you old bitch.

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I don't give a fuck about where you're from.

328
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,920
It's about what block you're from in Watertown.

329
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,440
How about you start spitting that cross address, because I'm going to fucking kill you.

330
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,320
Old people, I mean we've talked about, let's not get back into this.

331
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,760
I mean let's do it, why not?

332
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
We've talked about how much I don't like old people.

333
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
No, you know what?

334
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
They haven't had enough.

335
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,720
Listen up you old pieces of shit.

336
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
Hey, old people.

337
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Nobody can't, listen, World War I and II, I don't think either of them happened, and

338
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
I think you're lying.

339
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,880
Yeah, I'm happy when you get senile because it means I don't have to listen to your dumb

340
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,600
stories anymore you just walk around going "blah blah blah"

341
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I get to take stuff from your purse now. You don't get to hide that candy from me.

342
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,640
Huh? I'm taking, you know what? I'm taking two Werther's Originals.

343
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,560
Here's what I do. I go to the Dollar Tree, I buy every single bag of Werther's they have

344
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,120
just to fucking make poor old people, their life a little bit worse.

345
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,600
And then I scatter them on the ground outside the senior center so that they trip and slip

346
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,240
around. I melt them all down, I make a sculpture of

347
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,860
a middle finger and I put it in the middle of the old people's home and I flip off all

348
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,720
those old people with my big Werther's Originals middle finger.

349
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Old people are scary man.

350
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,640
The last time I saw my great grandpa, it was before he died, he was like staying at a nursing

351
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,480
home and he just like wouldn't say anything, he was just like completely catatonic and

352
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,120
we were like, "How you doing there, Papa?"

353
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
And he was just like, "Get me out of here."

354
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,560
That was the last thing he ever said to me.

355
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,680
oh my god it was like me and my brothers trying to like come visit like cheer him

356
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:43,840
up we knew he's sick and we were all like oh oh pop funny yeah yeah yeah yeah

357
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:50,400
and then like going back to my mom she's like what did he say he's loving it

358
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,200
He said I get his car. He said take me to McDonald's please and I'll come right

359
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,200
back cuz I love it. He said this bed is so comfortable. He said they don't hit me

360
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,600
with socks filled with oranges. Yeah there was a yeah and I think he also said I'm

361
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:17,120
in jail. Yeah no it was a bad day. Yeah. He was one of those guys who like the last

362
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,000
three years of his life he just ate every day at the same Chinese restaurant.

363
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,860
and if he could like days that he couldn't eat there he was like

364
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,900
noticeably like depressed yeah and also he would go and he would just get he

365
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,060
would get like plain chicken and white rice nice so cool dude yeah he's a

366
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,580
fucking man dude yeah do the white rice at the Chinese restaurant don't you

367
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:48,740
don't you dare say that it's delicious don't you dare say that it's like a

368
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,580
- Don't.

369
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,820
- Oh man, the white rice, best thing at the Chinese restaurant.

370
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,300
- I wish they'd lay off the spice a little bit though.

371
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,300
- Yeah, I wish restaurants stopped using seasoning.

372
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,100
- Yeah.

373
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,920
- I really do.

374
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,060
- I know, it's like they're slathering on the salt on there

375
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,780
and it's like I'm gonna have to rinse my mouth out

376
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,180
after I eat this, it's so spicy.

377
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,100
- Just white, all white rice, plain chicken.

378
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,540
- Yep, white bread, ice cubes.

379
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:22,060
tin foil, no nothing like salmon, raw spaghetti.

380
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,660
Even if there is any kind of fish, no salmon.

381
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,500
Yup.

382
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,320
Yeah, I will say--

383
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,700
Just the bones, just the fish bones.

384
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,100
I do agree that every time I go to the Chinese restaurant,

385
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,700
it low-key feels like I'm doing the white rice challenge.

386
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,040
Yeah.

387
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,980
Dude, I keep ordering from this one Indian place

388
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,260
and I keep forgetting that, like the meal that I will order.

389
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,780
Like I'm like trying new things on the menu.

390
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,940
I tried chicken dildo last night.

391
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah, I bet you did.

392
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
It was really good.

393
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,820
Chick-a-dilder in your ass.

394
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Chicken dilder.

395
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
It's...

396
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
Chicken...

397
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
I hope that's how it's pronounced.

398
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
Chicken dilder.

399
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,820
Oh, it...

400
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
Well, okay, hold on.

401
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,500
It'd be funny if you Googled "chicken dilder" and it was like zero results.

402
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,180
Yeah, every time I look up "chicken dilder" it just says "chicken and pineapple curry,"

403
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,660
so I guess maybe I could have just called it that.

404
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,020
I hate when they be putting that pineapple in that shit.

405
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Oh, dude, it was so good.

406
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,200
Dude, I don't want no hot pineapple.

407
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,200
It was good.

408
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,240
You just ate the desert?

409
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,280
It was really good, but I keep forgetting that it comes with white rice.

410
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,000
So for the first two weeks I was living here, me and Joe would both order from it and then

411
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,360
also forget.

412
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,280
And for the first two weeks I was here, our fridge was just full of boxes of white rice.

413
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,240
When you get to takeout, they hit you with the big-ass fucking white rice.

414
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Yeah.

415
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,320
Big boxes of white, like, we had no room

416
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,860
on the top shelf of the fridge for two weeks

417
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,760
'cause it was all white rice.

418
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,680
- Yeah, here's what they should do.

419
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,560
Chinese places, if you're listening.

420
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,320
Stop giving me that white rice, fill up that takeout box

421
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,300
with more fortune cookies, bro.

422
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,880
- Oh man, do fortune-- - I'm fuckin--

423
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,800
- Fortune cookies are so, like, so good.

424
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,920
- It's one of the best cookies in the universe

425
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,820
and I don't know-- - What is the flavor of it?

426
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,800
- It's paper, that's the thing that you like about it.

427
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,980
- Maybe that's the thing that makes it so good,

428
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,700
is the paper. No, it tastes like destiny dude. You don't know. It's so beautiful. It's not

429
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,420
too sweet. What do you mean I don't know? You think I didn't try a fortune cookie before?

430
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:26,380
You've never had one dude. You're not adventurous like me. I'm trying all sorts of ethnic foods

431
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,940
like fortune cookies almost every single day. I'm going around doing like a Andrew Zimmer.

432
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,300
I'm ordering fortune cookies from Indian restaurants. I'm ordering them from...

433
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,620
A kind of bizarre foods world tour where I try fortune cookies. I tried cookies from

434
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,020
every culture. This one tastes really, this one tastes slightly of lemon and

435
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,780
actually has a very neat fortune in it. I am trying the Chips Ahoy from

436
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,740
every continent. Did they do, did they do the lottery numbers in other countries

437
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,220
fortune cookies? I don't think, I don't know. That's a very

438
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,020
funny thing to put in a fortune cookie. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. I like that they

439
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,740
do that. What, what is the, what's the flavor that

440
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:11,380
makes fortune cookies taste like fortune? It's lemon dude. Is it lemon? Hint of

441
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:17,380
lemon. I don't know. Let me look up. It's lime dude. It's a hint. It's actually a hint of lime.

442
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,060
Oh, it's a sugar. It's tahini. It's the tahini and the other stuff that they're pouring on top

443
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,900
of the fortune cookie. Also, who are these beautiful women who fold these things? I want to see them so

444
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:34,660
bad. Yeah. These are hand folded. A machine couldn't do that. That's a craftsmanship. My high school...

445
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,180
- Vanilla and sesame oil.

446
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,720
- My high school, the Chinese class,

447
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,520
the Chinese language class,

448
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,500
they would take a field trip every year

449
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,340
to a Chinese restaurant and make fortune cookies.

450
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,180
- Oh.

451
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,020
- But I did not take Chinese, so I did not get some.

452
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,920
- You ever have to make so incredible.

453
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
- Yeah, from what I heard, it was pretty stressful,

454
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,160
'cause it's kinda like--

455
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,720
- Also, you gotta come up with a fortune, dude.

456
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,280
- Yeah, like making food in a restaurant.

457
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,120
- Right.

458
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,440
- It's like maybe not the best field trip.

459
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,560
- Yeah, free labor, yeah, it sucks.

460
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,540
We're going on a field trip to my restaurant

461
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,540
and you will work there doing math with the food.

462
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,920
That was my math class in eighth grade.

463
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
Did I ever tell you about this?

464
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
I probably have.

465
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,920
In the eighth grade, I got put into a math class

466
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,240
of four kids 'cause we all had ADHD.

467
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
That means you're either the smartest

468
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,080
or the stupidest in the entire school.

469
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
It was 'cause we were the stupidest

470
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,720
and all we would do was cook and it would be like,

471
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,500
okay, well, you could put this many teaspoons

472
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,920
or whatever into this.

473
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,620
It was like, every Friday, we would make food

474
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,300
with the Home Ec teacher.

475
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,140
- They're teaching you how to use a measuring cup?

476
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,660
That was an entire math class?

477
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,940
- Pretty much, 'cause they were like,

478
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,860
oh, they're all just gonna be line cooks in the future.

479
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,700
Like, just shit like that.

480
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,620
- That's fucking incredible, dude.

481
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,740
- Oh, dude, it was the best math class I was ever in.

482
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,940
- Yeah, we had very different--

483
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,820
- We made the worst, the worst thing we ever made

484
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,860
in that class was the teacher was like,

485
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,460
okay, we're gonna make this recipe.

486
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,900
It's a tortilla and you spray it with Pam cooking oil and you put cinnamon sugar on it.

487
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
[Laughter]

488
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I forget what it was!

489
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,900
That that was supposed to be... I think it was supposed to be churros. I don't know!

490
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,900
[Laughter]

491
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,900
We literally like spent a whole class spraying tortillas with like Pam and like putting brown shit like just cinnamon sugar on it.

492
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,900
It was like one of the best fucking days in that math class. It was just like, "Ah, this is sick."

493
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:36,260
My math class at my like right-wing homeschool thing was like, it was all like libertarian

494
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,340
like economics like we never did like real math so we had like a three-week chunk just

495
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,100
on the national debt and we all had to like come up with ways to get rid of the national

496
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,840
debt and one kid was like cut everything except the military that the United States spends

497
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
its budget on.

498
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,900
I was like dude that kid's a fucking genius.

499
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Yeah, smart.

500
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,900
It would work.

501
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
He's got it dialed.

502
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,500
also had a debate class where we had to do we had to debate for and against

503
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:16,260
slavery what we the proslavery team won and I was the leader we weren't able to

504
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,700
choose what side we were on we're supposed to be doing the Lincoln

505
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,780
Douglas debates which usually people in class in like high school do that format

506
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,020
but they don't do the actual Lincoln Douglas debate we did the same topic

507
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,140
except more narrow and just on slavery. Me and my friend were in the

508
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:37,500
same English class where we had like a we did like a debate style thing like

509
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,420
that or maybe it was like a social studies class I don't know it was like

510
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,900
it but the debate was something about was something about like like just racial

511
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,300
discrimination or slavery or something and me and my friend would do this thing

512
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,340
where we would just like sit on other other opposite sides of the room for

513
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,060
each other and just really loudly argue like during the debate just to like try

514
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,620
like just to like be loud and annoying like this yell back and forth but then it would like make

515
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:07,180
other people's in the rooms energy like rise too and like we were doing it one time and this girl

516
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,500
was like this girl like we were like you know like yelling at each other and this girl was like

517
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:18,140
well you know i can actually kind of see like why why um people might have been discriminating

518
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:25,260
against black people back then we're like what the fuck jesus christ yeah we never did it again

519
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:31,740
Yeah, the worst part about our slavery debate was that it was judged by like five parents from the like homeschool thing. Oh, no

520
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,780
And it was unanimous that the that the pro-slavery

521
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:42,060
Team won and when they were like giving their decision they were like they just made better points. There's no way around it. They were more logical

522
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,220
That's fucking crazy, dude. I wish I had gotten into debate team, dude

523
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,980
Yeah, i'm glad I didn't I wish I'd gotten on like a fucking debate team's a very funny thing to get into because it doesn't

524
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,100
It's not going to help you with an argument in real life.

525
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,980
Like it's going to lose you an argument in real life.

526
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,620
That is the most sociopathic thing you can get into in high school.

527
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,460
That's why like there is a like you're like that somebody wants to be like a politician

528
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,740
or something like if you're like a teenager and you want to be a politician or like your

529
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,220
dream is like I want to be the president it's like you are a fucking psycho fuck you.

530
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,580
That is a psycho thing.

531
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,740
You should luck into the presidency.

532
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,860
No I'm going to become the president pretty soon.

533
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,340
You can decide that at 23, 24.

534
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,740
Yeah, but if you're like 15 and you're like, "I'm gonna be the president," that's...

535
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,980
If you're 15 and your goal is power...

536
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,500
There's an age window.

537
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,980
If you're in elementary school or middle school, it's okay to want to be the president.

538
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,540
But once you're in high school...

539
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,660
That's a big dream.

540
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,340
Once you're in high school, yeah, you can't...

541
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,180
That's the cutoff for the sociopath.

542
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,820
The 17-year-old who wants to be a president is like, "Well, I have a plan.

543
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm gonna work my way up to selectman."

544
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:49,820
That kid is gonna kill someone.

545
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,100
That's a fucking murderer.

546
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,040
Okay, the thing is though that I will debate either of you right now on any topic

547
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,760
And what about the top 10 most common lies people tell you can give me any position and I will win

548
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,620
You choose go ahead. Okay. What about number one the top 10 most common lie. I'm fine

549
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,280
What do you?

550
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,960
Before before we get into the list actually do you want to debate Caleb on something?

551
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,780
No, I would like to debate Caleb on whether or not he is as tiny as a bug

552
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,140
I would like Caleb to argue that he is that tiny.

553
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,980
You can go first.

554
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,900
I'd like you to speak for about five minutes on this

555
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,820
and then I may or may not provide a rebuttal.

556
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,660
- Of course.

557
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,760
So basically I'm obviously as small as a bug

558
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,820
due to my tiny size.

559
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,300
You can see it on the camera right now.

560
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,500
I'm as small as maybe an ant or maybe an ant's child even

561
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,820
because I'm even smaller than an ant.

562
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,020
I think that a toothpick is a flagpole

563
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,540
and I think that a gumdrop is a house to me

564
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,740
because of how large it appears in stature

565
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:55,780
to my tiny body. I'm less than an inch tall. I smell really bad and because I was hiding

566
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,460
in a man's ass, which I can do because of my smallness, or it was actually a girl's ass.

567
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,460
I changed my mind. And then also I have to fight different bugs in my house. We've been over that.

568
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,460
And I'm really one inch tall or smaller. I yield my time to my opponent.

569
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:20,460
Yes, I concede the debate and request a copy of the recording of the debate.

570
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,420
The copy has actually been destroyed.

571
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,420
That's not true.

572
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
And the original.

573
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:29,500
Okay, well, you look at it, there's no evidence that you won the debate then.

574
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,700
Well, I guess I'll...

575
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,780
Okay, I guess I'll do it again.

576
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:40,620
So basically to me, a piece of gum is like a surfboard because of how small I am, and

577
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,260
I like to ride it around in the sink.

578
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,820
The bathtub to me is bigger than the entire ocean combined, and I live in a tiny hole

579
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
in my wall.

580
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Okay.

581
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,460
I'd like to ask Caleb some questions about borrowing.

582
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,500
Yes, go ahead.

583
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,460
Do you borrow things from the house that you live in?

584
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
Yes.

585
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,980
No further questions.

586
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,500
Sometimes I'll borrow like a grain of rice, but it's too big for me to eat, so I drive

587
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
it like a car because of how small I am.

588
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,180
And you might be asking yourself, how do you drive a grain of rice or a car that doesn't

589
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
have any wheels?

590
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:22,300
Well, the wheels that I use are actually nerds, the candy, and I put those on there and I drive

591
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
around.

592
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Okay.

593
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,500
Guilty, I sentence you to one year in Lego jail.

594
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Okay.

595
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
We can do this now.

596
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Lego jail?

597
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Oh, fuck.

598
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:40,060
All right, so number one, the most common lie is I'm fine, but shit, that's so real.

599
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
That is real.

600
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,580
lowkey that's true.

601
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,060
Well I mean not that you guys would know anything about this because you're not dark and demented

602
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
like me and have-

603
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,660
What are you talking- I have the most pain out of anyone here.

604
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Um.

605
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Ow!

606
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Oh!

607
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
No, no I have-

608
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
I have pain!

609
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,900
I have mental pain that you could-

610
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,660
Oh my head is hurting with all my thoughts!

611
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,940
If you guys could see a list of my mental pains your draw would drop.

612
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,940
I think that there's three people besides me in this call right now because I'm so crazy.

613
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
It's not about crazy, it's about mental pain.

614
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,940
What and it hurts to think about.

615
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,460
You're crazy that means you don't feel pain.

616
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
Yeah.

617
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,380
Look, I have mental pain, ask me a math question.

618
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
Okay.

619
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,380
Yeah.

620
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,260
How many people are in this call right now?

621
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,940
Oh, my head already.

622
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,580
That's not mental, it's physical.

623
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,700
Oh, I'm so anguished mentally and emotionally too, but I'm fine.

624
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,580
I suffer, I'm a sucker for pain.

625
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,460
I'm a suffer for pain.

626
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,340
That's like double worse.

627
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,300
Here's a comment here.

628
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,860
Honestly this is true most of the time people say I'm fine when they really

629
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,140
aren't I've actually told this lie before when I broke my foot in PE it hurt a lot

630
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,420
so I was hobbling around all day repeating I'll be fine to everyone that

631
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,620
asked nobody believed me I always say I'm fine when I'm sad or something I try not

632
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,140
to show weakness to not cry to accomplish this I cover my face just in

633
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,980
case I do then pinch myself or something getting an obvious like physical injury

634
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,860
yeah and then they're like oh my god you need to go the hospital I'm fine yeah

635
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,260
Seriously, don't look at me, I'm fine.

636
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,260
That's how I was like a month ago when I hurt my leg.

637
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,260
You were not, you were not.

638
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,260
You love talking about that shit.

639
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
You did not say you were fine once.

640
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I said I was fine to the guy.

641
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,060
To the guy that I was like, can you help me land this trick?

642
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
I said like, I'm fine, whatever.

643
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,060
And then you set off on a months long campaign of not being fine.

644
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,060
To tell the entire world about your weird leg.

645
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Yeah.

646
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,660
Well yeah, I mean that was the most pain I was in for a pretty long while.

647
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,140
No matter how many people ask me if I'm okay, the answer will always be I'm fine, even though

648
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,740
I might be depressed as hell.

649
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,820
But it's better than people thinking pity of me, depressed teenager.

650
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,580
Damn, that's from a depressed teenager.

651
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,720
They signed it depressed teenager.

652
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,780
Even when I'm hurt, angry, sad, etc.

653
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,460
I still say I'm perfectly fine.

00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460

Yeah.

660
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,620
There's a comment here, we haven't read any of the stories on this list, but there's a

661
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,540
comment from Sloth21 that says, "The stories on this list are horrible."

662
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,620
It's da truth.

663
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,100
Rachel did it to me today.

664
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Rachel?

665
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Dude.

666
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
Rachel?

667
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,180
When I think about Rachel, it low-key breaks my heart.

668
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,220
Rachel, you gotta talk to people, Rachel.

669
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,580
Rachel, you need someone to talk to.

670
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,860
Your issues are mad piling up.

671
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,580
We got a hotline for you.

672
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580

674
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,580
You gotta call that.

675
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,980
Drake wrote a song about it.

676
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,660
No.

677
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
Really powerful song.

678
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
Do you think he's going to...

679
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
There's a way...

680
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Sorry, I just read an insane comment.

681
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Say what you'd say.

682
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,660
Yeah, wait, can I read this?

683
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Yeah.

684
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Find that same one.

685
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:59,020
Recently, my parents got divorced.

686
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,540
My dad killed my brothers and I have to live with my friend.

687
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,260
I have only two more days here, then I'm on the streets.

688
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,060
I have two friends and one that tries to make me feel okay.

689
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,580
I have tried taking my life four times before and I'm only twelve.

690
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,580
I feel hopeless.

691
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,900
I just want to end it, but how do I without upsetting my only true friend?

692
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,140
She actually cares about me.

693
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,260
I have a knife that looks like it would do the job of finishing me, but I'm not one of

694
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,260
your friend's friends, so if I go, she will too.

695
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
That's horrible.

696
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,060
I think it's cool, it's mad cool to be depressed.

697
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,380
Here's a comment I found from user Lucky's that says Bart Simpson.

698
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:36,180
That's true, Bart Simpson always do behind the scene with a smile.

699
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,820
He was low key depressed as hell.

700
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Yeah.

701
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
Kind of like me too.

702
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
V-Lone Bart.

703
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Yeah.

704
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,580
I try to, you know, I don't know man, I'm just, I get down, you know.

705
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Yeah.

706
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,020
Yeah, I get down.

707
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,300
I just need a bad bitch by my side though.

708
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
True.

709
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,340
a bad bitch to stick by me when I'm depressing. Sit in my car in hot box my armpits melt.

710
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,100
If you really want to know how I feel you gotta listen to Depression and Anxiety by the boy

711
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:07,300
boy west coast. Yeah. You have to listen to the song Caleb's Mental Anguish by B-Lack.

712
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:13,140
He's lowkey fire though. He's waiting to get signed. Yeah he's the only thing keeping me

713
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,540
alive right now. His music is like fire. This guy B-Lack whose raps are off the chain. I

714
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,980
I don't know, do you like rap? Do you like store corps? He's like the most insane store corps rapper right now.

715
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,540
He'd be rapping about the store all the time and shit.

716
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,580
And also he's mad depressed, Loki.

717
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,300
Yeah, V-Lack's the most depressed rapper I've ever heard of.

718
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,340
He truly is. He's so depressed.

719
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,420
He sampled the sound of his tears hitting the linoleum at the grocery store.

720
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,100
He said, "Clean up." He has this song, "Clean Up On Aisle My Heart."

721
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
It's so sad.

722
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,660
It's insanely sad.

723
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,660
It tells a story too. That's the thing about him.

724
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,660
He's a storyteller at heart.

725
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,660
You know, it's none of this stuff about

726
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,660
about jewelry or guns.

727
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
I mean besides "I'm so sad

728
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660
I don't have jewelry or guns"

729
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660
[laughter]

730
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
But you know, other than that

731
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
it's lyrical content.

732
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
It's about stories and poetry mostly.

733
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,660
He like low-key changed my entire

734
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,660
life. Too bad he got assassinated when he was

735
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,180
years old. It's one of the saddest stories in all of rap. Yeah. Is that he was the

736
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,960
most depressed eight-year-old in the world and then and that's why they killed

737
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,260
him low-key. He was about to make a documentary about depression and they

738
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:35,460
killed his ass. Yeah. They couldn't let the truth come out. Yeah and he was he was also

739
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:43,060
yeah he was in this big beef with Happy Guy the Rapper. Yeah. And if you listen to

740
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:49,940
if you listen happy guy the rapper's track smiling all the time you know there's a lot of subliminals

741
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,420
in there yeah i mean and i mean i don't even know why he never got convicted or anything

742
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,500
from that song i'm so happy i just killed a little boy named b-black

743
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,140
it's really fun it's one of the most [ __ ] up stories yeah and there's no lyrics either he's

744
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,340
just you can be like i'm smiling on the microphone but it would just make

745
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,180
B-Lack Stip. B-Lack Stip. B-Lack Stip was like low-key. He was real though. He was twisted,

746
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,580
he was tortured, he spoke to the soul of the people, you know. Yeah, the heartbeat of the

747
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:29,300
streets I would say too. Yep, and he was addicted to perfume and that was a big part of it too

748
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:37,220
actually. He was so addicted to drinking perfume that it would, I mean it's like low-key like he

749
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,820
He got sober right before he died and his raps absolutely fell off.

750
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,900
It was like, it was like maybe this.

751
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,060
It's chilling too because some of his lyrics you'll hear, I mean there's that one in that

752
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,980
and that one song I'm so sad where he says damn this perfume might kill me.

753
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Yeah.

754
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,300
And it's like damn he could kind of see the future in a way.

755
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,260
It's damn this perfume might kill me, fuck it one more spritz.

756
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,220
Yeah and then yeah there's that other song where he says fuck it I'm not even gonna make

757
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,980
it to nine and it's like damn like that's real shit.

758
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,820
Yeah, it's real shit.

759
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,940
He kinda knew it was coming.

760
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,860
Yeah, and remember that one line where he's like,

761
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,340
he's like, "Yo, past the Vogue,

762
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,780
"I'm flippin' to the cardboard page, I'm goin' rogue."

763
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,620
Remember that one?

764
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,020
Yeah, that line where he says,

765
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,440
"I hide all my pain behind my mask.

766
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,020
"Every night I drink a bottle of Axe."

767
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,140
Yeah.

768
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,340
That was deep. That went crazy, dude.

769
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,180
Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,540
Yeah.

771
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,860
That boy was on another level.

772
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,700
Rest in peace.

773
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,060
And I do mean boy, he was eight years old again.

774
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,020
I would like to clarify. He's one of the most tortured eight-year-olds.

775
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
V-Lack Stip.

776
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:45,660
Yeah, they ran up on him while he was in a Maybach that was powered by a battery and it

777
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,220
was about eight pounds. He was riding it in his backyard.

778
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,860
Are we even doing the list anymore?

779
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,660
You guys remember his merch drop where he released a handkerchief that was labeled "For

780
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
My Tears"?

781
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,660
That was insane dude. That was fucking crazy to me bro.

782
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:13,340
Yeah. Anyway, on that note, number two lie, common lie people tell is I have read and agreed to the

783
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:23,340
above terms and conditions. I do that shit. Yeah, I mean, if I see one of those I click no,

784
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,580
I don't agree because I'm not reading that shit. I never agree. I never agree to your terms and

785
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,740
and conditions. I just won't use iTunes. I don't even care.

786
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,580
They should seriously do a South Park about this.

787
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
True. True.

788
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,580
I don't have all day to read 15 pages in size 8 font for nothing.

789
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,980
What about your future, bud?

790
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,980
My mom forces me to read these, even if they're over 10 pages long.

791
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,780
Your mom forcing you to read the terms and conditions.

792
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,040
and it's two pages long, I actually read this.

793
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,920
Dude, I wouldn't read it if it was a sentence long

794
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,640
and it said, "I'll kill you."

795
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,260
I wouldn't fucking, there's no way I'm reading that shit.

796
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,820
- You signed, "If you agree to this term and condition,

797
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,980
"I'll kill you."

798
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,820
- Yeah.

799
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,960
- Hey, fuck it, dude.

800
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,560
- You guys ever, did you guys ever,

801
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,980
I remember somebody in like elementary school or something,

802
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,400
like when I was first like,

803
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,820
when I was first like getting music

804
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,060
and so I like downloaded iTunes and stuff

805
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,620
and you have to like read the terms and conditions.

806
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,940
I think one of my friends told me like,

807
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,080
"You know like, if you actually read it,

808
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,920
there's a part in there that like they can use your computer to launch a nuclear missile

809
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,960
if you agree to it.

810
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
That's true actually.

811
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
It actually is in there.

812
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Is that true?

813
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Yeah.

814
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Holy shit.

815
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
You didn't read, well I read the iTunes one.

816
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Yeah.

817
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,080
You know, you gotta read that one.

818
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,320
True, that's true, yeah.

819
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,640
The iTunes one is the most important one to read because you get a voucher for one free

820
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
song.

821
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640

I got ADHD. I forget

884
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,400

00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,400
Yeah? Why?

888
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,960

889
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,680
You want me to forget my pain?

00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,480

893
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,200
Oh my god, Cameron, that's such a beautiful thing to say.

894
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,960
Can I tell you a poem to you about you?

895
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,880
You're so beautiful, you look like a rose.

896
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,740
You're so beautiful, the smell from you comes to my nose.

897
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,920
It smells so good, it smells so nice.

898
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,320
You're as beautiful as a sculpture made from out of ice.

899
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,520
I will go ice skating together on a rink.

900
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,320
That will be quite fun I think.

901
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:35,760
I would like to end the poem.

902
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,120
If there was a good line to end it, I don't know it.

903
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Oh my fucking god dude.

904
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,680
You're making him cry.

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,400
You're actually making him cry.

906
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,640
Okay take it back.

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,920
You're such a baby dude.

00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,480
You don't stop crying all the time.

909
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,840
You lowkey should have collabed with B-Lack when he was still alive.

910
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,080

Remember that shit about watching Anchorman?

918
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,680
Yeah, yeah more rappers like him should rap about shit that I care about, you know, exactly. Yeah

919
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,240
Like there's a serious gap in the market in the hip-hop market right now

920
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,880
The market yeah with all this kind of

921
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,520
Cool shit that i'm into you know

922
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,740
You guys you remember when he was like I went to the restaurant and I ate some shawarma

923
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,720
My brain's so fucked up about the world and big pharma

924
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,920
Damn, because he was low-key conscious and shit.

925
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,240
Yeah, he was like a society-based rapper.

926
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:53,740
Yeah.

927
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,680
I just remember, yeah, there was lots of stuff like that.

928
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,320
You know, "My house is so awesome because I am the resident.

929
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,720
I hate this stupid imperialist president."

930
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,520
Was that the word you used?

931
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,320
Yeah, and it was like, damn, for there to be a rapper that could actually know about imperialism

932
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,080
and shit, that's like low-key insane.

933
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,160
And do you remember the name of the song was "This song could be about any of the presidents."

934
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,480
Whoa, yeah, that was insane. Yeah, he said that one line that was like I'm eight years old. No lies

935
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,120
I can tell I only drink perfume because of the smell. Yeah, it was insane. Yeah, he went that was from his song

936
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,240
My name is be like where he explained this whole deal. Yeah, that was like the first, you know, yeah

937
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,080
I was like when he came out on the scene

938
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah, that was like the opening bars of that song too, which were so hard when he was like I am so sad

939
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,880
I feel so bad

940
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,960
Yeah, I was like

941
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,000
Second of all, I feel that, like I feel that in my bones,

942
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,840
you know what I mean?

943
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,680
Yeah.

944
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,480
And I remember going to Target the next day

945
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,320
and there was just like,

946
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,240
there wasn't like a single bottle of Chanel blue

947
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,380
on the shelf 'cause it was like,

948
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,680
he low-key had like blown up the entire industry.

949
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,280
And people were drinking,

950
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,380
people were going to Marshalls

951
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,080
and taking those curves samplers

952
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,040
and drinking all the curves perfume.

953
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,200
Yeah, it was insane, dude.

954
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,040
(laughing)

955
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,560
It was insane as hell, dude.

956
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,480
It was insane.

957
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,800
Yeah, remember all the people,

958
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,120
all those like those fake B-Lack fans that were drinking bod body spray.

959
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,680
Yeah it's like that's body spray low-key that's not perfume.

960
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,920
I mean some of them and some people were even like they were drinking shampoo.

961
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,960
Yeah it's like how's that anything to do with what he's doing?

962
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,080
When B-Lack got that Axe sponsorship I mean like a lot of people did like tell him he

963
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:40,000
sold out which is probably one of the reasons that you know he kind of you know maybe that

964
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,560
led maybe that led to some darker stuff. Yeah.

965
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,200
There's the eight-year-old rapper. Remember that line where it was like, "Take the adidas,

966
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,080
mix it with the Sprite, I'll be home soon. No matter how much Sprite I put in the cup,

967
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:59,840
it still tastes like perfume." I heard that and I was like, "He low-key doesn't even care how

968
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,960
bad it tastes because he's so addicted to that shit and he's insane on it."

969
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,760
And that was when I really started to think about addiction more clearly.

970
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,200
He's the reason I got sober as a gopher.

971
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,200
Yeah, for sure, yeah.

972
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,200
That was, he was crazy.

973
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
Number seven, don't worry, it will be okay.

974
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Like I hate to bring this back to beelike and shit, but like...

975
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,200
That's a good point.

976
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,200
But like that's word for word, word for word, the words from his song.

977
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Word? Yeah.

978
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,200
I mean, do you guys remember his lyric where he was like,

979
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,200
"Rollin' so deep, fucked up off this perfume,

980
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,080
I have a feeling that it might be my doom.

981
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,580
Yeah, and I was like, oh dude, remember that one that was like,

982
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:49,840
I've got perfume on my heart, you know it's never hate.

983
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,800
I do think I will be murdered before I turn eight.

984
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,940
That was like, it was like, this guy, kid,

985
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,000
can actually like almost tell the future and shit.

986
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,840
Yeah.

987
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,840
It's fucking insane to me.

988
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,480
Do you remember when he was like,

989
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,880
when he had that chain?

990
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,040
Do you remember his chain with the,

991
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,280
he had a Peppa Pig chain?

992
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,400
Thought that was really stylish.

993
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,240
- That was nuts, dude.

994
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,760
- I mean, it really changed the game.

995
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,880
- Remember when he ate a crayon?

996
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,200
- Yeah, he would eat a crayon.

997
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,400
Yeah, and I remember he was like one of the first,

998
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,000
like, not only about depression,

999
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,920
but he was one of the first rappers to come out

1000
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,280
and really be honest about wetting the bed and shit.

1001
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,120
- Yeah.

1002
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,600
- And he was like, yeah, low-key,

1003
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,480
like I sleep with a liner on my bed.

1004
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,160
But you know I'm an all-timer off the head because he was such an insane freestyle rapper.

1005
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,320
Yeah, he would only freestyle in every interview.

1006
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,320
He wouldn't talk.

1007
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:51,200
He was like, you remember when he was like, "This perfume might be the end of me.

1008
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,880
It's like venom from a viper.

1009
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,240
When I go to bed, I have to wear a damn diaper."

1010
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,920
Yeah, that was insane.

1011
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,760
And nobody could tell if it was because he was sad or because he was eight years old

1012
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
or what.

1013
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,800
line where he's like like you know you know this perfume is what my cup gonna

1014
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:15,640
be full up every night I wet my damn pull up yep remember when he was like he was

1015
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,800
like um like I'm the star player these other rappers bench guys hit the

1016
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,000
restaurant order the smiley face French fries.

1017
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:33,920
And he was like, "Whoa, he actually knows about sports."

1018
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,720
When he was like, "When I'm feeling sad, I just cry the pain away.

1019
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,440
I will die at age 8, 26, June, Friday."

1020
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:45,440
It was impressive, dude.

1021
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,840
Number eight, "I am sick."

1022
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
Another another be like

1023
00:53:49,840 --> 00:54:00,440
Another one he's like he's like when he was like damn all this perfume is making me so sick at least I can stay home from

1024
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,440
third grade and watch click

1025
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,000
You know what a funny thing about click the first movie I ever cried yeah

1026
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,140
Yeah, dude when he's like walking through the rain, and he's crying and he's like falling over and he's got cancer and shit

1027
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,700
I was like, "Wait, I know people with cancer.

1028
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:18,700
What the hell?"

1029
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,700
I'm gonna cry.

1030
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,060
I was at Chicken Pox.

1031
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:29,100
I saw a click last day of third grade and my brother hit somebody's car next to us and

1032
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,620
they freaked, like he opened the door and dinged it and then she came in and like started

1033
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:36,100
crying.

1034
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,900
I don't remember why, but she was like telling us it was like a show car and she like knew

1035
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:51,100
like yeah and you tried to rewind her yeah I wish I had the remote to rewind that

1036
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:56,100
damn story if you had the click remote what would you do in your life I would

1037
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,700
fucking rewind time so that I could go back in time and save be lack from

1038
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,780
getting hit by that stray bullet I would low-key change the channel to Fox and

1039
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:12,020
just watch the Simpsons cuz I get to be in their world and they would might think

1040
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,260
I'm pretty cool since I look different from them they might like me or they

1041
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,740
might you know sacrifice me or something yeah different I see if I had the click

1042
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,060
remote I would rewind time all the way back so that I go watch the first

1043
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:29,060
episode of SNL live a hundred percent cuz I'm such a comedy fan that's what I

1044
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,660
would have done and then I would have fast-forwarded and been like I've seen

1045
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:38,100
it I saw it live I saw it live I saw the Muppet show I saw the Coosbane sketch

1046
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:46,340
I probably would fast-forward you guys a lot yeah really yeah I just skip around

1047
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,300
a little bit just see who dies first I would press if I had the click remote I

1048
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:56,460
would press the open disk tray button just to see what happens it's in the

1049
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:03,940
middle of the ocean just like yeah dude it's a giant DVD that would be so cool

1050
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,700
It's like the biggest DVD and it just says like something jackass to you

1051
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,860
Something I was obsessed with like a few weeks ago

1052
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,340
It's just imagining that like like archaeologists like just find like an a thousand year old DVD

1053
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:23,660
They find out that like cavemen like had DVDs back then they just didn't have like DVD players

1054
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:28,500
But that would be even cooler if it was like a giant did they like we're digging in a cave and they like unearthed

1055
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,140
It's like a huge like a hundred foot DVD. Yeah

1056
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:36,660
They find like a caveman stand-up DVD called a no-collar comedy tour

1057
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:47,780
And he holds a rock in his hand

1058
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:53,600
Yeah, yeah, there's like there's like a Gallagher type guy who's trying to smash a rock with another

1059
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,020
Well, yeah, I mean you guys heard what happened at Louis BC, right

1060
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:06,020
*laughter*

1061
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Yeah, he accidentally dropped his loincloth.

1062
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,020
*laughter*

1063
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Oh...

1064
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,020
Yeah...

1065
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,020
Oh my god, man.

1066
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,020
Naaaaaah!

1067
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,020
No, that didn't happen back then.

1068
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,020
There were no DVDs in caveman times.

1069
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
No, that's nasty.

1070
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,020
You don't even know what you're talking about, man.

1071
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,860
Oh my god. Number 10, I love you.

1072
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,820
Whoa.

00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,420
Damn, that's some true shit.

1074
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:38,460
I mean, yeah, I mean, and that honestly just takes it back in full circle to, you know,

1075
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,300
B-Lack's wife.

1076
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,620
Yeah, true. B-Lack did have that adult wife. He was mad problematic. He had an adult wife and

1077
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:50,780
shit. It was just like, what are you doing, bro? And a lot of people were trying to like

1078
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,700
cancel him and shit. And it's like, I get it, but like, listen to his music first.

1079
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,420
when he got famous and then he like left her for Mila Kunis. Yeah that was like entirely

1080
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:06,460
fucked up dude. Yeah. And she's still out there and she like still like has him in her heart and

1081
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,140
she's still posting pictures of him on Instagram every day. She actually wears it. It kind of

1082
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,500
looks like it's her son or something. Yeah she actually wears a fragment of his skull around

1083
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,780
her neck on a chain. She actually like had his blood turned into perfume so she could wear it.

1084
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,280
Yeah.

1085
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,660
I mean, talk about poetic, you know, not justice necessarily, but it's just a poetic thing that

1086
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,740
he was kind of turned into perfume after his death.

1087
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,260
A hundred percent, dude.

That's so crazy.

1121
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,980
Someone says, "It was science that created us, not God or any religious figure."

1122

Yeah, true.

1123
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,980

00:59:53,980 --> 01:00:00,220
That's what they mean.

1126
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,700
You can't prove God isn't real.

1127
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,940
You'll know when you die.

01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:25,660
That's like one of the main lies that this white supremacist society has been built upon

1138
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,660

01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:32,460
It's like, can we just at least stop spreading, I don't know, misinformation?

1143
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,540
Yeah, I hate misinformation.

1144
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,540
You know?

1145
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,460
Oh God, I hate it so much.

1146
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,380
And the number 54, I mean, you can't make this up.

1147
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,180
My dog ate my homework.

1148
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,260

- Yeah. - So true.

1150
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,700
- I never had that excuse. - So true, but that's false.

1151
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,460
- What was your go-to excuse if you didn't have a homework?
