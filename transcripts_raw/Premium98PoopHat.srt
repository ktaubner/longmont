Chuck and Larry.

12
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,600
Chuck and Larry.

13
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,440
Chuck and Larry.

14
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,660
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

15
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,160
- You were singing a second ago.

16
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,920
I was thinking the doctor,

17
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
when they say open your mouth and say ah,

18
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,360
they should say open your mouth and say,

19
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,400
(chanting)

20
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,440
Just to see if you have a beautiful voice and then maybe you could get on American Idol.

21
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Yeah.

22
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,280
Yeah, well that's because my doctor is Dr. Dre.

23
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
No shot, dude.

24
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Is that true?

25
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Do you ever get mad?

26
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Does he spend most of his time when you're in his office usually on the ones and twos?

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,160
Yeah, he spends a lot of his time doing like product, like what's that fucking A&R or whatever

28
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
the fuck.

29
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
A&R.

30
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,440
Not A&R, like inspection of his beats pills.

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,640
He does a lot of quality assurance.

32
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,640
what the was. I didn't know he was on the assembly line for those.

33
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,640
It's in his doctor's office. Really? It goes through his doctor's office so

34
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,640
there's like a hole in the wall of the conveyor belt. Yeah, it's like a sushi restaurant. And he has to look at every single one

35
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
and inspect it and put a sticker on it. He has to look at every single one and go, "Yeah!"

36
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,640
It says, "Dre approved." He puts the Beats logo

37
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,640
on it. And if one is broken, you get to take it home with you for free?

38
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,640
If he doesn't like one, he slaps it and throws it down a staircase.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,560
case. He doesn't like it. Yeah, because there is a bunch of stairs in his office.

40
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,080
Well yeah, because he's got all these assistants walking around. Where else is he gonna throw people down?

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,740
Yeah, Dee Barnes just walks around his office. He tried throwing them off the

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,360
chair, but it's just not the same. They should make, I hope they make like a

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
sequel to the Compton movie, the Stratocompton movie. Yeah. It's just about

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,120
Dr. Dre and it's like him every time he has like someone in his life he doesn't

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,720
like he like slaps him and throws him down the stairs. He's like I'll have a

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll have a nice tea sir we're out of tea. Be cool. He carries them to the

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,120
stairs. Yeah yeah yeah you want to see my stairs? Yeah yeah you made me mad just

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,800
now you're about to see my stairs. He's cool man. Yeah it's cool that he did that when

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
he was like 30 years old. I actually didn't know what you were talking about. I thought that was

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,200
just a thing. D Barnes? No. D Barnes is this like reporter who made I think she

51
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,540
would use she was like talking to him and she was like you don't like women and

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,880
you make all your songs about hurting women he's like no I don't.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Threw her down some stairs dude. Jesus. Pretty crazy man. At least he didn't throw her down a

54
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,560
Stairmaster because she would have gone forever. Yeah. On one of those. Oh man.

55
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Yeah.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Get thrown down an escalator.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Fuck.

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
That'd be scary.

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I mean, you can't get off the escalator.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
It's just very long.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Yeah.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah, it's not like a Stairmaster where it's going to go indefinitely.

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,240
And you just know my white ass would fall exactly the speed that the escalator goes

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,800
up, so I'd be stuck in one place.

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, dude.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
That's what my white ass would be doing.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,040
I'd be rolling like a tumbleweed down that.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
And you know my shoelace would get stuck in there.

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't know how to tie them yet.

71
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
I still wear a rope, bro.

72
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,120
You know my flip-flops would get stuck in there, getting fucking grilled cheese.

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,120
my flip flops that they're really long in the front and they taper off until

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
they're as thin as a piece of paper.

75
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,120
And I wear them on the escalator. I hope nothing happens today. I wear them

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,220
around like automotive facilities, constructing cars with giant turbines

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,520
and shit. Like giant flippers.

78
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,420
Oh, haven't you known?

79
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,420
Yeah, I go scuba. I'm ready to go to the beach. And then I show up at the

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,620
beach at the Ford factory.

81
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,720
Yeah. Well, you know, the latest style is that the shoes now, they don't

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
just they don't have the two ends on the shoelaces there's like ten of them and

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,560
they all have tassels and they're 20 feet long. Yeah like a train on a

84
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,000
wedding dress. When did the the curled shoes stop? That was after

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,680
Elfin times. Okay yeah. Yeah Elfin. I think maybe we should bring them back.

86
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,800
Curled shoes? Yeah. Well that's one way to... Why do we have steel toed boots? Why not a

87
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,240
curled toe. Yeah. And there's a double layer. Yeah, you have double layer but

88
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,440
inside of the curl. Steel. Yeah, I was gonna say like a steel rod. Yeah, steel.

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Yeah, it's like a combo. It can hold the rod. Yeah. It's like a steel combo. You can put a

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,240
bundle on it. Oh, you can put a rod into you, you have it curled up. Yeah, yeah.

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
Yeah, and then you put a rod in, you curl it up, and you can carry stuff on

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,800
your shoe with the rod. Shit, god damn it, dude. We gotta get on Shark Tank so fucking bad.

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,240
They should do a jester shoe skate shoe. Yeah. I feel like you could put that out dude. That might be heat. They kind of did

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
No, I don't care

95
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,420
Now Dylan Reeder just made these like boots that he skated in yeah, and they were kind of they looked like a foreskin

96
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,640
Oh like a purple. Hell no. Oh, fuck you man. That's disgusting. Rest in peace Dylan.

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,480
hard moment in my life. Really? I had a crisis. Really? What was the crisis?

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,260
reason why there's not a lot of blue fruits yeah you know even blueberries I

upped and I have been defeated hmm it happens even the best you think you

124
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,420
think Monsanto has been working on a blue raspberry probably yeah I think

125
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,620
that they thought that they would have it cracked,

126
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,260
so they told all the lollipop companies,

127
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
"Yeah, just go ahead,

128
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,980
"we'll have the blue raspberry out in probably six months."

129
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,740
- That's exactly what that would taste like, too.

130
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,660
- Yeah, yeah, they were like,

131
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,300
"Yo, just kind of freestyle it.

132
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,620
"We'll put it out, it'll be like banana,

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,460
"it doesn't matter what it actually tastes like."

134
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,540
- It was too good, it was the same with pink lemons, too.

135
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,420
- Yeah. - That's true.

136
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,140
Where that pink lemon at?

138
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,720
- Is that some kind of fucked up '70s rock euphemism

139
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,700

You're dressed up like a bandaid.

177
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,300
Speaking of becoming a gay...

178
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,580
I'm not dressed like a bandaid.

179
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,100
You're dressed up like a bandaid.

180
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,780
You're one red hat away from...

181
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,380

183
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,980
No, I got dressed listening to Luther Vandross.

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,180
Oh, okay.

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,100
Props.

187
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100

Yeah.

189
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,700
They had... I was at the gym today.

190
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,300
They had Fox News.

191
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,540
Fox News on the TV.

192
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,540
Nice.

193
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,980
And you know what they're talking about on there?

194
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,980
Apparently there was an article.

195
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,100
There was an article.

196
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,220
There's an article in some magazine or something that's about apparently now the word Jedi

197
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
is offensive.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
No.

199
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
That's what they said.

200
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,820
See, that's what I'm saying, man.

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,900
Isn't that crazy?

202
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,100
That's crazy, man.

203
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
That's where I draw the line.

204
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
What do you think about that, Caleb?

205
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Jedi?

206
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Yeah.

207
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
Dude, Jedi.

208
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,340
Back in my day, you could say Jedi all you wanted to.

209
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:04,660
just a word. This is a word I'm gonna keep saying it. Yeah. Yeah. Why is it

210
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,700
offensive? I don't know. I mean they don't have sound on the TV so there's no way to tell.

211
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:16,740
Yeah I saw Fox News on the gym TV and closed his eyes on the treadmill. He put his hands over his eyes and went "Ahh no!"

212
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,340
Even if I did do that I would still be able to run okay. He tripped over his shoes. I can run with my eyes closed.

213
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,140
You're like a shark. Alright try it right now let's see it. Okay well let me step over

00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,740
- Put them down.

221
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,820
- No, I'm not gonna put them down.

222
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,140
- He can reach a running speed from this distance.

223
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,980
You need to relax.

224
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,460
- Okay, will you move the chair out of the way?

225
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,740
- Okay, hold on.

226
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,220
- Oh, he gets a little bit on the other end too.

227
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,700
- Yeah, here we go, okay.

228
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,540
All right.

229
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,700
(water gurgling)

230
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,300
(laughing)

231
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,140
- Wow.

232
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,960
- Okay, he did it.

233
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
- He actually did it.

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,060
- Impressive, right?

235
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,860
- Now imagine that on a treadmill.

236
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,220
- Cameron did fall face first into the treadmill.

237
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,500
- I've been having my left eye has been nonstop watering

238
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,820
for like four days now.

239
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,380
- You probably have conjunctivitis.

240
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,980
What's conjunctivitis? Speaking of poop, dude, did you really come to my house wearing a brown hat that says "P" on it?

241
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,980
Damn!

242
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,280
Well...

243
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,980
What's that stand for?

244
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,680
Poop?

245
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,280
You couldn't pick a different color for your pee hat?

246
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,680
I didn't get this. Mike D gave me this hat.

247
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,680
He got the poop hat!

248
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,380
He got the brown hat that just has a "P" on it!

249
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,680
Oh my god!

250
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,680
I'm gonna continue to wear it. I do think with this hat and the mustache I do look like

251
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
The poop salesman?

252
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
No, like the poop salesman.

253
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
I look like poop Mario.

254
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,680
You do look like poop Mario, bro.

255
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,680
No, Mike gave me this hat.

256
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
What's the P supposed to stand for?

257
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Somebody told me, because it's like a...

258
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
What's it say on the tag?

259
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,960

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
- How do you spell Ebbets?

264
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,160
- E-B-B-E-T-S.

265
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,200
- E-B-B-B-D-B-D-B-B-B-D?

266
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200

267
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
- Yeah.

268
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,200
And then, and then they have the hats.

269
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,380
- Hold on, should I just search Ebbets Hat?

270
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,420
- No, that's the hat.

271
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

272
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,080
- What?

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
- It's the first result.

274
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
- What, okay.

275
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,120
We have to shop Father's Day sale.

276
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,960
- Oh, okay, hold on.

277
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,680
Hold on, now, they got deals, though.

278
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,300
- What are, okay, here.

279
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,140

281
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,160
- Whoa, hold up, win a free hat?

282
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,000
- Shut up.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,440
Why'd you close out of it?

284
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Fuck you dude, I'm trying to find out what your hat...

285
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh fuck dude, we could have won a free...

286
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,120
I'm doing you a huge favor right now by letting your hat not mean poop anymore.

287
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,040
We could have won a free hat.

288
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
You want another P?

289
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Here's a brown one with a P.

290
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,280
You want a yellow hat that says P next?

291
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
There's five pages, I'm not going to...

292
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Well you could make it spell pussy.

293
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,680
You could.

294
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Yeah.

295
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,680
If you had five heads, that would be so good.

296
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
Hold on, go to...

297
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,280
No, no, no, no, you can find the P hat.

298
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
No, there's five pages of this!

299
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Sort it by color!

300
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Sort it by boob!

301
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Sit down! Sit down!

302
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I gotta... no.

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
You are wasting our time.

304
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I'm not wasting anything, I'm figuring this out.

305
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Anyway, my eyes have been bleeding water.

306
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
You definitely have some kind of very...

307
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
contagious...

308
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
I've been constantly crying.

309
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Is it making gunk?

310
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Not really.

311
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Is it ever hard to open?

312
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm imagining beautiful paintings all the time too.

313
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
The what?

314
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
The Paris Red Peppers.

315
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,540
The Poops.

316
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
The Paris Red Peppers.

317
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,280
But the hat's brown.

318
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,080
That's what it says, that's the exact hat.

319
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,160
Okay, but it wouldn't be a brown hat for a red pepper.

320
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,000
It says it right there, Paris Red Peppers.

321
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,560
Looks like it says 1946 Vintage Ball Cap, The Poop Patrick Hat.

322
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
It does not say the Poop Patrick Hat.

323
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,120
I think it says Patrick the Poop Man.

324
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
Oh my god.

325
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
This sucks.

326
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
It says Poop.

327
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,960
Patrick orders our poop hat.

328
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
Poop.

329
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
So it would be poof.

330
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Poop.

331
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Poop hat.

332
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Poof.

333
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Poof.

334
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
Poof.

335
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Poop.

336
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Poop hat.

337
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
You guys enjoy bullying?

338
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Patrick orders our poop hat and this.

339
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
That's right.

340
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
Yes sir.

341
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,160
And when it under and this it has a picture of poop.

342
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Yeah.

343
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Under this.

344
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Because it came with a free poop gift.

345
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,160
It's the Paris Red Peppers.

346
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
It's the Paris Red Peppers.

347
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,160
You guys are jealous because you don't understand Parisian culture.

348
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Yeah.

349
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
This is a very Parisian hat.

350
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
They would.

351
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Don't get Kaled started on Parisian culture today.

352
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
That's right, dude.

353
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I might bust out some fucked up evil.

354
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Yeah.

355
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Yeah, I might go fucking-- what's that guy's name?

356
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Luther Vandross.

357
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,160
I might go Luther Vandross on Paris real quick.

358
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Yeah.

359
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah.

360
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I might go crazy.

361
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,520
heard you heard a glow of love it's a song he was a featured on you and I have a

362
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:42,200
some poop in your gloves when you're playing for the Poop Pirates or whatever

363
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm trying to give you a do you remember the poop glove you remember that was a

364
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,360
genius plan someone had what was the poop glove you put your hand in poop and your

365
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,040
hand is like a poop glove. I think it's probably one of us. I think it could have been one of us.

366
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,440
Hey, if it's someone else, I'm sorry for stealing your idea.

367
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,400
Something about arm wrestling is like people say it's all, it's all like...

368
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,360
It's all in the arms.

369
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Yeah, it's not. It's not. It's not in the arms.

370
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,840
No, it's in the mind.

371
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,200
It's in the table.

372
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,240
It's like the technique, but there needs to be a new, a third dimension to arm wrestling

373
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,680
where you're trying to do fucking like, you know, getting their heads.

374
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Zero gravity table.

375
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,480
And also to see who can have a nastier hand.

376
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Yeah.

377
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
You don't want to touch it, right?

378
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
Mm-hmm.

379
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,840
Like you should have to like, it should be like pee hand versus poop hand almost every

380
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
single time.

381
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
Yeah.

382
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Because you also can't copy your opponent's hand.

383
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Yeah.

384
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
No.

385
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
It would stink.

386
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
And then you come in with throw up hand and everyone's just like, "Oh, too far."

387
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,360
Well, then it's like, well, if you can't copy then it's like, well, who gets to decide first?

388
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,160
You have to arm wrestle to decide who gets to decide first.

389
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,800
You have to rock, paper, scissors to decide.

390
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Right.

391
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,320
How do you decide who gets the, you know, the poop hand and rock, paper, scissors?

392
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,840
Okay, you play rock, paper, poop hand.

393
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,360
And whoever gets poop hand wins or loses?

394
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,240
Yeah, rock, paper, poop hand.

395
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,640
Hold on, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, wait, wait, because you're trying to get your poop

396
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
hand ready.

397
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
You're trying to get it fully coated.

398
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Keep your poop hand strong.

399
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,040
I was supposed to go to the Met today.

400
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,600
It ended up getting canceled.

401
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Got ice cream instead.

402
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
You got canceled so you couldn't go to the Met?

403
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Oh, I was in the fucking...

404
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Who's Shawn Mendes?

405
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Is that guy famous?

406
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Yeah, that's a singer.

407
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
He was...

408
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:22,320
He was in Central Park all day, just like singing to like, doing like a rehearsal.

409
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,600
So I pretty much got the most amazing concert ever.

410
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Wow.

411
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,200
Did you get to meet him?

412
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,660
Did you see Camilla Cabello there too?

413
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,200
He's married to Camilla Cabello?

414
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
I think he's dating her.

415
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400

451
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,260
exists some places why would you name your brewing complex oh you drink this

452
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,780
shit you'll get the plague they should call it there should be an HIV

453
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,580
just a sickness just a disease. No they shouldn't. What am I even saying? It's the worst idea

454
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,380
of all time. There should be an HIV thrift store. There actually is. What? What's it

455
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:46,140
called? It's called, no it's called, oh it's called Out the Closet. That's what it's

456
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,980
called in LA. What? Yeah I have them here too. Really? Yeah. I see that. If I was a

457
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,900
gay guy with AIDS I'd see that and I'd say that's not cool man. Yeah. They have them

458
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,700
Ohio too. I went to one in Ohio. I would just feel like they were profiting off my

459
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,660
image. Yeah. Yeah, because you walk in there, it's just a normal thrift store.

460
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,820
Right. You can get AIDS tested there. I know. I told you guys about the time when

461
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,500
I was there and a guy came in and was like, "Where's the AIDS test?" I was

462
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,740
like trying to buy a shirt. I was like, "This is not a fun place to be." Yeah, and you said, "Right here,

463
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:25,660
buddy," and you pointed to your open mouth. Okay. Okay, you realize AIDS kills like

464
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,500
billions of people every day. But it keeps Magic Johnson alive every year. That's not

465
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,660
true. What? He's making things up. Magic Johnson. You were hoping it would power

466
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,880
you up like that. He's making it up. Yeah. You think Magic Johnson, the most pussy

467
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,260
getter of all time, would ever get AIDS? No, he's got... He uses his magic to keep it away.

468
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,460
He doesn't have magic, dude. This is the stupidest conversation I've ever had. Okay, you've seen him on the court, though.

469
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,060
The Comedy Central roasts paid him to pretend to have AIDS 15 years before they

470
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,820
started so that they could do awesome jokes about how his Johnson was magic in

471
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:04,420
2001. Right. So anyway. Which roast was he on? I don't think he was in any of the roasts.

472
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,340
Oh. So anyway Caleb was buying a trench coat and he said that about the AIDS test

473
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,100
because he wanted to become like Wesker from Resident Evil because he thought

474
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,100
that the T-virus was real. No. What's that T stand for? The virus. The AIDS.

475
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,380
That virus? The AIDS virus. That virus. Yeah. That boy got that virus. That boy got that

476
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,460
virus yeah and these I forgot about these shoes secondhand they're starting to

477
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,300
blow out in the back yeah I'm starting it I wish you would blow it in the back

478
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:41,540
that's right bumping mics he got mad at us for bumping mics on cuz you didn't do

479
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,740
it the right way it's like this we did do it we did do it the right way no it's

480
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,420
like this today we did it two days ago and we were before we were done with D&D

481
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,180
or during D&D we bumped mics and he said don't do that you know you shouldn't

482
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,280
- That's what I was telling you guys.

483
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,040
It damages the mics if you hit them into each other.

484
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,880
And the reason--

485
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,280
- You're just mad at what Jeffrey Ross said to you

486
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,120
at the roast.

487
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,420
- No, the reason that they bump mics on TV

488
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,320
is 'cause they're so rich

489
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,760
they can afford a new mic every night.

490
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,840
We can't, you know?

491
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,840
We just got our first new mic in two years, today.

492
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,000
- One year.

493
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,040
- Three years.

494
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,360
- That's right.

495
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,040
New business bank account.

496
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,860
- That's right.

497
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,880
- Things are looking up for us, man.

498
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,040

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,680
- 11.

521
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,080
- Dude, if we get robbed for all we're worth,

522
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,400
I'm gonna fucking, whatever, it's insured.

523
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
It's like a bank robbery.

524
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
It doesn't matter.

525
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Is that true?

526
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
You're free to rob us.

527
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Wait, is that true?

00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah.

529
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
You're allowed to rob us.

530
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Whoa, dude, I think I might have a plan brewing.

531
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400

542
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400

544
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Remember that production company?

545
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
They did like the--

546
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Deek.

547
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Deek.

548
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,200
They did a bunch of like Inspector Gadget, Heathcliff.

549
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Heathcliff.

550
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Heathcliff.

551
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Heathcliff.

552
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Yeah.

553
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
They did Heathcliff.

554
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Dude, I've been watching Mike Tyson videos.

555
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah.

556
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Because he just is like, there's a YouTube wormhole you can get into that is just every time Mike Tyson has done an interview.

557
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
That dude is awesome.

558
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Yeah.

559
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:55,560
I'll fuck you till you love me. He said a lot of really weird shit. FFFF. He said he was

560
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,320
gonna eat a guy's kids. Yeah. He's like I want your heart I want to eat your

561
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,560
children. Awesome. So cool. He said that he was like trying to talk like Muhammad

562
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,120
Ali but like the whole thing about Mike Tyson is he literally has like an 85 IQ.

563
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah he was like homeless and then he like fed pigeons. Yeah no he's like one

564
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,680
of the like stupidest people of all time. I don't think that's stupid.

565
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,680
To get a pigeon to trust you, you gotta be some kind of intelligent.

566
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Yeah, but Muhammad Ali was like a genius and Mike Tyson is like

567
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
the stupidest guy of all time. He's like, "I'm gonna be like him." So he just tries to talk.

568
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,680
He tried to talk like him all the time. He would get confused and say things wrong.

569
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,680
And it was just so cool, man. And now I've been watching the videos of him recently where he says

570
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,680
he smokes like 10 pounds of weed a day and he's like,

571
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:50,360
There's a demon inside me. I used to be a demon. He wants to come out. I'm not gonna let him. It's so cool, man

572
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,720
He's like I want to hang out with him so bad. Yeah. Yeah

573
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,280
Yeah, it's not gonna be happy

574
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,120
Yeah, I'm gonna he knows he's fucking stupid. That's his whole thing. I'm gonna go with this recording

575
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,200
I'm gonna show him I'm gonna say Mike. He said this about you. He did your voice. Yeah, I didn't I wasn't even doing his voice

576
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,760
Yeah, you were not dude. Please don't tell Mike Tyson that I don't telling him. He's like insanely strong. You know that please

577
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,200
I'm gonna show his tiger that could clip too. The tiger's gonna get mad at you.

578
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,680
He doesn't have the tiger anymore. Plus he had a TV show and

579
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:29,200
you're never gonna guest star. He told the story of why he had a tiger and

580
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,560
apparently he was trying to buy a car and the guy was like, the guy selling the

581
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,720
car was like, "Yeah, you know, like I think we'll have a new Maserati in in like a

582
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,720
a month. In the meantime, I have a bunch of tigers." And he wasn't even looking to buy

583
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,320
a tiger. Someone just was like, "Do you want a tiger?" And he was like, "Yeah."

584
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
That's sick.

585
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
That's so cool, man.

586
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,040
Yeah. I would not buy a tiger.

587
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
No?

588
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Let me just put it out on the record. I would never.

589
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,080
I do not support that industry, so I would buy the tiger. I would throw it away.

590
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
I'd buy a tiger.

591
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
Because that's one less tiger on the market.

592
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,000
I would never buy a tiger.

593
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,240
- Hey, I'll say it, I'd buy a tiger.

594
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah, if I owned a zoo.

595
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,320
(laughing)

596
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,160
- Yeah.

597
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,920
- Yeah, if I owned a zoo, I'd buy a tiger.

598
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,040
And guess what?

599
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
Put the tiger in the zoo.

600
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,260
All of a sudden, I'm a millionaire.

601
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,880
What do I do with the million dollars?

602
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,280
A million more tigers.

603
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,440
- I pay to keep the tigers sick.

604
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
- Yeah, that's right.

605
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,360
Keep 'em, dude, there is a horrible zoo.

606
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,200

like a week ago.

665
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Damn.

666
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Yeah.

667
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,640
He's getting ready for that.

668
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Really fast.

669
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Was he in good shape?

670
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Yeah.

671
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
No, it was crazy.

672
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
If someone's in good shape, you just assume.

673
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,440
to like, yeah, he was, well, he was like sprinting on it forward for like a really long time and

674
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,160
then he turned around and was running backwards.

675
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,440
He's like, "Come on, man, like, you see me right here."

676
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Yeah.

677
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
That's what I hate about the gym is all the damn showboats.

678
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,260
Yeah, wait until I leave to do that.

679
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,280
The best guy that I have at my gym besides that dude is like the biggest guy there.

680
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,640
Huge like, like Bose over the ear headphones.

681
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
That's right.

682
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
That is a mirror.

683
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,960
Getting huge.

684
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Big over the ear headphones.

685
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Fuck.

686
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Sits there.

687
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
That backfired.

688
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,880
Eminem songs while like these listen to while he works out sick he's like sitting

689
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:36,360
there curling and he's like everybody's just trying to like work out it's so I

690
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,720

691
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,600
years now to wear planet yeah yeah PF I have the gap the of the the membership

692
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,960

693
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,920
that like massages your back.

694
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,340
- That's gotta be expensive.

695
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,360
- Yeah, dude, it's like 21 bucks a month.

696
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,320
- What, for four years?

697
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,160
- Yeah, I just forgot to-- - What the fuck

698
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,980
is wrong with you, man?

699
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,120
- I forgot to shut it off.

700
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,400
- You, this is the worst part.

701
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,600
You've told me about that probably three times

702
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
in the past year, and not once did you say,

703
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,240
"I'm gonna log on to PF."

704
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,720
- You can just do that?

705
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,440
I thought you had to cancel it in person.

706
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,280
- Still!

707
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,120
- Who cares, you live--

708
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,960
- I thought you had to cancel it--

709
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,200
- You live six blocks away from one.

710
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
- I thought you had to cancel it at the one

711
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,460
that you got the membership in.

712
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,760
- No, why would you assume that?

713
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,600
- Someone told me that.

714
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,560
- That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

715
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,400
- You never tried?

716
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,220
You were just like, oh well, okay.

717
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,840
I figured I'd go to the gym at some point.

718
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,440
- I'd rather pay $300.

719
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,000
- You could also go on your credit card

720
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,680
and flag that as like, I don't wanna pay this,

721
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,420
and they'll just decline it,

722
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,560
and then they will cancel your membership.

723
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,760
- Yeah, I could do that.

724
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,520
But what if I wanna go use the massage jet?

725
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,640
- That's actually a really strong point.

726
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,320
that's actually an insanely good point. Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's true.

727
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,200
You know what, you guys could use my membership too.

728
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,040
You guys could... I can't use your membership. What are you talking about?

729
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
You can put on a wig. I already have a gym membership.

730
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,280
You can put on a wig, put on my face.

731
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,400
They have a photo of me in it.

732
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,920
Look me in the eyes and tell me exactly how you think I could put your face on me.

733
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Mask.

734
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,680
You want me to pay to have a custom Patrick mask made?

735
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
No reason why.

736
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,840
You want me to put it on my face like Mission Impossible 2 and you want me to walk into

737
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,800
a Planet Fitness and say, "Can I have a glass of water, dude?"

738
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
You want me to do that?

739
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Yeah.

740
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,800
You would get a massage out of it.

741
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,680
It would be really awkward when they threw you a party.

742
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,000
They're like, "You're the guy who's paid the longest and come the least."

743
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,520
Yeah, he set a record like Google's one billion search.

744
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Yeah, exactly.

745
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

746
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Like confetti falls from the ceiling.

747
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
They're like, "Yeah."

748
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,720
Like people had bets on whether you would ever show up or not.

749
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
We all thought you were dead, man.

750
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,480
like oh this guy this guy was saying your first visit would be 10 years in but if

751
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,200

752
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,160

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,320
and gets a massage the person touches their butthole I don't want that smoke

- They're around.

764
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,560
- I don't think this is true.

765
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,080
- It's true, man.

766
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
People get--

767
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,560
- And you don't have like a phone number for it?

768
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,380
- Yeah, I do.

(laughter)

795
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:08,500

- No, She Go is the girl, the green girl.

800
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,960
And then her dad is the blue monkey.

801
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,600
- There's a blue monkey, I never watched that show.

802
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,520
- And She Go is part monkey.

803
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,140
- She Go's part monkey?

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,180
I have to erase some searches for my circuitry.

805
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:40,700
Yeah, I went part monkey on her, though. Yeah, I went Charla Nash. I went Charla Nash on the pussy.

806
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:49,500
That's right. You know what it do.

807
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
Alright, so I um

808
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:02,940
Today we're doing weekend update. Okay, what? Yep. I brought some he has a Mario Party minigame for us

809
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,940
I brought some headlines from

810
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,380
Some headlines that have been ripped doing the headline. Did we decide we're gonna write new jokes for it

811
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,680
You guys are gonna you guys are gonna riff on me. Oh, all right

812
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:20,660
Christian Charleston just requested $10 for me co-pay for MRI parentheses will increase amount if tumor positive

813
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Do you think that's a scam?

814
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:34,700
No earthly clue and then I immediately got a text from my mom which is scary will

815
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,360
Let's see is this a real guy

816
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,800
This is probably just a good. I guess everyone in the world has my phone number. I should expect things like that

817
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,600
Yeah, well Charles

818
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Kudos to you and well done

819
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,760
It's pretty good, man

820
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,100
All right

821
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
So I yeah, I

822
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,160
I got these headlines from one of my favorite news sources,

823
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,560
which is fascinatingthings.net.

824
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,800
(laughing)

825
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,560
- Okay, that's good news.

826
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,520
- So these are big in the news lately,

827
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,360
and I want you guys to kind of just riff on them

828
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,640
politically, like we can update,

829
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,400
'cause it is the weekend when this comes out.

830
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,080
- The hardest part about this is,

831
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,040
this is not like a video episode.

832
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
- Right, if you guys are doing any mugging or anything.

833
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

834
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
- Well, that's okay.

835
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,200
like i mean if you guys are going to do great if we're doing joe's rules then

836
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,280
like you're not going to see my funny face a big part of my delivery is my

837
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,680

858
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,760
and Herman Melville at the Benghazi Convention.

859
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,560
- The Benghazi Convention,

860
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,080
that's actually a really good idea.

861
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,920
- Yeah.

862
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,740
- Yeah.

863
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,520
- I honestly think that she probably

864
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,720
was responsible for all that.

865
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,440
- Yeah, she was solely responsible.

866
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
She was the person who went there

867
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,600
and killed all those guys.

868
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
- Yeah, I think if I remember correctly,

869
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,120
she accidentally dropped a big turd out of a plane.

870
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,160
- From her butt.

871
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,600
- And it collateraled all six of them, like in Halo.

872
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,440
- Yeah.

873
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,280
- Yeah.

874
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,520

Here's the second headline.

878
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,040
Take a look to a Canadian moose refreshing

879
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,320
in an inflatable pool.

880
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,680
That moose's name is Hillary Clinton.

881
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,480

1015
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,900
Tom Hanks the horse

1016
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:20,320
Who's a handsome guy

1017
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:23,100
Brad Pitt the horse

1018
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,600
Adrian Brody the horse. Adrian Brody looks like shit. Looks like a damn plague doctor.

1019
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:35,120
You can't say that about him. What?

1020
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,520
He's a proud Jamaican man. That's true. I forget that.

1021
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,820
Proud white Jamaican. Yeah, like snow. Yeah.

1022
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,760
Infarmer.

1023
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,440
Snow.

1024
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,200
Is Snow the Canadian rapper? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1025
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,040
- Oh.

1026
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,160
- So who do you guys think won Weekend Update?

1027
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,680
- I think I gave up pretty quick.

1028
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,360
- I think Caleb won.

1029
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,280
- I'm sorry that I have a perfect brain

1030
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,360
for writing jokes in fortune cookies.

1031
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,960
- Well you guys, hey, you listeners, comment below.

1032
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,800
Comment who won.

1033
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,640
- Yeah, see who won.

1034
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,760
- Just like on SNL.

1035
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,720
- Can we do a fortune cookie context now?

1036
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,560
Context?

1037
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,000
- Yeah, be careful with the accent you choose.

1038
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,840
- That's a really good fortune cookie.

1039
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,080
(laughing)

1040
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,520
careful with the accent you choose.

1041
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,980
- That is like perfect, yeah.

1042
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,820
- Yeah.

1043
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:32,540
There's always a little bit more soda in the can.

1044
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,360
Don't you guys feel like that's true?

1045
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,960
Every time you think you're done with the soda,

1046
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,640
you pick up the soda can, you shake it around.

1047
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,040
You hear, what's this, a rain stick?

1048
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,840
Did I get a rain stick installed in my--

1049
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,960
- Yeah, and then you go to Tricky,

1050
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,600
you go, oh, it's the tab, and I was shredding my throat.

1051
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,440
- I had a Dr. Pepper for the first time in a while today.

1052
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,160
I've been obsessed with that DC guy video.

1053
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah?

1054
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,560
The guy's like, "As soon as you start your day with a DC,

1055
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,480
"it's all downhill from there."

1056
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,960
I mean, come on, it's a fucking DC.

1057
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,800
I've never seen it.

1058
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,620
You've never seen that?

1059
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,120
No. Dude, it's so good.

1060
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,440
It's a guy with no chin, sitting in his car,

1061
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,720
drinking a Diet Coke, and just talking about

1062
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,240
how awesome a Diet Coke is, it calls it a DC.

1063
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,360
It's really good.

1064
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,200
You had a Dr. Pepper though, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1065
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,040
Yeah, well, Dr. Pepper, it's really good.

1066
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,400
You know that motherfucker got 23 flavors in it?

1067
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,600
- It's also got some ingredient called,

1068
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,440
it starts with a P-H.

1069
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,280
- Fentanyl.

1070
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,600
- Fent, final nucleides or something.

1071
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,480
- No shot.

1072
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,880
They got nucleides in that?

1073
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,240
- Phyto, is that what gives it its flavor?

1074
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,440
- Final nucleus.

1075
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,320
- They have the final nucleus in that?

1076
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,680
- Favorite flavor?

1077
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,520
Is it pepper?

1078
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,400
- I think that could be.

1079
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,880
- Flavor bubble?

1080
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,840
- I never thought I would like a pepper flavored soda water.

1081
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,320
but damn if Dr. Pepper doesn't hit the spot.

1082
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,160
- It's true.

1083
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,440
- I never thought I'd like a drink in a cold can,

1084
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,280
but oh, what the hell.

1085
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,440
- You know what, it does taste better in a can.

1086
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,160
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1087
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,920
- Dr. Pepper tastes better in a can.

1088
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,320
I got it in a plastic bottle.

1089
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,800
- I can not believe what you're saying.

1090
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,760
- That's a good fortune cookie.

1091
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,360
If it was in a fortune cookie flavored soda can.

1092
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,600
- They should just do like the--

1093
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,920
- Fortune cookie flavored soda,

1094
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,920
and it's got a fortune in it.

1095
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,040
- Holy shit, dude.

1096
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,960
- Why is there not fortune cookie flavored shit?

1097
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,440
- That makes no, you're right,

1098
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,580
'cause fortune cookie's like vanilla and lemon, right?

1099
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,620
Vanilla, lemon, soda would be so good.

1100
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,580
- Yeah, well they have that.

1101
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,320
- But they don't call it fortune cookie soda.

1102
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,000
- Great, just ruin everything for me, all the time.

1103
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,720
Just fucking destroy every idea I have.

1104
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,400
You say, they already exist.

1105
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,560
I said, what about shoes that make you jump?

1106
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,000
- This would also, also, if we have,

1107
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,440
say we have fortune cookie flavored soda,

1108
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,460
they print the fortune on the inside of the can,

1109
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,420
People are gonna stop throwing their cans out.

1110
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,260
They're gonna save them to look at the fortunes.

1111
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,820
And finally, these freaking homeless guys

1112
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,820
will stay out of the grocery store.

1113
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,660
- That's right.

1114
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,740
- Get out!

1115
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,420
That machine's not yours.

1116
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:08,100
You're too close to the red box.

1117
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,940
- Fortune cookie soda.

1118
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,020
- You have to leave.

1119
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,220
- The only soda.

1120
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,980
- You're stinking up the produce.

1121
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,520
- The only soda that keeps the homeless people out of the store.

1122
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,780
- I put my apples in that plastic bag.

1123
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,220
I see a green cloud when I tie the plastic bag closed inside there.

1124
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,020
Come on man, I gotta eat those later!

1125
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,020
That's right.

1126
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,380
What the fuck's going on bro?

1127
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,500
I would do anything to be able to eat an apple.

1128
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,380
Yeah, you should try being a homeless freak piece of shit.

1129
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,940
At least dress like Aladdin.

1130
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:34,940
Yeah.

1131
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,220
Yeah, I think that'll solve the homeless problem.

1132
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,780
If we put them all in suits and like costumes and put them in Times Square and you can take

1133
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
a photo with them.

1134
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,540
Here's my thing, if you're homeless, right?

1135
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,100
Okay, you're homeless.

1136
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,700
What do most of these homeless guys do?

1137
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,180
out with a bunch of other homeless guys. Listen buddy, your network is your net

1138
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,460
worth. Yeah. If you're homeless you need to be hanging out with CEOs. Yep. And

1139
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:03,060
richest, rich hot girls. Yeah. And then maybe, just maybe, if you work, play your cards

1140
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,740
right, one of them will give you a job. We dress up a bunch of homeless guys like

1141
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,300
priests and the Pope and we throw them in Dimesquare and then they hang out

1142
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,620
with all these rich Red Scare girls and... Who all day hang out in Timesquare.

1143
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,620
Dime Square.

1144
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
What's that?

1145
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,420
This guy's in another world though.

1146
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,420
Yeah, I don't know what this means.

1147
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,420
We don't have any.

1148
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:26,020
He's in this weird world where that is a place.

1149
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,020
It's a place.

1150
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,420
Tell you what's a real place.

1151
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,420
Citi Field.

1152
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:30,420
Mets play there.

1153
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
You know that?

1154
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,620
Oh wait, we could dress them all up like Mr. Met and then it's like Mr. Met's like, we

1155
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,620
have like a big like family, Mr. Met family reunion.

1156
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,180
It would ruin the costumes.

1157
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,620
Fuck, you're right.

1158
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Okay, well we dress them up.

1159
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,620
They stink it up, smell like a fucking Nintendo cartridge.

1160
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,160
- During the seventh inning, during the seventh inning stretch,

1161
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,700
we put them all in chains and put them out in the field

1162
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,780
and make them fight.

1163
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,980
- You got a seven in you stretched.

1164
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,820
- Yeah?

1165
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,660
- Mm-hmm.

1166
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,500
- I got seven in me?

1167
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,540
- You put a seven in you and stretched you.

1168
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,520
- Yeah.

1169
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,460
What stretches?

1170
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,360
- I don't know.

1171
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,620
(laughing)

1172
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:05,460
I don't know.

1173
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,220
- You tell me.

1174
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,380
- Could be any part of your body, buddy.

1175
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,860
I don't know, you tell me.

1176
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,900
- I'm just a little girl.

1177
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,580
- Wait, what? - You're a little girl?

1178
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,400
- What?

1179
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,860
- Just run that shit back.

1180
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,700
Run that shit back.

1181
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,460
What did you just say?

1182
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,300
- I'm a little boy.

1183
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,740
I don't-- - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1184
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,060
- I just played the hate back.

1185
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,860
- That's not what you said.

1186
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,100
That's not what you, stop reversing.

1187
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,940
Stop reversing. - I'm a normal guy.

1188
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,780
I'm a normal guy.

1189
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,620
I'm a normal guy.

1190
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,460
- Oh, he's stuck.

1191
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,300
- Oh, shit. - I'm a normal guy.

1192
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,140
I'm a normal guy.

1193
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,960
- How do we fix him?

1194
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,980
- I'm a little girl.

1195
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:35,820
- What?

1196
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,460
(imitates a guitar)

1197
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,540
DJ Funk Flex.

1198
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,620
- Do you remember the

1199
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,460
- I still have my headphones on.

1200
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,700
- DaBaby's, I was talking about this the other day,

1201
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,620
DaBaby's, during his rant where it's like,

1202
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,300
you're not sucking dick in the parking lot,

1203
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,620
put your phone up,

1204
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,460
- Yeah.

1205
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,160
- And that, what are you saying,

1206
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,000
like something like,

1207
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,580
oh, you're not getting AIDS or whatever.

1208
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,580
As soon as he says AIDS,

1209
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,420
- Well, I mean, he doesn't--

1210
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,340
- The DJ does a drop that's like,

1211
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,180
(imitates gunshot)

1212
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,300
(laughter)

1213
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,140
- Gunshot, yeah.

1214
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,300
- Two gunshots, then he says,

1215
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,140
these people don't know!

1216
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,140
I don't know man.

1217
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,140
I mean he does.

1218
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
It's so good.

1219
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,980
He doesn't, it's not that he's homophobic.

1220
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,600
He really and this is, it's admirable.

1221
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,680
He respects the sanctity of a parking lot.

1222
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,340
I don't want to walk out there and see, you know, I have no problem with them but I don't

1223
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:31,620
want to see a demon or devil doing its business out there.

1224
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:36,340
I don't want to go out there and see, you know, whatever it is, a man tricking another

1225
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,340
man.

1226
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,860
I don't want to see that when I'm walking out of the parking lot, you know.

1227
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,860
And that's fine.

1228
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,380
And it's nothing, it's just not, don't do it in the parking lot.

1229
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,540
Yeah, if you want to punch your ticket to hell in the sanctity of your own cave, do that,

1230
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,700
but not in the parking lot.

1231
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:57,180
Hey, how about you do it at freaking Whole Foods or at a liberal shop?

1232
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,100
Yeah, Whole Foods, because a lot of these liberal things think eating a whole is food

1233
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,100
to them.

1234
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,100
Yeah, absolutely.

1235
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,620
Because they're so gay.

1236
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,620
And they don't even eat steak.

1237
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,620
They don't eat steak.

1238
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,620
And they don't even eat a whole steak.

1239
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,860
- They don't even eat a whole steak.

1240
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,860
- They think chicken is a cow, basically.

1241
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,140
- They think chicken is a cow,

1242
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,580
and that salmon is real food, which it's not.

1243
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,380
- They think a Beyond Burger,

1244
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,380
yeah, it's gonna send you beyond heaven,

1245
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,180
past it, back all the way around to hell,

1246
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,700
where you'll probably live forever.

1247
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,540
- Absolutely.

1248
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,380
- Yeah.

1249
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,520
- Oh, and the Impossible Burger?

1250
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,500
It's impossible for you to get into heaven

1251
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,580
after you eat that.

1252
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,700
It's red, but it never died.

1253
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,260
If something is red and never died,

1254
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,660
that is one of the most evil things of all time.

1255
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,500
You know what else is red?

1256
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,540
- You know what's living inside your belly.

1257
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,380
- What else is red?

1258
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,200
- What else is red?

1259
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,040
- The demons, baby.

1260
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,860
- The magma in the heart, the hoary depths of hell,

1261
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,660
where the devil lives and he pokes you.

1262
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,780
- That's right, tell 'em.

1263
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,620
And you know what?

1264
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,020
These people, they're eating soy products.

1265
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,860
Well, guess what?

1266
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,380
Yo soy devil, and I'm--

1267
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,220
- Mm-hmm, talk that talk.

1268
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,140
- Welcome you into El Hel.

1269
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,700
- That's right, yeah.

1270
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,540
- Yes, sir.

1271
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,360
- You're eating kale.

1272
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,460
You going to hell, boy.

1273
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,540
You'll be going straight to hell.

1274
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,540
You'll be killed.

1275
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,540
And go to hell.

1276
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,020
Oh, you like Swiss chard?

1277
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:14,140
You're gonna be charred and burned to death by the way.

1278
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,140
Just like the Swiss.

1279
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,140
And your Swiss dog.

1280
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,140
Already going to hell.

1281
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,140
That's right.

1282
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,140
That's right.

1283
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,100
You're gonna get killed by the volcano in hell.

1284
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Yeah.

1285
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,100
Yeah.

1286
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,100
Yeah, 'cause your flag's a cross.

1287
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Yeah, you're taking a ginger shot.

1288
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,460
Hey, I got a thing.

1289
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,460
Your things are shot.

1290
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,460
That's right.

1291
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,460
Your things are shot.

1292
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,460
I'm gonna shoot your thing.

1293
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,460
hell will see thee pretty soon.

1294
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,460
(laughing)

1295
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,460
God dammit dude.

1296
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,460
That was...

1297
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,460
You're talking about food.

1298
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,460
I don't think that. I just thought it was a funny rhyme.

1299
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,460
I don't think that though.

1300
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,460
You're talking about food though. You're supposed to talk about food.

1301
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,460
Alright, how about just bee though.

1302
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,460
The bees are going to hell.

1303
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,460
Yes. Anyone else?

1304
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,460
You will be...

1305
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,460
Tortured eternally.

1306
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,460
You will be in hell very soon.

1307
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,460
Yeah, okay. Well, there's eight set seven seconds six seconds five seconds

1308
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:13,300
This is the Patriots right to the twitch and your site. Alright, bye everybody
