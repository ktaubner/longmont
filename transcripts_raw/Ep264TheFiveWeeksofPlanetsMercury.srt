1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Okay, are you guys are you all seeing this I'm listening to your stream mate

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:10,860
it.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:30,860
Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you. Mercury, imagine me and you. Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you. Mercury, imagine me and you.

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,860
Mercury, Mercury, smallest planet.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,440
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,720
- No, you can't hit your head for a clap.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,760
Guys.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,220
- It's showing up on the thing.

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,200
- Welcome to the five weeks of planets.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,640
We said we were gonna do it.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm sick as a dog. - And now we're gonna do it.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
- And we're still powering through to do it.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
- Uh-huh.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,500
- We could've, you guys could've,

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,320
I could've told you guys, guys, get a guest.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,760
Go get some, go get Brett Gelman this week, man.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,200
- My favorite comic.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,380
- Yeah, go get Brett, man, because I am sick as a dog,

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,660
but I said no, man.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,640
The people need to see these planets.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,060
We can't delay this any further.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,040
Also, we're lining up the five weeks of planets

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,080
with the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,240
- Yeah, it's kind of a tie-in,

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,340
kind of a movie tie-in. - Five type of universe.

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,360
I mean, yeah, there's no better time to get started

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,620
on a 10-episode spectacular series than now.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,460
And just for everybody who didn't--

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,420
- On Halloween day.

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,960
- Everybody who wasn't, so anybody who didn't listen

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,920
to the last premium episode is probably a little bewildered

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,380
right now and you deserve to be if you're not listening

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,500
to the premium episodes.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,880
But basically Patrick dressed as an earth by accident

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,180
on last episode.

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,960
So we decided to do 10 weeks of planets and yes,

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Patrick's already done five weeks,

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,460
tied in episodes of planets and that will span

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,860
every episode we do for five weeks.

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,460
So today everybody is Mercury and then after Mercury,

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,300
it will be Venus.

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
Then we're skipping Earth 'cause we already did it

43
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,300
and then it's Mars, Jupiter.

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,940
- Well, we're on Earth every day.

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,900
- Exactly.

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,340
- So, you know, every episode's an Earth episode.

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,060
- Neptune. - We're not gonna say it funny.

48
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,540
- Did I, I forgot Saturn, I think.

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,460
Did I say Saturn?

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,860
- No, you didn't, but that's an important one.

51
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,940
- Saturn's in there for sure.

52
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,220
Pluto, the Sun, and the Moon.

53
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,500
Wow, all 10 planets.

54
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,060
- The Sun and the Moon debate.

55
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,900
- Which one's better?

56
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,860
I don't even, we can't even get there yet, guys.

57
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,140
- No. - This week it's Mercury.

58
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,300
if you, I mean, start off with a beginning.

59
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,940
- Again, again, again, regardless,

60
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,580
irregardless, Brett Gelman, open invite.

61
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,380
If you wanna show up in the five weeks of planets, come.

62
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,700
- You would make a great, he would make a great Saturn.

63
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,540
- He would make a great Jupiter.

64
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,820
- He has the ring around his head.

65
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,780
- With his, yeah, well Saturn, actually,

66
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,700
that's a good point, with the ring,

67
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,340
the ring around the head.

68
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,260
- Yeah. - I'd love to see him

69
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,620
tackle Uranus.

70
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,880
- And I'd love to see something impact him.

71
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,160
and destroy him into millions of pieces.

72
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,140
Guys, look at, we all dressed up as Mercury

73
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,940
for this episode, just like Patrick did accidentally.

74
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,660
And so Patrick, I guess I forgot to tell you.

75
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,620
- I guess I forgot to mention,

76
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,860
that's the most important part of the five weeks of planets

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,460
is every episode we will be dressing as them.

78
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,800
- Basically the outfits.

79
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
It's the outfits of planets.

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,220
- I was trying to get the light going

81
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,540
'cause I don't have my ring light

82
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,740
so you can't really see the full,

83
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,980
it's kinda, my webcam is pretty bad.

84
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,820
- Show us the fit, man.

85
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,140
- Look, I've got a gray,

86
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:37,540
I've got a gray Dickies Work shirt on, and as well as gray pants, I have dark gray pants

87
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
with a dark gray shirt.

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,540
And then the white is supposed to represent, I guess, the atmosphere or something on the

89
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
dust.

90
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,540
Is there an atmosphere?

91
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,980
You're making excuses, man.

92
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,140
It sounds to me like you didn't think this through.

93
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,140
The white is...

94
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,340
What is the black and orange hat?

95
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,140
It says that Mercury has an extremely tenuous atmosphere.

96
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
It barely has an atmosphere at all.

97
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,780
Cameron, why don't you shut up?

98
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,060
Let alone a white one.

99
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,420
Cameron, why don't you shut up?

100
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,460
Seems like someone just didn't put much effort in on the first day.

101
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Okay, moving on from you...

102
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

103
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,500
Somehow you accidentally dressed exactly like Earth the other day.

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Wait, wait.

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
What, bitch?

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,500
The black, the black on the hat is representative of the blackness of space.

107
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,460
And the orange on the hat is representative of our big orange sun.

108
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,020
So you dressed as the solar system and not Mercury?

109
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
No I dressed up like Mercury.

110
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,100
You added the sun into your Mercury costume.

111
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
No man it's not gonna fly.

112
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
The sun was on my Earth costume.

113
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,580
It's not gonna fly, unlike Mercury which flies very fast.

114
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,580
It's the speaking planet and the year is on the 88 Earth days.

115
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
The sun was on my Earth costume.

116
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,820
I know and that one, but that was not on purpose.

117
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,100
You accidentally dressed like Earth and the sun.

118
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,100
It's the same thing.

119
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
You had ample warning.

120
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,500
Honestly, it would have been fine if it wasn't that it was it didn't try to say that the white

121
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
shirt was the atmosphere.

122
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, that was a white shirt.

123
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
It just shows you didn't do much research.

124
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,540
You just fell off, man.

125
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,660
You fell off there.

126
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,260
No, the white shirt is represented.

127
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,580
The white shirt, there's white all over Mercury.

128
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,580
There's little white dots.

129
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,580
What are you reading?

130
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,220
He googled the word Mercury.

131
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,420
I'm looking at a picture of Mercury right now.

132
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
I know.

133
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,880
Okay, so here's how you handle that, man.

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
Look at my hat, motherfucker.

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,620
Look at my swirling hat.

136
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,300
That is beautiful, Caleb.

137
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,700
That looks almost exactly like the surface of Mercury.

138
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,620
It's a Mercury-themed outfit.

139
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,460
All right, we're gonna--

140
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,580
I have different tones of Mercury.

141
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,340
I have a gray shirt, I have a dark gray apron that I have

142
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,660
that I cook in sometimes,

143
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,540
and I also used to do the dishes, guys.

144
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,300
That is a green apron.

145
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,140
You brought that--

146
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,700
What are you talking about?

147
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,620
I'm not stupid.

148
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,460
Are you fucking stupid?

149
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,300
Get off Wikipedia, bro.

150
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,820
You're scrolling down the Mercury Wikipedia.

151
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,660
What the hell is--

152
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,480
You think this is green, man?

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
You think this is green, man?

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,320
let Caleb do his outfit. I forgot you can see my screen.

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Sharing his screen of him scrolling down the Mercury Wikipedia page really really fast.

156
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,320
I was trying to look for the word white. Look at all the pictures bro.

157
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Oh wait wait wait wait wait. The white here is supposed to be representative of Beppy Columbo.

158
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Oh!

159
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
What's that?

160
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:16,600
Well, BepiColombo is a joint mission of European Space Agency and the ESA and the JAXA, the

161
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,720
Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the white is supposed to represent BepiColombo's

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,200
shell.

163
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
I just don't think so.

164
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
Okay, we did my outfit, we did Patrick's outfit.

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,480
Cameron, walk us through this fit, man.

166
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, so first of all, we've got the obvious element,

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,700
which is I put some tinfoil on top of my head.

168
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,540
Oh yeah.

169
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,520
And what this represents is this is,

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,240
first of all, it's gray, like Mercury the planet,

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,080
but we also know that Mercury also gives its name

172
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
to a peculiar type of liquid metal

173
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,160
that is quite shiny and metallic in appearance.

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
So that's the element that's going on up here.

175
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,160
You're telling me you have Mercury

176
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
sitting on your head, liquid Mercury?

177
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,320
You know, it's insanely toxically dangerous.

179
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,300
- Yeah, that's what happened to the Mad Hatters.

180
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,520
- I don't care much about that.

181
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,560
I'm more interested in the planet.

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,120
I'm not afraid to die for my costume.

183
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
- I like that.

184
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,720
- So, what I have here on my topper, upper half,

185
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,300
is this is a gray sweater

186
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,460
to represent the gray color of Mercury.

187
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,540
And then I also have a gray shirt,

188
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,320
which, here, let me see.

189
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
- You put layers underneath it?

190
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,420
- Just wait, bro, this is a full body outfit.

191
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,540
This is a full body outfit here.

192
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,040
- Don't wait, don't tell me.

193
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,840
Okay, so I've got the gray sweater,

194
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,760
and I've got this gray shirt here,

195
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
which has gorillas on it,

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
which you might think seems a little bit out of place,

197
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,140
but wait, because there's a reason.

198
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,840
Now see, I'm wearing these,

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,320
oh, this cable's not very long.

200
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm wearing these pajama pants here,

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
the Boston Bruins.

202
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,200
Now what sport do they play, guys?

203
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
- Hockey. - Hockey.

204
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,760
- Now what do you play hockey on?

205
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,920
- The ground. - Ice.

206
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
- Ice.

207
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,760
And guys, Mercury's range of temperatures can be very hot.

208
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Some would say in excess of tropical temperatures.

209
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
- Oh my God.

210
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,440
- But they also at night drop to very low,

211
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,160
maybe as cold as an ice rink.

212
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,800
- Okay, show me your underwear.

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,680
- And my underwear is under my pajama pants.

214
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
And then there's the last part,

215
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm wearing these running shoes

216
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,840
because Mercury, guys, is the speedy planet.

217
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,080
- The speedy planet, oh my God.

218
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
- And you know what else I have, guys?

219
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
- What?

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,040
- An envelope because Mercury is the name

221
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,420
of the messenger God.

222
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,420
Oh my god.

223
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Wait, you popped off man.

224
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,980
Who's the messenger of the gods?

225
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,820
You popped off and you inspired me in so many different ways now.

226
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Yeah.

227
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
For the other planets.

228
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,420
That's my Mercury costume y'all.

229
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,260
Holy fucking shit.

230
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,580
What I lack in costume, I will make up for in song.

231
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,540
And you guys, I need to debut my new single.

232
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,820
Okay, I wanna hear it.

235
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,740

I hear that.

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Hope I make you wet with my dope rhyme.

249
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,040
On this planet you age like a fine wine.

250
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
A fine line?

251
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,040
I put my nut in you like a Clark bar. I put my butt on you but I won't fart.

252
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Put my spaceship here like a bear heart. Got my clothes and shoes they from Primark.

253
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
Mercury

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I was supposed to say fine wine.

255
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,040
Fine line? Aged like a... Oldest...

256
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I think I let...

257
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Like a fine line?

258
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I let the Adobe Premiere do the transcription.

259
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040

260
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I'm gonna fly to you

261
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,880
I think that's I should have double-checked that

262
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:03,880
And you guys

263
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,440
There will be a new song by OJ the alien every single episode no way

264
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,000
every planet episode every single

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,720
Episode of the five weeks of planets there will be a new

266
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,500
OJ the alien track I'm more excited than I've ever been

267
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,800
Mm-hmm. I I like that. Also, you know, what's kind of convenient about this. It is Halloween that we're recording this and

268
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Well, that's what I was thinking about. Yeah, we may be have come up with the three most psychotic Halloween costumes in all of history

269
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,620
I think if I were to walk outside right now, anybody would be like, oh nice Mercury costume. Well, yeah

270
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
Bruins play ice hockey

271
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,180
Hmm are they would say are you that are you the gray guy are you mr.

272
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,540
Gray, and I would go like this and I point to my envelope and they go oh

273
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:03,160
Jerry the fastest planet mercury like from the OJ the alien song yes exactly and OJ the alien is about to blow the fuck up

274
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,340
I think so guys yeah, and his spaceship uh-huh

275
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,640
When he impact I lay I really like the line put my butt on you, but I won't fart

276
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,840
Because that might be the most romantic shit I've ever heard

277
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:22,280
Very it's a it's see I was thinking about it, and it's like what would okay, so OJ the alien. What's he up to?

278
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:29,640
What would oh what would an alien think is beautiful right uh-huh and it's probably a cold

279
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,380
But also hot gray planet

280
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,120
True, and I don't know how aliens make love so right

281
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,500
It's probably in a way that we couldn't even comprehend like putting their butt on somebody without a nerd

282
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,840
Putting their nut inside of it like a clerk bar when an alien travels to earth. What the hell is it doing?

283
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:55,980
With all its free time in that spaceship. Well that here's my theory now. They all want to you know they will OJ the alien

284
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,440
I don't know what kind of alien he is, but I mean green my creation

285
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,120
alien yeah, you just I

286
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,640
I guess I think well these type of aliens are not there the planet fucker race and

287
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,120
They only they don't like earth because it's too watery. It's not cold and gray like a

288
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,760
like see

289
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Alien pussy

290
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,860
So this alien hella cold and gray is it really big where it can like hold the whole planet and fuck it or is

291
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,140
It may be OJ the alien has some kind of I don't know we'll see where this character goes

292
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,760
Well, it's there's it's gonna be a 10 episode arc and we'll see what type of things that OJ the alien gets up to

293
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,000
OJ the alien thinks about the Sun

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,920
Yeah, good luck trying to fuck the Sun, but I bet you like fucking love the moon. Oh my god craters

295
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh my god, wait, maybe Mercury is his main and his main thing is his

296
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,800
sidepiece

297
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,600
- You guys, I'm just excited to think about

298
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
all this new kind of, this whole thing that we can do

299
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,080
with OJJ. - The thing is, bro.

300
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,720
- All right, well tune in next week for the next episode.

301
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
(laughing)

302
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,740
- The thing is, man, the planet, we've spent,

303
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,620
what have we done, 300 episodes,

304
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,960
and 99% of what we talk about is all this Earth shit, man.

305
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,800
We are leaving the entire universe out of our vocabulary

306
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,760
and the things we're talking about, and this is wrong.

307
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
- I think maybe we've talked about aliens before,

308
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,080
but I don't think we've ever really spoken about--

309
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,200
- But we've never talked about these other planets, man.

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,920
And beyond this, even our galaxy,

311
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,840
there's probably 30 or 40 other galaxies

312
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,640
that have 10 planets each.

313
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,120
With tons of different things that we could talk about, man.

314
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,040
What the hell, Titan?

315
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,440
Are you kidding me, Titan?

316
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
- Titan? - Titan?

317
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,360
- That's a moon.

318
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,180
- Titan?

319
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,280
That shit is cool.

320
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,560
- It is cool to have a moon named Titan.

321
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,480
- Why have we never talked about Titan before?

322
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,920
- We're gonna get to Titan, man.

323
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,080
Let's think about what we can talk about Mercury here.

324
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,240
We don't want to jump too far ahead.

325
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,960
No, we're getting too excited about all these planets.

327
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,200
- Okay, guys, listen, here's a fact.

328
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,340
I'd like to read a Mercury fact to you guys.

329
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,180
- Go ahead.

330
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,640
- If Earth were a nickel, Mercury would be a blueberry.

331
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,280
- That doesn't seem--

332
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,120
- I guess spatially--

333
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,920
- If Earth were a nickel--

334
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,680
- Is this in terms of size?

335
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,880
Mercury would be about a blueberry.

336
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,360
- A nickel and a blueberry are pretty similar in size.

337
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
- They are the same.

338
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,000
They are, I have seen, well, these GMO blueberries.

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,800
- Blueberries come in different sizes, man.

340
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,680
- Mercury is .4 astronomical units away from the sun.

341
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,760
- How much is an astronomical unit?

342
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,040
- So, well, it's about .4 of the distance

343
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,960
from Mercury to the sun, is what I'm gathering here.

344
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,680
Oh, Mercury's highly eccentric egg-shaped orbit.

345
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,840
That's interesting.

346
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Okay, egg-shaped.

347
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Shaped like an egg.

348
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,840
It's an egg-shaped orbit. And Mercury has no moons, y'all.

349
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Yep, I knew that.

350
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Can you imagine living on a planet with no moons?

351
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I think that Mercury is kind of...

352
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
I would like that. No werewolves.

353
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
True.

354
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Your werewolves...

355
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
That's a good point.

356
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,840
The threat of werewolves is greatly decreased by not having a moon.

357
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
100%.

358
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Why do I feel like humans...

359
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Like how geese migrate south when it becomes December,

360
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,400
humans when it gets towards the end of October should migrate to Mercury to

361
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,880
avoid all the wolves, to avoid the werewolves and the wolves. Yeah, speaking of wolves,

362
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,860
last night I had, this weekend, listen this was Halloween weekend, this is why

363
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm sick, partied way too hard okay. Last night I had myself a completely blue

364
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,920
cocktail, almost Neptune colored. Let's get there, let's talk about that when we

365
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,480
get there. Well but I started walking around with and I put all my keys in my

366
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,320
hand and I started saying I was keys-a-reen like Wolverine but with keys.

367
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,680
This is last night? This was last night to my wife and my wife made a great point

368
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,560
she said Wolverine is just named after an animal it doesn't matter what his claws

369
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,640
are made out of. Yeah. So he would not be knife-a-reen or blade-a-reen he's just

370
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,520
still even if he had keys he'd still be Wolverine. Anything could be sticking out

371
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,060
of his fingers and it would be Wolverine. The reason he's named Wolverine is

372
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,260
because he's small, he's short. Yeah his height. He's a small guy. Okay so I

373
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,520
couldn't even be Wolverine then because of my slightly above average

374
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,120
global height. Yeah. How tall is Wolverine did you say? Like five foot four, five foot two

375
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,800
somewhere around there. He's really short that's the main aspect of his character.

376
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,480
I don't think his power is that he's short personally. I think it's

377
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,720
- That's why he's Wolverine and his brother is Sabretooth.

378
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,200
- That's his brother?

379
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,620
I thought they were enemies.

380
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,380
- Well, they're friends at first.

381
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,760
- They're brothers at first.

382
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,480
- I don't know anything about Wolverine, to be honest.

383
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,200
- Okay, so Wolverine is five foot three.

384
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
- Okay.

385
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,440
- So I was almost right.

386
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,080
- Is Hugh Jackman really short?

387
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,080
- Hugh Jackman is six foot two.

388
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,900
- What?

389
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,880
- Too tall to be Wolverine, yeah,

390
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,200
but he's too good for the--

391
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,880
But name one male actor who's 5'2" besides Danny DeVito.

392
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,520
Just get Danny DeVito to play him, man.

393
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Why is that a problem?

394
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Yeah.

395
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Danny DeVito is too old.

396
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,000
If the main thing is his height, he wasn't in 2001.

397
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay, but here's the other, okay.

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,480
I don't think the main thing is his height.

399
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
That's what we were just saying.

400
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,600
Caleb, I want you to cover your, don't listen to what I'm about to say here.

401
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,400
But the other thing about Wolverine is his hairdo, and I don't think that a balding guy

402
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
could play Wolverine.

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,400
he has to be able to have to be crazy

404
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,960
to do. He could still he could take the sides out. It's gonna look weird man and Caleb don't do that

405
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,600
expression because I told you not to listen to this part. I don't know how to not listen. I tried

406
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,120
closing my eyes and it didn't work. The only thing the only thing that matters about Wolverine's

407
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:09,080
hairdo is the sides. So a balding man a man with like a full Norwood 7 could totally play Wolverine.

408
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh I just googled it it turns out I googled what is the main thing about Wolverine turns out it's

409
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,560
it's a superhuman strength and reflexes.

410
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,400
- Oh, okay.

411
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,120
- So we're gonna have a little bit of trouble

412
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,440
finding an actor to play him.

413
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,280
- Yeah.

414
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,760
- Yeah, that would be tough.

415
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,800
- 'Cause you know, representation matters,

416
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,200
and if you're gonna have an actor playing somebody,

417
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,880
you gotta get somebody with superhuman strength and reflexes.

418
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,720
- Well, that's basically where--

419
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
- Adamantium skeleton.

420
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,600
- I hate to say it, but that's where Democrat SJWs

421
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,120
are trying to take Hollywood.

422
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,400
- Yeah?

423
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,520
- Is that you can't play Superman

424
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,240
unless you have laser beams shooting out of your eyes

425
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,880
and you have an allergy to green rocks.

426
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,880
But what, does he date the girl who has red powers?

427
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,640
- Which one are you talking about?

428
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,560
- Lois Lane.

429
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
- You mean red hair? - No, no.

430
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
- Amy Adams? - Wolverine.

431
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
- Wolverine does not date rogue.

432
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,840
He does not date rogue.

433
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,880
- No, the red girl who turns the other way.

434
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
- Scarlet Witch?

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,160
- Phoenix.

436
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,880
- Phoenix, no, well there was a love triangle thing

437
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,800
going on with them.

438
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,440
- In the ultimate universe, Wolverine is an adult

439
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
and Peter Parker is 15 and Wolverine and Peter Parker

440
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,640
get freaky fridayed and Wolverine inside Peter Parker's body

441
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,400
tries to fuck 15 year old Mary Jane.

442
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
- That's fine 'cause it's the body.

443
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,800
- And it's also fine 'cause you're a, whatever,

444
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,080
it's a Wolverine, you're a Wolverine,

445
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,680
you're not a normal guy.

446
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,520
- Also, you're hundreds of years old.

447
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,280
- You're gonna do weird stuff.

448
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,640
- Yeah, you're saving the world too.

449
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,000
- Nobody can expect him to be completely normal.

450
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,560
- If you're saving the world, I don't really care.

451
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,400
And yeah, he tried, like once a year.

452
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,680
He didn't go through with it.

453
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,200
Yeah, he would have stopped himself.

454
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,920
If he made it, he would have stopped.

455
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
He would have said, "Oh, I'm 400."

456
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,000
The other thing in the Marvel Ultimate Universe

457
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that it's like Wolverine is,

458
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,440
Wolverine is supposed to be Wanda Maximoff

459
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,160
and Quicksilver's dad or something.

460
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,880
I thought that was Magneto.

461
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
Well, I think in that universe--

462
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Or it switches in the Ultimate Universe?

463
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,860
Yeah, I think in the Ultimate Universe it switches

464
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,560
and then they are already in an incestuous relationship

465
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,160
and then I think he watches them have sex.

466
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,100
- His own kids? - That sounds about right.

467
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,060
- He watches his own kids have sex.

468
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,220
- All types of crazy shit happens in the Ultimate stuff.

469
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,420
- It's the Ultimate, you know?

470
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,260
- It's all the last in the long line of.

471
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,280
- It seems more like man, it's got incest

472
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,740
and pedophilia and all types of shit.

473
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,640
- It reminds me of this show called The Boys.

474
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,020
Have you seen this show?

475
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,060
- No. - Oh, brother.

476
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,420
- Dude. - You are about to derail

477
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,300
this entire fucking episode. - Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

478
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
- We have to talk about The Boys first.

479
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,380
- I think that we, yeah. - Hold on, hold on, hold on.

480
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,820
- We have been talking too much about superheroes

481
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,660
and we need to start talking about super moves.

482
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,220
- When a Homelander uses his powers to,

483
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,060
and goes, "Fuck you, motherfucker!"

484
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,300
And he blasts somebody's, a woman's head off

485
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,660
and then he fucks her dead body.

486
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,340
- It's a maze ball. - I was, okay.

487
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,080
I was about to be a stickler for us getting derailed,

488
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,340
but this sounds amazeballs and I need to hear more.

489
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,660
- So, basically there's a character named Huey

490
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,940
and he's not exactly the most normal of guys

491
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
because he fights against, you guessed it,

492
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,180
motherfucking Supes.

493
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,500
The Supes are basically the bad.

494
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,340
- And what is a Supe?

495
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,180
- They're superheroes.

496
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,000
- A superhero.

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,840
- Or maybe not even heroes,

498
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,180
depending on how you see it.

499
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,300
But imagine, okay, so you're watching Batman,

500
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,500
you're watching Spider-Man, maybe Superman.

501
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,340
And you're thinking, this is interesting,

502
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,940
I like these powers, but I think in real life,

503
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,700
they would probably use cuss words.

504
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,540
- Yeah.

505
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,980
- Dude.

506
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,060
- Buddy, you don't typically expect a character

507
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,140
in a superhero TV series to have a catchphrase

508
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,980
like fucking diabolical.

509
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,060
- Yes.

510
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,120
- Yeah, or an Australian accent.

511
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
- No.

512
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,200
- Well, things are a little bit different

513
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
in the boys' universe.

514
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,180
- Let me get this straight, okay?

515
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,260
Let me get this straight.

516
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,220
You're telling me that the real heroes

517
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,700
of the boys' universe are the villains.

518
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,500
- Well, the real heroes in the boys' universe,

519
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,260
I think, are the police.

520
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,100
- Yeah.

521
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,940
- Huh.

522
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,760
- It's the police and nerds.

523
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,600
- Yeah.

524
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,440
(laughing)

525
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,900
- Interesting.

526
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,220
It's about the police teaming up with nerds.

527
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,660
- And the enemies are superheroes and unions.

528
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,100
that's basically the enemies of the boys universe

529
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,620
it's really bad ass dude

530
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,140

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,540
and some of the characters fuck on screen

532
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,460
basically the whole boys show was conceived when the creator of the show

533
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,740
or the comic

534
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,500
watched the flash and was like

535
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,820
basically if he ran into somebody he'd fucking explode into fucking blood

536
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,860

and and also rappers are are bad in this universe rappers are not a third in the

551
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,880
t_v_ show

552
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,200

gonna be straight in this universe? Ron? Nah man. Let me do one finger gesture for you.

557
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,280
I just did a spit take. What are they scissors? I just did a spit take with no water. It is.

558
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:42,200
That screwed me up. It is so awesome that the in that show the thing that they keep

559
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,360
like cause the whole thing is they're like blackmailing superheroes and stuff and the

560
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,480
thing that they're blackmailing all the superheroes for is being gay. It's all being gay and being

561
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,880
addicted to drugs. Yeah, every yeah. Yeah, which is so funny

562
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
because it's I read the comic of it a while ago. And it's like

563
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,680
it's Garth Ennis. So it's very it's super. It's all what is he

564
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,320
else did he do? He did preacher and some of the Punisher and

565
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,600
stuff. But it's all like, yeah, every the secret, the dark

566
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,800
secret of every superhero is they're all gay pedophiles.

567
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,880
Literally every single one of them. And then yeah, they take

568
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,320
they they don't know how to do it in the show right so it is very strange so they

569
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,480
just take away all the pedophile stuff yeah I only watched I think like one and

570
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,280
a half seasons oh also the main the main villain Homelander is goes full fat

571
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,800
bastard and eats a baby what yeah oh yeah he does copyright infringement no yeah

572
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,560
he goes he fat bastards at the end of the show he is stealing he is stealing fat

573
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,280
That bastard's intellectual property.

574
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,120
That's messed up.

575
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,000
- Yeah, there's photos of him where one night

576
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,800
he got really drunk and he went fat bastard.

577
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,160
- Why do I feel like the boys is almost like methadone

578
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,120
for an MCU addicted culture?

579
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,920
- Damn.

580
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
- Holy fuck.

581
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
- Damn.

582
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,820
- Holy shit.

583
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,660
- I feel like I could write for the AV club.

584
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,920
(laughing)

585
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,640
- I think you'd have a very strong resume.

586
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,240
my dream being to write for the AV club.

587
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,480
- One line in the application.

588
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,320
The boys is gonna hire you.

589
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,440
- It's a question, why do I feel?

590
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,440
- Why do I feel weirdly like the boys

591
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,740
is some kind of methadone for an MCU addicted culture?

592
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,440
Cameron.

593
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,760
- Well I'm addicted to the MCU.

594
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,600
- Yep, say it.

595
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,080
- Moon cycle units.

596
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,680
- Yep.

597
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,160
- Moon cycles. - Let me segue this back.

598
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,800
superheroes of your remains planet

599
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,900
crypt on

600
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,400
yet what happened with cripple what how come we haven't read discovering

601
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
crypt on that's yeah has anyone been to crypt on yet

602
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,880
i think there is a unit it's a different galaxy i think that that's the problem

603
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,660
what is that's not a stay

604
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,080
are allowed to go between galaxies

605
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,880
let's stay in the milky way you got a lot of his well i was but not a lot of

606
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,760
that the human race but our discussion we can no no we can talk about we have

607
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,760
- I thought you were suggesting that the entire human race

608
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,280
should not travel beyond the boundaries of our galaxy.

609
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,320
- No, no, no, I've seen Event Horizon and stuff.

610
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,440
I've seen Event Horizon, I've seen Alien,

611
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,320
I know that we shouldn't even go beyond the limits

612
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
of the Milky Way.

613
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
- Do you guys believe that--

614
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
- I've seen, I've played Mass Effect 2,

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,880
I know that the geth are coming for us

616
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,720
and we're all gonna die. - I thought you were

617
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,520
suggesting right now, I thought you were proposing

618
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,960
a global policy, I thought you were saying,

619
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,280
guys, let's not leave the galaxy.

620
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:46,280
know everybody let's make a promise let's not leave the galaxy. I am proposing that. I am proposing that.

621
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:53,440
Uh uh. I don't want to know. Patrick's picture coming up like a zoom meeting on a giant projector

622
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,760
in front of the UN. Guys let's not leave the galaxy. All the countries, the Congo is like

623
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:08,080
yeah shouldn't be doing that. Don't leave the galaxy let's keep it in the galaxy. We

624
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,360
We don't need to know about all that other shit.

625
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,800
We don't need to leave the galaxy.

626
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,240
Can we start a petition to not leave the galaxy?

627
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
I'm down.

628
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
I think we should.

629
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
We should start that.

630
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Let's go to change.org.

631
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
Let's type that up right now.

632
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,760
There will be a QR code on the screen.

633
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,720
Well, because it's you, you could see things.

634
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,840
Here, you know what?

635
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Let's show our planets.

636
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Because this is in it.

637
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,040
We, guys, speaking of leaving the galaxy, these are, if you believe in an infinite galaxy like

638
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,100
I do, then these planets surely exist because every variation of planet exists

639
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,020
in an infinite, not an infinite galaxy, an infinite universe. So there are other

640
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,540
galaxy, there's probably an entire galaxy that has all of our planets in it in a

641
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,140
row. Yeah, but these planets that, but these planets we're about to show, these

642
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,560
exist in our galaxy because we're not leaving the galaxy and we know these are

643
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,700
here. Okay Patrick, show us your planet mate. I'm showing you my planet right now.

644
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,620
Describe it for all the people who are listening. All right so this is my planet

645
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:14,700
that I discovered and this right here it is a red planet with a lot a very a very

646
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:21,180
elevated planet it almost looks like a meatball it doesn't say meatball it

647
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:28,740
looks a lot like a meatball and what the hell is that a face there's whose face

648
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,740
is that? Who is that? You guys, this whole planet is alive. It is the Meatwad planet.

649
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,940
Okay. You were talking a big game before this episode. You guys were saying you had the

650
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,620
best planet. You wanted to make a competition. You wanted to change this into a contest about

651
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,300
who could have the best planet. Once I found out Julio had the best planet, I knew that

652
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:57,260
I would step down. I knew that I would step down because... But before you knew that, you

653
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,540
We were confident this planet would win the number one planet.

654
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,420
Well I didn't know what you guys would have.

655
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,060
But this is the planet Meatwad.

656
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
It looks nice.

657
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,060
This is planet Meatwad.

658
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
It has two moons.

659
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
It doesn't look that much like Meatwad though.

660
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
I'm going to be real with you.

661
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,180
Well it looks like, okay, you know in the MCU when they try to make Howard the Duck look

662
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,320
real.

663
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,220
You think this is what it would look like?

664
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
This is like photorealistic Meatwad.

665
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,820
Like real photorealistic Meatwad.

666
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
Why does it have so many moons?

667
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
It has so many moons.

668
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,040
What's with the dandruff on its head?

669
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,340
The dandruff is actually city lights.

670
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,260
Oh, those are the cities?

671
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
Yeah, those are the cities.

672
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,300
I can turn those off and on.

673
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Wow.

674
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Right there.

675
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,780
I like that everyone's kind of afraid to colonize the eyes and mouth a little bit.

676
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
Well, at least here.

677
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
Because I feel like I would be living right on the lip.

678
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
No, you wouldn't, bro.

679
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,300
Well, there's some people right here.

680
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,900
I would live on the lip and I'd be rubbing the ground all day with my body.

681
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,580
See right here, right on this corner of the lip, this is where all the people live.

682
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,020
are the most dangerous, these are the bravest citizens of planet Meatwad.

683
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,140
I feel like there'd be some serious...

684
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,580
So tell us about the culture and the atmosphere and all types of things. More than the appearance,

685
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
what's going on with this person at all?

686
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,580
Well, it's mostly...

687
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,540
Who's living on planet Meatwad?

688
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
The Meatwadians.

689
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,340
Okay, and they look like Meatwad?

690
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,740
Yeah, they pretty much all look like Meatwad.

691
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,980
It's like how you looked like Earth the other day?

692
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:29,140
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I'm gonna be honest you guys. I didn't think that much about this. And I

693
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:34,220
didn't think that you would be able to see the face on the texture that I uploaded. It

694
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,140
was just going to be planet meatball until I saw that the face showed up. So you uploaded

695
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,740
a picture that had the texture of a meatball but also a face on it. No I made it red. I

696
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,740
I made it red and this is a Yoda mask.

697
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Oh, okay.

698
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,740
I can show you my custom picture here.

699
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,740
I do like how this looks right now.

700
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,740
I thought it would show up like, I thought that would be an interesting texture to put on a planet.

701
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,740
That would be kind of interesting, but I think Yoda already has a planet.

702
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Yeah, he does have a planet and it is Dagobah, but...

703
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Yeah, this is, I think, the loser of the planets.

704
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
No, go ahead and just freestyle some stuff.

705
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,980
- Yeah, tell us about it.

706
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,820
- You're so down on your planet.

707
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,640
- You're not even trying to tell us a detail

708
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,580
about the culture or the climate,

709
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,420
or just tell us about it.

710
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,540
- There's a spaghetti sauce sea.

711
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,140
- Sea, this is what I like to hear.

712
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:24,980
- Okay, all right, we're getting somewhere.

713
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,180
- I'm liking this.

714
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,540
- All these low elevation parts right there,

715
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
that's the spaghetti sauce sea.

716
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,740
It's mostly spaghetti sauce.

717
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,020
And there's the whole United States.

718
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,260
(laughing)

719
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,100
- Okay.

720
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,260
- The entire United States.

721
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,900
United States. A lot has not changed. I can tell you that a lot. This is Planet of the

722
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,820
Apes. This is the Earth in the future. One day this is what it looks like. You guys,

723
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,120
I was more focused on OJ the Alien, but now I think that Planet of the Apes becoming a

724
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:07,340
meatwad planet. Patrick and the UN doing a Greta Thunberg conference about how we need

725
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:13,640
to stop cloud. We must be. Earth is going to look like this in five years. This is what

726
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,400
earth would look like in five years? It will be a planet meat wad. Half of the United States

727
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,400
will be in this big hot sea. Look, look, look, where earth, the moon is going to become earth.

728
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:33,160
Look at that. That's scary man. That's terrifying. Wait, so now I'm feeling like this, you would

729
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,860
go to the UN and you would say, can we, we need to stay in the galaxy. They would like

730
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,580
be like okay then you start showing them this and they don't want to leave the

731
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,660
galaxy immediately. This is a horrifying vision of the future.

732
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,260
Well this is we need to stay in the galaxy and we need to stop focusing on

733
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,420
going to the other galaxies and stuff. This is what happened is it happy to live

734
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,300
on a planet like this? We need to stay in our lane is what the lights are still on.

735
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,220
We are we are we got to stay in our lane and we got to make sure that this

736
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,180
doesn't happen. This is more cautionary. The side profile on this thing is really handsome.

737
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Yeah. Wait, go back to the side profile.

738
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:19,500
It kind of lined up perfectly. I didn't even think the nose would get a ridge like that.

739
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,420
It looks amazing, man.

740
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:29,940
Yeah. Well, what my planet lacks, it makes up for in aesthetics.

741
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,600
You don't have to be hard on, now that it's grown up,

742
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,820
now that it's evolved past just being Meatwad,

743
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm in love with your planet.

744
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,980
- Yeah, see, we needed just the details, man.

745
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,820
- Here, I'll go next 'cause I do feel like Caleb's

746
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,380
is gonna be better than mine.

747
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,620
- Okay, that's a little bit harsh too.

748
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,720
- No, it's okay, he was also talking a big game,

749
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,340
and I didn't have that, just spend that much time on mine.

750
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,980
- I will say, you are the most humble of the three of us,

751
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,260
in terms of your planet.

752
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,460
- It's not that I spend that much time on it,

753
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,660
I just have a natural talent, I think, for--

754
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,380
We're going to start with this view of my planet.

755
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,700
What do you guys think?

756
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,140
It looks amazing.

757
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,980
It looks green.

758
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,940
And I bet it looks like this all over.

759
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,620
You know what this looks like?

760
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,140
Can you guys describe what you're seeing right now?

761
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,220
OK, yeah.

762
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,060
It's like a gray planet, and it looks

763
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,180
like there's some kind of fuzz around the edges of it,

764
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,100
but not all the way around, kind of like a horseshoe-shaped fuzz

765
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,460
going around the sides of the planet.

766
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,900
This looks like popsicle shots.

767
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,020
Do you remember those, the lemon-lime,

768
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,040
- Oh wait, oh wait, hold on.

769
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,860
- It came in a cup and you would get it

770
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,700
from the ice cream?

771
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,200
- I'm starting to see, oh God, man.

772
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,460
(laughing)

773
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,060
This is a foot.

774
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,300
This is a photo of a foot.

775
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,540
Two feet.

776
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,220
- This is a photo of two feet.

777
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,340
- This is a photo of two feet that has been turned

778
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,900
into one of the most disgusting orbs

779
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,520
I've ever seen in my life.

780
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,380
are these your feet

781
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,460
no yeah these are your feet

782
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,120
you think i have to sit like this on my feet? yeah that's... oh my god

783
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,060
oh my god

784
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,000
look at those corns dude

785
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,920
okay alright what's the name of your planet? oh my god is it what's it plantar fasciitis?

786
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,180
this is planet feet

787
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,400
okay

788
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,340
and it's a very stinky planet as you can see by the green atmosphere here

789
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,120
that i'll highlight here. you can change the atmosphere color that's amazing. this is what it normally

790
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,680
looks like but I removed the atmosphere for you guys.

791
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,500
To be able to see it.

792
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,020
Very dense green stinky atmosphere.

793
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,240
So this planet is uninhabitable due to the stinkiness, the climate and the grossness

794
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
of it.

795
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Every food...

796
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,200
And this planet, the size of this planet, it is about 8 inches in diameter.

797
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Okay so kind of even small for a planet.

798
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
8 inches in diameter?

799
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Yeah.

800
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
It's very very small.

801
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
This is a moon!

802
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
It's not a moon.

803
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
This is a moon!

804
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:02,920
It's a planet or whatever they call it and it is located in New York City somewhere.

805
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,440
And whoever possesses it, possesses great power.

806
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
This is like the...

807
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,080
It's currently set into an amulet.

808
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,920
This is, yeah, this is what I was going to ask.

809
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,300
Is this like the cat that has the little Orion necklace in Men in Black?

810
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,760
This is exactly like that.

811
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
Yeah.

812
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,440
This is kind of a MacGuffin.

813
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,360
Some bodega cat in New York has this around its neck and nobody knows.

814
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,720
This is probably the most disgusting thing we've ever shown on the show.

815
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,920
Oh absolutely.

816
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,000
You guys should have seen when it was a butt before I posted this as a YouTube episode.

817
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I wish that I could see it as a butt.

818
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Wow look at this angle!

819
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You know what?

820
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,960
I can see what it would look like as a butt right now.

821
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
This is land-

822
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,280
It's almost impossible to describe what I'm looking at, I'm very sorry.

823
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,640
The land is the feet, but what is this black void?

824
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,560
- That's the core of the planet.

825
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,400
- Okay.

826
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,440
- Oh, it's got an open core.

827
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,320
- Yeah, it's an open core scenario.

828
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,440
- I could see this being in like Super Mario Galaxy.

829
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,240
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,700
I think that's actually where it originated.

831
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,600
- Oh.

832
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,800
- Okay, and you said nobody lives on this, right?

833
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,280
- No, nobody except for one guy.

834
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
- Who?

835
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
- Who I just remembered who lives there.

836
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,280
- Okay, and what's his name?

837
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,080
- Caleb.

838
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,600
I don't, but not me, right?

839
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,240
I thought, I think his name is,

840
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,600
it's just, yeah, I don't remember his last name.

841
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,480
I think it started with P, but I don't,

842
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,920
I don't know that many details about him

843
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,680
'cause I've never been here to try and,

844
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,560
I don't really wanna go anywhere near it.

845
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,960
A glitch, you said?

846
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,560
It's just a glitch, yeah.

847
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,600
Okay.

848
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,680
Well, maybe it's just a glitch.

849
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
That's a mental glitch that you're having

850
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,880
'cause it's just keeping true.

851
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,320
All right, well, that's my planet, planet feet.

852
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,760
All right, come and show my planet, man.

853
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
Oh!

854
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,200
All right, let me see your planet.

855
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,080
Oh God, I'm moving slowly to my illness.

856
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I need to see this planet.

857
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,080
I do, and I'm excited to see Julio's planet also, even though I already saw it.

858
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Wow!

859
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,580
Okay!

860
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,580
Okay, so what I'm seeing here, let me try...

861
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
This is planet chill.

862
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:14,580
This looks like a person wearing sunglasses whose face has been violated and completely flayed by one million rubber bands.

863
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
Yeah, this looks like a cenobite.

864
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,060
- It's not, oh.

865
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,900
- This is fully centebrite vibes.

866
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,800
- I guess it does kinda look like somebody.

867
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,620
This is Planet Chill.

868
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,460
This is the Earth revolves around Planet Chill.

869
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,220
The Earth is one of, is one of the moon,

870
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,480
or is the only moon of Planet Chill.

871
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,380
- Oh my God.

872
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,200
- There's-- - Yeah, this looks like

873
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,680
when they try to blow up a watermelon

874
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,140
by putting rubber bands on it.

875
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,980
- There's-- - But with a human head.

876
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,080
- Look at the side profile on this, man.

877
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,380
This is cool. - Oh my God.

878
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,800
- So here's how this planet works.

879
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,140
Everybody lives on the white face of the man in the planet,

880
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,840
planet chill.

881
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,160
And then these are, they look like sunglasses from space,

882
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,860
but when you're on the planet,

883
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,680
they're actually two giant flat screen TVs

884
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,080
with Dolby Digital surround sound

885
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,820
in the entire planet installed.

886
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,080
That's what this back part is.

887
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,520
This is uninhabitable wires and cable management in the back.

888
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,100
And basically people sit on this edge

889
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,940
like it's the Grand Canyon and they watch the Super Bowl.

890
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,940
That sounds awesome.

891
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Yeah, and these are giant 70 inch flat screen TVs on either side over here.

892
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,940
There is also a giant crack in the middle of the planet.

893
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
The no man's land.

894
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,940
No, it looks like it goes all the way down. It's a hollow earth kind of situation too.

895
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:39,940
And like I said, once a year when the earth revolves around this planet,

896
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,780
that you can actually, once a year, meaning the Super Bowl,

897
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,860
you can actually, people on Earth can watch the Super Bowl

898
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,620
in the sky, in space.

899
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,100
- Oh, that's actually pretty incredible.

900
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,940
- Yeah, yeah.

901
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,420
- If Earth doesn't--

902
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,860
- And all the girls live over,

903
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,560
all the girls on the planet live over here by the lips.

904
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,700
And they kiss the lips all day.

905
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,900
- They put their butt on it?

906
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,140
- They put their boobs and their butts

907
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,460
all over these two big, beautiful pink lips.

908
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,000
And they kiss it and they love it.

909
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,860
The girls all live on the lips and the guys live on all the stuff around the sunglasses.

910
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,420
And never the twain shall meet.

911
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,500
And earth revolves around this planet.

912
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,140
Earth revolves around basically earth doesn't fucking matter.

913
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,740
This is the only planet that matters.

914
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,940
This is where everything cool is happening.

915
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,140
Everyone on here look there's snow on earth.

916
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
People are snowing.

917
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,060
They're they're shoveling their driveways.

918
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,860
Meanwhile on planet chill people are drinking daiquiris.

919
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,780
There's a giant hole, there's a giant thing

920
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,500
that pops out of the eye there.

921
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,460
There's another one right there.

922
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,960
I mean, this is basically the only cool planet

923
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,260
in the universe and Earth is over.

924
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:52,140
And I think that my petition to the United Nations

925
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,060
is that we need to instantly evacuate all eights,

926
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,360
nines and tens to planet chill as soon as possible.

927
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,860
Wow, and the eights will live on this side

928
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,300
'cause we just need, we only need the eights there

929
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,100
so we appreciate the nines and the tens.

930
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,240
Well, yeah, and you gotta,

931
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,900
someone's gotta do cable management.

932
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,740
Yeah, exactly.

933
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,220
So we'll send the eights back here,

934
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,060
and then every once in a while,

935
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,560
you'll be walking around this edge land,

936
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,500
hunting for--

937
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,700
Above the sunglasses.

938
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,140
Yeah, hunting for money.

939
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Oh, and there's an ear.

940
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,340
(laughing)

941
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,980
Hunting for money over here on the edge lands,

942
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,220
and you'll see one of the eights,

943
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,900
and you'll go, "Oh, God!"

944
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,580
'Cause it becomes so disgusting to you,

945
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:34,220
'cause you're so accustomed to the tens and the nines.

946
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:39,740
But yeah, it's like how if you it's like how if you eat you're eating something that's not

947
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,100
spicy at all and then you eat something that's a little spicy like a strawberry it burns

948
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
your mouth.

949
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,900
Exactly and I will say that Tens are the indigenous people of this of this land.

950
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Wow.

951
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,380
Okay so it all of this belongs to the Tens and the Eights and the Nines are like the

952
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,700
Nines are second-class citizens and the Eights are animals.

953
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
Why don't you call it Planet Ten?

954
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,540
it's more chill than it is about like the hotness is how hot all the women are is basically

955
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:12,520
oh okay eights nines and tens with women the guys are all threes so the kids have no choice

956
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:20,540
but to get with the guys also lesbianism is illegal in the entire planet unless it's on

957
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,540
a poster unless it's on a poster in a dorm unless it's a picture pictures of lesbianism

958
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,380
- A picture or a video.

959
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,780
- Are required. - A picture or a video.

960
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,620
- Pictures and videos are required,

961
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,460
but it's illegal to be lesbian.

962
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,060
- They make them off-world.

963
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,540
You make them and then you import them in from Earth.

964
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,660
- Yeah, it's okay to be gay though,

965
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,740
but it's illegal to be lesbian.

966
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,300
All the lesbians have to live on Earth

967
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,180
and all the hot nines and tens and the dirty, dirty eights.

968
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,540
- Imagine being gay on planet chill.

969
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,980
(laughing)

970
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,260
You'd wanna get the hell out of there.

971
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,780
- Sounds like an amazing short story.

972
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,680
Yeah, it sounds like a great a great old pulp pulp.

973
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,880
Plus I find novel being gay on planet.

974
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,580
You'd find in the bookstore gay on the chill with it's like

975
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,080
Harrison Bergeron most incredible pick like painting you've ever

976
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,380
seen as the book cover.

977
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,380
Yeah, one.

978
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,680
There's the Harrison Bergeron style story for planet.

979
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,580
Chill is two lesbians that go on TV and just start making

980
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,480
and everyone and the and the horror the sci-fi horror of it

981
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,960
is that all the threes start clapping

982
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,040
'cause they think they're doing it for their entertainment.

983
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,320
- Oh no.

984
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,680
- Guys, I heard a new planet just got discovered.

985
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,160
- What happened? - Whoa.

986
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,120
- They haven't named it yet,

987
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,360
but a visual feed is coming in right now

988
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,820
of a new planet that just got discovered.

989
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,660
- I wanna see this planet.

990
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,360
- I need to see this planet. - Oh my God, what's this?

991
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,040
- I don't know, let's inspect it.

992
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,860
- Whoa. - Let's look closer.

993
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,080
It looks like some kind of food.

994
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh my God.

995
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,700
- Oh my god, it's some kind of a mud man.

996
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,380
- What is this planet peanut butter?

997
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,760
- Imagine if you're in space,

998
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,540
you're on the moon of this planet,

999
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,540
and you're watching the sunrise,

1000
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,680
and you see the planet's slow-mo orbit,

1001
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,720
and it goes like this.

1002
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,960
(laughing)

1003
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,480
- That would be amazing. - Oh my god.

1004
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,520
- This is why we should have been god.

1005
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,360
- We should have been, yeah.

1006
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,360
- God planet designers.

1007
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,220
commission because it is

1008
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,380
away we need to see we need to see who lives planet also

1009
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,200
that's the other important point of view

1010
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,320
pressure is to plan it yet to describe it

1011
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,440
uh...

1012
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,960
so i'm in the best detail possible and is called friendship

1013
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,560
uh...

1014
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,720
and uh...

1015
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,760
the flip it is

1016
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,160
this friday

1017
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,520
the

1018
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,680
because everyone on the entire planet is friends with you

1019
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
so it's really moon and skull

1020
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,680
can you try and describe this visually while we're looking at it?

1021
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,680
*laughter*

1022
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
*laughter*

1023
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
*laughter*

1024
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,680
no

1025
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,680
*laughter*

1026
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,680
*laughter*

1027
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,680
what's that over to the side?

1028
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
wait

1029
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,680
this planet is not in space

1030
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,680
it's moon friendship

1031
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,680
this is another planet that is in New York City

1032
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,680
it's exactly the same

1033
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,320
same as the planet but it's just green and it's the moon and it's also called

1034
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:26,520
moon friendship. This is so beautiful so it's a picture of two best friends as the background. Can you zoom in here to this part of the planet?

1035
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,680
Yeah and which friend is the planet actually made of? Both of them. It looks like it's both.

1036
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:44,360
Yeah it's planet friendship right there. Oh my god. It's two faces. So the atmosphere, or the galaxy that it's in, or the planet mimics the

1037
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,860
galaxy that it's in. Pretty much yeah. That's beautiful. That is fascinating. I

1038
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:53,360
wonder if NASA has done a paper on this. This is gonna be great for our audio

1039
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,920
listener. Yeah I would say this is the only one that you have to tune in to

1040
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:06,120
understand the video. This is an amazing planet guys. Yeah we're well on

1041
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:10,440
our way to creating our own entire galaxy. I know. Which is probably what the goal of

1042
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,280
of the five ways of planning.

1043
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,680
- Are we gonna be doing a new planet every episode?

1044
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,400
- Um, we, no, probably not.

1045
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,240
(laughing)

1046
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,080
- No, we're not.

1047
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,920
- No, no way.

1048
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,360
- I think, okay, so all of these planets

1049
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,020
need to exist in the same, I know you said

1050
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,140
that you're just a New York camera,

1051
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,640
but I think it really should be--

1052
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,220
- Well, New York is in space.

1053
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,760
- All four of us, well that's true.

1054
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,180
- Technically.

1055
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,020
- Yeah.

1056
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,520
- All four of us have planets in one galaxy.

1057
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,080
Instead of the sun, we have the fun.

1058
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:48,600
fun the fun instead of the moon we have the choom the planet chill is next to

1059
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:57,320
the fun it rotates around the fun and it has a choom and I think Jubio's planets

1060
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,860
might get Pluto'd here pretty soon might get kicked out of the galaxy yeah because

1061
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,940
they're not really I heard that planet feet just exploded and it was

1062
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:09,840
replaced by the second planet they just oh my god yeah that's scary that is

1063
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,980
scary what new planet did they discover it was this one oh this one just covered

1064
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,880
but the shape is a little different okay so this is the this planet of the

1065
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,720
peanut butter man what is this photo and that's will Ferrell is that that is I

1066
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:34,920
don't know who this is I don't think that I don't think this is a who I don't

1067
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,240
think I would the mount it's too mountainous.

1068
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,880
Yeah, there's a looks like it's a dry dry desert.

1069
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,460
This planet is in.

1070
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,160
And this does not have a choice.

1071
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,600
This is this is in our galaxy.

1072
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,860
This is a no choose planet is barely dangerous planet.

1073
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,600
This is a planet that they are trying the scientists of our galaxy are trying to eliminate

1074
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,400
the lack to style destroy every other planet.

1075
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,960
Oh my God.

1076
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,280
All right.

1077
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,840
And this one has no choom.

1078
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,360
This one has no chume, but it does orbit the fun.

1079
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,920
- All right, well that's good news at least.

1080
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,920
This is the Mercury, I guess, of our universe.

1081
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,040
Let's bring it back to Mercury.

1082
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,160
- Or just the space engine.

1083
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,400
- Well, I guess maybe because, okay,

1084
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,360
we're creating our own galaxy that we're pretty soon

1085
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,020
is gonna make real, thanks to our prayers to God.

1086
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,360
So what I'm thinking is maybe each of these planets

1087
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,620
that we do for the five weeks of planets,

1088
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:31,200
we can choose what elements we like about them.

1089
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,120
Into our galaxy create the perfect plan yes, yeah

1090
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:44,240
At the end of the month at the end of the month we'll have the perfect planet we could terraform Earth to also match this planet

1091
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,560
It's a pretty good idea

1092
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,440
Are you guys ever do you guys ever get scared that you're gonna be asleep?

1093
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:58,400
And then a asteroid is going to hit the world and destroy it instantly or some kind of space object that we've never

1094
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,560
discovered that moves at the speed of light that's the size of a quarter is

1095
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,880
gonna hit the earth and go and destroy it into pieces I'm gonna be honest that I

1096
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,840
don't think about this the galaxy in the solar system too much and I think that

1097
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,160
is because that's that's for my own safety though I mean as soon as we

1098
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,640
started talking about other galaxies I was like full isolationist do not know

1099
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,600
You do not engage do not engage. I'm gonna know you take me to another galaxy. I'm gonna nope the fuck out of there

1100
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,180
I'm with you kill it with fire

1101
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:38,080
I think I'm not so worried about space objects because the thing about space objects is even if they're moving as fast as as

1102
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,940
Fast as a thing could possibly move

1103
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:48,400
That's still really slow because of how big everything is they're so good you would have yeah, man if the Sun

1104
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,600
Exploded it would take eight minutes for the the light to go away

1105
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:01,240
But if something hit us so fastly, but it can't go faster than the speed of light, but so we would know

1106
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm not afraid it's gonna happen in my sleep because they're gonna tell us about it before it happens

1107
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,040
Nothing you can do if you have a big ball headed towards your head. Yeah, but you know about it

1108
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
This is like it would be like seeing

1109
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,160
Like if you were out at night and you looked up at the full moon and you saw a ball

1110
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:24,840
falling from the moon. That would be scary. Oh no! Yeah, but by the time it got to you.

1111
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,280
I would just stand there. Yeah, exactly. I would not stand there. First of all, I would

1112
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,880
leave the planet. I would be terrified with fear. They told us that an asteroid was coming.

1113
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,960
First of all, I would leave the planet. No, you wouldn't. I would fly away to another planet. Yes,

1114
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,200
I would. You would not use, code name, Kid Next Door 2x4 technology to build a wood spaceship.

1115
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,000
I would fly away from the planet with a pwodogostick. A pwodogostick? What the hell

1116
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,040
Yeah, it's on a different planet. You don't know it. It's a new invention that I got

1117
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:59,480
Bullshit doesn't exist man. It's a potago on this planet. It's made by the Pota goes. Yeah, I

1118
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,100
Feel like you guys are fucking lying to me. I'm not fucking with you

1119
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,400
There's a no you're not very cultured when it comes to planets

1120
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,720
I know about every other planet and I know what order they're in they're okay

1121
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:18,360
Where the pota goes where the pota goes I'm playing at Padogian. No, it's not. Okay. Well you got that one

1122
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:25,640
The Padogians live next door to me. No, they don't the Padogians or maybe what OJ the alien is

1123
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,720
I don't want aliens to visit because I think that culturally there will be a lot of differences

1124
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,560
You're not you don't fuck with two cultural differences. Well, I just think they'll have a hard time

1125
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:41,000
I think aliens will get here and they'll be like the they'll be like white guys that order off the menu at the bodega

1126
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
They go.

1127
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah.

1128
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
They're supposed to go on and they go into McDonald's like big back.

1129
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah exactly.

1130
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
They're doing the accent.

1131
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,400
And they go what the hell is that man?

1132
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,360
You're not supposed to order off the menu at the bodega.

1133
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,000
I have discovered that this is a thing that only white people do.

1134
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,680
Why do they have the...

1135
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,840
You go in and tell it isn't me.

1136
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,360
I'll have the Cuomo sandwich and they go what number is that?

1137
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,600
Yeah they walk out from behind the counter and they look at the menu.

1138
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,400
- They look at the thing, 'cause everybody else comes in

1139
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,100
and they say, "Let me get a pepperoni pizza with shrimp."

1140
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,100
And you walk in and you say, "Let me have the cotton club."

1141
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,440
- I want an ice chicken tender.

1142
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,800
- I have to go in there and I have to look at the menu

1143
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,080
and then say every single thing piece by piece.

1144
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,920
- Just the ingredients.

1145
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,880
- The menus are fake, you don't even have to.

1146
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,400
- The menus are completely, it's like,

1147
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,280
you just have to know what they want.

1148
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,560
- It's a legal thing, that they have to have a menu

1149
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,560
'cause they're technically a restaurant.

1150
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,440
- They have one million sandwiches on.

1151
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,560
- Okay, this wouldn't happen on my planet.

1152
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,180
I'm just gonna say it.

1153
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,040
On my planet, you got a sandwich on your menu,

1154
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,920
everyone knows how to make it.

1155
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,880
- They always just turn around when I say,

1156
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,520
"Yeah, let me get the firefighter."

1157
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,500
And they turn around and they say,

1158
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,360
"Which number is that?"

1159
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,200
What are you talking?

1160
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,260
They look at me like I'm crazy.

1161
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:05,260
And it's floating above their head like runescape text.

1162
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,400
It's right above their head, the firefighter.

1163
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,120
And I'm like, "You want me to get the firefighter?"

1164
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,120
and they say, "Can you give me a hex code for that?"

1165
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,120
They do not like me.

1166
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,920
- Now I used to order this sandwich all the time

1167
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,280
called the Bushwick at Sunrise Deli

1168
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,240
next to my old apartment.

1169
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,080
Do you remember that sandwich?

1170
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,240
- You said, "Can I get the Bushwick?"

1171
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,080
You said that? - Yeah, I said,

1172
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,320
"Can I get the Bushwick?"

1173
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,960
It's a good sandwich, though.

1174
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,080
It's roast beef-- - That sounds like a code

1175
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,120
at a happy ending massage place.

1176
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,640
- Wait 'til you hear what it is.

1177
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:41,640
It's roast beef, pepper jack, jalapenos, mustard,

1178
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,560
like hot mustard, and I would get pickles on it.

1179
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,640
- So you're making, see, but you know the ingredients,

1180
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,360
so just say that, dude.

1181
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360
- Well, I don't know, well, I'm missing a few of them.

1182
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,520
There's a few more ingredients

1183
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,600
that I'm forgetting currently.

1184
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,000
- I'm just saying, man, this is, I've discovered,

1185
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,480
I'm done doing this.

1186
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,020
I'm done ordering off the menu.

1187
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,720
I feel like a fool every time.

1188
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:13,080
It's making me feel less than I did at one time and I was like, oh that's not clearly not they just don't well again on our planets

1189
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,880
If there's a menu

1190
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,280
You get to order from you get to order off the menu. You can always order

1191
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,360
You can always order off the menu. What do you guys think about mercurians?

1192
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,880
The mercurians are

1193
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,480
Pretty cool. I would say

1194
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,240
They have

1195
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,480
What if they got one big eye on the front right mm-hmm?

1196
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,700
One big eye on the front completely white skin

1197
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:48,000
You know not like Caucasian like no way for like a like paper paper white white Kindle paper white

1198
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,420
Maybe they are they be a real

1199
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,760
They are many would say they were

1200
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,180
Do they still exist or no no?

1201
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,780
They were they live they flew too close to the Sun pun intended literally

1202
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:09,120
Shit, and they guys burn mercury could reach temperatures of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes wait, but how is it I see then?

1203
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:15,560
Because it can reach temperatures of negative 290 degrees Fahrenheit, which one would actually be in

1204
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:21,940
I'm looking at a mercury and right now hold on let me show you guys what I'm looking at. What does it look like?

1205
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,300
I'm

1206
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,800
I'm looking at this. This is not a McCurry and I remember oh

1207
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,100
She's beautiful as a woman with fire hair and a green V shaped body

1208
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,220
clothes

1209
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:39,420
Do you think maybe we could get oh, well this hasn't happened yet? This is in the year 3000

1210
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:45,380
Do you guys think that if we ever go to Mercury will hopefully find oil under the ground

1211
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,020
hopefully

1212
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,780
Okay, I just watched a movie that maybe would would be relevant to this

1213
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,260
It's called killers of the flower moon, and I feel like it also has to do with mercury because of the word moon

1214
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,740
So why do I feel like my entire life is a pattern?

1215
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,140
Was that movie good has he done it again?

1216
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,620
He did he only made it once

1217
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,140
It was a fucking really good

1218
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,540
Yeah

1219
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,540
It is a really good point. Do you think that he probably loves the boys right Scorsese?

1220
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:21,260
Oh, yeah, because it's a send-up of superhero cinema. No cuz he's like he's like fuck all this MCU shit, man

1221
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:25,600
I like cusses I like I like cussing and boobies. Let's watch the boys

1222
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,620
Cuz they're my boobs in the show I

1223
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,460
Only watch the first season. I think there was some pairs

1224
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:40,660
There's and I think there were a month accident. Yeah, I think there's huge ease huge ease and humongous is in like two episodes maybe

1225
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:47,180
That's interesting. They should add a hero whose power is heard the size of her boobs didn't they have of her

1226
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,020
Do you remember--

1227
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,420
- That she can distract villains?

1228
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,260
- Do you remember this show--

1229
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:52,300
- Yeah, where they're just their size

1230
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,740
and they can't do anything?

1231
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,320
- The show on the SyFy channel, and it was,

1232
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:59,100
I forget what it, I think it was called

1233
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,940
Who Wants to Be a Superhero or something?

1234
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,460
No, but that would be an amazing show on the SyFy channel.

1235
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,980
Could you imagine that?

1236
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,820
- Real sex.

1237
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,660
- It's a space--

1238
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,420
- Real sex on the SyFy channel,

1239
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,940
a choir of real sex. - It's a space taxi.

1240
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,380
It's a space taxi.

1241
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,900
Oh no, that's way funnier.

1242
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,180
- Yeah, no, it'd be funnier if they just syndicated

1243
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,340
for real sex.

1244
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,940
- After, but they put, yeah, after like 4 p.m.,

1245
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,620
the Science Channel just turns into real sex reruns.

1246
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,460
- Yeah.

1247
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,660
- We went to Mardi Gras with a can of whipped cream

1248
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,620
with the Science Channel thing on the bottom right.

1249
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,020
- I watched that one time when I was a kid, and--

1250
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,060
- It doesn't seem like the realest sex.

1251
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,740
- No, no, no, it's really a documentary

1252
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,500
about sex and everything.

1253
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,700
And I learned that the hard way

1254
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,700
because the episode that I saw, barely any sex stuff in it.

1255
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,300
What I saw in that episode was a grown man

1256
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,740
who programmed sex games for Windows 3.1

1257
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:01,020
and it was just him playing these animated,

1258
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,580
kind of like Leisure Suit Larry type games

1259
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,620
and it was just him getting horny as shit

1260
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,660
at his own computer.

1261
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,500
- And they called that real sex.

1262
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,580
- And I was like 11 years old, I was too scared

1263
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,460
to look up porn on the computer watching that

1264
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,900
and I was like, "Oh, come on."

1265
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,060
At 11, you were too scared to look up porn, man?

1266
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,900
You were a pussy.

1267
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,380
I didn't know how to delete the history yet.

1268
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,900
You just don't care.

1269
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,300
Yeah, it doesn't bother you.

1270
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,140
No, no, no, no.

1271
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,180
It's supposed to not bother you.

1272
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,260
Yeah, just be unbothered.

1273
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,300
You're supposed to be free of all kind of thought

1274
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,140
when you're that age.

1275
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,840
No, I'm the middle of three boys

1276
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,020
and then I have an older sister

1277
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,020
and we only had one computer.

1278
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,740
I wasn't gonna let them know that I jack off.

1279
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,820
I wouldn't look up porn

1280
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,980
if I was in the middle of three boys either.

1281
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,100
Yeah, that would be a pretty inopportune time.

1282
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,100
How are you even in the middle of three?

1283
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,700
- I'm the middle of three, I meant.

1284
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,820
- Oh, okay. - Of three.

1285
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,060
- I was gonna say, that doesn't make so much sense

1286
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:52,900
to be in the middle of three people.

1287
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,400
- I think that's what you said.

1288
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,820
I think I just twisted your words.

1289
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:57,060
- I was in the middle of three boys.

1290
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,340
- I think you twisted my words.

1291
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,180
- Well, what else can you do, man?

1292
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,460
- I think I just twisted your words.

1293
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,300
- Okay, we need like-- - I don't twist people's words.

1294
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,220
- I think we need like five more Mercury Facts

1295
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:06,980
before we send off into space. - My PC just get,

1296
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,460
let me pull up Mercury Facts again.

1297
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,540
- And I think it's Discord, goddammit.

1298
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,860
- What?

1299
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,020
My PC just skipped.

1300
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:15,860
- That's okay.

1301
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,780
- I gotta figure out why that always happens.

1302
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,780
- When the ions, or, hold on.

1303
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:28,140
When the ions, I don't know what the ions are,

1304
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:33,080
but when the ions strike the surface, I assume of mercury,

1305
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,100
they knock off neutrally charged atoms

1306
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,680
and send them on a loop high into the sky.

1307
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,500
- Huh.

1308
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
- That is, I don't really understand that fact.

1309
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,620
- I just hope, okay.

1310
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,540
Well here's some facts about Planet Chill

1311
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,420
because Mercury has some pretty wack-ass facts,

1312
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,780
I'm gonna be honest.

1313
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,700
- Yeah.

1314
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:55,700
- On Planet Chill, there is a statue of liberty

1315
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,600
that's fully in a bikini.

1316
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,500
- Whoa! - That's cool.

1317
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,580
- Yeah, yeah.

1318
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,160
And she's got a job too.

1319
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,740
Or you know what kind of job,

1320
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,580
I don't have to say what kind of job.

1321
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,980
- Here's a fact about Planet,

1322
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,900
- Planet Peanut Butter Man was only recently discovered

1323
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,140
because it just entered this galaxy

1324
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,840
because it was beforehand trapped inside of a Ziploc bag.

1325
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,420
A giant Ziploc bag.

1326
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,900
- That's more of a scary fact for Halloween.

1327
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,060
- A penis-sized Ziploc bag that was opened up by a meteor.

1328
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,900
(laughing)

1329
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:28,740
- Okay.

1330
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,060
- And released the planet into the galaxy.

1331
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,640
- There's really only like five space things.

1332
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,940
Okay, what's the next planet?

1333
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,980
- So next planet is Venus, I think.

1334
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,980
- Okay, we're gonna have to figure out some stuff for Venus.

1335
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:42,820
that is uh... i think we we cannot blue or load on making planets

1336
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,620
uh... addressing up

1337
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,340
there are all time will be another day

1338
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:51,820
another another song costumes and new we won't do exactly what we did this time

1339
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,780
and i don't know how the world will be a little different

1340
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,340
and uh... i hope you join us on the rest of this journey you can help me on

1341
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,280
patrion so it's not that it's right so we can be on saturday will be on saturday

1343
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1344
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,920
- Okay, then I, on Saturday, when the next episode drops,

1345

01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,120
I will be in Chi City, Chicago, and maybe--

1347
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,240
- Chi-Rac.

1348
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,240
- If you come to the show and show me that you have a,

1349
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,320
you have OJ the Alien Mercury Rap downloaded to your phone,

1350
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,520
I will sign your phone.

1351
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1352
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,800
And I'm going to be--

1353
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,480
- I didn't think of a good thing.

1354
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,480
Los Angerac Drillifornia on November 17th.

1355
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:49,480
In Los Angerac Drillifornia,

1356
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,440
performing 30 minutes of standup comedy

1357
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,320
with my friend Gus Fiveros at The Yard.

1358
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,040
We're doing two shows, go check out the thing

1359
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:58,880
and buy some tickets there.

1360
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,160
- And that's The Yard, the venue.

1361
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,000
- The Yard, the venue.

1362
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,080
Not performing on a podcast, that would make no sense.

1363
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,800
So if you want to see Planet Chill in real life,

1364
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,560
come on through and I'll buy you a key chain.

1365
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,320
All right, goodbye my friends.

1366
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,360
- Happy planets.

1367
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,720
- Happy planet month. - Happy planet month.

1368
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,560
- Bye.

1369
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,080
- I don't know, when you were sober,

1370
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,100
it was like everyone kind of respected it.

1371
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,560
When I was sober, it was kind of like

1372
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,240
everyone was waiting to have another beer.

1373
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,560
- Yeah, it felt like the doomsday clock was at.

1374
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,080
- Yeah. (laughing)

1375
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,560
- Like it was almost like-- - One minute to midnight.

1376
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:39,180
Like it was almost like we would go out and I would like we'd go to that bar and I would get like a fucking orange soda or something.

1377
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:46,180
And then you would like almost buy me a beer every time.

1378
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:49,820
It's funny when people are straight edge or they used to be alcoholics or something.

1379
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,080
It's so funny to buy them a beer and be like, oh, you don't want it?

1380
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,580
All right, it is mine.

1381
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,960
I think I did that. Yeah, I did that to Brace after the show.

1382
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,120
You got to do it every time.

1383
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah, I had two shots.

1384
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,400
You have to test their gangster willpower.

1385
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:03,900
Yeah.

1386
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,500
I was really good about it for six months.

1387
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,800
It doesn't mean anything.

1388
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,500
If you don't have the willpower to stay straight edge in the face of a friend

1389
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,100
Exactly.

1390
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:18,900
Offering you alcohol, then you don't deserve to wear the badge of honor that is straight edge.

1391
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,000
I 100% agree.

1392
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,100
You should be, every single person in your life who's like an AA or whatever,

1393
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,100
you should be like asking for their chip.

1394
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,100
You should be tricking them.

1395
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,100
You should literally be trying to trick them.

1396
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,100
Yeah, I know it's probably seltzer water.

1397
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,100
And then if you can't smell it before you take a sip,

1398
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,100
you should be, yeah, exactly.

1399
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:39,100
If you don't have the diligence to check for the poison

1400
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,100
that is ruining your life in every single thing that you have.

1401
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,100
Your touch should remove alcohol from liquids.

1402
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,100
You should be making...

1403
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:48,100
You should pick up a cup and the liquid in the cup disappears.

1404
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,100
It becomes...

1405
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,100
And if they don't break on the seltzer trick,

1406
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,100
you should be inviting them over and making alcoholic beef stew

1407
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,900
you and trying to like pouring hard

1408
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,400
be

1409
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,020
and saying and they're two by ten.

1410
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:06,980
No, it's delicious.

1411
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,940
Fifteen percent.

1412
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,740
So you like it.

1413
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,660
I fucking knew it.

1414
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,540
Yeah, they're like alcohol poisoning.

1415
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,740
Fuck is so funny.

1416
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:19,780
God damn.

1417
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,900
They don't make edibles for beer.

1418
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,980
It was sitting with your homies and watching watching a sports game,

1419
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,020
eating beef stew.

1420
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:27,020
That is so funny.

1421
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,020
That would actually be so nice.

1422
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:31,340
Spilling it everywhere, plus sitting with those shallow bowls.

1423
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,340
Six bowls of beef stew each.

1424
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,340
Just dying dude.

1425
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,340
