1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,180
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,000
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,280
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,320
- You realize that when you tell stories,

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,560
you are the hero of the story.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400
So you have to have a happy ending.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,480
You can't just fucking hurt yourself.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,880
- A beginning, a middle, a happy ending.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,560
- I'm just telling you, it's not a story,

13
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,280
it's an anecdote of when I got hurt.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
- What is a story?

15
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,560
- An anecdote is a story.

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
- It was not a story.

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,220
- There was events that happened in that.

18
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,340
story no it was an anecdote there's a set there was a setting note is a boring

19
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,100
story that's exactly what an and that's all I'm good at you're not no that's all

20
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,500
I can tell is anecdotes I don't want to hear about you getting hurt that makes

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:49,260
that makes you take your anecdotes you add a turn it so I went I went to grab

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,300
some beers for my roommates last night and I went down a hill okay on my

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,080
skateboard okay beginning the story beginning beginning and inciting

24
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
incident.

25
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Yep.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,320
And now we have the rising action.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,320
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,840
I it was wet from the rain.

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,520
That's rising action rising.

30
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
It rained previously.

31
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Climax climax.

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Okay.

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,920
And I was trying to do a power slide.

34
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,880
It's a boring climb to to slow down speed.

35
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,880
Still the climax.

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Okay.

37
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
Still the climax.

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
The peak.

39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,160
And then I snowboard slid out.

40
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
Falling action.

41
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
Mm hmm.

42
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Well he's about to have some falling action.

43
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,600
I got a bruise on my hip and my wrist.

44
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,000
So everything low point, low point, low point.

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's what that is.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Low point, yeah.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then my board rolled into a tire and shot back out at me.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,880
Okay, second low point.

49
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,920
But then I picked it up and I walked to the grocery store and I got beers for my friends.

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Happy ending, denouement.

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,200
Yeah, back to, back to, happily ever after.

52
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,680
And then we drank the beers.

53
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Back to the beginning but something's changed now.

54
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes.

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
He has beers.

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
The new normal.

57
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,160
We drank the beers and then I ate some chips.

58
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay, so this is the beginning of a second story.

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
Okay, and then what happened?

60
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,040
The chips were so good that I rubbed my belly.

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,360
Rising action.

62
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,400
I rubbed my belly and I went, "Ooooh."

63
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Oh, that is a big climax.

64
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520
"Ooooh, that's great."

65
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,200
Wow.

66
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,960
That's very exciting.

67
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,800
Actually, I didn't buy chips,

68
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,400
I bought crackers and I had cheese and crackers.

69
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,320
Okay.

70
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,720
This story sucks.

71
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,760
This is the worst story.

72
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,200
Is it possible to plot this straight?

73
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
How am I supposed to make a movie out of this?

74
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,520
That happened in movies like at the end of Clue

75
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,400
where they just like they go for like 10 minutes like oh wait no actually though

76
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,040
no no it was something different that's what they do at the end of clue there's

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,080
no I'm saying like at the end of clue if movies did that you should have this in

78
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,360
the middle like you know in Star Wars like oh wait no no no no no no Darth

79
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,320
Vader he wasn't that wasn't true that was like is we'll think of something

80
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,880
else yeah the chips are poker chips actually and they were it was a million

81
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,840

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,160
He sent us a picture? Yeah a picture of his decayed flesh on half of his body.

88
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, I see I didn't even recognize him. Yeah, I mean the bone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a guy served him at a restaurant

95
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,560
Laughter's the best money. I don't need money. I need money. I want money. I'd rather I

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,220
Yeah, I just the best money, but not for way to bars

I give my laughter away cuz I'm like charitable laughter is like way more

98
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,180
important than money so I give away my laughter and I just keep the money

99
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,180
return is money basically nothing it's what paper made of dirt yeah it's

100
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,220
basically nothing man it's paper made out of it's metal made out of circles

101
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,500
what is what it's just like a t-shirt pretty much like cutting a bunch of

102
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,340
second yeah what is learned what money is this is a credit card that's wiggly

- I know, come on, the money I get is wet.

105
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,940
- This is a credit card from the bottom of your shoe

106
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,860
that's crumpled up?

107
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,700
- It doesn't make any sense.

108
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,520
- All the money I get is so wet.

109
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,900
- A credit card with a spending limit of one dollar?

110
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,100
And I never have to pay it off?

111
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,020
You guys wanna see something cool?

114
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,300
- Yeah.

115
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,140

116
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,260
- Let me put that up to my butt.

117
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
- Are we gonna play?

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,940
- Are we gonna play with this today?

119
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,780
- I mean, you tell me.

120
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,940
No, wait, I have to calibrate it first.

121
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,260
Let's do it quick. - We also have to...

122
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,100
- Oh yeah, we--

123
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,060
- We have to explain.

124
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,860
I mean, not everybody has seen the news, I'm sure.

125
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,940
- I've had a gas leak in my house

126
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,380
for maybe since I moved in.

127
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,220
And I--

128
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,700
- Which is over a year.

129
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,740
- So yesterday, so I bought this thing

130
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,180
'cause I was like, first of all, this is cool to have.

131
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,500
Also, I've been smelling gas.

132
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,420
Maybe there's something, maybe I have a gas leak.

133
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,260
Who knows?

134
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,400
- There's literally been, there's been so many instances

135
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
on the show where we've recorded here and been like,

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,360
there's like a gas leak or something.

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,700
Does that mean there's still gas?

138
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,680
- Put this on your penis.

139
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
Okay.

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,060
(loud buzzing)

141
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,900
Wow.

142
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,840
That's an alert, that's a red alert.

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Did that feel good or what?

144
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,800
It felt, I know that my penis extrudes gas now.

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,640
Wrong word.

146
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
Expunges gas.

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,560
Wrong word.

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Expels gas.

149
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,220
Yeah.

150
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,380
Oh, that was pretty good.

151
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,340
Yes, I had a gas leak and I was,

152
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,060
I literally, I just, I turned this on for shits and giggles.

153
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,020
I was like, oh, it'd be funny if I had a gas leak,

154
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,900
started moving around my apartment and I was like I got near the oven and I was

155
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,020
and it like went up one bar and I was like oh that's all interest I was like

156
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,740
okay well that makes sense this is where gas comes out I'm sure there's some

157
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,180
residual gas around here and then I put it behind my oven and it hit the maximum

158
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,260
reading on the thing and I was like okay I'm fucking out of here so I love there's

159
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,540
that fucking the video you made with Joe and Alex you literally say there's a gas

160
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,540
There's a catholic in my oven.

161
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Yeah, dude, God was telling me something I didn't even know.

162
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,540
But I, then I called National Grid, they came out,

163
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,540
and the two guys seemed like very non-plus, you know,

164
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
they do this shit, they do this all the time, right?

165
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah.

166
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,540
Until they got to my oven, and they put their meter,

167
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
which is more sensitive and has a higher cap than this one,

168
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,540
behind my oven, and the guy, who again, does this all day,

169
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,780
It's his only job is investigating these things.

170
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,320
He goes, "Holy fuck!"

171
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,300
(laughing)

172
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,340
- Dude, how, like, it makes so much shit make sense.

173
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,180
- Dude, I literally--

174
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,220
- I feel like we've lost the fifth member of the show.

175
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,200
- Dude, I literally have just spent like every,

176
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,420
the fifth member of the show.

177
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,260
- Yeah, Patches.

178
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,380
- Yeah, but he's not in these ones.

179
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,180
- Yeah, but he's the fourth member of the show.

180
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,460
- I'm kicking him out of the podcast.

181
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,300
- Wow.

182
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,120
- Yeah.

183
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
- Patches, we're starting here first.

184
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,780
- We heard it here first.

185
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,620
- Yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,540
I like just sit in my apartment all day for the last year just like, "Oh, how am I so

187
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
tired?"

188
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,340
And then I walk outside and I'm like, "I feel incredible.

189
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,420
Outside is amazing and my apartment makes me feel so sleepy."

190
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,860
And so I think it might have been a mixture of natural gas and carbon monoxide.

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,180
My brain hasn't been getting enough oxygen for close to a year now.

192
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
Maybe even longer.

193
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
I mean, truly, I don't know.

194
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
That's sick.

195
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,180
I mean, completely.

196
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,740
And they showed me the fucking-- you can look at the tube behind my oven.

197
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,740
Just a giant hole in the tube.

198
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,740
Just like a huge ass hole.

199
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,740
And it's just been spraying gas.

200
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,740
That's sick. Do you think maybe

201
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
your mice friends did that?

202
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
I maybe considered that, but then

203
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,740
I was like, a mouse doesn't like eat metal.

204
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,740
They do.

205
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I don't think so. Every mouse eats metal.

206
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
I don't think a mouse can eat straight through a metal

207
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,740
post. Maybe it wasn't eating it, maybe it was

208
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,740
like grabbing onto it.

209
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,740
You know, and swinging on it

210
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,740
like parallel bars. It could be, yeah.

211
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,100
I don't think so, but you could be right.

212
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,060
That could be it though.

213
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,780
Yeah, he's having a little adventure back there.

214
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,620
He's trying to get ingredients to come back to his house.

215
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
It could be like a gremlin who did it too.

216
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,460
Like a gremlin with a grill.

217
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,700
They put a sticker out front of my apartment.

218
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,820
I don't know if you guys saw it on the way in.

219
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,460
It says, "Warning of hazardous conditions."

220
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,060
It's still hazardous.

221
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,380
It just says you can't, no, it's not still hazardous.

222
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,700
It just says that you can't--

223
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Set it on fire.

224
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,020
Don't set my house on fire yet.

225
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
Right, 'cause--

226
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,940
But I do still have this.

227
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,220
It'll go on fire too good.

228
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,060
I guess it's good that you don't--

229
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,180
I'm gonna actually calibrate it and I'm gonna try to burp into it. I guess it's

230
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,700
good that you don't like smoke weed. I do smoke weed.

231
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,420
That's the window right next to the... Oh right yeah you've burned

232
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,540
incense. Also right next to the oven, that's the window that I

233
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:13,980
will smoke cigarettes out of sometimes. That's crazy. We got him. Caleb's

234
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,480
landlord if you're listening. Alright let's try this out. Okay.

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
[Laughter]

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Holy shit.

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
[Laughter]

238
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
It hit four bars on that.

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
There's only six bars on the thing.

240
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
[Laughter]

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
[Laughter]

242
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
[Laughter]

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Clearly there's some...

244
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
[Laughter]

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
That's crazy.

246
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
It's like a breathalyzer for farts.

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,980
super.

248
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,880
There's a residual.

249
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,480
Body

250
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,080
oh my God.

251
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,280
Burr

252
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,580
yeah, it's

253
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,580
pretty fun little is true. Yeah. I mean somebody has to fart into it. Yeah.

254
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,380
Yeah, let me know if anyone has to fart will will stop whatever we're talking

255
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,180
about and will the thing is like we should have worries you can't eat it's

256
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,340
raise your hand about like like yesterday I was like before record I'm

257
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,180
gonna eat like a fucking just a can of pinto beans cold or something but I

258
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,660
forgot to get him this morning damn yeah that would have been so funny I'll be

259
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:34,420
great because my birds are doing that it actually might catch on fire if I yeah

260
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,180
that thing's diabolical but yes now I'm recovering from my gas leak brain there's

261
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,500
There's so many times, literally, I think I've said the word "gas leak" in this apartment

262
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
probably 50 times.

263
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Specifically in this apartment, yeah.

264
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,180
50 times in my life.

265
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Do you guys feel different?

266
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
Do you feel different in here?

267
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
No.

268
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
A little bit.

269
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
Do you feel like you can take a deeper breath?

270
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
No.

271
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
I mean...

272
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,180
I feel completely normal.

273
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
Most of the time.

274
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
You're in every way.

275
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,020
Like sometimes there's like, I'll come here and I'm out of breath already because I like

276
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,340
skated over or like walked over.

277
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Mm-hmm.

278
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,740
And honestly, it feels no different.

279
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
Yeah?

280
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
Still feeling out of breath?

281
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Yeah.

282
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I feel amazing, dude.

283
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Yeah?

284
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I feel incredible.

285
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,700
I don't know if it's just, I mean, it's definitely my brain pulling a trick on me, but it also,

286
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,180
I read that if there was trace amounts of carbon monoxide in there and I got poisoned,

287
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,020
it'll take 120 days for me to recover, for all my platelets to be replaced.

288
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Holy shit.

289
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,220
They have been deoxygenated.

290
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,900
So you have about 120 more days before I even know who I am anymore.

291
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Right.

292
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,460
Yeah, because of the effects of the gas leak.

293
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,340
It would be so funny if like 120 days later you like test into like Yale.

294
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,740
Well, I've been, dude, I've literally for the last year been saying, like I feel stupider

295
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,260
since moving here.

296
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,060
Like I feel noticeably stupider.

297
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,140
I barely have an attention span.

298
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,060
I can't like read a book for more than like 20 pages.

299
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,500
And that's crazy.

300
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,660
- Yeah, and I think it might be that I have had a gas leak

301
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,220
and that my brain has been, I've been neurotoxined.

302
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,060
Could be, yeah.

303
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,880
- Goddamn.

304
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,620
Well, I mean, I can imagine like,

305
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,720
we've probably got 60 days.

306
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,260
- I've also got a lot worse than,

307
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,900
I've been a lot worse at singing.

308
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,740
- Yeah.

309
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,560
- Yeah.

310
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,400
- That makes sense.

311
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,060
- I think I've lost my key.

312
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,900
- Yes.

313
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,720
- He's at perfect pitch.

314
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
- Sing something.

315
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,400
- Gas makes singing so hard.

316
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,240
- What should I sing?

317
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,320
Just sing something.

318
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,760
You got the right temperature for shelter me you from the storm.

319
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,480
Oh I'm gonna gonna run around thinking turn you on.

320
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Angola.

321
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,280
When I meet a papa you can be the mom.

322
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Oh oh when you roll with a player like me with a brother like me there is no other.

323
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,360
A cloud like obscured the sun when you started singing.

324
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,920
See that's a sign dude.

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
My perfect pitch has been robbed.

326
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
God is turning his back on you.

327
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Robbed for me.

328
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,240
I used to sing all kinds of cool songs.

329
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah.

330
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
I remember your ditties.

331

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Does it try to order like that at the deli? There is a house in New Orleans. Can I get two pounds of cheese?

351
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,480
They do mother eyes instead. And roses too. I see. We're gonna do the whole episode like this.

352
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,880
It hurts me. It's one of the most fun voices. It's so fun but it's just you

353
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
can't do it for more than 30 seconds. What are you talking about I could do it for

354
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,480
way more than 30 seconds. You're not rolling. I can do it way longer than that.

355
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,200
You need to be heard. It feels like there's a dust in my voice.

356
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,440
When I do it it feels like there's a natural baritone. I feel like I have a dust in me.

357
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:30,240
beautiful baritone. You do have a beautiful baritone. You do. Pull it out. Yes I do. Do a normal baritone.

358
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:38,320
And I have a beautiful alto. Yeah. Man we gotta... Can we we keep keep each other company?

359
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,800
Oh company. You don't have to call. Yeah that's right.

360
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,920
You need to sing something beautiful right now. I did. What'd you sing? This is the sing-along

361
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,080
episode. All right what should I sing? I gotta testify, come up in the spot

362
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,920
looking extra fly, till the day I die. That's a rap, that's not singing. I gotta testify, come up in the spot.

363
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Twinkle, twinkle little star. This sucks. How I wonder what. See the gas leak's fixed guys. There's nothing weird in here anymore and we feel normal. Oh my god. I feel beautiful. I don't feel completely normal.

364
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,880
Oh yeah, see that's that's I'm glad that I immediately felt normal because if it if

365
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,360
I just felt the same I would have probably probably ended my own life.

366
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,680
Hmm yeah I probably would have gone over to that their gas valve.

367
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,040
I mean they claimed they teed off.

368
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Concussion and gas leak.

369
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,000
Well it's not even back-to-back it's middle of yeah I got concussed.

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,120
My brain has been through the ringer you know and now Mac would like the ringer.

371
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,560
You know what I'm saying?

372
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,560
I know exactly what you're saying.

373
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Because I'm athletic.

374
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Right.

375
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,560
And I can do hurdles better than some people at least.

376
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Yeah.

377
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Crazy Brian Cox is in that movie as the evil uncle.

378
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,560
Yeah he's kind of a, it's like, was that after Rip Torn died?

379
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Feels like he's just kind of doing Rip.

380
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
No, Rip Torn died like pretty recently.

381
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
It feels like he was just doing Rip Torn in that movie, right?

382
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
They kind of just couldn't get Rip.

383
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Yeah, he was busy with dodgeball.

384
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Yeah, so they got little Brian Cox.

385
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Is Rip his full first name?

386
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
His name is, I think...

387
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Is it Ripley?

388
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,560
It's not, no, it's a nickname, but it was his dad's nickname too.

389
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,560
So his dad was also Rip Torn, and he went by Rip Torn,

390
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,560
and then he had a brother who also went by Rip Torn.

391
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
That's not, that shouldn't be allowed.

392
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
I don't like names like that.

393
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Army Hammer, Rip Torn, you know, just fucking, just get a normal...

394
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Absolutely.

395
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
I want your first name and your last name should be complete opposites.

396
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Whoa.

397
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,360
What if Torrin's real name was Elmore Ruall Torrin Jr.

398
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,560
Whoa that's cool as fuck.

399
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
Elmore.

400
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,440
Elmore Torrin?

401
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
That's a good name.

402
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah that was wasted.

403
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
Elmore is a better name.

404
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
Not even Elmer, Elmore.

405
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,160
I wish he would L less.

406
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,360
He didn't catch a single L his entire life dude.

407
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Yeah exactly.

408
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,040
He had an ideal life.

409
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Did dodgeball.

410
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
He should L less.

411
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,120
Except when he died.

412
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,320
That honestly has ruined so many lives.

413
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,160
his life for sure. Oh great life is my life's officially ruined I died. Oh crap

414
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
my life is over I'm dead. Great. Oh this is so embarrassing I just died at the mall

415
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,720
and all my friends saw it my life is over. I've also been here. I can never go

416
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,440
back to high school again. Only in this house I just have crazy dreams every

417
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,080
single night that then I wake up and I text you guys about sometimes. Mm-hmm. But

418
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,240
any anytime I sleep anywhere else I've had almost a perfect dreamless sleep

419
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,940
every time. I don't dream anymore really. If I do it feels very lucid and it scares me.

420
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,640
I would say dreaming is a byproduct of a gas leak. I hate dreaming. Me too man. It sucks.

421
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,320
I had a dream where I was in a dark realm the other day. It sucked. I woke up I was in a

422
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,320
dark realm version of my apartment. There's spirits everywhere. I had one eye. Couldn't

423
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,280
use my right arm. I was walking around I was like this is fucking fucked man. Dude I have

424
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
I dream. It's just always make me sleepwalk. I'll have I'll have dreams

425
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,320
where it's like I think I've definitely talked about this. I've had dreams where

426
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm like landing skate tricks. That is cool though. And then I wake up and I'm

427
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,080
like I'll never I'll never be able to do that. I never have a dream that's like

428
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,560
aspirational. The only dreams I have nowadays that are like it's either like

429
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,680
stress nightmares or I'll have a dream where it's like my dream in my dream I'm

430
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,800
like I need to open the window shade and then I sit up and open the window shade.

431
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,080
horrible. You might have the burbiglia disease. What's that? Where he has he

432
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,760
sleepwalks and does crazy shit and he like jumped out of a window. I haven't

433
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,360
jumped out of a window yet. Well I think he hadn't done that either until he

434
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,120
jumped out of a window. I don't think I've done anything that would approach

435
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,480
that though. It's mostly opening the window shades and putting on pants. Those

436
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,240
are the two things I usually do. You never know man. You might have a window

437
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,400
dream pretty soon. Who knows I mean if if I who knows what I do after I put on

438
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,120
pants probably put on a shirt but after that it could be anyone's guess. You

439
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,800
should go the other way around. What other way around? Put the shirt on first

440
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,520
put the pants on last. I would if I was awake. I put my shirt on first. Yeah. I

441
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,520
always do. I always put the pants on first. I put the pants on first

442
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:21,160
usually. I go underwear. I go bottom. I usually put underwear on last. Yeah that's typically my rule. I'm totally

443
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,440
serious and then for me the first would have to be my hat. Mm-hmm. First hat. That

444
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,540
- It makes it really hard though.

445
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,260
- Then I put my shirt on and all my shirts have,

446
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,900
I use extra wide collars.

447
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,300
- Do you guys sleep in your chain?

448
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,220
- I sleep in my clothes.

449
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

450
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,000
- I sleep wearing my chain and I wake up

451
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,780
and it'll be like, on my face or like--

452
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,180
- You ever wake up and you ever get caught on something

453
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
and it's choking you to death?

454
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,500
- It's gotten caught on my chest hair before.

455
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,820
- That's horrible. - I've had to yank it out, yeah.

456
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,660
- That sucks.

457
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,860
- Man, getting a chain was the best decision.

458
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,100
- Do you guys sleep with all-- - I look so sick.

459
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,940
all the with a popped bubble gum bubble on your face yeah a big

460
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,580
giant pop bubble bubble. Do you sleep with a feather on your nose?

461
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,260
Yeah sometimes. Yeah you go oh me me me me. It's just to make sure that Jana knows that I'm

462
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,980
breathing. Yeah. She gets worried sometimes. Do you guys use like nose and mouth and ear plugs?

463
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah yeah of course. I breathe I breathe through the you know that like a little bit of air.

464
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,620
Yeah. You get through your eyes. Do you guys usually let you guys usually fold up the Murphy

465
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,700
bed when you're sleeping in it? Yeah I let it fold up. I have a secret bed that folds out of my

466
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,420
my door. It's in my door and I fold myself back in. I really like being squished.

467
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,940
Yeah. I like the great Muppet caper when they all get stuck in the Murphy bed.

468
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,500
Yeah.

469
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,660
Ever since I saw that as a kid, I've always wanted to swing up into a Murphy bed.

470
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,740
Weren't you telling me that you got stuck in Murphy's bed?

471
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,100
I got stuck in Murphy's bed but not in a Murphy bed. Yeah, Murphy Browns.

472
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,340
Cool.

473
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,740
Yeah, I'm the-- I was one of Murphy Brown's boyfriends. I've never seen that show.

474
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,860
No. I thought Murphy Brown is what they call Frosty the Snowman.

475
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,100
That's-- that's in the spring. That's when he's made out of mud.

476
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,020
They call him Murphy Brown?

477
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,460
No. Oh, you're thinking of Parson Brown.

478
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,420
Parson Brown.

479
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,980
Yeah. Do you remember that guy, Parson Brown?

480
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,780
No, I don't remember him. I just told you. I thought-- first of all,

481
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,780
I thought he's a different guy. Second of all, I only know him from Frosty the Snowman, the song.

482
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,340
Isn't that Frosty the snowman? He's Parson Brown the snowman. And they call him Parson Brown.

483
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,740
And he can do the job when you're in town. He's Brown the snowman. Who do they call

484
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,340
Parson Brown? Is it Frosty? No, they build the snowman and then they pretend he's Parson Brown

485
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,140
and then he asks you if you're married and then you say no man and he says well you can do the

486
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,100
job when you're in town. No, you're right that's not Frosty. It's different. Frosty would never ask

487
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:53,500
that by the fire you'll have a sexual desire yeah you'll have a sexual desire

488
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,460
for Parson Brown right that makes sense to me he was like so crazy in the 70s

489
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,980
though Parson Brown he was honestly like he changed the game yeah yeah yeah well

490
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,520
there's like all those pictures of him at like studio 54 yeah shit yeah like

491
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,340
Elton John yeah yeah and they're like they're bringing you died in the hot tub

492
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:20,620
- yeah he died in the hot tub cuz he melted yeah he took all those drugs

493
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,060
really hot

494
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,500
heating up the spoon to put in your vein and then he was like oh my gloves on

495
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,220
fire so he jumped in the hot tub yeah what a tragic loss yeah dude I did yeah

496
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,340
but then they had that tribute show to him or like Prince play I was just gonna

497
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,000
I say Prince. Yeah, we're really close right. It's played like while my guitar

498
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,040
gently a lot of a lot of people got kind of mad. They thought that Prince was the

499
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,260
one to kind of like put them on all that shit. Prince used to be like yo try

500
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,860
that try the fire pill like the fire. You know it's like a little ball of fire and

501
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,780
person was like super green like he was literally from the ground. Yeah, like he

502
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,660
did not know what was going on really actually. He also didn't speak any

503
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,860
English like kind of because he was never in school. Well he spoke. I mean he

504
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,500
speaks the sentences that are in the song. If you learn those from like a phrase book.

505
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,900
He can say, "Are you married?" and that was about it. It's like guys who like

506
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,500
Mexican coaches speak, "Do you know where the bathroom is?"

507
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,620
Really? He'd say, "Are you married?" and they'd say, "No man."

508
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,620
And he'd say, "We can do the job in the bathroom."

509
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,260
"Kay?" He'd say that a bunch. He didn't understand what they were saying back then.

510
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,500
He knew one Spanish word and one phrase in English.

511
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,180
And all the rest was in Snowy's.

512
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,660
Yeah, which almost nobody speaks anymore.

513
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,780
Right, except Santa and his elves.

514
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,460
Yeah, you say like ho ho ho, there's like a million different things that could mean.

515
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:41,700
Exactly.

516
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,900
It's like aloha.

517
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

518
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,260
Aloha can mean almost anything.

519
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,980
It can mean get out of my house.

520
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,020
Get out of my house, you're touching all my shit.

521
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,300
Stop touching all my shit, get out of my damn house.

522
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,620
Exactly.

523
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,660
And that's why they say aloha.

524
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,820
Aloha is, yeah, it can mean...

525
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,220
Maybe the gas is still on.

526
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,420
It can mean like, I'm gonna surf this big wave, I'm gonna sit down and watch you surf this big wave,

527
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,980
I'm gonna sit down and I'll watch TV, I'm gonna sit down and turn the TV off, I'm gonna stand up

528
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,580
and watch TV, I'm going down to the beach to watch you surf this big wave, I'm gonna sit at the beach,

529
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,340
I'm going on the beach, I'm going home from the beach to watch TV, I mean there's just like a

530
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,340
million meanings. I mean what's the deal with these Hawaiians though? I know. Hey Pat, you want to weigh

531
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,360
- I'm not weighing on this one.

532
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,820
- Not again.

533
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,660
- I want a rating from one to 10

534
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,500
(laughing)

535
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,700
on what you think of Hawaii

536
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,300
and the people that live there indigenously.

537
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,100
- I think that--

538
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,380
- Indigenously.

539
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,780
(laughing)

540
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,900
- I just wanna make sure it's clear

541
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,220
what Pat's talking about.

542
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,460
- I'm just chilling, honestly.

543
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,820
I'm like doing so much in my life right now.

544
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,660
- Blow the vape smoke--

545
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,540
- Oh, that's smart.

546
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,380
- Oh yeah, let's see that.

547
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,180
- Blow the vape smoke into the gas detector.

548
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,540
- I gotta calibrate it, hold on.

549
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,140
(laughing)

550
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,380
I love that it makes like a fallout.

551
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,660
It sounds like the mousetrap timer.

552
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,860
I don't know that.

553
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,900
I think it's a cool, I've used it so much it's already saying low battery.

554
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,860
Just put batteries in it.

555
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,900
Maybe the warning for the gas was just...

556
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,740
Alright, I'm going to do it.

557
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,740
Okay.

558
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,180
Wait, hold on, I've got to calibrate it more.

559
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,100
This thing loves being calibrated.

560
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,100
Whoa.

561
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Okay, let's try it.

562
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Alright.

563
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Let's see if this vape is made of gas.

564
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:34,020
Oh my God, the smoke's coming out the tube. I I breathe that in every four

565
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,220
minutes. That's pretty good. Yeah, that's pretty good. It's pretty good

566
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,220
smoke though, like the vapes the vapor is just coming out of like every

567
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,620
couldn't even handle it. It looked like it was on fire. I think I need more

568
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,900
devices that can detect dude detecting absolutely the vice. I think I might get

569
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:00,020
needed detection. I mean it like I kind of want to get a metal detector. Metal

570
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,520
detector is not, yeah. I was just going to say. How we never talked about metal

571
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,820
detecting before? I had a metal detector when I was a kid. It's so cool. Yeah. I

572
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,460
got one for my birthday or for Christmas or something. I would just do it in like

573
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,420
my backyard. It's just like, oh, yeah. Well, there's a, I should have taken you

574
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,620
guys here. There's an island. There's an island in North Carolina called Topsal

575
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,380
beach which is apparently where Blackbeard buried his shit.

576
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,380
That's cool.

577
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,380
Yeah, so there's like...

578
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,380
Yeah.

579
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,940
I mean, that's like his last recorded place was Topsail Beach.

580
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,380
I mean, this guy's also a pirate, so he might have been fucking lying.

581
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
Yeah.

582
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,100
You know, he might have went to Las Vegas.

583
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Yeah.

584
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
But yeah.

585
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
You gotta gamble me winnings.

586
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,140
There's a bunch of shipwrecks and shit around there.

587
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,740
When I had my metal detector as a kid, I was like hanging out with one of my friends and

588
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,620
I like he's wearing like a baseball cap and I was like I was holding it

589
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,500
because you know they had the little metal thing like at the top of it and I

590
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,340
would hold the I like held the detector over his head and like it would like go

591
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,780
like beep beep beep and I'm like dude you have to go to the doctor like there's

592
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:09,460
yeah I would love like honestly I feel like there is a 20% chance I will find

593
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,980
treasure in my life hmm like I feel like I have a pretty good luck with stuff

594
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:21,660
like that. And I feel like I have a true cosmic feeling that I will find a bunch of gold bars

595
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,180
or something. That would be cool. I actually thought this so earnestly, again, gas leak

596
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,740
in my home for a long time, that about a month ago I googled how many gold bars would make

597
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,340
me a millionaire. I was like, I should shoot to find that many gold bars. How many was

598
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,940
it? Sixteen. Only sixteen? Depends on the size though. If it was the big ones, it would

599
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,860
only be five. That makes sense. Yeah. Well, there's big ones that are like 200 gram or

600
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,860
something yeah and those are the those are those ones you'd only need probably

601
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,180
five to be a millionaire I think they're the ones that are a thousand gram you'd

602
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,440
only need one yeah it would be just so I'm such a bitch to carry that not for

603
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,060
me strength yeah I'd probably just walk around with them I'd probably not I'd

604
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,700
probably forget there were you on me well it's like yeah it's like this I

605
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,100
think I in your pocket I would like to buy this restaurant that's what I would

606
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,300
do are on the counter what I would do that if I had gold bars I like found

607
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,420
gold bars I definitely wouldn't sell them yeah I would have people like I

608
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,780
I would even put them in the bank.

609
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,900
I'd just, I'd carry around a little like potato peeler and I'd shave off little pieces of gold

610
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,380
to give to people instead of money, you know.

611
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:30,260
Because if it's $250,000 for the entire bar, then that means there's $250,000 valued little

612
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,500
shavings that I can give people that make up the bar, you know.

613
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,020
And who cares if it's exact, you know.

614
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,820
I'm a gold, I'm a goldenare.

615
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,820
A goldenare.

616
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
I don't care anymore.

617
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Yeah.

618
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm a goldenare.

619
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,300
like a cookie cutter type thing that just like presses out coins off you know it

620
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:53,220
stink what you did that would stink pretty bad

621
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,620
it would seem to be on a treasure hunt and you finally get the big hit you

622
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,500
fucking dig down 10 feet or ever spent all day doing that maybe even takes two

623
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,540
days then you you open up the you find a chest you're like this is I've struck

624
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,760
gold you say that out loud I've struck gold you open it up silver that'd be

625
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,860
fine for me I like silver mm-hmm it's not worth as I probably find that where

626
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,660
I probably found diamonds though in my scenario I've done a platinum together

627
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,460
I'd find out a first try I found the dragon's horde so it's like diamonds

628
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,900
aren't worth a single thing in this story that you told I already had found

629
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,700
the dragon's horde with treasure a gore so the dragon's horde was found like

630
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,480
forever go as some soviet by me no yes i you it was by me i have it

631
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,720
in my treasure box

632
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,340
but i think that uh...

633
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,980
again

634
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,040
as awesome

635
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,800
disregard when does so cool as we are going on i'll uh... i still love

636
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,140
gargling

637
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,120
that

638
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,820
you know it's not going to let's say it is a blown bubbles in the drinks

639
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,540
you know i don't know what you know

640
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,780
yet you know when the milk about your nose

641
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,780
i was that's when you know you let him

642
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,140
I forget you laughing when you spit out that food. Forget who I was with, but I

643
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,140
thought it was really funny to blow bubbles into a gin and tonic.

644
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,420
When you're sitting across from them, when you shoot the boogers in the tissue, you

645
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,380
know you're sneezing.

646
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Mm-hmm. What's the funniest food to do a spit take with?

647
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,300
Probably a bunch of ham. Yeah, something with bones in it. Yeah.

648
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,460
Yeah, bone or maybe just bones. Bones. Yeah. Maybe a fish skeleton.

649
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,540
Ribs. Yeah, ribs would be perfect. Or you put a whole fish in your mouth and

650
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,540
and then you shoot out the entire

651
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,540
hit you need in the face or a bunch of

652
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
chili like an entire crock pot of

653
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,540
chili. I guess you don't spit take food.

654
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,540
Usually it's usually some kind of liquid. Yeah, funny as

655
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,540
liquid would be like that's why it's fun. That's

656
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,540
why it's funny. True to be

657
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
for it to be food. Yeah,

658
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,540
I guess you're yeah, but

659
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,540
most people don't laugh that hard that they need to spit

660
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
their food out or like

661
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,540
if it may be just like a single

662
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
like like concentrated stream of

663
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,540
of boiling hot oil.

664
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,660
Yeah, that melts anything in its path. Yeah, man, rose of acid magma will be

665
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,900
Whole right there. So that'll be funny or a laser beam. Yeah, that'd be pretty funny

666
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,680
Yeah, if you're eating a laser beam and yeah, I mean we're just going for laughs. Oh, yeah, let's see a dozen eggs

667
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,060
Yeah, that'd be funny ping-pong balls. I might also be funny. Yeah toilet paper

668
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:28,680
What else would be funny? Maybe a Ruben? Oh, hold up. Hold up popcorn or um a

669
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,680
shoot out you eat like a bunch of watermelon and all the seeds yeah like

670
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:43,360
ball bearings maybe ball bearing could be banana peels or fake vomit or maybe

671
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,280
Chinese finger trap that would be cushion shoot up gumball but because

672
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,760
when you spit take it comes out as a bubble

673
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,100
bubble bubble like bubble mixture maybe a whole cup you ever tried a flag in you

674
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:10,440
ever as a kid drink bubbles and then try to burp out bubbles like this like I

675
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,920
didn't live in in the whatever candy land you grew up in where you thought

676
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,220
you see that you see that in a movie or in a cartoon like kids are like I you

677
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,700
You know what I did when I looked at cartoons?

678
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,140
Like the bubble, the stuff you make bubbles with.

679
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,660
Yeah, I didn't do that.

680
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
Yeah, well I guess I was a very smart kid.

681
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,660
I guess I was a very impressionable kid.

682
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Well you looked at-

683
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,340
You probably also drank a poison potion based on movies.

684
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,340
Yeah.

685
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:42,220
You ever eat an apple and get so sick that you fall into a coma until you become kissed?

686
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,620
I did that all the time because I saw it on a cartoon.

687
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,340
I would like told you guys like two days ago. I smoke weed when I was nine.

688
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,220
That's true. I saw them in Woodstock. Yeah. I basically like eat a hot pepper and run

689
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,460
around turn red and shoot steam out and run around and bounce around out

690
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,980
everywhere so. It was mad embarrassing when I was a kid. Yeah no I was like so

691
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,380
strange. I like ate a piano and the keys were my teeth too. It was like I felt like

692
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,620
weird doing that but it was like fun. Remember when Nancy Reagan tried to get the Looney Tunes

693
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,020
taken off a TV because they were a bad influence on. You're thinking of Marge Simpson.

694
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,100
I remember that, I was like two years old when they said that.

695
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,540
So many kids are painting streets on the...

696
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,660
I wasn't alive for the Reagan administration, motherfucker.

697
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,720
You weren't alive for when Nancy Reagan was saying that too many kids were walking off

698
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,700
a cliff and standing there for a minute looking down and then realizing that they were going

699
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,740
to fall and that's when they fell?

700
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,220
Wait, are you thinking of cartoon logic?

701
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220
God, I love it.

702
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
No, wait, no, no, you're thinking of Tibber Gore.

703
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,220
Huh?

704
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,220
You're thinking of Tibber Gore.

705
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
I'm going to put my tip in you until you're gored.

706
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,620
(laughing)

707
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,460
- Okay.

708
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,280
- Checkmate.

709
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,420
- Yeah.

710
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,260
- That's right.

711
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,820
- That, that fuckin'.

712
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,900
- That burn was epic?

713
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,740
Yeah, you're right.

714
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,780
- That was a good burn, honestly.

715
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,060
- Yeah, thank you.

716
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,900
I think I might post that.

717
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,820
- Was that trial?

718
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,960
When she put Twisted Sister on trial?

719
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,580
- Did they put Twisted Metal on trial?

720
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,420
- Yeah.

721
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
- Yeah.

722
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,080
- Time trial, to see how fast I can go around the track.

723
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,860
- This is making kids go too much, too fast.

724
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,700
And they're too mean when they drive.

725
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,100
- These kids are trying to turn their arms into wheels.

726
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,500
- Yeah, great, awesome, cool.

727
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,660
- Okay, this kid's got a flaming clown mask.

728
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,940
- Okay, great.

729
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,780
- Yeah. - Awesome.

730
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,740
- What is he, some kind of evil clown now?

731
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,620
- Great, this kid's granting wishes.

732
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,900
- Oh. - This kid's holding

733
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,860
a tournament to grant ultimate wishes.

734
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,820
- Okay, this kid wants-- - Is that what we want?

735
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,660
- Yes! - Yes!

736
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,380
- So, ultimate wish? - Calypso.

737
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
- You don't want an ultimate wish?

738
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,660
What is your deal?

739
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,980
- Every video game is about an ultimate wish.

740
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,540
- There's not a catch. - Everything where someone

741
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,300
fights someone else is about an ultimate wish.

742
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,940
- Right, like "Coggedy Modern Warfare 2"

743
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,860
is the wish to destabilize Iraq.

744
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,860
exactly

745
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,120

746
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,140
political and what else i don't know what else what else politically and call of

747
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,160

748
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,440

749
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,920

750
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,540

751
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,280

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,280
i'd be snatched away i would be on the other hand i think all their thing to

754
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,880
I know you guys are friends with him, but I'm not.

755
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
I don't fuck with him anymore.

756
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
I do not fuck with him.

757
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,280
Yeah, no, he was like weird at one time.

758
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Yeah.

759
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
I found out he was like weird to women.

760
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Yeah.

761
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
I don't like him.

762
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,680
And I mean a lot of other people too.

763
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,040
Nah, I only heard about women.

764
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,440
Yeah, Hitler was like mad weird to Jewish people.

765
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,920
He was just like weird, you know?

766
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
It was like clear to the--

767
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,400
He was just like, yeah, just misbehaving.

768
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,840
He was just like, I don't--

769
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
He just like--

770
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,920
And he was racist.

771
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,720
I heard honestly just like some real out of pocket shit.

772
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,800
He's just putting out weird vibes too.

773
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,040
When I last I was with him, he was just like...

774
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,800
Plus he would always be like, "Yo, check out my music,

775
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,640
check out my music."

776
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
Yeah, he would corner people and talk about his music.

777
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,640
Yeah, and it's like, "Dude, IBM is over."

778
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,080
Like, you don't know he's making IBM anymore.

779
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,280
Nobody has a fucking cassette player either.

780
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,920
Like he's like trying to sell cassettes to people

781
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,760
for like $20.

782
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,080
He loves Apex Twin.

783
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,320
Yeah, no, it's like, "Get over it."

784
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,280
Yeah.

785
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
It's like, "Dude, you're not gonna be..."

786
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,720
You're not gonna be the next James Murphy.

787
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,640
Exactly, dude.

788
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah, and I know that you guys are already friends like Barry like you burial like you're just ripping off burial

789
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,460
Absolutely, like yeah, this complete just garage rip. Yeah, you're not even from like the UK. This is feels just weird

790
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,400
You know, yeah, and what he did since like bad - it's going

791
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Just killing he was a killer plus. He's a killer. He crushed on stage. I'll say that much

792
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,160
absolute killer

793
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,680
He used to do I always said do open mics, bro

794
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:25,920
Yeah

795
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,120
And then he would go and he crushed you to kill and I'd be like, dude

796
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,120

797
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,360
like prove to myself I could do it." Yeah, you know. Yeah, it's like dude, just like

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,720
Yeah, like you like already made it. Like you have rich parents, you know. Yeah.

800
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,800
Just fucking, just do it. Yeah. A lot of people think he didn't go to art school. He did.

801
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,520
He did and he was like pretty good, you know. I've actually never seen Hitler's

802
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,040
paintings were they any good? No. Not really. They're boring. They're just like... All paintings

803
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,060
are boring. No. Paintings suck. I'll show you. Paintings are stupid. They're just like

804
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:13,060
houses and landscapes and stuff. Arts suck. Here look, this is his paintings. That's pretty

805
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,280
cool. I mean they're just boring. They're pretty good I think. They're pretty dumb.

806
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,920
I think he's... They're pretty dumb actually. He's decent. I think they're all crap. I mean

807
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:32,060
better than me yeah dude I can really tell what I might do there might be

808
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:49,160
trouble just like poorly drawn like circles yeah come on let me into

809
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,400
I'd like to do art school here.

810
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,160
Yeah, that's why art school is easy to get into now.

811
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,200
It's all bullshit because it used to be something but then they turned down Hitler and look

812
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
what happened.

813
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
They said we're going to change our ways.

814
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

815
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah.

816
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,080
All right, the list for today.

817
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,760
Before we go any further, we seriously hate Hitler.

818
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,360
I just want to clarify.

819
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,920
Why are you rubbing my foot with your foot?

820
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,240
This is a secret message.

821
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Oh, okay.

822
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,920
Oh, now both of you are doing it.

823
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,640
Keep talking about how much you ate Hitler.

824
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,400
Not gonna lie, it feels so good that I couldn't think.

825
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
I did not like that.

826
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,120
It's not as, you of all of my male friends I find the least repulsive to touch.

827
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,160
Why?

828
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,200
That's for us to figure out later.

829
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,120
Shit, I guess you're right.

830
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,640
Top 10 things your parents don't want you to know by Finch.

831
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,720
alive has or at one time had parents. Chances are that when they had their kids

832
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,280
their lives changes forever. Probably not for the better. Sure they tell you they

833
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,760
love you and that you were an angel or a blessing but in reality the first words

834
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,080
out of their mouths when you were born were probably a little different. Below

835
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,800
are the top 10 things that your parents don't want you to know. Either about you,

836
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,040
your siblings, or life in general. Yeah now I can't see it so like great thanks

837
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,400
so much. I can see it, I have a front row seat. You see this? No. That's my middle finger.

838
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,780
my penis that's what I got it's putting his it's not your penis then suck it

839
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:32,200
then if it's not my pocket I dare you did not prove it was my penis

840
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
because you didn't suck it.

841
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
(laughter)

842
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
What do you mean? I just don't know how.

843
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I never did it before. Is that not right?

844
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Dude, the gas leak is gone

845
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
and we've become so sexual.

846
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh my god.

847
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
This is insane.

848
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Number one, your parents

849
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
have sex when you aren't around.

850
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
No! Whether you're asleep staying at

851
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
a friend's house or just down the street at the store for

852
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
30 minutes, your parents have

853
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
utilized that opportunity to have sex.

854
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,000
they send you out on an errand or say that yes you can stay at your friend's

855
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,960
house for the night know that they are at least considering what to do with

856
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,480
their privacy I'm freaking I don't think so I'm ready to throw up I don't think

857
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,080
my I think it's really I think my parents are not having sex yeah they're

858
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,640
worse probably 15 years yeah I think it's pretty unlikely that they're doing

859
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,560
that when I'm not home yeah I think that I they're not even trying to keep it

860
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,520
from me anyway yeah the fact that they don't have sex yeah I think they tell

861
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,900
tell you that yeah they I mean pretty every time I see my dad he's like I'm

862

in predator to uh... yeah

934
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,460
as a mission called predator to urban predator

935
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,740
that's what the what the movie is

00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,820
uh... yeah there is a well like what if instead of the jungle we do it in l_a_

the man is a that is kind of clinton's in the movie is cool

938
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,820
therefore movie i've seen any of the only predator movie of seeing is the one

939
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,100
that came in a couple years ago

940
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,020

resis get the i watch it i want to know if the reader yeah watching the every

942
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,420
different

943
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,020
sitting or a movie horrible movie as would go and i watch thirty minutes

944
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,300
really

945
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,040
no that's predators ok that one's for you know it's ok it's pretty good

946
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,140
yeah i couldn't have a lot of that was directed by a guy named nimrod

947
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,500
well now yeah nimrod himrod

948
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,920
there is not a lot of street

949
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,660
uh... in number two of him right here parents considered abortion at least

950
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,320
once a set of having you not true i don't think that that i was a little way

951
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,560
too quick

952
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,340
i would say my parents

953
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,840
I would say my dad definitely did.

954
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,740
Me and my older brother are 13 months apart.

955
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,020
So you think they just didn't even have time to think about aborting you?

956
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,340
I think I got in mad quick.

957
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,580
You knew that there was not a lot of room for error to pull this off.

958
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,740
So you got in, got out.

959
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,740
That was a big heist.

960
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,540
So here's some comments.

961
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,100
Oh gosh, I hope not.

962
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,380
I'm the only one that isn't spaced out.

963
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,420
I would call you pretty spaced out.

964
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,740
- What?

965
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,540
What are we talking about?

966
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,580
- So my sister is four years older than me,

967
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,020
my brother is a year older than me,

968
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,220
and then my little brother's two years older than me.

969
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,020
Or two years younger than me.

970
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,140
- Your little brother's two years older?

971
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,220
I think you're pretty spaced out.

972
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,060
Hey.

973
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,300
- Hey.

974
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,660
- My mom tried to have me aborted,

975
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,420
but she keeps denying it.

976
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,380
Here's a comment.

977
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,220
I have Asperger's, autistic,

978
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,180
and sometimes my mom wanted to know why I had to be born.

979
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,560
well that's very racist and offensive

980
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,700
that's a

981
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,180
so very nice

982
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,300

991
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,460

993
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,700
layout this guy i was just too smart is that maybe this actually means that

994
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,700
there's a point here

995
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,340

997
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,820
yeah i feel inferior to other sometimes

998
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,060
I felt so... I was number one when I was a kid, bro.

999
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,140
Yeah, I was probably the number one person I ever met.

1000
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,760
You're the second child, right? Yeah, I'm the middle, dude.

1001
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,480
That's why I'm so beast. They say I'm the middle child, but I'm the third.

1002
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,040
Middle child is a state of mind and you definitely are a middle child.

1003
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,820
I would say you're a little child. Yeah.

1004
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,180
Well, I'm the tallest one in my family, bitch. What's up?

1005
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,960
That's so embarrassing for you to know. I'm 5'9".

1006
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,080
my dad so tall and then the rest of us are like like my little brother's five

1007
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,880

00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,960

1015
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,680

1021
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,500

mister mouse and mommy mouse never never they never loved him

1026
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,860
Yeah, they didn't.

1027
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:17,860
It's true.

1028
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,820
Number four, your opportunities in life are limited.

1029
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,820
Not true.

1030
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,820
Not true.

1031
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,820
The sky's the limit for me.

1032
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,820
Not true.

1033
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,820
My mom told me this.

1034
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,820
I pretty much have an unlimited potential.

1035
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,820
Watch this.

1036
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,700
You guys want to see me become a superstar?

1037
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,700
Yes.

1038
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,700
I already did.

1039
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Hold your breath.

1040
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,700
Hit me baby one more time.

1041
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:48,500
Hit me baby one more time, that fucking sound, down in the fan, as I was a, just believe,

1042
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:55,780
give me a sign, hit me baby one more time, wow.

1043
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:02,380
I'm gonna have to hold my breath for that.

1044
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:03,380
When's it gonna happen?

1045
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,380
I've already became one.

1046
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:11,660
I think I became one so hard. Don't mind the paparazzos when you walk out of my door

1047
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,740
Yeah, yeah, they're there every second

1048
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:17,740
This man has not registered with the

1049
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:28,020
Come on make way make way for my client. It's just me. Come on. He's coming out any minute now

1050
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,540
I'm gonna grab that camera. That's a gun

1051
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,540
I'm done.

1052
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,820
Any good comments here?

1053
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,420
Everything depends on money these days.

1054
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
So true.

1055
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,540
This one comment that says, "What I know when I was four."

1056
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,860
What I know when I was four.

1057
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,940
Yo, what I know when I was four.

1058
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,260
So now the list takes a turn here.

1059
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,260
Those are making me laugh.

1060
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,900
Number five is, "Rated R movies are realistic."

1061
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,900
True.

1062
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,900
We're just talking about Predator.

1063
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,900
Facts.

1064
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,900
As realistic as hell.

1065
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,180
This could happen.

1066
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,180
Some alien fucker.

1067
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,180
Yeah.

1068
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,740
alien right now. What's another Raider movie that's realistic? I mean Matrix is probably

1069
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:10,380
one of the most realistic movies of all time. VR basically stands for realistic when it

1070
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:18,660
comes to these movies. Matrix Reloaded, Matrix Realistic, think about that. And STG stands

1071
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:27,620
for like pre-graphic. Probably G. G movies are pretty much never realistic. They're never

1072
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:32,200
-Gross, yeah. Basically stands for, G basically stands for gross.

1073
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,700
-Lester's lucky day.

1074
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,700
-Greatly distorted from reality.

1075
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,200
-Yeah.

1076
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,700
-Yeah.

1077
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,200
-Fobo.

1078
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
-Elmo and Grouchland.

1079
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,700
-Phoebe's friendly fun day. Didn't happen.

1080
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,700
-Is it Elmo and Grouchland, G or PG?

1081
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:48,200
-PG 13 is probably just happened 13 times.

1082
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,700
-Yeah, ever. Yeah, probably around, they average it out. Probably just 13.

1083
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,200
-NC 17, no chance this happened 17 times.

1084
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,720
Yeah, either more or less, but not 17 17 no chance

1085
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,800
I would say in 17 movies might be the most realistic true because a lot of times

1086
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,960
It's just like some French girl showing up at a French guy's house, and then they put fucking fuck yeah fucking like the brown bunny

1087
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,920
Yeah

1088
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,200
On each other they do that mm-hmm. Yeah, can they put all sorts of plugs on each other? Oh my god?

1089
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Yeah, that's right. I patches - oh

1090
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,720
No, yeah, the pig leg on it. Oh, you don't want to see the peg leg a peg leg on yeah

1091
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,540
Oh, no, he put the peg leg on all what you but they're wearing clothes. Mm-hmm. Yeah, wait till you see the movie. They're not oh

1092
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,760
Yeah, that's right. No

1093
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,920
See an NC 17 movie. No, I don't normally normal. There's nothing going on in it. Yeah

1094
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:46,260
Except for all the fun. Yeah, it's since we're not crazy except for the 17 crazy things that happen

1095
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,580
yeah not crazy unless you think 17 assholes on the screen at the same time

1096
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,780
are crazy because of mine we should we should watch a nc-17 movie count how

1097
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,260
many times so I've seen what's that one movie nympho maniac nympho maniac that's

1098
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,140
what I was your first nc-17 movie nympho maniac was the only one I've ever

1099
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:08,060
watched I've seen Caligula what is nc-17 like what movies are nc-17 I've never

1100
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:13,820
gone to the theater to see one dog I think I've seen man bites dog

1101
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,460
I think yes, I've ever seen that one um oh

1102
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:22,260
Bad lieutenant that was my first one. I'm on the road plans pretty scary. Yeah, what that the 90s?

1103
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,940
Bad lieutenant oh yeah

1104
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:30,340
Yeah, he smokes crack and like shows his full dick on the screen who directed that again. I think it's able Ferrara

1105
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:35,620
Could be wrong. I don't know I accidentally searched NC7 movies

1106
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:45,180
No children under seven can watch this movie. Yeah, that's like did you guys ever play an adult only game? Yeah, which one?

1107
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:50,100
TurboTax

1108
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,980
What was the one about the pervert

1109
00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:01,380
Leisure suit Larry. I think there was a leisure suit Larry. That was a oh evil dead was NC 17. Yeah, that's him

1110
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,900
Yeah, yeah, I know I see evil was a I say a little bit the first one

1111
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:13,620
I assume NC-17 was just porn, but I get like Eyes Wide Shut is NC-17. Yeah. Oh, really? Yeah, it's usually movies American Pie

1112
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:20,140
What that's what it says here. No, maybe they're a good addition. Yeah. Yeah, dude unrated

1113
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,980
My god Freddy got fingered. It says here what?

1114
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:30,820
Yeah, this is the fucking poster for bad. I guess it Harvey. I tell you just have Harvey Keitel's like that

1115
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,660
- There's no way that was the 90s.

1116
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,660
- 92.

1117
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,500
- Really?

1118
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,320
- 92 Abel Ferrara.

1119
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,220
- He looks so young.

1120
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,380
- Well yeah, I think it was before Reservoir Dogs,

1121
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,380
or at least after, maybe.

1122
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,100
- It was before, or at least after.

1123
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,340
- Could have been one of the two.

1124
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,820
- At least it was before or after.

1125
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,700
Definitely not at the exact same second.

1126
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,540
- Well, I think Reservoir Dogs did come out in '92.

1127
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,300
- Before or at least after.

1128
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,140
- Hold on.

1129
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,060
- Not even before or after, before or at least after.

1130
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,260
- Or at least after, to be at the very least.

1131
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,260
No, no, Reservoir Dogs came out in '92.

1132
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,760
It was really- Reservoir Dogs was before, but only a month before.

1133
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,760
Or at least after.

1134
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
Or at least it was after it.

1135
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,760
Well no, Battle of the Tennant was at least after.

1136
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,260
Okay.

1137
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:10,760
Yeah.

1138
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,760
So wait, that's even funnier!

1139
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,260
You're saying, "Resident Dogs- Reservoir Dogs was before."

1140
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,760
You're not even making sense.

1141
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,760
"Reservoir Dogs was before, or at least the other one was after."

1142
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,760
Yeah.

1143
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,760
That's what you were actually saying.

1144
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,760
Just admit you just got headshotted from across a map 360 no-scope.

1145
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,760
Just fucking admit it oh

1146
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,360
oh

1147
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:39,300
I got that in a DVD combo pack when I was when I was 12 the the only yeah

1148
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:45,220
I think the only in AT-17 movies for a very long time were just ones with with you could put a cock in there

1149
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,220
Yeah, yeah, that's yeah

1150
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:52,780
Now I'll show some big heaters to noodle noodle cock 17 chunky ones, bro. Yeah

1151
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,880
He smoked he smokes a bunch of crack in that movie. Yeah. Yeah, he's a badly

1152
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,720
He's the fucking worst. Brother Hank, the good lieutenant. Hey some of those lieutenants walking around. I mean nowadays

1153
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,600
He might be one of the good ones. True. That's what I'm saying. Some of the stuff that's going down in lieutenant

1154
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,120
Well, here's the thing. This might get you on his side. He loves gambling

1155
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,000
Yeah, let me watch a movie, let me please

1156
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,760
All right, number six they love your sibling more than you. Not true. I'm the favorite child

1157
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm the favorite too because my mom lets me drunk drive her around. Yep

1158
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,120
My mom I don't know how to drive, but that's the gauge for

1159
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:35,000
Favorite child my mom and my mom one time. Let me do that and I was like I'm definitely the favorite

1160
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,520
She would never trust my brothers with this task. Yeah drunk driving dude. That's like

1161
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:47,980
That's a seer. That's like a fucking that's like a family heirloom passed down in my family. Yeah, that's like me getting a ring you know

1162
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,660
True might be I might be the the favorite

1163
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:59,060
Maybe be the favorite boy your parents don't know the answers to many of your questions. That's true as hell. Do you guys?

1164
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:06,600
I realize this growing up my my dad my mom anytime you ask her anything

1165
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,240
She has an answer and it's almost always wrong

1166
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,880
She'll say some parents do like they won't they don't want to say I don't know they'll just say something my dad though

1167
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,720
Would just he doesn't know any both of my parents would say I don't know and then tell me to fuck off

1168
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,560
My mom will just make something. Well, I mean your questions are probably deserved. Yeah

1169
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:30,020
It probably wasn't like why is the sky it was like yeah, like what? Yeah. Why is the Death Star so big?

1170
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:34,040
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what the Death Star. Yes

1171
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,200
Please leave me alone. It's 3 a.m

1172
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,080
It's 3 a.m. On Christmas Eve

1173
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:46,180
There is one time I think I was showing I was watching Revenge of the Sith and thought my dad was watching it with me

1174
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,260
but he was asleep the whole time.

1175
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,700
And I kept turning to him to ask him stuff

1176
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,060
and didn't realize he was asleep

1177
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,300
until my uncle came in the room and like laughed at me.

1178
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,300
- You thought your dad was just icing you out?

1179
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,140
- Yeah.

1180
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:57,960
- Damn.

1181
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,220
- Well, and you thought he was answering

1182
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,940
all your questions like this?

1183
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,820
- And you thought, I'm gonna still do,

1184
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,660
I'm gonna still.

1185
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,080
- You were like, dad, what does the Wookiee language

1186
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,920
sound like?

1187
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,940
And you're like, not really, but thank you for trying.

1188
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,140
I appreciate it.

1189
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,380
Remember, Ed, you ever been to Kashyyyk?

1190
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,020
their health isn't as good as they lead you to believe.

1191
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,220
True, they're all dead.

1192
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,980
That is scary to think about.

1193
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,820
Not for me.

1194
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,640
Especially now that my parents are getting older.

1195
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,340
We can potentially die from anything.

1196
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,780
My Asian parents.

1197
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,740
Fact.

1198
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,420
Well yeah, we could die from this person's Asian parents.

1199
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,100
My Asian parents said the same thing.

1200
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,940
Yeah.

1201
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,780
And they're crazy.

1202
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,060
Number nine, your parents hate driving.

1203
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,900
Fact.

1204
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,260
I don't think that's a secret.

1205
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,100
My dad loved driving.

1206
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,620
I think one of the things of parents is they do tell you

1207
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:41,460
that they hate driving.

1208
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,900
My dad loved driving so much because he would,

1209
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:49,960
My dad would always, until maybe a couple years ago, I think his girlfriend got him to stop,

1210
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,900
he would read a John Grisham novel while he drove.

1211
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,100
He would literally just hold it in front of him, like one hand on the wheel, one hand

1212
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,340
on his Diet Coke, one hand on the wheel, holding with his thumb and his pointer finger a John

1213
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,340
Grisham novel.

1214
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
I would probably do that.

1215
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,340
If I drove, I would probably be reading and driving at the same time.

1216
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,340
And just hit into audiobooks.

1217
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,340
Well, it's different.

1218
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,340
Audiobooks suck.

1219
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,340
It's different.

1220
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Audiobooks are not very good.

1221
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,340
No, they're good, but...

1222
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,800
Listen, my dad's being gripped by John Grisham spy novels,

1223
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,500
some of the most intense, well-written things

1224
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,680
in the history of literature.

1225
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,580
So he's not gonna let,

1226
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,000
I mean, who's gonna read that shit, right?

1227
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,040
Who's gonna do that justice?

1228
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,500
- All right, number 10, last one.

1229
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,940
Your parents get scared too.

1230
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,640
You ever seen your parents get scared?

1231
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,600
You ever scared your parents so hard?

1232
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,500
- No, I think my mom,

1233
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,760
I remember my mom,

1234
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,260
I would always, I mean, this doesn't really count too much.

1235
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:45,340
this isn't like terrified or whatever,

1236
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,020
but I would always do a joke when I got really tall,

1237
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,180
if we went into a room with a low ceiling,

1238
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,580
I would turn on my mom and be like,

1239
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,980
like, "Mom, look how high I can jump,"

1240
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,180
and go like I was about to jump my head

1241
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,820
right into the ceiling at full speed,

1242
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,980
and she would always freak out every time.

1243
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,980
- You know what?

1244
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,180
Okay, the one time I saw my mom really--

1245
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,780
- Or under a ceiling fan, it's a good joke.

1246
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,900
- The one time I saw my mom really scared

1247
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,260
is also why I'm the favorite.

1248
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,180
I think I've told this before,

1249
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:15,060
but my brother basically, we took a two by four

1250
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:18,180
and we sawed it almost all the way through

1251
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,340
and then he broke it on the back of my head

1252
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,540
and then it was a big prank and my mom,

1253
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,620
she thought I was dead or something for a moment.

1254
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:31,020
And then my dad is like me, he gets scared by loud noises.

1255
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,860
- Nice. - Yeah.

1256
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,820
That's why he used to live downtown and then he moved

1257
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,220
'cause he was like,

1258
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,940
ambulances damn scare me too in the morning.

1259
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,380
- I saw my dad one time,

1260
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,680
This is like the weirdest, this is a very, I think,

1261
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,100
life-changing moment.

1262
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,940
Saw my dad get scared of a frog that was in a shop vac.

1263
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:53,340
He knew that there was a frog in it

1264
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,300
and then made me empty the shop vac

1265
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,820
because he didn't want the frog to jump on him.

1266
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,380
- Whoa, that's serious.

1267
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,780
Oh yeah, my mom's really scared of bees too.

1268
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,540
Which I don't fuck with bees all that much either.

1269
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:08,020
- Like my dad's not like a scaredy cat at all.

1270
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
Yeah, now I think about it, both my parents are just fucking pussies, dude.

1271
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,020
Scared of everything.

1272
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,020
My dad's scared of loud noise, my mom's scared of bugs, dude.

1273
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,020
The two things that I'm most afraid of.

1274
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,020
My dad's not a pussy, but my mom is afraid of fucking every--

1275
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:25,020
Like, my mom, if there's a tornado warning in, like, Rochester or somewhere,

1276
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,020
she'll send me, like, "I found out that there's a tornado warning in New York City.

1277
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,020
You need to get inside!"

1278
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,020
She thinks it's gonna be, like, day after tomorrow.

1279
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:36,020
Just, like, giant tornado, billboards fucking smacking--

1280
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,020
That'd be sick.

1281
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:44,860
news anchors. Dude, I hope honestly, we'll leave it at this. I mean, I don't know if you guys agree,

1282
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:51,180
but I do hope by the end of my lifetime I see one movie level apocalypse climate disaster.

1283
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:51,660
Absolutely.

1284
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:52,540
Wouldn't that be so sad?

1285
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,260
