1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
*wind*

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's time to leave the office.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh wait, let's go home.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's completely frozen shut.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What the hell? It's like an icy tundra out there.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, that almost means what?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It means that we can't even get out of the door.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're snowed in!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Doesn't matter to me.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't give a shit.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And it's my birthday in six months.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,500
*Intro*

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Okay

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
*Silence*

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
*Mimics the sound of a car*

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Why are you guys just sitting there completely still?

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Because I didn't know we started yet. You waited for you to press that button.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
You guys always start it instantly.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
No. Whenever we start. We're gonna restart right now.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
We're gonna re- reset.

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
*Mimics the sound of a car*

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,220
Oh, fuck it's cold in here.

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,460
Are you silently chattering your teeth?

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,700
That's not silent.

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,540
Wait, hold on.

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
I can hear that shit from here.

27
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,620
We're hearing a little bit of that.

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,940
I can hear that from here.

29
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,100
Here's a question you motherfucker.

30
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,700
You island motherfucker.

31
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
How come you don't have a puffer jacket on

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,940
if it's so damn cold?

33
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,140
This is what you wear when it's cold.

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:15,960
I got you.

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,700
I see all these guys flying around the ice wearing this.

36
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,540
Oh, that's a good point.

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,460
Yeah, that's a good point, yeah.

38
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,260
That's why Kevin Smith always wears one.

39
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,420
This is not Halloween.

40
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,260
Yeah, it is.

41
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,220
That's the Christmas creep.

42
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,700
That is not a Christmas creep.

43
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,700
There's no such thing as the Christmas creep.

44
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,340
Well, he's right there, so what do you mean there's no such thing?

45
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,180
Also, here's a question.

46
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,540
If there's such a Christmas creep going around,

47
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
name three of his attributes.

48
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,340
Skeletal.

49
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,940
Okay.

50
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,700
Hooded.

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,420
That sounds right.

52
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,540
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.

53
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,020
Upon a jersey.

54
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,300
Skeletal, hooded, and upon a jersey?

55
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,700
Yeah.

56
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,940
That last one doesn't count.

57
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,860
He's on your jersey.

58
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,420
He doesn't live--

59
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,460
Oh my God, it's true.

60
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,900
I was right.

61
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
His third attribute was completely correct.

62
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,980
Sometimes I hate--

63
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,940
Now we'll have to find out about the first two, I guess.

64
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I hate how smart you are.

65
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,940
It pisses me off. It makes it so hard to argue with you.

66
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
I'm running circles around you guys.

67
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Christmas circles.

68
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,940
He's 50 steps ahead.

69
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I hate Christmas circles.

70
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
I would say a Christmas circle doesn't exist, but I know god damn well you're going to prove it to me.

71
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,940
You're going to pull all these Christmas circles out of your ass.

72
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,940
What do you mean you don't hang Christmas circles on your tree every year?

73
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm just scooting on you.

74
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
Yeah, you always, whenever we cut to you, you're always way farther than us.

75
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,940
You're on your own little island.

76
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Look at you.

77
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,940
There's because this thing, I can't move any further than this.

78
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
move any further than this.

79
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,980
- Oh my God.

80
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,800
- This is the closest I can move.

81
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,860
- It's almost like turning my old desk

82
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,500
into the table we use for the podcast

83
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,220
was kind of a bad idea.

84
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,220
- What's bad about it?

85
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,140
It works fine.

86
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,620
What, I can't sit where I'm sitting?

87
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,540
- Hey.

88
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,940
- I think we just need to get a little bit closer as friends.

89
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,460
- I think that we learned something,

90
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,380
which is that you think that an ornament

91
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,740
is called a Christmas circle.

92
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
- No, it's a wreath.

93
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,400
- An ornament?

94
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
- A wreath is a Christmas circle.

95
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,300
- You don't put a wreath on a tree.

96
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
- You put a wreath on a tree.

97
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,740
- Why would you put--

98
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
I said dozens too!

99
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,740
You're like dozens of wreaths on your tree!

100
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,740
I got my tree yesterday.

101
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
I went out right before it got this cold and we got all snowed in.

102
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
The last thing I did was I got a Christmas tree.

103
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,740
We have a little fake light up tree.

104
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,740
A small fake one.

105
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
Did you get a real one?

106
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,740
You can't get one? Yeah you can.

107
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
You can get one.

108
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,740
No Moe, I woke up at 3 in the morning last night because Moe had the zoomies.

109
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,740
No, that means you can't get a tree.

110
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
He will topple that shit.

111
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
He'd be too tired to take care of it.

112
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
He weighs less than a pound. He can't topple a tree.

113
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,740
He will topple anything in the house.

114
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
He knocked over my flowers.

115
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,740
Did he knock you over yet? Flowers are a lot

116
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
easier to knock over.

117
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
Flowers are like a baby tree.

118
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Has he knocked over your refrigerator yet?

119
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,740
No. You know what he did do?

120
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Last night

121
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
he bit me in my sleep.

122
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
He's a biter. I don't know why he bites me.

123
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Probably because he's a cat.

124
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,960
because of that. He's just like his owner, he's a buyer. He steals rapidly. Oh he does.

125
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,060
Yeah I forgot about that, that he did that. Yeah, the other day he was, we were

126
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,880
walking on the train, we were walking on the train, yeah, and he said, and he, we were

127
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,220
subway surfing, we were doing like this, we were walking on top of the train, and he looked at me and he said, "Ask Beavis, I get nothing but head."

128
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,620
And I was like, oh that's a pretty clever little line. Yeah. Go home, big L. Yeah.

129
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,020
93 freestyle. He took a big O. I said dead in the middle of little did we know the

130
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,420
brittle submittalmen didn't do diddly. Yeah and he said all that crap and I said

131
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,900
that was great Pat. No it turns out he ripped that off some Spaniards. Yeah.

132
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,540
What? Yeah big fat Joe and big fat pun. Big fat pun. Couple of Spaniard rappers.

133
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,980
Only one big fat guy I care about in this season. Who's that? Santa. Mr.

134
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,580
December. Santa Claus himself. Oh well I was right. I thought you were talking about Mr.

135
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,580
Mr. December from the fireman calendar I have.

136
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
No, I call Sir DeClause Mr. December.

137
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Why?

138
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Because he comes around in December and he's a boy.

139
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
I would say that Christ would be much more Mr. December.

140
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,580
No, Christ is Mr. Worldwide.

141
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Master December, I like that more than Mr. Worldwide.

142
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
Mr. Worldwide already has it, there's already a guy who does that.

143
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
That's true.

144
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,580
I like that your hat is backwards today.

145
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
I like that your hat is non-existent today.

146
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
Up top.

147
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
Down low.

148
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,580
I've decided to show off my Norwood 3.

149
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,020
Let's get a punch in on this.

150
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Like North Pole 3.

151
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Damn.

152
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
See that?

153
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
This is the pole right here.

154
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
And it goes like, "Ooooh."

155
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Yep.

156
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,420
I've got three years with this left.

157
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,020
I've got three years with the front of my hair.

158
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
That's what I thought one year ago.

159
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,020
Yeah.

160
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
You're done.

161
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
I'm not done.

162
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
You're fucking done.

163
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm going to be fine.

164
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
You're done.

165
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,620
No, you will die.

166
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah?

167
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Yeah, one day.

168
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
Well, I don't have the thingy.

169
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,620
I don't have the...

170
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
The spot?

171
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,440
you're getting a little spot it's not that big though it's not that big yeah

172
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:52,340
yeah a little it's not big it's not you get a spray you are you do you have a

173
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,140
bald spot right here though yeah and I would say you have some like your ears

174
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,900
have almost no hair on them yeah and like all right cameras doing the blurry thing

175
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,660
again just shut up yeah your neck has basically nothing there's no hair over

176
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,900
You know where I do grow hair is right here.

177
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,780
You don't grow hair, any hair on my head.

178
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,860
Oh, you do grow hair there.

179
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,940
I grow hair right under my eyeballs.

180
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,020
That's so crazy to have a beard that goes up to your eyes.

181
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,500
And then it goes up there, but then this,

182
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,060
this doesn't connect to my mustache.

183
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,900
Yes it does.

184
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,980
So all the hair, no, no, no, you saw when I,

185
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,540
on Saturday I sent you guys the picture.

186
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,380
It clearly does.

187
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,340
It was the K-Night Live thing, it was like the,

188
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,060
like right there, there was just a patch that was,

189
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,780
oh not this side, it's this side, this side.

190
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,620
There's hair all over your face.

191
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,620
You're crazy. There's proof of this.

192
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,620
There's proof right in front of me that it is dog hair on your face.

193
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,620
Have you ever thought about growing out a big beard? Yeah. Have you ever done anything close to that?

194
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,620
You used to have a little bit of a beard. Yeah, I had a beard when we first started hanging out.

195
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Yeah, but it was more chin strappy I feel like than it would grow now.

196
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,620
It had like a perfect chin strap in my head. You were misremembering a lot of things.

197
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,620
No, I think I remember a lot of things. One thing, and I think I remember it okay.

198
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,940
up photos of me. Yeah you used to look like this. I remember you used to look like this.

199
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,340
Patrick Doran, Family Tree. Man you look wide here in this shot. I know and I'm blurry.

200
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,580
Yeah. Because we never figured out the... You need to learn to keep your mouth shut.

201
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,100
You are an awful radio personality. That's a rude thing for me to say but I'm saying

202
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,700
it. I can't believe you've been doing this so long and you just never got any better.

203
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,500
No. Maybe you got worse actually. Well it's worse now that we got video because now all

204
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,260
I can see is that the fucking camera is blurry as shit. Well that's because it's fucking frozen

205
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,760
over because we're fucking locked and snowed in here which we barely even

206
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,020
mentioned so far but we've been trapped in here for a week what's your worst

207
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,460
favorite least favorite part of being completely trapped in an underground

208
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,900
bunker with your friends probably that it's snowing in 53 degrees the fact that

209
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,380
it's 53 degrees outside and it's still not melting the doors are fucking frozen

210
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,380
shut we can't get out of here it sucks ass dude there's snow all over the set I

211
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,220
don't know if people can see this yeah oh my god there's snow I bet you guys

212
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
I mean, it's so cold to touch

213
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't touch it man. You don't want to touch that

214
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,640
And I just realized what that it's snow it's snow

215
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,860
Did I what don't worry about what it is

216
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:24,220
What Patrick did I take the inside of a couple of adult diapers that we have laying around the office and turn the?

217
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,380
filling into snow

218
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,820
Yes, maybe I thought it wasn't actually snowing in here

219
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,340
And I wanted to maybe sell the fact that there was some snow around the office

220
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:41,420
Then yeah, that'd be a fucking good idea, and maybe I should work for Martin Scorsese in Hollywood, but you should I

221
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:48,460
Was looking at it, and I was like oh this looks like it would be crunchy, but no it's diaper inards

222
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:55,060
No, you're a diaper nerd you're the diaper nerd. I don't like nerd in diaper no

223
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:03,360
Diaper innards. Oh, yeah, well you guys started making me wear those diapers that we had cuz we're snowed in you guys are sick of my

224
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Farts well, that's the worst part

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,040
For the toilet completely froze solid yeah, so you just been taking craps

226
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,420
It just lay on top of a little bugs playing hockey on the toilet just discuss with our craps with our crap

227
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,640
Pucks here's the thing about bugs man. Why do you want to eat?

228
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,020
Why do you want to eat you saying it wow all right? I'll say I'll go in on bugs for a minute

229
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,220
Hey flies, why do you want to eat fucking shit?

230
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
Mm-hmm.

231
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
What are you--

232
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,220
Talk that talk.

233
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,220
That's nasty.

234
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Yeah.

235
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
That's disgusting.

236
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,420
Hey cockroaches, you're nasty.

237
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,420
Kill yourselves.

238
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,940
Hey cockroaches, what's that first part of your name all about?

239
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,940
Kind of sus.

240
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
And what's that second part?

241
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
What are you, a bug?

242
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Yeah, because you smoke penises.

243
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
What?

244
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Cockro-- like a roach.

245
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Oh, like the roach.

246
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Yeah, the roach that you eat.

247
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Oh.

248
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Yeah.

249
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Like this.

250
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
You just puff, puff, pass.

252
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,740
where I don't smoke it, but I eat it like 10 minutes

253
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,620
before I fall asleep.

254
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,500
So I'm not living while I'm high at all.

255
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,980
I only am high while I'm in my dream.

256
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,620
And last night I had a dream that I had a pet mouse.

257
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,460
- Oh. - Oh.

258
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,300
- Named Tay-Tay.

259
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,540
(laughing)

260
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,420
And Tay-Tay got lost.

261
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,100
- You could make that a reality at any point.

262
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
- Tay-Tay got lost.

263
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,500
- Tay-Tay is such a good name for a pet mouse.

264
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
And Tay Tay got lost last night.

265
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
That is really good.

266
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
And so the best part of the weed thing--

267
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I want to get an office mouse now.

268
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,500
The best part about doing weed like this is that you get awful dreams like this, where Tay Tay gets lost.

269
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:45,500
And then I wake up from this very disorienting dream, and I wake up and I'm at the highest I've ever been in my entire life, to go piss.

270
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,500
And I go piss, and I'm sitting there and I'm like, I wonder if I'll ever see fucking Tay Tay again.

271
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
And then I go back to sleep, and he's gone.

272
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah.

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,500
That sucks.

274
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
It's like he never existed.

275
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah.

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He was hanging out with my dog in this dream,

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and they were both in a blanket fort.

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
[LAUGHTER]

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,500
That's nice.

280
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
He was in a blanket fort.

281
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,000
And I loved him so much, and I'll never see him again.

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I think you have to get a pet rat now.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That is so-- dreams are so cruel, man.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,500
Tay-tay.

285
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Dreams are so fucking cruel.

286
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I really, really want you to get a pet rat now.

287
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,000
A mouse.

288
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,500
A mouse.

289
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,000
Whatever.

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Tay-tay.

291
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
They're the same thing.

292
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,000
[LAUGHTER]

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,040
How awful is it that in dreams you can you can in your brain conjure up something that you love more than anything?

294
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,160
Yeah, I love Taytay more than I love my fucking mom or my dad. I loved Taytay

295
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,440
You could feed I loved it

296
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,660
And I felt like I felt like I'd lost my child in an amusement park when he was lost in the blanket fort and I was

297
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,720
Started getting scared lost in the blanket. He was in the blanket fort and then I opened up the blanket fort

298
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,600
I said surprise Taytay. It's time to sing your song and he was

299
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,740
He's fucking gone dude. He was gone

300
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,160
I didn't get to the point where I heard the song in the dream

301
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,000
But I knew that he had a special song that I would sing on with to make him go to bed

302
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,820
So the Taytay saga basically completely ended with me opening up the blanket fort where the fuck's Taytay my pet mouse

303
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
He's nowhere. I see my dog

304
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,520
And then I yeah, and then I and then I look her oh, this was the worst part

305
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,120
I look around and I'm like where the fuck is Taytay

306
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,200
where's my baby and I look around and there's a cat roaming. No! So the last feeling I have

307
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,960
It wasn't a little black and white cat was it? It was actually. The last feeling that I have in my dream, the last

308
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,280
thing I had before I woke up and I had to come into work now, right I was

309
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:32,200
trapped in here I mean, is that my last feeling was that I think that Tay Tay, my

310
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,440
my pet mouse I've had my entire life, is 25 years old, that my pet mouse it was

311
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,200
eaten viciously by a cat. A black and white cat. A black and white cat. Like Moe. Yeah, maybe.

312
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,680
It was a bigger cat. Most cats are black and white. Was he big, but

313
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,880
he was big in the way that his stomach was really big and was shaped like a

314
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,180
mouse? I don't think eating a mouse would make your stomach all that big.

315
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:59,040
Tay Tay was very small. Well, a cat could be small enough that his stomach was very, very

316
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,520
small. What are you doing? Guys, it's time to be real. Oh, I knew one day we'd

317
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,240
come to this. I think you're gonna have to miss this one.

318
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,960
Yeah? Or you have to do it right now. He's already taking it.

319
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,240
He's already taking it. Wow, he doesn't even want me in it.

320
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,000
Wow. And you don't get to retake that. No, no, no, no, no.

321
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,600
See? He's gonna punch in on this. Okay, let's not.

322
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,280
That's awful. That was a bad one. And also you ruined my Tay-Tay.

323
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah, I'm hungry as fuck and I'm gonna eat Patrick. That's fine.

324
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,620
That's fine.

325
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,620
Why would you eat Patrick?

326
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,620
Because he was on B-Real.

327
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,120
True.

328
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,620
Yeah.

329
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,120
I'd like to-

330
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
I really have- that's been the first thing-

331
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,620
When I get angry at somebody or something annoys me,

332
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,120
Yeah.

333
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Recently, the first thought in my head is, "I'm going to eat you."

334
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,620
Did you ever get mad at a mouse?

335
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,120
Yeah, named Tay Tay.

336
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Not yet.

337
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Is that a weird name to have in my head?

338
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
No.

339
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Tay Tay?

340
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
You guys made me feel really self-conscious about my mouse.

341
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
What? No, we didn't.

342
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
Why are you self-conscious about the mouse?

343
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,320
We were smiling.

344
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm just kind of, I don't know.

345
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,920
It was just weird.

346
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,800
I think what you should do is make that a reality.

347
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,440
I don't want--

348
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,680
I think that you should make--

349
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Dude, you know how fucked up it would be for me to feel--

350
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,800
to be like, OK, well, I had this mouse that I loved in my dream.

351
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,520
His name was Teytey.

352
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,840
I need to meet him in real life.

353
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,960
And then try to find a mouse that fits the personality

354
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
that I actually fucking--

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,280
What was his personality like?

356
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,160
He was playful.

357
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,280
He was a little bit mischievous, right?

358
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,200
Yeah, that would be really hard to find a mouse.

359
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
- In a mouse.

360
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,000
- That's probably one of the rarest personality traits.

361
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,840
- He loved cheese.

362
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,880
- A mischievous mouse.

363
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,240
- He loved cheese, he loved snacks.

364
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,840
- Wait, can you describe what his ears looked like?

365
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,680
- Yeah, what did he look like?

366
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
- Was this a realistic mouse?

367
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
- They were perfect.

368
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,120
They were like little pink,

369
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,840
just like triangles kind of that came off his head.

370
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,360
- Yeah, triangle ears.

371
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
- He had a little--

372
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
- Or a little like--

373
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,280
- A polygonal mouse.

374
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,120
Just like a--

375
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,040
- He had eight legs.

376
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,280
(laughing)

377
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,280
- What the fuck are you,

378
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,280
why are you debugging an urban dictionary right now, Juvio?

379
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,760
- I was trying to hack urban dictionary.

380
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
- Oh, he was trying to, you ruined his bit.

381
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
He was gonna probably cut to that.

382
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,320
- I'm gonna cut to him.

383
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
- Whoa, we're gonna cut up Patrick and maybe his body.

384
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
- Have a plate of--

385
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,880
- Why do you have so much stuff going on recently?

386
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,960
Just, you're like a fucking fidget spinner, man.

387
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,520
- Yeah, I didn't take my Adderall today, so I'm crazy.

388
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,760
And I also took my crazy stuff.

389
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
- What's this?

390
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,420
- What the fuck?

391
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,260
- What the fuck is that?

392
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
It's my crazy spray.

393
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
I've talked about it before, I've been doing that.

394
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
You've been using this?

395
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Yeah.

396
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
What the fuck is wrong with you?

397
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
Jesus Christ, bro.

398
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,260
This is a cowboy bebop drug.

399
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
You're gonna die.

400
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
No, I won't.

401
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
You're gonna turn into the fucking thing.

402
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
You just casually sprayed it in your mouth?

403
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
You're gonna be the fly, dude.

404
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
Look at how much good stuff is in there.

405
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Niacin.

406
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
Nothing that sprays in your mouth is good.

407
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
What are you talking about?

408
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
I'm gonna read this. I need to read this.

409
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,780
- What the? - Taste five mists,

410
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,120
spray all day.

411
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,420
Oh, this is batch number OB1B.

412
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,520
So you know it's good, that was a good batch.

413
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,460
- So what is in this?

414
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,100
It's caffeine? - Uh-huh.

415
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,220
- It's apple?

416
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,460
- And it tastes terrible.

417
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,700
- What are you doing this?

418
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
Why are you doing this, man?

419
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,140
- I just didn't have enough pizzazz.

420
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,020
- This is...

421
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,980
- What the, something is seriously just wrong.

422
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,820
- Yeah, I need to see this again.

423
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,780
- But it's got electrolytes in it, too.

424
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,620
is that it doesn't look like i had to do the same a caffeine no it's because it's

425
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,720
all of us all this is you also you didn't do enough that the serving sizes

426
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,260
ten minutes yet but i'm only doing to get out of the island is

427
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,860
contract yet

428
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,000
go ahead

429
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,420
all as all that's so awful i told you it's bad it's my mouth

430
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:53,420
yeah i told you it's really bad why do you do that because it has energy

431
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,940
It is. It is actually Mad Max. And you're not supposed to

432
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,580
see a ring or the bottle doing the chrome thing.

433
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,380
God, that is all. That's a big problem. People are always like

434
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm going for three bottles of the energy.

435
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,780
Three bottles of 24 milligrams of caffeine per what spray per

436
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,820
spray per spray. And it wants you to 10. That's not true.

437
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,860
You can't handle think about it. Milligrams in a spray. Think

438
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,060
about it. Per spray. That's the same as like one Red Bull.

439
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,060
No, it's not. It's close. 24. I think five sprays is close to one Red Bull, right?

440
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,540
Because a Red Bull is 80 milligrams of caffeine.

441
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,860
Well, the serving size is 10.

442
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,380
So 24 times 10, that's 240.

443
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,580
It's 24 per spray.

444
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,300
And that's the same as...

445
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,740
Good stuff.

446
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,180
That's the same as a Rockstar Zero.

447
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:48,420
Well, here, regardless of that being a cyberpunk thing that will turn you into a gray sludge.

448
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,660
Yeah, I'm going to get cancer.

449
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,540
You need to ration it out because we're snowed in and you're gonna waste it all.

450
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
And that's gonna be our last food.

451
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,140
No, I'm not gonna waste it.

452
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,640
And what I'm gonna tell you is...

453
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,380
I'll dilute it with water.

454
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,140
It sounds like maybe I'm warning you for your own sake.

455
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,840
For like, "Okay, we're gonna run out of food."

456
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,100
But mostly because that's the last food we have in there and once you run out of that,

457
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,340
we're eating you.

458
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,380
Oh, yeah.

459
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,940
And also, this is maybe for your own safety.

460
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,740
For our sake, please stop putting sprays and bad chemicals in your body that would make

461
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,500
your meat taste rancid.

462
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,700
drink out of plastic cups or anything. Nothing that could put any...

463
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Any microplastics, no sorts of any bees.

464
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,700
No, that's most of my food and my sex.

465
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
With hose?

466
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Yes.

467
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Mysterious hose?

468
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
Oh, I thought you said a hose.

469
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Mysterious back alley hose?

470
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I've been putting my penis in the hose.

471
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Can you get...

472
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
That's not good either.

473
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
The hose that iced us in?

474
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
There's particulates.

475
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,700
You know the hose that we left running and now there's all that ice?

476
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
I do remember that.

477
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Basically filled up both of the basement doors.

478
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,100
It sprayed hot water is basically like putting my penis on the jet in a hot tub, but then it went cold

479
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,920
Yeah, yeah went to the bath house. It's like fucking a mechanical worm. How'd you like that?

480
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,280
Oh, it was great, but I did you get into the cold water. Yeah. Yeah, it's good, right?

481
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,500
Oh, you're the best crap out of me. I thought my

482
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,720
Heart was gonna stop. Yeah. No, it can't if it's too cold if it's which that's not that cold

483
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,340
But if it's really really cold, I can give you a heart attack. Yeah. Yeah, I like dropped it

484
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,020
I I went in I have a dunk head under no oh

485
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,740
I was scared of getting a heart attack, but it's like to look at your brain attack

486
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,040
I already put energy mist in my body. I think that's something like that. That's why no

487
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,380
That's why you need to do stuff. That's good for you to counteract all this awful shit. You do I've been drinking beet juice

488
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:40,260
I don't think that's great beet juice and ginger nothing that really does much well tell that to dr. Sebi I

489
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,460
I think you died. Tell that to my doctor, Dr. Sebi.

490
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,460
That's your family doctor? That's your general practitioner?

491
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
A different guy. He's white.

492
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
Oh, okay.

493
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
He's a white doctor.

494
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Named Sebi.

495
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Yeah.

496
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Okay. Alright, that's fine.

497
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Well, his name is Sebastian.

498
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,460
I've been thinking...

499
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
His name is Dr. Sebastian.

500
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Sebastian.

501
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Sebastian Goldman.

502
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,460
I've been thinking recently that maybe I have cancer because my dog has been really, really

503
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,460
trying to sniff my balls all the time. And I wasn't thinking about it that much, and then

504
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,500
and then I found out that dogs sometimes can smell cancer in somebody's body.

505
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,660
You know what else dogs can react to that humans don't?

506
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Is ghosts.

507
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,780
That's why your paws are probably haunted.

508
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,340
By who?

509
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,100
I've seen what Phil does though.

510
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,460
The ghost of your damn...

511
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Balls?

512
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
That sucked.

513
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
No.

514
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Give me a handshake.

515
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
It's a handshake.

516
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
It's not a bump.

517
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
I'm not bumping the mic.

518
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
I'm not giving you a fist bump.

519
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,100
I think you two have brain freeze.

520
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:46,080
No, and me I had way too much coffee this morning. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm in a prison. Yeah. Yeah, you wait

521
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,480
I needed a little I'm in a bone cage. You should try this energy mist man. I don't I feel fucking in braiseable here

522
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
You could also you could try one of these

523
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,020
What's that a camel blue this thing can't smoke that inside these are?

524
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:08,160
Ever since we've been doing video I've got I have two sponsors now wait are we allowed to do this on YouTube actually three cigarettes

525
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
I don't think so.

526
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Yeah.

527
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,160
Yeah.

528
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Oh, we have, oh, we hate those.

529
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
I hate that crap.

530
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,400
I have, the third sponsor is Ballistics, and I've been doing this whole episode.

531
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,960
I'm gonna go ballistic on you if you don't fucking stop taking shit out of your pockets.

532
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Okay.

533
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
And talk about something funny like football.

534
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,840
This is funny.

535
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
She would never do that.

536
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
Ruth Bader Ginsburg would never do that.

537
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,840
That's why she died.

538
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
All right, well that, I actually-

539
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,240
That's a little of the edgy humor we're known for.

540
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,560
We need to be masking up when we record.

541
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
That's a good point.

542
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Yeah, that's really good.

543
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,120
to tell you guys before we got snowed in.

544
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,360
I have COVID.

545
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,200
- That'd be fine.

546
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
You have COVID?

547
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,880
- I guess it doesn't matter

548
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,440
'cause it's not like we can leave.

549
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,000
- It's getting to that time of year

550
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,120
where every year, the last couple of years,

551
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,360
I've been getting to this time of year,

552
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm like, oh man, I hope I get it.

553
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,920
- Yeah.

554
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,740
- I'm probably about to get it.

555
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,880
I bet you I'll have it tomorrow.

556
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
- Again?

557
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,960
- I'll bet you a thousand dollars I have it tomorrow.

558
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,920
- Remember that one time we all recorded together

559
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,440
and you're like, no, it's just my allergies.

560
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,800
- It was my allergies and then it turned into COVID.

561
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,720
- Yeah. (laughs)

562
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
- I don't remember if that's where I got it

563
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,080
or if I got it somewhere else.

564
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,040
- No, I think you did get it from there.

565
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,560
- I was the only one who didn't get it.

566
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,240
So I think that I maybe gave it to you.

567
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
- Yeah, I think 100%.

568
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,120
I think I got it in Seattle from one of you guys.

569
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,960
- Yeah.

570
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,280
- Or from one of our disgusting fans.

571
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,200
- Or from all of those goth clubs we were going to.

572
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,680
- No, they don't have COVID in goth.

573
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,000
- Yeah, no, they scare it away.

574
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,240
- Yeah.

575
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,360
- They don't have COVID, but they have Covina,

576
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
who is a woman who walks around.

577
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
They have Corvid, who's a guy dressed like a crow.

578
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Yeah.

579
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
True.

580
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Pretty scary.

581
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
That was the layup there.

582
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,760
God damn it.

583
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,200
I laid it up with Corvid.

584
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,320
You laid up that Corvid.

585
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
Corvid was the obvious one.

586
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
That's an easy ass layup.

587
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Yeah.

588
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,640
Hopefully you do have COVID, because I think your flesh will taste kind of exquisite in

589
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
a new way.

590
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
It'd be like dry-aged.

591
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
A different flavor.

592
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:02,120
I really, I thought, okay, the other day I left a steak in my fridge for eight days straight,

593
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
and it turned black.

594
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,200
So listen, so I didn't eat it, but I did cut part of it to see if maybe the inside was

595
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
good.

596
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Yeah.

597
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
It wasn't, but I was thinking maybe I probably could have eaten that and it would have tasted

598
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
kind of dry-aged.

599
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
No.

600
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,280
Are you just the fun police?

601
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,800
You don't know, because you aren't doing anything that Guga does in that situation.

602
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,400
So what's the difference between leaving it in there in a bag versus leaving it next to

603
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
an open bowl of yogurt?

604
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,640
The bag.

605
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
The bag is a membrane.

606
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,400
- You guys are learning to cook from Guga.

607
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,640
I'm learning to cook stuff from Google.

608
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,000
Finding recipes on epicurious.com.

609
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,600
- I'm going on Google and I'm looking up Guga Foods.

610
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,840
(laughing)

611
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
'Cause I don't know how to use a YouTube search bar.

612
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,560
- YouTube is owned by Google.

613
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,680
- I really wanna eat a dry aged steak, I've never had one.

614
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
- Me neither. - Let's do it.

615
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,120
- I really wanna do it.

616
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,960
- Do they age it in a special situation

617
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
like they do with alcohols?

618
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
- They put it into a secrets bag

619
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
and then they put it into a degree controller

620
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
that controls how much, how--

621
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,800
- Do you know how they do things like--

622
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,640
- A fridge.

623
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,940
- You know how they do stuff,

624
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,320
you know how they do stuff like with whiskey and stuff

625
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,920
where like this was aged in like a haunted mansion.

626
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
- Yeah.

627
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,580
- Yeah.

628
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,420
- Do they do stuff like that with steak?

629
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,200
- It's like that, but--

630
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,080
- But I mean, can you get a steak that it's like,

631
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,240
oh, like this is aged in a castle.

632
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,160
- I do, it is awesome that there's so much cheap whiskey

633
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,200
that's like, we age this in a barrel

634
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,040
that used to have barbecue sauce in it.

635
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,740
Doesn't that sound like it's worth $40?

636
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,860
That's so cool, man.

637
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,580
It is awesome.

638
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,140
Yeah. We put out a cigarette in this whiskey, and you're tasting it, and you're like, "Oh, yeah."

639
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
I can taste the cigarette.

640
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,980
I can taste that.

641
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm starting a whiskey brand, and my whiskey is going to be aged on a roller coaster.

642
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,940
Oh, wow. That's good.

643
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,860
It's the most fun brand.

644
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,700
It's called Funtime Whiskey.

645
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,580
Yeah, and you drink it, and you say, "Wahoo! Yippee!"

646
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,900
And you put your hands up when you drink it.

647
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,020
You can't control what people say when they drink your whiskey, you asshole.

648
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,500
But it makes you do that, because you can taste the fun.

649
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
It really tastes like a roller coaster experience.

650
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,060
- You see the fucking cheap ass-- - Just shut up.

651
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,900
- Look at the green stuff.

652
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,740
- Just shut up. - I was like,

653
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
oh, why is my eye itching?

654
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,980
- Oh, oh!

655
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,780
I'm gonna make your eye stop itching.

656
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,920
- I'll put them back on 'cause I need to read.

657
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,020
- You don't need to read shit?

658
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,820
- No, I think that you would be better off--

659
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,260
- You need to read two more words in your life.

660
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,380
The end, that's what you see when you die.

661
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,220
- Damn.

662
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,060
- It says the end in front of your eyes.

663
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,260
- Why are you, all right, that's a little far.

664
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,020
Yeah, he's been bringing up a lot of fucking nonsense.

665
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,760
- He has to die for us to eat him.

666
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,100
I'm not gonna kill him. COVID's gonna kill him. That's actually a wonderful point. I'm

667
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:37,280
not saying like I'm gonna, okay, like, but I'm gonna sign a piece of paper. You know

668
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,520
what we need? Oh yeah, here, because we're gonna do your DNR, because you're gonna be

669
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,080
on life support after you eat that energy. I think I do have a, I think I have a DNR.

670
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:54,520
You have a DNR? At age 25? Yeah. What? Why? I put it on my license. You have a, you know,

671
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:01,520
you're a donor. No, no, no, no. I don't have organ donor on it. I have do not resuscitate.

672
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,760
You better not have organ donor on your fucking license after what I've seen with your body.

673
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,160
I do have, and you know what? I would be so pissed off if I got your kidney. If I got

674
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,920
your green kidney, it's going to kill you 50 times faster. What are you talking about?

675
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,920
My shit's all strong. I have so many preservatives in me. No, that's not how it works. Yes it

676
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,120
does know you're young you will die at 31 you will die I have I have a do not

677
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,280
resuscitate because I misheard them when I was when I was like signing all the

678
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,160
stuff and figure it out I thought I thought that I was saying please kill me

679
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,560
if I'm ever inside a Cobra mmm that's probably scary to be in yeah yeah I don't

680
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,840
want to be in a Cobra ma'am I'm sorry to say yeah you're so we had to put your

681
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:49,760
son in a Cobra we had to medically put your son in a Cobra I have a I have a

682
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,600
Sorry, did you say coma?

683
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,440
I also have a DNS.

684
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
A cobra?

685
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,120
(laughing)

686
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,160
Yep, he's in a cobra.

687
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,360
I have a DNS on mine.

688
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,280
And he's on that bed.

689
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,080
It's a do not suscitate.

690
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,920
What does that mean?

691
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,640
It means, look, you don't need to resuscitate me.

692
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
You can resuscitate me.

693
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,300
Once is enough.

694
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,140
You can resuscitate me all I want.

695
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,080
I've already been suscitated.

696
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,560
But once I'm suscitated, that's it for me.

697
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,520
I only need it once.

698
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
Watch this, all right, Daffy Duck.

699
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,840
Thuthitate.

700
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,680
That's Sylvester.

701
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,800
That's Sylvester the cat, yeah.

702
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,640
What am I, a fucking tune genius?

703
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,000
you have to make me the king of all fucking tunes.

704
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,920
Shut the hell up.

705
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,600
You think I still pay for boomerang?

706
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,440
- Yeah.

707
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,280
- Dude, I wanna pay for boomerangs.

708
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,940
I keep the boomerang icon on my Roku channels

709
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,000
just so I can look at it.

710
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,440
- It doesn't look good. - I don't have an account.

711
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,040
It just has Bugs Bunny and Scooby Doo on it.

712
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,880
- You look at it, oh that's funny.

713
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,480
- I just love seeing that between Netflix and YouTube.

714
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,200
There's a picture of Scooby Doo for me to look at.

715
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
Damn.

716
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,520
- You know you can get a screensaver on Roku.

717
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,340
- Yeah, it just automatically sets mine,

718
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,740
It sets it to like whatever new movie just came out and I like it that way.

719
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,340
They should make a scream shaver, like a tooth tune.

720
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:54,840
Mm-hmm.

721
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,340
Rage Blade.

722
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,840
Oh, and you...

723
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,340
Oh, every time...

724
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:56,840
Oh, every time...

725
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,340
AHH!

726
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah.

727
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,340
Yeah.

728
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,840
Home Alone.

729
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,340
It startles you.

730
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,840
Pretty good.

731
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,340
Yeah.

732
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,840
Every single time.

733
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,340
[Laughter]

734
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,340
We have the screensaver on the TV at my house is...

735
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,340
They downloaded an app that's just pictures of monkeys.

736
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Mmm.

737
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,840
And there's this one picture of a monkey going like...

738
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,340
Oooh.

739
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,840
[Laughter]

740
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
And every time I leave the TV on, it's just a monkey going...

741
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
When I leave my TV on, it goes to Roku City.

742
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,400
- Dude, my fucking, I'd like to go to Roku City.

743
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,480
My fucking screensaver on my shit is,

744
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,920
it's connected to my mother-in-law's phone.

745
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,760
- Oh yeah.

746
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,400
- So it's just every picture on her fucking phone.

747
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,600
So it's just, and she does like real estate shit.

748
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,680
So sometimes it's just like a picture of a house or a sign

749
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,820
or like all these people from their church

750
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,600
that I don't know who they are.

751
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,040
And so if we have people over, they're like,

752
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,200
oh, who's this, is this your family?

753
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,920
And I go, I don't know who this is.

754
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,760
(laughing)

755
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,620
These people have no idea that they've been beamed

756
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,000
on to my television for three years now.

757
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,940
You can change that at any time, though.

758
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,060
I don't know how.

759
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,940
Google it.

760
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,700
What?

761
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,500
I don't know how.

762
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,020
I don't care.

763
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,740
It's funny.

764
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,700
Sometimes I see a real-- there's just one guy who's on there.

765
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,460
The slogan of our generation, I don't care, it's funny.

766
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,420
There's this-- whoa.

767
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,660
There's this one guy who's on my TV basically

768
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,980
every 16 to 17 minutes who is like 600 pounds big.

769
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,100
And he's so-- and every time he comes up, I laugh.

770
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,740
Every time.

771
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,780
There's ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends of the family that I haven't seen in years on there,

772
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,760
and they just all look right at me.

773
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,460
There's a guy who comes on my TV sometimes who's 600-700 pounds.

774
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,780
Yeah, when I turn the TV off, I'm fat as hell.

775
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Come on, you're not that fat.

776
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,980
Come on.

777
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
You're like 600 pounds.

778
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,700
You're like maybe 3 or 4 hundred pounds.

779
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,980
And I show up in the reflection.

780
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,100
I saw a Seinfeld joke the other day that just a full lie that he did on stage, where he's

781
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,620
He's like, "I'm 300 pounds! I'm a fat guy!"

782
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:54,060
The joke was, he's talking about a news story the other day about the world's fattest man.

783
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,060
He's 1600 pounds!

784
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,500
I guess the joke is from the 80s where people would believe that.

785
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Nobody was 1600 pounds!

786
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
No way!

787
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,060
His whole joke was that even if he lost 400 pounds, he'd still be 1200 pounds!

788
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,180
Nobody's ever been that big either.

789
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,380
- That's so annoying, dude, I was like, you--

790
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,540
- 1,600 pounds!

791
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,260
- Maybe you meant grams.

792
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,180
- Google what is 1,600 pounds,

793
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,260
just let's get some examples of stuff that is 1,600 pounds.

794
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,100
- Things that are 1,600 pounds.

795
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,060
- 'Cause 2,000 pounds is a ton, right?

796
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,180
- But it, yeah, but it really pissed me off,

797
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,460
I was like, I can't believe--

798
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,140
- Oh yeah, so that's $2,000.

799
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:29,980
- $1,900.

800
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,580
No, none of these people are 1,600 pounds.

801
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,780
- Search things that are 1,600 pounds.

802
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,540
- People get to be 700 pounds,

803
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
people get to be 750 pounds.

804
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,940
- There we go, what, wait, no, go back,

805
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,940
first result was the thing we're looking for.

806
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,940
Here we go.

807
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,940
Several breeds of cattle.

808
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,940
He may have been talking about a cow.

809
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
He may have been talking about the Hereford Angus.

810
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I may be messed up really bad

811
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
and he was just talking about a cow.

812
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,940
And the Encole Watsui.

813
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,940
You know, now that I think about it,

814
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
it was a cow. This cow!

815
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
Oh wow!

816
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
Oh wow! This looks like one of those long-haired cows.

817
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Can you pull up

818
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
the next tab for me, Julio?

819
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,140
tab you have open. Just pull it, yeah, just that one right there, just click on that.

820
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:19,620
Whoa! Oh, interesting. Okay, so this... Wait, why did you just have this prepared?

821
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,540
He says it's right there. Wait, okay, so wait, I'm curious about this, Cameron.

822
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,500
Yeah. This is a slideshow that says in the title, "I have prepared some

823
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,420
information about eating human flesh." We've not been stuck in here all that

824
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:39,780
long. Why? This is an old, this is from the last time we were stuck in here. Oh, okay.

825
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:46,860
I never ended up showing you guys. Oh, carry on, carry, continue. But yeah, I kind of did,

826
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,560
this is, you know, it's a list of, I found out, so, this is an aggregation, okay? I found

827
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,860
some stuff for different, yeah. So this is kind of the Metacritic of cannibalism. Rotten

828
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,940
tomatoes. What I've put together for you guys. I'm giving being stuck in a, I'm being, just

829
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,180
being stuck in a bunker with fucking ice all over me. It's giving being stuck in a bunker

830
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,540
I'm giving that certified, what's the opposite of fresh in that? Rotten. Rotten. Yeah. Certified

831
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:13,220
rotten. Frozen. Yeah. If I'm stuck in a bunker with ice, I'm doing some leftist ass shit

832
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,380
and beating the crap out of them. Oh, ice. Oh, ice. I haven't heard about ice all that

833
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,780
much recently. No. Yeah, you don't really hear it. It must have gotten abolished. Yeah.

834
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,980
It's over. Probably. We did it! Well, you guys did it. Yeah, I didn't do it either, actually.

835
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
They put G.B.O. in a computer.

836
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,220
(laughter)

837
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,540
He tried to visit for Christmas

838
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,140
and they put him completely in a computer.

839
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,620
Ice did that, look at that.

840
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,220
They made him green.

841
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,400
That's fucking crazy.

842
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,440
- Okay, so we'll start off with just some fun facts

843
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,220
and some fun little tidbits about eating human flesh.

844
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,060
This is the first thing.

845
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,420
- Ooh, tidbits is probably a good part of a human.

846
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,460
- Yeah, well we'll see if the tidbits are good.

847
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,720
- Somebody named Tid.

848
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,560
- Yeah.

849
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,180
Their recipe, girl the human flesh with the bud of the pindopalm.

850
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,500
So that's, first of all, that's if we were going to cook Patrick,

851
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,980
we could girl him with pindopalm.

852
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,580
What's pindopalm?

853
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,540
Yeah, what is pindopalm?

854
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,340
It's just an ingredient.

855
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,260
Do we have that here?

856
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,100
We might have that.

857
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,740
Oh, wait.

858
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,060
Here's the-- I think this is called the pindo.

859
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,820
Of your palm?

860
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Yeah.

861
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,420
The pindopalm.

862
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,500
That's probably what it means.

863
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,380
If a man is being eaten, boil the penis and give it to a woman.

864
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,020
Oh.

865
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,700
Eating male genitalia means they will give birth to a boy.

866
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,380
So we have to boil his cock and give it to you.

867
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,460
No.

868
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,100
No, that wouldn't really make any sense.

869
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,740
I bet it doesn't taste good boiled. Boiled? Yeah, I think that you're probably right.

870
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,940
I think that the human penis probably tastes really good braised. I bet yours might taste good boiled.

871
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,700
Yours probably would taste good boiled because it's reverse. Yeah, I guess my penis probably has the same chemicals in it

872
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:49,020
in it that a hot dog would. Also, you're uncircumcised so you kind of need to boil it like a

873
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,500
like you'd hark off a corn. Yeah, that's true. I guess if you're cutting off my penis to eat it,

874
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,600
You're already tomorrow. We won't cut it off before we boil it. We'll just lay you over a pot. Yeah

875
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:12,500
We'll get the rest of your meat afterwards the hurt locker when I got a tattoo once you watch the hurt locker

876
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,580
Yeah, you were in the fucking hurt locker. That's right. It hurts to get tattooed. Mm-hmm

877
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,840
If you're a pussy, no, it hurts. No, it hurts. He actually well you you were you have a low pain tolerance

878
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,700
No, when you're talking about it, it doesn't, it obviously, the only way you would say it

879
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,820
doesn't hurt is if you had a medical issue or you were...

880
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,220
I have a medical issue.

881
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,580
You don't have that medical issue.

882
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:39,620
I will say the first couple times you get tattooed, it definitely doesn't hurt as bad

883
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,420
as... the more tattoos you get, the worse it hurts because you have it built in your

884
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,700
head of like, "Oh man, this sucks."

885
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,700
Every single time it gets worse.

886
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I think I agree with you.

887
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Yeah.

888
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,540
And also, healing is worse than the tattoo though.

889
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
That's the worst part.

890
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Definitely.

891
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,620
hurt you're a liar. It hurts. Or a girl. Girls always say it doesn't hurt. No, girls are

892
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,260
liars though. Yeah, I agree. Every single girl is a liar. Maybe a boy with his penis

893
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,620
defeated to himself. Oh, that sounds good. And then you'll give birth to a boy, Patrick

894
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:14,860
Jr. I would love that. Do you think you'll ever have kids? If I do, it will be an accident.

895
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,300
And not after today. Thank you for being so brutally honest. I would love to see you at

896
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,640
your kid's soccer game.

897
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah?

898
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Yeah.

899
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,580
Especially if you have a jock kid and you're just picking grass.

900
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:36,180
I don't know if I'd be the worst dad in the world or just a very good dad, but not the

901
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,060
best.

902
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:42,980
You think that the ceiling for you is a very good, but not the best dad.

903
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
No.

904
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
No way.

905
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
There's no world where you're a good dad.

906
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
No way.

907
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,900
If my kid gives me world's greatest dad, I'm like, "All right, you left."

908
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll be honest. I don't think I think that the ceiling for everybody is very good. No, I know such thing as the best

909
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,320
I will be the best

910
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:04,420
Because everyone hates their parents for random shit doesn't suck that if you have kids so you're there speak for yourself

911
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,980
Well, this guy's you this guy's creepily. Yeah, I don't creepily love my parents. I just have a really nice relationship

912
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:18,700
Okay, yeah world's best father he's got the pictures to prove it

913
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,020
Oh, good for him.

914
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,420
Since the birth of his daughter, his photos feature Dave and Alice and his signature trophy

915
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
mug.

916
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Wow.

917
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,380
Well, we found out who the best dad in the world is.

918
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
Let's see.

919
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Oh.

920
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Oh.

921
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
There he is.

922
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
That's the best dad in the world.

923
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
Oh, God.

924
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Wait.

925
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,380
He just makes photos with a mug and his kids?

926
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,140
Wait, he's actually a terrible dad, guys.

927
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
They trapped his child.

928
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,460
This is some kind of ironic bullshit.

929
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,980
Wait.

930
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,380
That's not right at all.

931
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,060
Why is there pomegranates next to the fucking turkey?

932
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,220
And what... oh okay.

933
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,420
He's doing ballet.

934
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,020
He's putting a boot on his kid's fucking head.

935
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,180
This guy seems like a moron of a father.

936
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,500
Wait, what is that? That mirror... wait, go back one.

937
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,140
There's a very confusing mirror behind...

938
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,140
What the hell is going on there?

939
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,060
Where does that mirror begin and end?

940
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
I guess the mirror is the whole wall.

941
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,020
The whole wall is a mirror.

942
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,780
Yeah.

943
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,740
Alright, well, okay, that makes no sound right go back. I can see where the mirror ends now go back to that corner here

944
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,620
in

945
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,220
2013 New York police officer

946
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,300
Gilberto volley was arrested for plotting a kidnap torture and eat female victims the cannibal cop search terms like human meat recipes and how

947
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,180
To cook a girl using the screen name meat market, man. Yeah

948
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,300
I think

949
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:44,920
Market man he had like a bunch of posts on like a forum or something. That's how he got got yeah

950
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,800
Well, yeah, also he googled human meat recipes under the screen name meat market man you guys remember that fucking Winklevoss twin actor

951
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,580
Yeah, army. Oh army hammer. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you wanted to eat a girl, too

952
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:03,540
Yeah, yeah, I cook a woman said he wanted to eat a girl's butt and her pussy. That's disgusting

953
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,360
That's that's gross in Pakistan's Bacar district two brothers were arrested for digging up the grave of a 24 year old woman and cooking her

954
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,080
and a curry. After serving two years in prison, the brothers were arrested again. Complaints

955
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,540
about the smell of rotting flesh led authorities to their home where authorities discovered

956
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,300
the head of a child. The brothers admitted to cooking the youngster in a curry. We do

957
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,100
not know the details of their recipe. However, Punjabi cuisine is rich, robust, and full

958
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
of flavor.

959
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:35,480
Alright, well thank god. Thank god it was at least robust and full of flavor.

960
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,680
I also, I mean, they're committed to the game. They go to jail for cooking someone.

961
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,560
and again i got a meal a like

962
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,000
double down right again i'll take a look at the worst

963
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,720
the workers

964
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
possible one

965
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,440
what do you want a word of your brother you want to do

966
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
well i guess i guess

967
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,840
that's the uh... run probably got a problem was we we a little woman

968
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,560
you know we we got a kid i don't think i had now

969
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,280
yet property will probably less matter we need a child's headhead

970
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,520
god damn dude

971
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,040
so that i found this article

972
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,520
okay how to cook your roommate into a pie science

973
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,280
And I thought this was gonna have a recipe.

974
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,200
I thought this would be useful

975
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,000
in case we wanted to cook Patrick into a pie,

976
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,760
'cause right now he's basically our roommate.

977
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,600
'Cause we're trapped in here.

978
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,640
- I would love to put you on a spit.

979
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,680
That's a really good--

980
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,040
- We should spit roast him.

981
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,960
- Yeah.

982
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,800
- Promise?

983
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
- Yeah, sure.

984
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,160
Yeah, I'll spit roast you, Cameron.

985
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,000
- Yeah, yeah.

986
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,280
- Yeah, we'll spit roast you.

987
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,120
- Sure.

988
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,480
Okay, we're gonna spit roast you later.

989
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,320
Wait, what?

990
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
- Now you have to do it.

991
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,160
Now you have to spit roast me.

992
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,600
- We were already planning on spit roasting.

993
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,960
- Yeah, you've gotta do it.

994
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,740
You're gonna take all 2.25 inches of my index finger.

995
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,120
- Wait, that was a bait and switch.

996
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,960
- Yep, a bait and--

997
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,120
- Are you guys talking about fucking?

998
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,200
I was talking about eating him.

999
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,080
- No, I'm gonna stick my finger in his cavity

1000
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,280
to test the temperature.

1001
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,200
- I thought you guys were talking about

1002
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,360
fucking and eating me.

1003
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,880
- I'm gonna cook you 'til, what do you think,

1004
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,440
okay, look at him.

1005
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,160
Look at, and think about all the things

1006
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,000
that are in his body.

1007
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,320
What do you think is a safe temperature to eat him at?

1008
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,160
Because honestly--

1009
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,980
- 7,000 degrees.

1010
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,760
- I probably would not eat until 500 internal.

1011
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,120
- I would not, you could not be eating medium rare.

1012
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,600
You couldn't be eating medium.

1013
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,440
- No. - I think that you

1014
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
would need to be well done. - I think you'd have to,

1015
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
you'd have to braise me like I'm venison.

1016
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,120
- I'd look at him and I'd be like,

1017
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,200
okay, I'm gonna eat internal temperature 500,

1018
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,680
let's do it, that's the only safe way.

1019
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,520
I put him in the oven,

1020
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,280
immediately smelled burning plastic.

1021
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,160
- Yeah, yeah. - Well--

1022
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,760
- It's like when you leave, it's like leaving the,

1023
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
accidentally leaving the plastic wrapper

1024
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,480
on the frozen pizza.

1025
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,080
- That would kinda melt it down though, right?

1026
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,920
- You know when you do that?

1027
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,740
- No. - No, I've never done that.

1028
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,580
- I never did that.

1029
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,320
I was thinking of a thing that people do.

1030
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Do people do that?

1031
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,480
I feel like that's happened before.

1032
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,320
I've definitely left the cardboard on the bottom.

1033
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,720
I know, I was trying to think of a thing that was plastic and the cardboard's not plastic.

1034
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Well, think about it.

1035
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,520
You've eaten the Hungry Man dinner.

1036
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,280
I probably taste just the same as the chopped sirloin in that.

1037
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,440
You're like a Chungus Man dinner.

1038
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
You're like Big Chungus because you're so hilarious.

1039
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,440
You take that back, you piece of shit.

1040
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Oh, I thought you were calling me fat.

1041
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,920
You're so funny.

1042
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,200
I love getting that compliment after stand-up.

1043
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
You're so funny like Big Chungus.

1044
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,200
You're funny, you remind me of Big Chungus, look how funny you are.

1045
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Thank you, thank you.

1046
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Who do I remind you of?

1047
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Big Chungus.

1048
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
That's our favorite impression that you do.

1049
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Thank you very much.

1050
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I could see you opening up for Big Chungus one day.

1051
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
You could open up for Big Chungus.

1052
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:41,480
big chungus, my comedy mount rushmore, kinesin, chapelle, sinus, chungus, big chungus, sucks

1053
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:49,200
that ralphie mayes stole all of his material.

1054
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,520
But anyway you need to be yeah very hot the hardest part of course would be acquiring the meat

1055
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,600
No, I'm gonna him would be the bones. We don't have the problem. We don't have that problem

1056
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,120
We got the meat right here, but actually however

1057
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:07,560
Would be cannibal acquires her meat cooking it early is the trickiest part. Okay. It's actually the hardest parts actually cooking it, okay

1058
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,040
Yeah, one after the other pretty well if you're a girl

1059
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,640
I guess I guess actually the hardest part is acquiring it, but the trickiest part is cooking

1060
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,680
Why don't you see as many women serial killers?

1061
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,200
Oh, there's--

1062
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,280
It's almost like men have some fucking evil thing inside

1063
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:20,480
of them that hurts them.

1064
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,780
You ever heard of Eileen Warno?

1065
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,800
Shh.

1066
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,880
Makes them want to kill, murder, and really hurt people really,

1067
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,160
really badly, especially women.

1068
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,880
Yeah, it is almost like that.

1069
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,200
But women don't have that for some reason.

1070
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,840
Women just do that to their children.

1071
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,680
Women do that emotionally, serial killing.

1072
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,180
Yeah.

1073
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,680
Yeah.

1074
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,180
Emotionally--

1075
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,440
Breaking up with good guys.

1076
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,240
Yeah, and ghosting.

1077
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah.

1078
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,960
Emotional serial killers all over Bumble and Bee.

1079
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,440
Bumble and Bee. I know one of the apps. I'm on all the apps. I'm on Bee. Yeah, I'm on all

1080
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,160
the apps. I told you guys this the other day. Yeah, I'm on all the apps. Yeah, talking Tom

1081
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,160
and talking Ben. You ever heard of Eileen Wuornos though? You knew that that lady was killing

1082
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,240
men because she had no eyebrows. I'm going to lean on your Wuornos. Yeah. Yep, and I'm

1083
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:09,960
going to lean all over it and go. I'll spit all over it. Wow. Yeah, I'm on all the apps.

1084
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm on bubble. I'm on bubble. I'm on bubble. I'm on toad in the hole. I'm on

1085
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,200
bubble. I'm on apples and pears. Yeah I met this girl on bubble. We really popped.

1086
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,920
Oh that could be actually a pretty good one to do. Does 23andMe have a racial

1087
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,480
dating aspect to it? No. Am I going crazy? You are going crazy. I thought that 23andMe you could

1088
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,880
match up with people who have your same DNA. I think they just match up with your cousin. I think

1089
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,760
they make websites like that. Really? Yeah. Well they make, I mean they make them for

1090
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,320
religions I think they make room 23 and me if they in a worse year we why you

1091
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,800
want to get on white date I want to get on no I want to go on the opposite I

1092
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,160
want to get on a dating website that shows me the exact opposite I do a deal

1093
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,720
oh that's a great idea you do a DNA test and it matches you up with the person

1094
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,320
who's the exact I tried to do that I tried to do that too and I kept matching

1095
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:04,720
up with sea scorpions yeah the exact opposite of my DNA that's a good point

1096
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:16,200
a cactus yeah yeah okay as BritLab host Greg Foot in an attempt to eat a strip of

1097
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,040
his own leg meat earlier this year the muscle in a human thigh broken down into

1098
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,240
its constituent fibers is roughly equivalent to half chicken breast

1099
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,840
combined with various cuts of beef so apparently Greg Foot ate his leg that's

1100
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,640
I don't believe I went I found some pictures of Greg Foot doing this I guess

1101
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:40,320
he did this so this is Greg Foot and he says this is a meme I found about Greg

1102
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,680
Foot. This is my cooked leg meat. This is my cooked leg meat and that's Greg Foot right

1103
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,160
there. Yeah I know I can tell. And he went ahead and he ate it I guess in a burger

1104
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,040
or something. Did he lose his leg? I didn't watch the video I just looked at a bunch of

1105
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:57,360
pictures. Why did he? And he liked it! Look! He really liked it. Oh he liked it so much

1106
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,360
I'd put him in an insane asylum.

1107
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
He's having so much fun.

1108
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I like that he like...

1109
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,360
This picture was making me laugh so much.

1110
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
If you google "Greg Foot eat leg meat"

1111
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
this is like the first thing that comes up.

1112
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,360
He like...

1113
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
It wasn't for science.

1114
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,360
It was for BBC.

1115
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,360
If he put it in a fucking burger bun...

1116
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,360
Just eat the leg meat like a nice steak.

1117
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Put it on a...

1118
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,360
See? First picture.

1119
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,360
I wasn't lying.

1120
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:32,900
it. Juvio tried to fact check me. Wait, Greg Hefley memes. Wait, click on that. Greg Hefley

1121
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:41,440
memes. How you feel when someone mistakes you for a... Oh, I know this feeling. That's

1122
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,200
a skater thing, right? Or a surfer thing. Or it's also a surfer thing? What's going on

1123
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,140
with this troubled child? Oh shit! Oh fuck, zoom out, zoom out Juvio. Show everybody the

1124
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,120
full text here. Come on now. Holy crap, that's funny as fuck. Oh yeah, Greg Heffley or Under

1125
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,340
Arrest for Sipping. Didn't, wasn't there a guy who ate his leg or some shit? Yeah, Greg

1126
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,820
Foot. No, no, this is a guy who like, him and his friends made like tacos out of his

1127
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,700
foot. Oh yeah, out of his foot. Yes, I did. I saw that when I was, he made foot tacos.

1128
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,260
What if his name was also Greg? And they said, I read, I was reading, I thought it wasn't,

1129
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,060
there wasn't enough funny stuff to put into this slideshow, but they described the taste

1130
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:20,180
as beefy. Yeah. They ate foot tacos and they said, "It tastes beefy." Yeah. Beef-eat. Beef-eat.

1131
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,780
- Like beef eat? - Yeah, beef eat.

1132
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,380
I'd like to eat some beef instead of foot eat.

1133
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,300
- Yeah, that's a good point.

1134
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,420
What else you got on here?

1135
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,540
- Well, I'm gonna drink some water first

1136
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,220
so you guys can just talk while I do that.

1137
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,060
- Okay, here, I'll do my impression of Cameron while he drinks.

1138
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,300
(gurgling)

1139
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,020
- I didn't do a single thing of that.

1140
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,060
So next up I found, I think the next thing

1141
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,260
is a different website, let's see here.

1142
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
- He's talking up and down about how I'm gonna taste

1143
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,540
like plastic, and then he drinks out of this plastic bottle.

1144
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,740
- Well, I'm not gonna be eating it, so it doesn't matter.

1145
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,940
- You're already putting your lips on plastic.

1146
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,820
- If that was your bottle, you'd be eating the bottle.

1147
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,440
I know you'd be like no this has b12 vitamins in it. It probably does

1148
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,100
It's probably made entirely out of b12 no no no you okay, so here's something I found from the straight dope message board

1149
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Yo, uh-huh that's great dope

1150
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:11,060
Master chefs how would you prepare human meat? This is obviously a hypothetical question and no I do not need an answer fast

1151
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,600
That is a great kind of a cover. Yeah

1152
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:13,860
Yeah

1153
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,160
No

1154
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,840
and I really don't care when I get this because I got no meat.

1155
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,200
And this is from the normalvore. I eat normal foods.

1156
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,960
I'm not defrosting any meat on my counter.

1157
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,760
Yeah. So, a bunch of people had different answers for this here.

1158
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,160
Somebody said, Calibri said, "Since this is about cooking,

1159
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,240
it's better suited for cafe society than general questions."

1160
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,840
So, they recategorized it as the first thing on there.

1161
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,640
Send it over there.

1162
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,600
This question about cannibalism, we have to put this in the cooking forum.

1163
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,680
So, what does cafe society have to say about it?

1164
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
Let's find out.

1165
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,760
Carpaccio of buttock.

1166
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,200
What the hell is carpaccio?

1167
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,960
You know what carpaccio is.

1168
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,880
It's like a type of cut.

1169
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,480
It's a it's really thinly sliced

1170
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,640
like meat.

1171
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,200
I didn't eat meat until I was like

1172
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,000
you ate poop carpaccio.

1173
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,280
Oh I've heard you say that before.

1174
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,920
But I didn't eat. I've never.

1175
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,440
I just thought I don't really I had to

1176
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,680
look up what carpaccio was.

1177
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,000
I just thought carpaccio of buttock

1178
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,160
was a funny thing to say.

1179
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,480
Yeah it is the first thing.

1180
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,680
Just you know I had a steak for the

1181
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,160
first time with you guys.

1182
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Really? Outback Steakhouse. That was your first steak? Yeah, I think so. What?

1183
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I think that was either my first or my second one.

1184
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,860
Yeah. First like, are you, you mean the one that was raw? Yeah.

1185
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,360
Your first cut of steak. That was the first time I'd ever, I mean, I had like maybe some tacos or something.

1186
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,060
My first time eating just a steak, that was it. Wow.

1187
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,260
You didn't act like it. You acted like you ate a hundred steaks before.

1188
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,560
I watched a bunch of videos about eating steak.

1189
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,060
(Laughter)

1190
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,560
I watched a bunch of videos about. You're 14 years old, dude.

1191
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,000
I didn't eat meat until I was like fucking way old.

1192
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,940
- Googling how to say slang before I go

1193
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,780
hang out with my friends.

1194
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,240
- No, I watch videos about cooking steak.

1195
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,040
- What to say when eating steak for the first time

1196
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,220
to fool people that I've eaten steak before.

1197
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,040
- You ordered it fucking rare too.

1198
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,760
- I said medium rare because I learned

1199
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,000
that that's the cool way to order steak, like James Bond.

1200
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,200
That's like the shake and not stir.

1201
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,280
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1202
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,120
- Yeah, you go.

1203
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,200
And I'll have that medium rare

1204
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,320
because I don't regard my life for my mouth.

1205
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,800
And then it came out and it was a complete red slab of meat

1206
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,960
and I ate the whole thing for you guys.

1207
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,960
you didn't eat it because we stopped you from eating it.

1208
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,960
We stopped you from eating it.

1209
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960
You pretended that you liked it.

1210
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,960
That steak wasn't like...

1211
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,960
I told you do not eat that.

1212
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,960
That steak was blue. It tasted good.

1213
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,960
That was the rawest steak I've ever seen.

1214
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,960
We kept saying please don't eat that.

1215
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,960
You kept putting it in your mouth and spitting it out.

1216
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,960
I wanted him to eat it.

1217
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,960
It tasted good.

1218
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
And it was that rapper.

1219
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,960
Young Givenchy.

1220
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Shout out Young Givenchy.

1221
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,960
if he's dropped anything.

1222
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,800
- He's our waiter.

1223
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,160
- I wonder if he's like watching us.

1224
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,280
- I think he's making it out of Amarillo, dude.

1225
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,120
- He's gotta be.

1226
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,940
- Yeah.

1227
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,780
- Yeah, he's next up at Amarillo.

1228
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,620
- He's probably in Hollywood.

1229
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,640
(laughing)

1230
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,200
- But yeah, I thought that that was a normal,

1231
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,600
that's not, most steaks are not like that, I've learned.

1232
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,440
- Yeah.

1233
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,440
- 'Cause now I eat steak all the time.

1234
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,280
- Yeah.

1235
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,100
- And after that, 'cause I was like,

1236
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,840
I had that and I was like, that was really good.

1237
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,680
I loved that.

1238
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,880
- It was really good.

1239
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,420
- And then I started making my own now.

1240
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,240
- I'd look for chimpanzee recipes.

1241
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,080
- Oh.

1242
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,900
- Bup said that.

1243
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,140
eat chimpanzees do they? I think they used to maybe. They eat like brains and shit. Yeah,

1244
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,780
they eat a chimps brain in Indiana Jones. Yeah, and that's a documentary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah,

1245
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:18,620
and that's a documentary Patrick. Is that a way, is that like a real, do people eat

1246
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,460
chimpanzees brains or is that Steven Spielberg being like. I think monkey brains, no people

1247
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,340
eat those. Okay. I was gonna say is that just like. I think it's dangerous to eat though.

1248
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,820
I think, I thought that was just like them being like. You can turn into a monkey. You

1249
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:33,540
can get banana hunger. Kuru. Kuru, like Hillary Clinton had. Hillary Clinton had a Kuru? What

1250
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:40,160
What do you guys see this Google Hillary Clinton Kuru KURU is a prion disease you get it when you eat

1251
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,360
You can only get it from eating human brain. Oh, yeah, I don't know Kuru prion. What are these new streaming services?

1252
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,000
Go to images here

1253
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400
See oh

1254
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,960
Yeah, her face was rotting off. That's classic Kuru symptoms. She cuz basically she's eating face became white

1255
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,140
She ate human brain and a bohemian Grove

1256
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,160
in a preschool or something. Women aren't allowed in Bohemian Grove, by the way.

1257
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,160
Yeah, it was something else. See, is it a brain injury or Kuru from cannibalsome?

1258
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,160
She cannibalized, probably some children, some brains.

1259
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Wow. And she got Kuru. And look, that water has a lime in it.

1260
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Look at that circle. See that? That is a telltale symptom of Kuru, green thumb.

1261
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Oh, shit. People who get Kuru get green thumb when they drink water.

1262
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
Wow. Good at gardening. Yeah. I see that.

1263
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,520
But only when they drink water.

1264
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,020
Okay.

1265
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
So here's some other stuff.

1266
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,600
So this is something, you know, I'd process the carcass same as I would a deer,

1267
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,100
discarding all the organs, and then someone replied to that and said,

1268
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,600
"Bold and underlined as mine, you are a fool.

1269
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
You are discarding some of the best meats available."

1270
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,600
Which is probably true, you know, discarding the organs.

1271
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,100
All organs, yeah, no.

1272
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
Have you guys eaten liver? I've never had it.

1273
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,600
I want to, though.

1274
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,600
The reason I put this on here is because this guy fires back, okay?

1275
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,100
And says, "Do not call me a fool, please.

1276
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,100
This isn't the pit and you needn't get carried away with trying to play up to your nickname."

1277
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,540
I do not enjoy the flavor of many organ meats and in wild game the organs can be infected with some

1278
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:09,060
unpleasant parasites and a human they will likely have the same unpleasant favorite flavor and in the case of the liver have a high concentration of

1279
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:13,680
Waste and Toscan's toxins that I do not wish to consume you may feast on all the meat byproducts

1280
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,680
It pleasures you to consume good day

1281
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:23,920
With a good day, yeah, Willie won't get his ass every every fifth grade nerds dream is to get in a situation

1282
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Where you can hit someone with a good day?

1283
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:33,020
Dude getting saying good day to you or now we're snowed in I have a late-stage hypothermia

1284
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:39,520
Okay, where you get you start to get really really? Yeah, I'm snowed in should exposing the truth about human meat true

1285
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,980
Eat words

1286
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:52,060
The words snowed in I've never had liver me neither. I want I don't get it at the grocery store all the time

1287
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,060
I really want to eat

1288
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,860
I haven't knowingly had liver.

1289
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,180
I want liver and onions really, really badly.

1290
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,060
Me too.

1291
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:02,980
I look at it and then I'm like, well, you have to keep it in milk for like an hour.

1292
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:04,220
That's what you'll be saying, by the way.

1293
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:04,780
You said me too.

1294
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:06,740
That's what you'll be saying once you've had liver and onions.

1295
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,700
You'll be going, meat?

1296
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,220
Who?

1297
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,420
Because you love liver so much now.

1298
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,340
Yeah.

1299
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,860
I also, I don't eat livers.

1300
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,740
I prefer to eat dead stuff.

1301
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,380
Yeah.

1302
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:15,940
Stuff's already dead.

1303
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,420
That's right.

1304
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,740
Yeah.

1305
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,100
And what the hell is dead bitters?

1306
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,540
I don't want to eat a liver.

1307
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,500
Yeah.

1308
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,260
I want to eat something--

1309
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,980
I wanna eat raw heart pretty badly though,

1310
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,820
just 'cause I feel like--

1311
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,180
- You are an insane person.

1312
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,900
You watch too many of these gym guys

1313
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,820
and you fuckin'--

1314
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,700
- The office.

1315
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,540
- Yeah. (laughs)

1316
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,420
- Yeah, kill me, or sue me.

1317
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,260
- Yeah, that's why you wanna eat so many--

1318
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,080
- Kill me. (laughs)

1319
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,060
- That's why you wanna eat so many fuckin' bones.

1320
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,300
Yeah, dried up bones, turn into a powder,

1321
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,780
make 'em into gelatin.

1322
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,060
- Too long of a line between point A and point B

1323
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,020
on that one, I'd say. - Yeah.

1324
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,420
- You could've said, yeah, you wanna eat bones.

1325
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,980
You had dry bones, you Mario Kart motherfucker.

1326
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,300
- You know how, have you guys ever watched a show Hannibal?

1327
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,960
You know how people say like, okay, well people--

1328
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,800
- You mean cannibal?

1329
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,120
- So you know, people, there's a bunch of scenes in that show

1330
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,120
where Hannibal, Hannibal Burress,

1331
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,720
is preparing like human meat,

1332
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,560
and they make it look like really good.

1333
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,400
- And he puts pickle juice on it.

1334
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,240
- Yeah.

1335
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,060
(laughing)

1336
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,320
- Yep, yep, that's what happens.

1337
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,080
- They make it look really good,

1338
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,240
and people are always like,

1339
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,240
people always say about the show,

1340
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,840
they're like, yeah, like that show,

1341
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,120
it made me wanna eat human meat,

1342
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,900
'cause it looked so good when they were preparing it.

1343
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,880
That's like their joke that they always say about that show.

1344
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,000
And I think it's funny to imagine,

1345
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,320
like watching that show for the first time,

1346
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,160
and turning it on and being like,

1347
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,600
Oh my god, it does look really good.

1348
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,840
It's just all the characters talking to each other

1349
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,480
before they show any cooking scenes.

1350
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,080
You're just looking at Mads Mikkelsen and being like,

1351
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,040
"Oh my god, they really do make human meat

1352
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,160
"look like it tastes so good in this show."

1353
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,600
- Mads Mikkelsen would not be in my top 1,000 people

1354
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,440
to eat. - No, definitely not.

1355
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,880
- No, fuck no, dude. - Probably the very bottom.

1356
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,160
- Dude, I'd eat Bert Kreischer.

1357
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,240
I'd eat the fuck out of Bert Kreischer, dude.

1358
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,640
- Gabriel Iglesias.

1359
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,400
- I mean, listen, I hate to say it,

1360
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,000
who the person I'd eat would probably be pretty young.

1361
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,000
When you say pretty young, like what age I guess?

1362
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Probably is pretty young.

1363
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But like two?

1364
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm just thinking about flavor and tenderness.

1365
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I just think about flavor.

1366
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I just think about flavor.

1367
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I think hungry.

1368
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Here's the thing.

1369
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I wouldn't eat, I would probably kill myself before eating Clint Eastwood.

1370
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,720
would yeah that you wouldn't want him he'd be nothing yeah Bruce Willis he's

1371
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,040
right out what if yeah what if humans are like lobsters though or it's like the

1372
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,440
older they are like the more meat I would not eat a trillion lobster we know that

1373
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,520
because we know people who were old yeah but we're grandparent I'm talking about

1374
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:38,360
like the meat we've all taken a bite out of grandma's sagging arm I definitely

1375
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,440
have my grandma used to flap her arms in front of me like when old people flap

1376
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,400
their arms I wanna throw up my nanny to do it in the car she's I wrap around

1377
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,880
usually don't really hate old people yeah my Nana would do that with her arms

1378
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,920
in the car she I honestly London London London London London my god arm go like

1379
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,560
I wish that all people tasted good to eat so I could I could have an excuse to

1380
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,320
kill and eat them that wouldn't be a good excuse that's not a good you know

1381
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,880
what I was thinking if I was a serial killer my method of finding a victim I

1382
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,560
would I would enter the house and kill people of people who put you know when

1383
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,480
people put posters or art in their window facing out.

1384
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,240
And it's like, you can't even see that inside your house.

1385
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,600
That's like they put a funny picture

1386
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,480
for people on the street to see.

1387
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,200
Do you know the kind of thing I'm talking about?

1388
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,880
I think if I was a crazy person and I wanted to kill,

1389
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,200
I would be walking down the street,

1390
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,520
and if I saw a picture of a funny cartoon

1391
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,680
facing out in someone's window,

1392
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,840
that would be the house I would break into and kill.

1393
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,240
- Like a funny sign that says,

1394
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,160
"In this house, we believe science is real,

1395
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,040
"black lives matter." - Yeah, one of those signs too.

1396
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,740
I think that's, that would be my thing. I would be the window art outward facing killer.

1397
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,140
That would be the catchy name they gave me.

1398
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,540
That is really funny when you see that sign that like, "In this house we believe blah blah blah."

1399
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,040
You see it in the window because you know that the person who put it out is like,

1400
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,040
"Well, if I put it out, somebody is going to steal it."

1401
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,740
[Laughter]

1402
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,340
That's a good point.

1403
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,340
"Better put this in my third floor window."

1404
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:04,140
"I'm gonna put it here so people know that's what I believe."

1405
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:07,140
but they can't know i want anyone to steal that she had a

1406
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,280
so it's gonna really pissed off about my son that says i believe water is

1407
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,040
important

1408
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,140
yes on fire called they're gonna take i know someone's gonna freakin steal that

1409
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,340
for me that is the funniest thing that those signs say what it says something

1410
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,580
about what it is like i believe water is life or so yeah

1411
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,180
it's like what what yeah it is like i believe like immigrants are beautiful i

1412
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,300
believe black

1413
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,000
my lives matter i believe science is awesome and i believe water is wet

1414
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,440
you know who it is and that's where and what it is you know who would be who

1415
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:35,960
would go

1416
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,200
crazy on that but inside is a little mother fuckers from captain underpants

1417
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:40,800
get nothing

1418
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,640
that rearrange shit we're not a good at that

1419
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,000
blackwater i believe it you know

1420
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,040
well they're there are a lot of other sciences black

1421
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,360
is that a lot of black well they would be a little rearrange it is just a side

1422
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,440
I mean I think they may be

1423
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,500
be able to turn upside down man I don't know how those damn signs were shut the

1424
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,080
fuck up

1425
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,400
What do I look like? A fucking home goods employee?

1426
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,880
Dude, they would be able to turn the McDonald's, they would be able to wreak havoc on the McDonald's

1427
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
logo. Oh my god.

1428
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,280
Turn it into a W or an E. Or a 3.

1429
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,360
My turds are $1. That's what I always wanted to make this one sign say in my hometown,

1430
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,500
but they never had a dollar sign. Yeah.

1431
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,200
My friend took one of those. We used to do that all the time. We used to

1432
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,520
do the... I did that, we did that to a church sign one

1433
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,520
time. It was very fun.

1434
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,080
I used to live next to this motel and we would change it, we would change it all the time.

1435
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,800
And we made it say, it said, "Yes pets, I miss you mom."

1436
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,440
And the first one we ever did was we were pretty shy, so we just changed a couple letters.

1437
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,520
We made it say, "Yes Mets, I miss you mop."

1438
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,520
And that made us laugh.

1439
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,160
But then we realized that that lady's mom died.

1440
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,520
Oh, that's kind of sad.

1441
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,640
And then we just pranked her.

1442
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,280
The one that we did, we only did one time and it was pretty damn edgy.

1443
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,440
We changed the church sign and we made it say Satan.

1444
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,040
Shit, we used to make the church say ass.

1445
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,600
But it was one of those things where it's like, okay, they left the, it was that type of sign

1446
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,760
And there's like a glass door that they always locked yeah, and was like one time

1447
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:04,860
We walked by and was open and it's like okay if this is unlocked and the letters for Satan are there you have to make you

1448
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,180
Can't there was a church school that had a sign that said something about class dance

1449
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,580
We made it we took every letter off except ass dance

1450
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:16,540
Yo, that was my friend took a photo of the one he did and send it to me

1451
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,900
I wasn't there for it, but he made it say shit missing from cunt

1452
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:26,700
That one's really tough. Okay. It takes forever to rearrange exactly I got a power, but something must have been missing

1453
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,080
Okay, so this is this is a website. I found

1454
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,420
Delish the daily delish and this was that this is a little shot

1455
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,220
This is the crown jewel delish God

1456
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,920
And this is this is a website where it has a bunch of question you google you google a question this website pops up

1457
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,100
It is a page with a bunch of related questions

1458
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,340
And it has answers that they've written for us to all these questions that we might have about how to cook a human

1459
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,220
Okay, so we'll just go through and I'll read some of these Q&A so this is like kind of an FAQ

1460
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,700
for for cooking human or cooking Patrick specifically. So first off, what is the

1461
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:00,580
tastiest part of a human? Don't call Patrick that. The brain and muscles are

1462
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:04,300
probably your best bet according to Yale certified nutritionist Dr. Jim

1463
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,140
Stapani. So the brain and muscles. Jim Stapani? Yeah, he knows what's up, the

1464
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,500
brain and muscles. So we'll get your brain, we'll get your muscles. I don't know why that name is making me laugh.

1465
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,980
Then we have, how does a human brain cook? And we have instructions. Whisk enough

1466
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,740
milk to cover the brains by three times their volume with salt just until you

1467
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,380
can taste it. The next day, drain and rinse the brains and pat, completely dry.

1468
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,580
We're gonna eat his brain. To cook, heat a pan with butter until lightly browned. Dredge the

1469
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,900
brains in flour, tap off the excess, and fry golden on each side. So this is how to

1470
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,740
make fried human brains. Yeah, that's the same way you make liver.

1471
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,860
Well, that's just how to make fried human brains. Okay. So that's useful.

1472
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:42,780
Yeah. Brain looks like a cauliflower though. I'm sure you could turn brain and you

1473
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,900
can make brain wings. That's true. Usually when foods look like each other,

1474
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,100
that's what you do with them.

1475
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:48,940
- Just one piece.

1476
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,260
- You should have said that.

1477
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,860
- You should have said nothing.

1478
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,100
(laughing)

1479
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,420
- Okay.

1480
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,060
Then we have, "How do I prepare for 40 Humans" book.

1481
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,900
How to cook for 40 Humans is a cookbook

1482
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,780
that the Regelians keep in their kitchen

1483
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,820
of their spaceship.

1484
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,260
The book is a guide for preparing meals

1485
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,460
for large groups of humans.

1486
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,940
Serac the preparer referred to it

1487
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,060
while preparing meals for the Simpson family

1488
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,460
when they were on board the ship.

1489
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,500
- What the hell kind of bullshit is this?

1490
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,180
Is this still this doctor?

1491
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,020
- Yeah.

1492
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:14,860
- Yeah, this is Stupani.

1493
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,700
- So this is Dr. Stupani is telling us

1494
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,940
about this book that was in the simpsons that's disgusting uh...

1495
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,920
and then we have uh...

1496
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,500
can you hear back at the top of the court in a recent study the desire to eat your

1497
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,000
baby up is totally normal and healthy

1498
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,060
really it went far beyond what i have a little baby toes i wanted to devour my

1499
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,420
children just eat them all up

1500
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,620
okay

1501
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,460
so that's a normal there's only a right to somebody else's baby with a ladder

1502
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,120
no just yet they're only they only really cover

1503
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,040
it's normal to want to devour your children and eat them all up ok on so

1504
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,080
So that's something this website has for us.

1505
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,360
Then we have, "Can you eat your own poop?"

1506
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,360
Yes.

1507
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,880
According to the Illinois Poison Center, eating poop is minimally toxic.

1508
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,200
Yeah, it's not that bad.

1509
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,240
Yeah, I like that that came up on the page for cannibalism though.

1510
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,240
That is a way of cannibalism.

1511
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,640
Somebody Googled, "How to cook human meat," and one of the questions is, "Can you eat

1512
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
your own poop?"

1513
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,640
It looks like meat.

1514
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,240
Then we have, "How do you cook a human cookbook?"

1515
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,800
How to Cook for 40 Humans, YouTube.

1516
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,920
God, it's got the Simpsons-obsessed mother-father.

1517
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,480
It's the same Simpsons thing, yeah.

1518
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,680
And then we have, "How long does it take to cook a human hand?

1519
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,900
To enhance the flavor, you should boil it for nearly 15 to 20 minutes until it becomes soft,

1520
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,900
and follow the recipe of a chicken curry to cook it.

1521
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,880
You can also add oregano for extra flavor.

1522
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:29,160
For side dish, you can add gingerbread, some orange juice, and sweet bread."

1523
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,160
So two types of bread.

1524
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:35,960
So if you're cooking a human hand, you want orange juice on the side and some breads.

1525
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
I'll have some.

1526
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,560
Do you think a human cooking human hand is like chicken feet?

1527
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,200
No, I think it's like a chicken hand.

1528
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Okay.

1529
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,880
No, I just like cuz you have to like boil. I don't know if you eat in chicken feet.

1530
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,040
Which Simpson would you eat? Yeah, is it good? Homer, duh. Yeah.

1531
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,560
Yeah, I just want to stress this is the only website on the

1532
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,800
internet you can find information on how to cook human flesh. Everything else is

1533
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,000
like, yeah, apparently there's a secret cookbook on how to cook human flesh but

1534
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,760
we can't show it to you. And then this one is like, if you're gonna eat a human

1535
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:18,480
hand. You should have orange juice with it. I would eat a criminal. Yeah. Yeah. If that

1536
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,440
was an option, I would probably eat one bite of somebody who maybe stole... I would eat

1537
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,080
a full guy. Somebody who taped Avatar in the theater or something. Yeah. I'd eat that guy.

1538
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,640
I actually, if it was in an Avatar situation, definitely. What do you mean an Avatar situation?

1539
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,320
Just any kind of guy who brings disrespect or disrepute to a showing of Avatar. Do you

1540
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,820
Do you think that the Navi tastes better than the humans?

1541
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,820
No.

1542
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,820
Does it not eat the human?

1543
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:42,820
Well, they're leaner.

1544
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,820
No, they don't.

1545
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,820
Not yet.

1546
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:45,820
I mean, we'll see what happens.

1547
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,820
The new movie's not out yet.

1548
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,820
True.

1549
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,820
Maybe out by the time this is out, I guess.

1550
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,820
Well, I'll report back when I see it.

1551
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:50,820
Let me know.

1552
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,820
I'll let you guys know.

1553
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:52,820
I need to see your report.

1554
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,820
How do you serve a human?

1555
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,820
The simple five-step process of serving humanity.

1556
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:55,820
Build a foundation.

1557
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:58,920
Chisel yourself into the person you want to be, piece by piece.

1558
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,920
Find your why.

1559
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,540
Find the reason you want to truly serve humanity.

1560
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,540
Act daily.

1561
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:04,140
Trust your instinct and share your vision.

1562
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,700
That doesn't help me eat nobody.

1563
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,300
- That's how you become your best person to eat a person.

1564
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,580
- Oh, you gotta be fully actualized

1565
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,620
before you eat human meat.

1566
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,120
- Here's how you serve a human.

1567
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:17,760
- Well no, you're doing kind of the thing you do

1568
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,800
after you serve someone.

1569
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,640
- Oh yeah.

1570
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,780
- You have to like--

1571
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,020
- Wait, hold on, let me, all right,

1572
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,720
imagine I just spun on my head.

1573
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,900
- That's good, yeah you did.

1574
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,740
- He served that.

1575
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:29,660
- Yeah.

1576
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,240
- This is, yeah, 'cause eating human meat

1577
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,100
is like the top of the hierarchy of needs.

1578
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,220
You have to be full, self-actualization is under--

1579
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,180
- 'Cause it's kinda like, you're bored.

1580
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,020
- Yeah. - You're like,

1581
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,100
"Ah, I guess I'll fuckin' eat somebody."

1582
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,700
- Yeah, and then if this is the next one,

1583
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,740
I think the next one's the last one.

1584
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,540
This one made me laugh out loud when I saw this.

1585
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,540
I was scrolling through all these questions

1586
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,340
about human meat on this page,

1587
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:49,380
and this is the last question on the page.

1588
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:50,580
"What is the yeet baby?"

1589
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:51,900
(both laughing)

1590
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,700
"Chris Rooney and his two-year-old niece Marley,

1591
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,000
"otherwise known as the Yeet Baby,

1592
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,100
"have become internet stars after he documented

1593
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,340
"her progress of life skills on their TikTok account,

1594
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,740
"gaining over three million followers."

1595
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,580
- Holy crap. - That's the Yeet Baby.

1596
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,420
- I didn't even know that.

1597
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,060
I didn't know that Yeet Baby existed.

1598
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,060
Me neither.

1599
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:08,060
It's good to know though.

1600
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,060
Yeah.

1601
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,060
All right, well we're stuck in here.

1602
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,100
I don't think we're ever getting out.

1603
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,540
Yeah, probably not.

1604
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,700
But you can get out.

1605
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,780
Oh shit, we forgot to do one thing.

1606
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,340
Oh yeah, Santa Tracker.

1607
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,820
We'll close on this one this time.

1608
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,180
Yeah, we'll close out.

Yeah, you can get out your wallet and go to Patreon.

1611
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,180
If we get enough money, we might be able to buy a hair dryer for me.

1612
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:32,700
To melt our way out of here.

1613
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,700
