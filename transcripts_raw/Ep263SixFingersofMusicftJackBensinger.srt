00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,160

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,120
Welcome back to P-A-L fuckin' radio, man.

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,400
W-P-A-L

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,000
W-J-A-C-K-B-E-N-S-I-N-G-E-R

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,520
*gunshot*

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,360
Jack motherfuckin' Bensinger, what the fuck is up, man?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,760
real quick, I don't go by that name.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
What do you go by?

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Okay.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,920
Well, because my whole thing is you guys said, "Yo, you want to come on to do the Five Fingers,

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
right?"

15
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Am I spoiling anything?

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
No, that's fine.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
It's in the name of the episode.

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,320
So I said this, "This is a perfect opportunity because I quit acting."

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
No.

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,920
I quit comedy and now I'm just straight up a rapper.

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,400
Jack Ben rapper.

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
No.

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I don't.

25
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
So?

26
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
You don't?

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
I don't have a name now.

28
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
You have no name.

29
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,960
Names are incredibly corny.

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Wait, I have a fucking name. Don't say that shit.

31
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,960
You're talking to three named men.

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,960
You guys started out the show like Porky Pig.

33
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Like, come on, man.

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,960
You're bringing some negative energy right away.

35
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,960
I apologize.

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,960
You guys are more like Sam the Salamander in that regard.

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
Who is Sam the Salamander?

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,960
He's a new, more handsome representative of the animated scene.

39
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,480
right yeah. Oh, I don't know what it describe him in detail who Sam the

40
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,000
salamander he's like a one dimensional James Bond with liquid skin. You know

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm so

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,920
yeah, this is sounding a lot like gex to me, but gex is two or three

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,480
dimensional. Yeah, I don't know if I know who gex is. He's a gecko James

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,400
Bond man from our old video game from the three do right or the p.s. War he

45
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,140
that he's told celebrities yeah and Bubsy would chill. This is how I feel

46
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,600
he used to run with Bubsy back and he walks around with a remote control and

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,300
control any TV. Oh he's like Adam Sandler. Yeah, he's clicking, but he

48
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,840
doesn't have any pants. Adam Sandler click clacking. Can you here's why you

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,640
shouldn't quit comedy man. Imagine ten years from now you've been doing comedy

50
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,400
acting for years at this point, ten of them, plus however many you've done so

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
far and then you get invited to the Adam Sandler basketball games.

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,720
you in Chalamet? It's just not how I want to get there. Yeah. Like yeah, I want to

53
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,720
get there no matter what my path is, but I just feel like I'd be embarrassed if I

54
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,920
showed up. Like I want to show up because I've been like being more real, being a

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:45,720
musician. Right. Like if I show up as a goofy ass. I would want to show up and like maybe that I was grinding really hard and I sold a lot of stuff at my store. Yeah. Do you think they invite? Do you think it's just the upper echelon of every...

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,000
They invite bodega guys. You have the top store in the area, they're gonna invite you.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,320
That's true. I mean, they do play random pick up with people as well.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,620
I mean, he gets in the fights too. Adam... what's his name? Sandler. Adam Sandler gets in the

59
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,080
craziest viral fighting. It's almost like...

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,760
it's not even about the basketball to him. Remember when he threw that shovel at that girl?

61
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,040
Yeah. In 2014. He threw a shovel at a girl? Remember that video? No. Adam Sandler throwing a shovel at a girl?

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,760
Remember when he wore a troll face t-shirt?

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,240
Mm-hmm. Remember when Chuck and Larry got all... Remember when you Chuck and Larry?

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah. Engaged. Chuck and Larry had a big grip on my school life. Yeah? Yeah. Homework?

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,680
Well, it was more like that's... We would call anybody, including myself and my

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
friends, if we... If somebody was kind of gay, we'd say, "You are Chuck and Larry."

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
You're both of them. Yeah. "Well, you're Chuck and this guy's Larry." Right. But they

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,640
didn't... Must have not seen the movie and realized that it was for... They were doing

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,640
it for some kind of legal. You guys aren't so much like the characters themselves

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,800
who are doing it for legal reasons, but the relationship between you guys is

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,480
similar. You are more like the perception of Chuck and Larry by me,

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
by me, because I didn't watch it. By Nicholas Turturro, who's in that movie.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,120
'Cause I know the poster of the movie, that's about all I know.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,640
Well, it's Chuck, by the way, Adam Sandler and

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,400
Chuck. Imagine those two. I mean, that's a hot and steamy... The show,

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,100
Chuck or well no or Larry which one is where Kevin James yeah Kevin James yeah

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,480
that's his name those two I don't think there's a worse couple to watch have sex

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,600
maybe in his that's a you know what that's a big joke in the movie really

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,640
yeah if you remember the movie like I didn't I didn't watch that's how I found

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,240
out Freddie Mercury was a gay guy when they play the you're my best friend song

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
at the end of the movie my dad and was like you know why they're playing this

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,240
right? Were you disappointed? I wasn't disappointed. It was just like my dad was saying it was

83
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,600
like it was trivia for the movie. Right. You thought it was just, no this is the end of

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,640
the movie song. This plays at the end of every movie. But no, it's because he's a gay man.

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:04,360
You know what I think? Every single movie should end with this song. The maroon 5 one

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,280
or the who sings that that's Adam Levine. No, I'm thinking is that Adam Levine? The original

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,520
by Beethoven. Oh, that's not by Beethoven. Most of that stuff is by Beethoven. Can you

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,680
imagine if that's a dog you're talking about Beethoven? No. No. Imagine what? Can you imagine

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:33,400
if a natural animal did noise like that? Because birds go like this. I've noticed all sorts

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,840
all sorts of different shit. So what I'm saying is imagine if a bird went

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,400
there's certain ones. I do

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,800
now I stopped acting.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,520
That's true. That's true. Okay, that's music. Yeah, all right. Thank you. Then

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,480
I accept it. I accept that. Yeah, but you're saying what if a bird sang a

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,360
song? I'm just curious, not a parrot, but I'm just right like a bird. That's not

96
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,140
mimicking somebody's thing. Originally is singing the song. I was going to say

97
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,940
have you seen this this starling? This is what news is a bird. What's in the

98
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,280
news about a starling? There's a bird that made a complete mimicked R2D2's

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,500
voice and human voices, but the most impressive thing was that he got bored

100
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,180
of mimicking human voices and then he just pulled out the R2D2 sound and it

101
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,020
was pitch perfect. No, no, no, no, no, no, it's it's complete R2D2. It's like

102
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,800
it's all the beeps and everything. Do you know the bird that does the cell phone

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,180
noises at the hardware store? Yeah. Droid.

104
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,880
It goes... I can't think of a cell phone noise, but it goes...

105
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,860
It goes...

106
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,300
I can't fucking do it. What cell phone do you have? The one where it kind

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,640
of pops and goes ding. Oh, the notification... Oh, okay. It pops? It

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,300
has cheeks? It pops, yeah. Yeah. That's scary about a bird. Well, that's...

109
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,140
I'm talking about the noise, not the bird. Oh, okay. But a bird could

110
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,480
make that noise. They can click and certain birds can mimic human voice. So

111
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,060
perfect. Did you guys ever in the jungle do it's like they're parading to scare

112
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,220
people that would freak me out. I don't know why they do it. Did you guys ever

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,420
know anybody who had owned a parrot? No, not yet. I had a pair of eat my eat some

114
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,100
of my hair when I was a kid. That's what I happened to it. Yeah, I said some nice

115
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,220
and also as a kid, but nice try you to guys. Well,

116
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,860
there was a pair of try you to go. You're already getting into the the wrapping a

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,000
little bit. I was installing a glass shower door and a lady said, you want to

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,520
hold my parent and take a photo with it? And I said, for sure, and then I had a

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,640
photo taken of me and the parrot ate a piece of my hair. Remember we said that

120
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,880
parrot on the bus on the 73 bus in Boston and he was a reoccurring guy or I

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,720
only saw him like two times, but I don't know why would you why would you get a

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,200
whole extra ticket for the parrot and said, just let it fly? Yeah, he had the

123
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,620
the parrot on his on his arm. It had no it was not attached to him in any way.

124
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,520
I just was sitting on his arm and then I was like, can I take a picture of the

125
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,520
parrot? And he was like, it's a good thing you asked, because when people

126
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,580
take pictures without asking, the parrot attacks them.

127
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:11,120
That's a bad quality. No, it's not a good thing to have in an animal to be

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,480
picture of. I saw a picture or a video today, a bunch of videos actually of a

129
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,020
lady who got a cat off the road. Some Russian lady raised the cat. The cat

130
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

131
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

132
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Don't tell me.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Panther!

134
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
It was a panther.

135
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
And how's it behaving?

136
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Like a dog, except it can jump 20 feet in the air.

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Yeah.

138
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Well, some dogs can do that, that's for sure.

139
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,520
Like a Great Dane run up a tree.

140
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
A Great Dane can't do that shit.

141
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
A Great Dane can jump 20 feet in the air.

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
A Great Dane's dog die instantly.

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Yeah?

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
How?

145
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Great Danes last like three years.

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Really?

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Yeah, they do not have a long lifespan.

148
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
In bed.

149
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Put that on any sentence.

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
In bed.

151
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
In bed.

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
In bed.

153
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
In bed.

154
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,520
sentence. At the end of any sentence, it'll take a change to me.

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,520
In bed? Damn. That's actually good as well.

156
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Hey man, everything's in bed if you think of the dirt as a fucking mattress.

157
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Think of the world as a floor.

158
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,520
It's the bed for human death.

159
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Human seed theory.

160
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
You're bringing that back?

161
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Well, it's either going to be me or the government.

162
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Didn't you talk about this last time you were here?

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Maybe.

164
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
Nah, probably not.

165
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
No, so say it again.

166
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,520
No, it's just the idea that people are seeds, so just be careful if you're walking around

167
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,040
around a graveyard don't be don't be surprised. Don't stand in grass for too long. Don't be

168
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,240
surprised like for a tree. If a tree grows out of the ground and then instead of leaves

169
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,960
it's a dude. There's a bunch of heads. Oh because they're planted in the graveyard.

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,640
That's a seed. Like an executor. Sure. Like the Pokemon. That always you know how the

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
person who's in charge of a will is called the executor. The person in charge of a will

172
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,200
is named a Jada. Wait oh my god. No they've actually been separated for some time. That's

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
tell me why she's still in charge of him. Then tell me why she's still so fine.

174
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,360
You have a like a

175
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,000
business all the time that has to hurt so bad when she said that she was in

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,480
love with two pucks. Imagine your girlfriend, imagine your girlfriend told

177
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,760
you today that like juice world was her soul mate man, but that was know him. I

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,320
don't know. He probably didn't know world. Yeah, juice world world of juice.

179
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,040
I'd go to a store like that. There's a place near me called snack world and

180
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
then you walk in, they just sell weed. They don't have so many different

181
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,600
worlds in this city. Every store here is a world. There's so many types of worlds.

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Basically Mario game vibes.

183
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Yeah. Or outer space.

184
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
Well, that's one way to look at it.

185
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,080
Yeah, I guess there's an outer space Mario game though too. So Mario kind of covers outer

186
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
space.

187
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
He kind of covers everything.

188
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Yeah.

189
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
He did cooking.

190
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
He did it all really.

191
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,120
Is that actually, that's a foray he hasn't jumped into.

192
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Cooking.

193
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Mario cooking.

194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Mario cooking. I've never seen a Mario game where he cooks a mushroom.

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,120
Yeah, but a full game. There's a game where he does.

196
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,240
He's always cooking up those mushrooms. He's always cooking on the goombas.

197
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,480
How do you think he's going to get a one up from a raw mushroom?

198
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Is there a Mario restaurant game?

199
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Mario cooking?

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Chef Mario lasagna.

201
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,920
Okay, that looks real to me.

202
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I love this game.

203
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,120
See, you get to scroll around and click.

204
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
This is Mario cooking.

205
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
What is this?

206
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,360
You click on the squares, see they get bigger?

207
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,960
That's five points.

208
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
That YouTube video, cooking with Chef Mario.

209
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,680
Cooking tour adds Chef Mario.

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
Cooking with Chef Mario.

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,080
So it looks like to me here that there's a full Mario cooking game based on all these

212
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,320
pictures. Where else would they have come from?

213
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
Well I want to play this game.

214
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm alright.

215
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
I want to play it right now.

216
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,400
I guess I can't argue with you wanting to play that game.

217
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm so beefed out guys. Do not ever eat beef.

218
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Beefless.

219
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Beef bragging.

220
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Beefless.

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I know.

222
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
I can't stop bragging.

223
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
He's bragging right now so bad.

224
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
I went to a beef restaurant last night and I beefed.

225
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,800
Hit the mute button on him.

226
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
An all beef restaurant?

227
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,680
All beef dude.

228
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,440
in the drinks, even the drinks were pieces. It wasn't even just beef.

229
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,000
They molded beef to fit the cup moldy beef and you had to put it

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,240
this is funny. This shit is not cool. No, we don't want to hear about your

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
beef escapade. Okay, go ahead. Talk about your beef escapades, man.

232
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,960
My beef was so delicious and well done. I got all of the beef. Well done.

233
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,820
Wagyu. You, you, you, you got it well done. You didn't make you didn't cook

234
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,980
it. No, the guy came and he said it's medium rare. Okay, and I said we'll

235
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,780
take it well done and then he just kind of left it for a little bit. You got

236
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,060
Wagyu cooked well done and then he wiped up all the all the grease with a

237
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,640
napkin and I ate the napkin. Even at a restaurant he's making people wipe the

238
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,200
table for him. No, I didn't spill anything. Is that a theme that you guys

239
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,220
with? He spills and doesn't give a fuck. I'm not anti white. I'm not anti white.

240
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,220
Don't go around saying I'm anti white. You can go around saying whatever I want.

241
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,220
I imagine his butt's like a cast iron. I know. Let me give an outsider's

242
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,220
perspective. I have no skin in the game here, right? I can give a hell. You have no skin.

243
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,220
I'm almost, well I have skin, I have a lot of skin. Oh yeah, sorry. I'm more

244
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,220
normal. I realistically have more skin than any of you guys. That's probably true.

245
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Now, have you ever thought that maybe you don't mind liquid being around

246
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,420
because of your preferring Aquarius environments, etcetera. I grew up about

247
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,660
four miles from a beach. Water was a big part of my life growing up. Newport News.

248
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,380
There was always water in the house, so spilling it was not a big deal. I, my,

249
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,540
here's my rule on water, dude. If I spill water on the ground. We're not talking

250
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,780
about water. No, no, no, no, no. It's not water and it's not the ground. It's

251
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,700
drinks on the table. We're talking about spilling coffee and soda on the table.

252
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,500
Coffee is mostly water. Hey, man. You see this right here? I thought that that

253
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,000
that was a beautiful that looked like a country. A table is a ground.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
I won't, that'd be too much to move it, but we could get the spill cam. Okay,

255
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,680
there we go. See the stain?

256
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,620
I'm about to, you're about to be a stain. This is a brand new nice table.

257
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,980
You're about to be a stain on God's beautiful creation if you keep talking

258
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,060
like this. Save it for the...

259
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,260
Switch the angles, y'all.

260
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,340
Wait, that was insane. Wow, Cameron's new angle.

261
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,180
Cameron got two cameras. Cameron Diaz.

262
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,340
Cameron Diaz, Charlie Zengel.

263
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,340
Cameron Diaz, man.

264
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
Did you know that she used to be

265
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
Legged.

266
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Legged?

267
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
What did you say?

268
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
Stop hiding behind your microphone, bro.

269
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,340
Yeah, why don't you stop hiding?

270
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,340
You're the biggest one and you're looking so small and bashful, man.

271
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Get up, get up.

272
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm not hiding, bro.

273
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,340
You're hiding right now.

274
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,340
I was just watching an interview with Cameron Diaz.

275
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I just left.

276
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,700
I was just watching somebody give an interview who mentioned that Cameron

277
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,860
Diaz was previously there.

278
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,740
Whoa

279
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,340
wow,

280
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,860
where was that on the Internet, man,

281
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,340
honestly, it was on a late night talk show with somebody that I had never seen

282
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,900
in my life. Who was it? I don't know him. Oh, you don't even know you already.

283
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,020
You watch the whole you went on YouTube and you searched interview without

284
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,460
ever to do. She was right there.

285
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,380
A second ago, they had mentioned that she was just there and they say

286
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:03,060
I remember some Nickelodeon like man on the street bit that they did that was

287
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,380
like in the ad space between shows where they brought out celebrity farts in a

288
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,780
jar and one of them was Cameron Diaz and one of the guys said he liked it.

289
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,020
Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Was she ever in another movie besides Shrek and the

290
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,460
Mask? Night and Day. Charlie's Fucking Angels. What the fuck? Yeah, Charlie's

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,060
trip she is in a cut yeah she was in bad teacher which I thought was going to be

293
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,380
full on porn and it was hardly hardly she's an alcoholic that's the only thing

294
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,660
that's bad about her is her I don't have a disability student but she doesn't do

295
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,020
that no she didn't even suck a student she sucks her teacher friend has anyone

town, maybe because they're not all family. Necessarily bad Santa. Now we

299
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,540
have bad baby man, that bunny. What the hell fell off about? I forgot about bad

300
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,260
baby yeah, and that's what she's up to right now. I mean she's right. I believe

301
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,460
so that's kind of different, because she has different letters in her name.

302
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,420
Yeah, she's a hobby, same way, yeah, this is a hobby, a hot baby, bad,

303
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,660
but

304
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,700
he had baby yeah, so she doesn't really count, but that bunny would count yeah

305
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,420
yeah, and so would the worst bunny of all time bugs. He's always fucking up

306
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Bud's life. The best bunny. I didn't mean to hit you. I meant to grab your head fast.

307
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,820
Well then who's the bad bunny? Bad bunny? The one from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

308
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,040
Oh yeah. You want to talk about a bad bunny? Beastly bunny. I don't want to go see this

309
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,560
guy in concert. He's going to chew my neck off. He's going to eat my carrot. Yeah. But

310
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,220
he's only a flesh wound. I got all these carrots with me. He's going to steal my carrots. No

311
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,440
way. No way. Not letting him near my little bag of carrots. I was holding a carrot one

312
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,940
one time and fell through a sliding glass door. Yeah, fell through. Yeah. Did you

313
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,300
break it? Wait, glass? Yeah. Did you trip? Yeah, I tripped. On your carrot? On a

314
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
tile, no, and I dropped the carrot,

315
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,500
went and jumped for it.

316
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,060
You jumped after a carrot through a glass door? Did the carrot go through the glass

317
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,500
door and then you jumped after it?

318
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,860
The carrot wasn't strong enough. Okay. But you were. I was. How, baby carrot or?

319
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,500
You didn't know you were on, right? Baby carrot. Full on. Smooth. You didn't know

320
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,920
on how much you wanted the carrot. I didn't know how close the door was and

321
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,920
how I just well I don't know. I wasn't thinking at the time. If you had been

322
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,320
thinking, you probably would have never done something like that. Imagine if you were thinking. If I was

323
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,920
thinking, I might have been, I don't know what I would have been thinking about.

324
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,320
Yeah, oh no. Oh my fucking carrot, man. Oh shit. Fuck me, I think I dropped my fucking carrot.

325
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,720
I think you're just eating plain carrots. Sure. I would be a handful of carrots.

326
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,420
Hopefully, you'd be thinking something like, nah, that carrot ain't worth it. Yeah. Leave the carrot on the

327
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,220
ground. I just throw it out. Right. If I could have slowed down time. Yeah, I'm not

328
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,020
going to eat it anyway. It's been on the ground. Yeah. Would you eat it? Did you

329
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,300
eat it off the ground? No, I was well. Ten second rule. Were you badly injured?

330
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,660
No, it's actually 30 seconds. You can leave food on the ground for 30 seconds

331
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,100
and it doesn't collect any germs. I thought they did this on the ground. This

332
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,660
must depend on the... Yeah. If you work in a germ factory and you drop the shit,

333
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,860
you'll have to... But if you drop it in outer space, you can practically eat it

334
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,900
forever. Pretty much actually any factory. I feel like it's five second rule.

335
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,020
but okay, so you're pretty much every single factory, whatever's on the floor

336
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,080
of a factory, I would not want to eat. Imagine how sad you're saying three

337
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,480
seconds on the floor of the asbestos factory. Yes, eating it

338
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,420
three seconds. If it's a second to I'll eat that three seconds is too money,

339
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,380
but two is okay. Two will three is when three, you know,

340
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,080
more factor. Now, hold on a second. Let me pretend I'm a germ, right?

341
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,360
You be a piece of food and go ahead and like I'll be time lie on

342
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,400
at me. Ready? Grab! You see what I'm saying? I'm on you now.

343
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,720
Yeah.

344
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,960
Well, but that's what I was wondering is...

345
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,320
It's instant.

346
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Imagine you're a germ.

347
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,480
It's like Velcro.

348
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,960
Is it because the...

349
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
No, it's 'cause the germ has to live.

350
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,000
Like get an apartment?

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,640
It has to create... So if I'm... Yeah, so I'm like a building now, right?

352
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,240
So I can't just go like that and now I'm not John.

353
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,480
No, no, no, 'cause you're not gonna... Like, you can visit Oklahoma City. You don't live

354
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:02,880
there.

355
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
Oh, I can't.

356
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,840
Oh, wow.

357
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,640
Well, it doesn't matter if you... It doesn't matter whether you live there. If you're visiting

358
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,400
Oklahoma City and you kill somebody...

359
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
Well, you're not a resident.

360
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,400
you're still a resident. It doesn't matter if you live there, killed him

361
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,940
and where's the murder coming into this? We're talking about germs theory man

362
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,720
well,

363
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,160
kill people, they cause sickness that causes death.

364
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,440
Have you not heard about this yet? Osmosis Jones, how long was that egg on

365
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,120
the floor? The

366
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,080
five sec or

367
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,960
longer than five seconds. What

368
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
and how hot was a hard boiled cold egg and it was in a chimpanzee exhibit. It

369
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
was in the chimpanzees hands and he put

370
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,360
of knowledge. That's shocking from all three. You never see you all are

371
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,600
speaking about this egg. Like it was like that's the number one part of the

372
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,480
movie that everybody everybody remembers the

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,320
okay. What do you remember? The thing is surfing. He's grabbing

374
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,640
surfs up. No, I'm thinking of a dude on a plate lit.

375
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,320
It had to be him. Who else could that have been? Miss? She can't serve. She

376
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,920
can serve can do anything. I've seen her four plates. Yeah, right. Four plates of

377
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,460
barbecue ribs that would still be pretty. That would be a lot. I would be very

378
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,000
much more impressive in terms of balance, maybe without them falling off.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeah, that's if she bench press for plates and let me try another one for

380
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,540
paper plates of air sauce.

381
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,680
Air would be very light. I'm trying to dis her.

382
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:32,320
Great, all right, all right, weird, Miss Frizzle and she got weird orange hair.

383
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,440
yeah, I would like to romance her. Oh, if what she's a kid,

384
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,280
she's a

385
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,260
tall is she well really, but why is she going to say I just like that? Who's

386
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,800
she trying to impress the kids? The she wants the kids to think that she

387
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,000
dresses cool, the field trip people is that building in a town or is it

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,160
floating in the sky?

389
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,620
why when I think about the school of the Magic School Bus Academy, I don't know

390
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,380
what it's called. It's the

391
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,940
Magic School. They named it after the bus.

392
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:13,120
Why do I think why? Why, when I pictured the outside of that school, do I

393
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,200
picture it floating in a floating city?

394
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,680
Probably because of the blue around it,

395
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
the sky,

396
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,040
yeah, maybe you're thinking of the sky being above it. I'm not I'm thinking

397
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,640
no, I'm truth. You're thinking of the blue that surrounds it. It's not

398
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,280
from the in my head. It's surrounded by black. You think it's in space.

399
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,880
Yes, you think it's in a boy. It's not space. Maybe you want to know where

400
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,400
we're going to the time in the episode. I know what it is. I know what it is

401
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,600
here. It's the theme song where they pull the school away and then it goes

402
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,040
into the bus or and then they go on the little thing. What goes into the

403
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,360
well, it is. I wouldn't sign that permission slip man straight up. No,

404
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,680
if my kid came to me, hey, I got to shrink down and jump into a rat's eye.

405
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,920
If I was the kid, I would be, I'd be forging the signature every day. Oh,

406
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,200
yeah, I'd be like, there's no,

407
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,800
Miss Frizzle is definitely going through a ton of just crayon block letter

408
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,760
signatures tell you right now. If I was one of the kids on the magic school bus

409
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,640
and she said, all right, everybody stand next to the gun. I'm going to shoot you

410
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,440
all. You're going to get small. Here's me. Clear move to the right. You it's

411
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
everybody gets all small and I go fucking eat everybody's turkey sandwiches.

412
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,360
You're kidding. You would wait for them to leave and then eat the lunch. But

413
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,120
little do you know, they went to a a medieval medieval banquet. But how can

414
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,080
one be that? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. They don't have those that small.

415
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,160
That's the thing is they go somewhere small. They're going back. They can go

416
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,920
shrinking. Can they go back in time or can they just go small? I think they can

417
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,520
just go small. I think they can go wherever they want to do anything they

418
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,320
want with magic.

419
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,040
The school bus. That's a great point. Did they ever go bigger? I think they've

420
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,680
done literally everything you could imagine to do. They've never been so big.

421
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,840
They've never, they didn't give this podcast. Yeah, they never went here.

422
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,280
They've been on the podcast. No, they had to delete it. Carlos, yeah. About

423
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,840
being small. Carlos and then the redhead one. I can't stop wiping my mustache on

424
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,120
I do the same thing. I do that pretty much every episode.

425
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Me too.

426
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
We both, all three of us here,

427
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
same type of mustache.

428
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Don't say that. Joy Tactics.

429
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Make him talk in a funny way.

430
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Oh, one second.

431
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
And then he can say it.

432
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
You can only plug your show if we give you a filter.

433
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Yeah.

434
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Joy...

435
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Tactics!

436
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Yeah!

437
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,120
That was really good.

438
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,760
Pokemon, I got to stop talking about Pokemon man. No, it's a problem.

439
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,600
What's wrong with Pokemon?

440
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,040
If you're able to do it without it interfering with your life, then it's

441
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,280
fine. Do what? Speak about Pokemon, but it comes up so frequently for me

442
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,960
that... It's taking over. Yeah. The problem with Pokemon... It's because

443
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
they have a million types and all these different types you could apply

444
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,120
to almost anything. Grass, water birds. Exactly. Oil. Flying. Oil. And basically

445
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,640
anything you see in the world, it makes you think that's fire, that's grass.

446
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
I never seen an oil Pokemon. You never seen an oilmon? No. You know what, you're not watching

447
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,200
the right show. No I'm not. Wait, which show are you? What am I watching? Are you watching

448
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Pokemon or are you playing Pokemon? I'm just talking about it. Oh. That might be the craziest

449
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,280
option yet. I haven't played a video game in four months. On purpose? I played Halo

450
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,800
two days ago. Oh, so a lie. But that was only one round, but other than that. One round?

451
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,760
one round one round one round in it. I got to do a one. Oh, congratulations,

452
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,300
thanks y'all. Grants everybody. Wow! Did you get everything on your

453
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,200
checklist? The address one, two, three, suck it Academy

454
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,540
Matrix School,

455
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:39,260
called Sucket Academy

456
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:47,800
Sucket Academy. There's a school in the first floor and you're just between two

457
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,440
classrooms. Yeah, lockers in the house. Yeah,

458
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,480
you're careful with that because I'm sorry to unplug. Is there any you don't

459
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
to be careful with it's fine. If I put a can on it, no, that's not interesting,

460
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,880
but I can on it. Wait, that actually looked cool, though. Okay, whoa, whoa,

461
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,520
yo, wake up, do it.

462
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,280
Dude, wake up, wake up. You just fucking got hit by something. I can tell you

463
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
that. No, this is a Pepsi.

464
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,280
Wake up, wake up, dude. What the fuck? You just walked in front of something

465
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,320
I fucked you up. You good. I knew the kiss was coming me to what the fuck I could

466
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,700
feel the kiss coming. You are smarter than me.

467
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,460
All right, sorry about that. No, it's okay. You wake up in a universe and

468
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,840
you're a bottle or a can whatever you know which kind of I would want to be

469
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,280
one of these ones. Oh yeah, bottle. It's got curves. Yeah, I have to bow. I

470
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,760
would want to be a bottle. I'd be a jug. I probably be a gallon ground or

471
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,240
multiple gallon jug of vinegar

472
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,880
cleaning vinegar. First thing I could think of that

473
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:56,300
maybe water. No, I'm thinking of a big jug that's filled with vinegar. What's

474
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,400
the biggest jug you can imagine? One of those big ones, brown jug that can be a

475
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,700
bat in the cannon bottle universe. Fuck no. Well, you can't be can't move your

476
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,100
that's bolted into the ground. Anyway, could be a distillery, distillery,

477
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,580
distillery, distillery building at that point. That's a multiple person. Well,

478
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,320
there's yeah, I guess it's full of that's I guess I could be like a silo

479
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,120
silo is a can a silo is a type of can all right. Let's rain it back in so

480
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,520
we're today. We're on this. All right, all right.

481
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,920
Well,

482
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,120
well, we just

483
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,620
what we just talking about silos versus can with you. What kind of bottle would

484
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,120
you be in your bottle universe that you invented? Oh,

485
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,820
or can

486
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,720
Yeah, I don't know. I'd be Mrs. Buttersworth, actually.

487
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,480
Okay.

488
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Yeah, I guess you could, you may be another good one to be that I wouldn't

489
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,400
want to be. Maybe someone else could choose this would be the honey bear.

490
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,120
Honey bear is really good. Oh, that's a good one. Honey bear would be a really

491
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,680
good one, but I don't really want to be it. A lot of people would fuck with

492
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,040
you. A lot of people would like being it, but me, I'm built different. I would

493
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,960
just probably be something giant, like a... Why is it not a bee, man? A bee?

494
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,000
A bee. I think I've seen honey bees

495
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,900
in a jar style like honey.

496
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,260
Bears like everything bears eat watermelons. They ever seen those videos

497
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,640
of bears, the bear eating the whole picnic table. Do you know that I saw

498
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,260
that one, but the bear with the tapeworm at its butt? Yeah, that's fake.

499
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,800
That's fake. Yeah, tapeworms break off really easily. Oh, then what was in

500
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,740
that bears? But I was always something more disgusting than a tapeworm

501
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,640
karate belt bear that had like three strings. Oh my God. No way. You know

502
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,100
what it was. It was a parachute er's bag. Oh, that's I just got it. What

503
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,340
would you do if you were a bear? You jumped out of a plane and you were

504
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,660
skydiving. You pulled your parachute and you look up and who's parachuting down

505
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,020
after he's a bear. I would go back up yeah yeah, but the bag back in the or

506
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,220
the shoot back in the bag in the box yeah, I would I would pull my reverse

507
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,900
falling and I put on my jet pack, put the whole thing in front of you. I

508
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,240
thought about getting into wing suiting yeah. Should I do that shit? You could

509
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,320
it's more dangerous than other things. It's the problem. Yeah, it depends on

510
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,180
what the other thing is, I guess. Listen, if you love something enough to where

511
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,480
it's not worth living without it, then do it, then you have to do, you have

512
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,860
no choice. You also have to live, you have to move to a place where they

513
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,380
have rocks that have circles and arches and loops, the loops, 'cause that's

514
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,300
always what they do when they win. And also gold rings.

515
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,460
They go through like amusement park rocks. Yeah. You have to live in Utah

516
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,580
or something. Those gold rings, man.

517
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,140
What was that? He touched my leg. He jiggled. He touched my leg. I always have keys upon

518
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:50,140
me. Oh, okay. I didn't know what it was. That's okay, man. You have a bunch of keys? You're

519
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:56,380
a carabiner key guy? I want to become a lanyard key guy and walk around and flip it. I have

520
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,380
a lanyard somewhere around here I could give you. It says Final Fantasy Online on it. Oh,

521
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:06,380
guys, my dad got a Jeep. What kind of Jeep? Jeep, the truck. Patriot? Gladiator or some

522
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Gladio? Your dad got that one?

523
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
It's fucking crazy.

524
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
It looks so funny.

525
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,380
He's really interested in the Jeep.

526
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Was he doing the wave now?

527
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
He was telling me

528
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,380
the Jeep is so amazing.

529
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
I wave at everybody that has the same car.

530
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,380
We put ducks on each other's cars.

531
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,380
You put ducks on each other's cars?

532
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
Apparently Jeep owners

533
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,380
put little

534
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
rubber duckies

535
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
and if you like a Jeep you put a ducky on it

536
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,980
it and then they collect all the duckies. That's why my mom had them on her on her dashboard.

537
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,580
It's like liking on Facebook. It's a car version of liking pretty much. Yeah. The thing about

538
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,420
a Jeep though is that it has no thing inside of it. Like there's no like if you if you

539
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:54,580
run a bumpy road of it, if you're on a bumpy road, it is the most jostling experience,

540
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,940
but you can take all the parts out. You can go on. I was driving a Jeep one time in the

541
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,860
middle of the pandemic across a couple state lines and all of a sudden my tire went flat,

542
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,500
but it has the tire in the back. I didn't know how to do that. So I drove into a rental car

543
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:14,380
place and they sorted me out. What kind of Jeep? Wrangler? This was a Wrangler, but I

544
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,580
didn't love the handling on it. No, no, no, no, no. You know, it's a little bit of, I

545
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:25,820
don't know what you'd call it, soft, like a soft cheese. Like a brie. It's like a brie

546
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:33,420
handling system. It could be even named after that. Are Jeeps from Germany? No. Jeeps are

547
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:40,420
a Chrysler car. America. Is that true? I think so. I think the Jeep is Chrysler.

548
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Where did Jeep come from? Jeep is its own brand, but I think it was a Chrysler. Uh oh, video game.

549
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Where are Jeeps from? Jeeps are largely made in America. Yeah, yeah. Northgate, Dodge.

550
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,420
They're made larger in America. Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep. Makes sense. They have small cars in other countries.

551
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,420
Is that what Jeep, the word Jeep means? I mean this has all changed so much after NAFTA and what Bill Clinton did.

552
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,720
Bill Clinton did exactly and now it's like what are we going to you know what

553
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,220
does jeep stand for what does jeep stand for?

554
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:10,560
Sturdy motor vehicle with four wheel drive, especially one used by the

555
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,660
area yeah jeep has been with Chrysler since eighty seven. Well, what does

556
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,500
jean the mouth movement helps a lot yeah

557
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,420
g e p j

558
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,580
that's you think ye now g

559
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,780
j

560
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,020
everything in a gap. So how did they come up with the word jeep? That's what I

561
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,980
was trying to figure out, but I guess it just already meant a small four wheel

562
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,860
drive car used by the military, but it's short for a jeep loppy. Oh, do you

563
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,460
think you plop in jeep loppy? Oh, here comes look at this.

564
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,260
What does jeep

565
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,180
what is jeep stand another enough essential parts? Oh, that's why it's so

566
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,980
jangly. That makes perfect sense. That's the brie of it all. That's how you can

567
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,020
take all the you can take the steering wheel. I'll tell you why they call it

568
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:01,860
Jeep because it's a Jeep piece of junk. Yeah, man, that's what my dad was so

569
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,660
excited about. He's like, I can take the doors off and taking the doors off is so

570
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,060
time consuming and difficult. That's what I was. That's what I said to him. I

571
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,860
was like, I'll take the doors off a cool car. That cost a lot of money. I get to

572
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,900
I get to chop the doors off of my Ford Focus. You know, it'd be cooler is put

573
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,900
some butterfly doors on the Jeep. Put some butter in your car. Yeah, but you

574
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,740
take the doors off your car. Everyone's taking your butter. Oh, did you put

575
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,580
butter in the car in the summer? You go and sit down on it and then you go and

576
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,580
down on some bread and then you

577
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,100
see to the car.

578
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,580
Guys, I can't contain myself. I need to wrap. We do. All right.

579
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,980
I'm hungry. Okay, I'm hungry for a beat. Well, it's time for the

580
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,140
five fingers of music part two. The six fingers of music. Last

581
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,980
time you said I love the fingers. I love all five of

582
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,460
these fingers, but I have six fingers and I wish that there

583
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,740
was a fourth finger of a human. Wait, what? Six. Oh, I see what

584
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,440
pretty soon. Yeah. So we brought it to you and we brought probably the best

585
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,760
freestyle rapper that I know, Jack Bensinger, but I don't know that many

586
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,940
freestyle rappers, to be honest.

587
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,120
Well,

588
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,980
for this moment, I'd like to reiterate kind of the background lore of who I am.

589
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,980
My name's not Jack Bensinger anymore. Oh, sorry. I don't have one. I used to

590
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,500
be an actor. You guys know me from the bear. I don't really do that corny

591
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,700
shit anymore. Right. No, that shit's cringe, man. If they, I don't know. If

592
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,840
I asked you to come back for season three or not. I would do season three like if

593
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,800
it was at a music festival, okay, and they just wanted to film one of my live

594
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,840
shows, yeah, or you could be there. It's like, oh, that's the guy I could be

595
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
doing the last yeah, you could be the musician.

596
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,180
Oh, my God, this guy was telling me this thing before now. Look at this. He's on

597
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,220
stage. Now he's a now he's a bear season three. You could be one of the people,

598
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,520
one of the humans, a sushi off of because that's not technically acting. That's

599
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,960
furniture. Excuse me, what that's furniture. You know the naked sushi in

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,800
the bear? In the world. In the world. They could eat a Portillo sandwich off of you.

601
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:00,800
They could have up here, they could have the beach. The bear is based on the world. It's

602
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,640
true. You gotta pitch a show, man. You gotta get away with that. You think I could get

603
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:14,880
away with that one? It's like the world needs... It's basically like the world. Basically imagine

604
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,640
in the world, and so the thrust

605
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:24,160
story engine is what's happening right every day. The sun comes up. That's

606
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,400
kind of what Atlas Cloud Cloud Atlas was about Atlas Cloud is that tragic past

607
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,200
after Angus. Oh,

608
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,040
not his name.

609
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,020
I mean when you the way you said past actor, maybe like he specializes

610
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,520
except from the past.

611
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,720
Well, everybody does know some people do know a on flux. Yes,

612
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,840
I had the unrated version of that movie. What do you mean the DVD unrated like

613
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,520
x rated unrate? Oh, those are different. They didn't even bother to rate this,

614
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,120
but I rated it ten out of ten. I go drop that beat. Okay, we're starting who had

615
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,240
Jack best worst or the first finger. I don't know who's the most thumb of us

616
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,300
for oh well, well, let's see I mean okay, so here's here's the here's the deal me

617
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,240
and Patrick each made to Jack made one and Caleb made one, so that's six

618
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,160
fingers. So that's six fingers. Should we get an order of a hand? No, what

619
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,620
let's draw straws. All right, well, let's go ahead and play Caleb's all

620
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,660
right, okay, oh wait, okay, how does this going to work because isn't one

621
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,720
supposed to do five fingers to see if they can survive the well, but we're

622
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,680
just doing what we do is basically a group freestyle. We're all fingers on a

623
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
hand. It's called a hand is the one. Well,

624
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,600
do you imagine where the future and we're all on? It's like a cipher. I see

625
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,080
now. So it's five. So the fingers are so we are the finger. Well, it's

626
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,360
interesting. We are the fingers because the fingers are the beats and you're

627
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,920
just who you are and I'm well, it's six fingers and then there's four of us

628
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,640
human fingers. So it's still ten. It's four fingers wrapping on six music

629
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,580
six fingers, four fingers wrapping on six interlocking between the spaces of the

630
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,600
fingers. So it's kind of like six fingers.

631
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,000
Yeah,

632
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,900
yeah,

633
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,400
yourself, you got hit with a joy buzzer or something.

634
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,200
I got a pretty bad cramp

635
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,900
from doing this.

636
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,600
I'm just interlocking, holding your own hand.

637
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,100
You got a thumb cramp from that. I don't think I've ever had a thumb cramp

638
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,700
on my life. I got stuck going that way.

639
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,940
That's how you broke it. That's not stuck. All right. All right. Well,

640
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,100
drop that finger.

641
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:49,980
How's it go now? Okay, let's do it.

642
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,020
Turn my headphones up.

643
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,500
Rapping on fingers.

644
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,900
He was on the bear and he has no hair. Got some underwear.

645
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
that he wears down there

646
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
and his hat is blue

647
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
and my friends are cool

648
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
and my food is too

649
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
and I'm wearing shoes

650
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
and I have two friends

651
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,900
and plus one more

652
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,900
and another one

653
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,900
he was at the store

654
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
NOOOOOO

655
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,900
NO!

656
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Oh I was on fire and then I went store man

657
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
he immediately went store

658
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
and what was wrong with the store

659
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,800
say that word on the

660
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,900
with the store every every rap. You do every fuck. Why don't you just lean into

661
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,340
it? Because I didn't see anything wrong with the store. Patrick, wait, you had a

662
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,300
shy ste this whole time.

663
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:51,260
Now home, so it actually hurts my ears every time. This is a recurring issue

664
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,180
that I have in the rap game, which is every time I freestyle. I forgot to put

665
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,260
this on. As soon as the beat dry, start rapping about going to the store and

666
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,460
getting some more almost every single time. Yeah, so you know, so it's just

667
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,460
not it's to the point where it's not a style. It's more of a crutch. Okay, so

668
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,860
it's what we're trying to do. So what's the opposite of a store? They're your

669
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,760
house library library is a free store. Yeah, I'm so I'm just say stuff with

670
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,860
library and I give me the be back.

671
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:25,760
At the library. It is so scary. I am so hairy and I am

672
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:41,140
even

673
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,140
I was singing.

674
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
I'm doing more of the hooks at this time.

675
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,940
Wait, this might help.

676
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,420
Reading is not a crime.

677
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,220
I do it all the time.

678
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,100
I'm reading books about limes.

679
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,980
I'm reading books about limes.

680
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,700
Lime scooter, hit her in the cooter.

681
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
Hit her?

682
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,660
Wait, drop a gunshot.

683
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,040
Hit her in her cooter.

684
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,220
With a lime scooter?

685
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
Lime scooter directly to the cooter.

686
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,400
doing some evil can evil shit into a woman's evil. This is a good way to

687
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,480
learn about your instincts. My exactly store hurting women's vagina,

688
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,620
hurting women's with, but with with cutting edge, cutting edge application

689
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,360
based technology, using an application vehicle to hurt a woman or thing. I

690
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,700
went in a self driving car. Really? Yeah,

691
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,580
about it.

692
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,380
I was in

693
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,780
I'll yell

694
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,580
I don't well I was in Phoenix basically and a rapist about it. Yeah, you have to rap about it

695
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,300
Yo, imagine a work. Well actually turn this beat keep it the same actually I

696
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:55,340
Was in a car that had nobody driving in it. I felt like a cream spinach

697
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:59,460
I had I literally got exploded on with the whole vehicle exploded

698
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,980
It was crazy Phoenix fell into the earth and then I and then I blow up all crazy

699
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,740
I have no I have no idea what's happening to me. I got a lobster hot pocket. Oh

700
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:15,220
Oh, I met two hot two girls with two lobster hot pockets.

701
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,060
I said, get in the self-driving vehicle.

702
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,900
Me and you got to go down and I could show you what it's like when I'm laughing at Jason.

703
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,580
See you go.

704
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:33,540
Vehicle to see a girl is insanely good, man.

705
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,260
That's the type of shit that I'm expressing myself about for a second.

706
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,020
All right, Cameron.

707
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,380
Okay.

708
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:47,700
Well, well, I'm sitting here and I can't. Oh, it ended. No, I was done. You just got

709
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,940
bit. Okay. I've set it to loop though, but I didn't know why you left a gap. Caleb, why

710
00:40:52,940 --> 00:41:00,020
did you leave a gap? I think that that silence in your beat was crap. It threw me off and

711
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:06,900
it made me want to cough because I have COVID and this episode is over. Now I have to leave.

712
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I have COVID-19.

713
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
You can't leave.

714
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
It's not a real disease.

715
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,900
You're good.

716
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
COVID!

717
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,900
I have COVID-19.

718
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
Ice cream.

719
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
You're barely rapping.

720
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:23,300
We gotta work on your confidence a little bit.

721
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,940
I have COVID-19.

722
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:34,780
I just made ice cream with the germs made from sperms.

723
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Ice cream sperms.

724
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,980
I put sperm in my ice cream.

725
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,180
People want to eat my ice cream.

726
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,020
- I don't know if this is okay.

727
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,860
- What?

728
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,680
- What?

729
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,520
- Putting sperm in ice cream?

730
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,480
- You can make sperm from ice cream.

731
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,980
- You can make ice cream from sperm.

732
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,020
It won't have germs.

733
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,860
- And it's not a worm, it's just sperm.

734
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,980
- And it won't hurt your sperm-ic.

735
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,580
When you eat it, you won't say erm-ic.

736
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,420
- Oh, 'cause you-

737
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,240
- 'Cause I'm defeated.

738
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,180
- You'll still like it.

739
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,000
- Yeah.

740
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,020
- This beat is defeated.

741
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Okay, we defeated that finger, man.

742
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
I just eat it.

743
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,020
My pants, they are pleated.

744
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,020
My texts, they get deleted.

745
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,020
Delete your text?

746
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,020
What are you sending?

747
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,020
Every month, just to save space.

748
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,020
Okay.

749
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,020
I had a picture of a new face.

750
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,020
That I made on my space.

751
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,020
Did you catfish somebody?

752
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,020
I invented duck face.

753
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,020
You invented duck face?

754
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,020
I invented duck face.

755
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,020
Ace invented duck face, fuck face.

756
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,900
Better get the fuck out of my space, out of my place. I'll send you to space.

757
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,700
I'll pull out my ACE, my ACE of spades. I have, I've fucking,

758
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,220
I don't have, I have AIDS.

759
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:54,780
I have the worst instincts.

760
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,500
Bro. It's making us all go.

761
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,100
Okay. To say you have AIDS on a freestyle. It's just off the dome.

762
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,220
what's your first that's what wait yeah. What are your thoughts on this? Can you

763
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,900
is anything goes with freestyling? You're allowed to say you have AIDS or

764
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,220
COVID. Look, you can say that you have a disease. You can say you have this and

765
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,700
that. I mean that's the beauty of expressing yourself is you can do it. You

766
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,660
should be able to do it, but you should be ready for the repercussions. Right. So

767
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,780
when people come at you and say, hey, my whole thing is that I rap, I have AIDS.

768
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,100
My whole thing is that I rap, I have COVID. You better be ready with the blood

769
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,860
tests or you know it's just I need to come with you said you gotta be ready for

770
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,100
three percussions. Let's hit it with some more real percussions.

771
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,220
Drop the next beat. Damn.

772
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,100
All right, let me say something real about what I'm like these days.

773
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,060
You got to rap in it.

774
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,260
Do you want your finger?

775
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,860
Sure. Start it up.

776
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,820
Okay, I'm going to start your finger.

777
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,700
Show me that finger. I'm excited for this finger.

778
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,220
Yo.

779
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,660
Yo.

780
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,460
Boom, bat.

781
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,860
Turn that up actually a little bit.

782
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,460
Actually a lot maybe.

783
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
All right, yo.

784
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,660
I was on the band, but now I don't do stuff like that.

785
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,660
I'm not an actor anymore, I rap and it's all- anybody wants to see me

786
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,660
I don't have- I was on the bare and the second AD was disrespecting me

787
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,660
and so I put the head up inside of- the set told me to shut the fuck up

788
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,660
the second AC was trying to pull focus and I snapped their neck

789
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:16,660
and then I put- well, I walked up to the boom op and then I put him in a hole

790
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,660
and then I walked- and then I saw the person doing craft services

791
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,660
and I said, "I don't do this anymore, I don't need this shit, I'm too real

792
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,660
I gotta move on to my next hobby, which is not a hobby, it's my way of life and it's rapping"

793
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,300
I'm not, yeah.

794
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,300
This finger is fire.

795
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
This finger is amazing.

796
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
It's kind of a sponge bob.

797
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,860
I like this squelchy ass bass.

798
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
I didn't make it.

799
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,860
You didn't make this?

800
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,860
Nope.

801
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
You said you made it.

802
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,860
You said you made it.

803
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,860
Oh, I know the guy.

804
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
You said you made it.

805
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,860
He said he made it.

806
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,860
The song is faked it.

807
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,860
Damn, now you naked.

808
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,860
Now you naked.

809
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,900
I was an air bud as an extra and then I started learning about different textures and I don't

810
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,900
do that acting anymore.

811
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,540
I was in the background when Air Bud was dunking the ball.

812
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,620
I was in the background making out with 600 people at the same time and then I had to

813
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,380
retire because I don't live that life of way anymore.

814
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,380
Wow.

815
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Wow.

816
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,020
You're like a reverse Malice from Clipse.

817
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,380
You gave up being good to be a rapper.

818
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,260
Yep.

819
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:24,260
I was a, I was a, I was in, what's a, I was in the bear.

820
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,740
I was in the bear now, but I was in the bear with Jeremy Allen white

821
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,060
They put me on TV with Jimmy Fallon

822
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,700
He's white and then I had to go and stop at a red light and then I had to eat some food with a big bite

823
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,680
And then I hung out with Jack Ben singer from the bear

824
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,180
He was an act air, but now he don't care and then he I said man

825
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,460
That's pretty fair and then he got some wings to share for me and him

826
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:52,700
We got the buffalo wings both of us ate those 12 things

827
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,540
I know 600 people named Julian every single one of them owes me six dollars for helping them and they are

828
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:05,180
Don't reply to me when I DM them every single Julian needs to stop it. I know you guys

829
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:13,640
Heard about my lobster hot pockets from the Phoenix when I was in the self-driving car and now I'm not that's the type of shit

830
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,020
I do now. I don't even act anymore. Nope

831
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
All he does is eat

832
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:25,500
Lobster hot pockets and rap faster than a rocket and take a picture to put in a locket of yourself

833
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,580
Because you're in love with yourself, and that's not good for your health man. You need to get

834
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:37,260
Better you need to get better you need to get better. You're gonna love yourself

835
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:44,180
Respect respect the fingers man respect the finger

836
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,180
You gotta rap, you gotta rap on this shit.

837
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,180
You're gonna love yourself.

838
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,180
I hit you with the elf.

839
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,180
That's on my shelf.

840
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,180
Christmas style.

841
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,180
Uh.

842
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,180
Chris Kyle, I'm sniping you

843
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,180
from a mile away.

844
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,180
Make you smile.

845
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,180
All day.

846
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,180
Make you smile all day.

847
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
I went to a dentist named the Smile-ist.

848
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,180
And my dentist was the wildest.

849
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,180
What'd he do?

850
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,420
Grinch tooth in my smile, bitch.

851
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,620
- A Grinch tooth?

852
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,900
- Put a green Grinch tooth inside of my smile, bitch.

853
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,740
- The Grinch's teeth are green.

854
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,540
- The Grinch had green teeth in the movie.

855
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,860
Look up his, that scene.

856
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,420
- Man, his teeth are white.

857
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,260
- Look up that scene.

858
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,100
- He doesn't have a green bite.

859
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,260
- He had green teeth in the movie.

860
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,660
Had it in that movie.

861
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,980
- Those are a lot more yellow,

862
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,340
which makes sense 'cause the Grinch

863
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,700
is a green and nasty fellow.

864
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,060
He wouldn't brush his teeth

865
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,900
And he likes to eat all kinds of trash and bugs and rotten types of meat.

866
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Damn!

867
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,900
That was a big one.

868
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Hold those pants down.

869
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:48,900
What the fuck?

870
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
That was pretty good.

871
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,900
What the fuck?

872
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,900
Chill guys.

873
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,900
He's just making himself conscious.

874
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,900
He popped off.

875
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,900
No, no, no.

876
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,900
You popped the fuck off, bro.

877
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,900
Guys, I didn't pop off.

878
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:04,220
And I'm not going to rhyme with pop off because I can't think of anything in time.

879
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,820
There's nothing in the world that's pop off that rhymes.

880
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,660
Peter Pop Off was a guy.

881
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,200
He went to church and he lied.

882
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,360
Sold Miracle Water on BET at night.

883
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,360
Damn, what?

884
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,360
Really?

885
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,360
Is that a true story?

886
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Miracle Water, Peter Popov.

887
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Jack's about to go off.

888
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,360
Well, stop the beat.

889
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Turn it down all the way.

890
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,040
Now, sorry, isn't part of the five fingers is that you're supposed to be able to switch

891
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,160
beat like switch the flow?

892
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
You want a challenge?

893
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,760
Well, that's what the five fingers are is like.

894
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,760
Well, let's just hit this next minute.

895
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,320
You're coming in here with all kinds of ideas.

896
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,320
You have all the rules about the fingers.

897
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,120
also about the fingers. You've probably seen a bunch of Five Fingers of Death,

898
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,880
I bet. Oh, what I bet is that you've never seen even a single Five Finger of

899
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,400
Music. Yeah, this is the Five Fingers of Music. Oh, this is the Five Fingers of

900
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,600
Music? It's more about the music than about dying. Yeah. We didn't understand

901
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,120
why Sway wants to kill these... He doesn't wanna kill Tori Lanez and Peppu's.

902
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,920
We're about bringing people up. Five Fingers of Death. Five Fingers of Life

903
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,920
and Music. Well, it's about rising to the occasion, right? It's like, "Okay,

904
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,080
these beats are gonna try to kill you." These are about beats that are gonna

905
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,740
A beat that's trying to kill you. Maybe this will help get you in the right

906
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,580
mindset. This is a beat that I made that I... This is maybe the chillest beat.

907
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,980
It's for just chilling. Wait, let me sit back, put my hood up. And it's kind

908
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,480
of a... It's a little bit of a November vibe, so maybe a little early.

909
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,520
Can we get a little more Immortal Technique, Demi God's Flow on this one?

910
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,280
I got a Nas, Nick Cannon type beat. So this one's a little... This one's...

911
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,120
That is coming up soon. Kind of for chilling. Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna

912
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,620
throw this one on and maybe we can just kind of relax and take it easy

913
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,620
instead of turning the key.

914
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,020
And it has a little intro.

915
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,020
Chill or be chilled.

916
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,720
And you made this?

917
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,220
Yeah.

918
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,280
Wait.

919
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:49,780
Wow.

920
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,580
That's actually fucking beautiful.

921
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,580
I'm getting Kirby vibes.

922
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,020
Rolling up some weed in my fucking food

923
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,980
Gonna eat that shit then I smoke with a dude

924
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,380
I'm gonna go back to my house tonight

925
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,980
I'm gonna watch TV till I feel alright

926
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,580
And me and my friends are hanging at school

927
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,180
We all have shoes and we all look cool

928
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,580
Every single one of my friends has food

929
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,980
Nobody has more food than you

930
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,980
*Slowly dying*

931
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,980
Oh god, I don't fucking food anymore

932
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,980
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

933
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,480
I got my AK, I bring it back to my house

934
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,980
I shoot every single family member in my fucking house

935
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,480
Blow my mom's head off, and then I kill my dad

936
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,980
I'ma kill my grandpa, make my grandma so sad

937
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,420
And then I kill my dog and I turn him into a food

938
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,860
And then I turn him to a sandwich and I give him a food

939
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:59,380
And then I go outside, kill my mailman, kill all my neighbors

940
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,820
And then I go back upstairs and I play Hello Neighbor

941
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,420
And then I play all every kind of scary game on my computer

942
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,620
I play Five Nights at Freddy's and then I fucking shoot her

943
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,740
Shoot all of my friends and I kill all of my family

944
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:16,180
And I kill the President of the United States and I kill all of the Senators

945
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,120
He shouldn't say that on the show.

946
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,420
He got in trouble for that.

947
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,260
Not long ago.

948
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:27,720
Not long ago in the galaxy far, far away.

949
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,760
Star Wars is gay.

950
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,800
Star Wars is gay now because the trilogy has been diluted.

951
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,900
He's rapping about food.

952
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,800
Oh, this battle's getting food.

953
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,800
We're not battling.

954
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,440
It's not a food battle.

955
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,340
Call me Smosh.

956
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,180
I'm a I'm alluded to Smosh and their move vids.

957
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,840
Their new vids.

958
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,440
Damn, Smosh is back.

959
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,340
Smosh is back.

960
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,020
Oh, Smosh is back.

961
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,680
Oh, Smosh is back.

962
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,680
Yo, Smosh is back with Anthony and Ian.

963
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,020
They make me laugh so hard like an alien.

964
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:11,900
Whoa. Would laugh if he saw human culture up in his UFO flying like a vulture.

965
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,900
He wouldn't understand why we have war.

966
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,240
He would think an intelligent species wouldn't have that anymore.

967
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,700
But we keep on with our guns and our bombs and their guns and their bombs.

968
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,040
And then maybe I could put a sample in a gun.

969
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,660
Oh, go into that.

970
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,080
That's a song and that one is called Zombie.

971
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,420
And it's about how we should have no more bombs, see?

972
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,500
Because even if an alien showed up,

973
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,960
we would probably take out our guns and blow them up.

974
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,060
Piers can't be a zombie.

975
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:52,980
I feel like I'm like maybe I just like I'm missing my kids graduation right now

976
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,940
and I came outside I'm sorry I have to go like do this thing and I'm just like

977
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,100
sitting here sweating and like knowing that a divorce is waiting for me when I

978
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:07,780
get home I'm just like chillin rapping with my friends who are 20 years younger than me

979
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,500
But after this, this is it.

980
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,500
This is uh, this will be some of the last recorded moments of my life.

981
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,940
This is uh, you're missing a really important funeral.

982
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,100
Yeah, this is the Chester Bennington Jelly Beans video.

983
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,660
Listen, honey, these guys have a lot of fucking followers.

984
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,980
This could change a lot of things for us, man.

985
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,460
This could change a lot.

986
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,460
Uh, yeah.

987
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,820
Well, why don't you rap on this new beat, man?

988
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,820
I want to hear you.

989
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:39,220
Yo, I would like everybody to listen to what I have to say.

990
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,220
What's happening right now?

991
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,520
I just restarted by accident.

992
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,420
That's good, though.

993
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,120
That's a good intro.

994
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,420
What's up?

995
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,020
My name is...

996
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,020
I was on...

997
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,820
I was on season 2, episode 5 of The Bear.

998
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,920
I don't do that shit anymore.

999
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,420
I don't act.

1000
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,220
I just get respect for being so real.

1001
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,720
I like to express myself.

1002
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,120
Acting is something that I put away

1003
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:12,340
Now I don't get disrespect from the second a DS who go and tell me to take a nap for nine hours

1004
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,900
And then they wake me up and give me chicken kebabs and I say

1005
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,200
This life is so amazing. How's my life so amazing?

1006
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,560
Sometimes I feel like I am supposed to be a little monkey

1007
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,520
Let's go to the next figure, bro.

1008
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,520
Let's go to the next beat.

1009
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
This beat is so good, though.

1010
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
Let's go to this next beat.

1011
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
This is by far the best beat.

1012
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,520
This beat makes me feel like I'm about three inches tall and my purse is turning around in a basket.

1013
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,520
Oh, wait. Yeah. We need a Quasimodo.

1014
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,520
Give us some... Can you make us also have voices with this?

1015
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,520
Oh, yeah. Hold on.

1016
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Hello?

1017
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
Hold on. I know how to fix this.

1018
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,520
Alright.

1019
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Everybody... Hello? Hello? Hello?

1020
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Yo, I am in my mushroom.

1021
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,520
My house is a mushroom.

1022
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,520
I make food in my mushroom.

1023
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,520
All my food doesn't have mushroom.

1024
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,520
Oh, damn!

1025
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,520
I'm gonna eat you.

1026
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,520
Mushrooms.

1027
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,520
And my house is also a mushroom.

1028
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,520
My house doesn't have that much room.

1029
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,520
But I have a new rec room.

1030
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,520
When it comes to strength, there's nobody feebler.

1031
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,520
And I'm just the size of an elf, feebler.

1032
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:35,760
There's about 12 hours left for the 1 million population to get to the southern side of

1033
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,880
Palestine before Israel continues to seemingly escalate what is happening is the report I'm

1034
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,880
getting.

1035
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,880
I just have prayers for all the civilians.

1036
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,440
It's just unfortunate.

1037
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,920
It's really terrible.

1038
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,400
I don't even, I really don't even like talking about it.

1039
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
Yo, I got a Q-tip!

1040
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah, I really don't even.

1041
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
I'm a Q-tip!

1042
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,200
Yeah, I really don't even.

1043
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,800
Oh my God, I'm using a leaf like a boat.

1044
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,000
I got a Q-tip.

1045
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,600
Uh, my stew has got a beef tip.

1046
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,100
Uh, Jesus Christ.

1047
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,600
Okay.

1048
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,600
You guys, listen.

1049
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,800
You are married.

1050
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,300
Yeah.

1051
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,600
You are on your way.

1052
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,000
You are on your way.

1053
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm not on my way.

1054
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,600
What are you talking about?

1055
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
So what's the problem?

1056
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
I can't, I can't rap about being small.

1057
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,700
No, you can rap about it.

1058
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,900
I'm rapping about being small and living in a mushroom.

1059
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,820
What's wrong with being three inches tall?

1060
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,820
Yeah.

1061
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,820
Kebler.

1062
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,820
You want us to get real.

1063
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,500
If I met somebody who's three inches tall, I wouldn't say anything.

1064
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,500
You want me to get real?

1065
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,500
You want us to get what you're talking about.

1066
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,460
I just am thinking about, like, who is everybody's inspirations, right?

1067
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,460
Immortal Technique, Leaving the Past, right?

1068
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
Yeah.

1069
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,460
Lucky the Leprechaun.

1070
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,460
Point of No Return, right?

1071
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,460
Yeah.

1072
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,460
Lucky the Leprechaun.

1073
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,460
So you like cereal?

1074
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,460
I like cereal.

1075
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,620
And that's what gets you crazy?

1076
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,620
I like grub.

1077
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,620
I like small cereals.

1078
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,620
I like grub the rock gnome.

1079
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,620
Who's that?

1080
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,940
It's a gnome that I've created in my mind.

1081
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,460
it? Well, then it doesn't count. Oh, he should meet the golem in my head. Yeah.

1082
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,740
I got a golem. What is a golem? Oh, what's a golem? Is this a rock monster?

1083
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,880
It's a rock monster. You don't know about the mint golem that I've been

1084
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,540
thinking about for three years now? Mint? Yeah, no, yeah. Mint like that's

1085
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:10,340
mint. Wait, wait, wait. Is a golem made of mint? Well, it's a mint flavoured

1086
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,820
golem, yeah. You lick him? That's cool. Okay. If you licked him, it would be

1087
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:17,380
minty, yeah. So it'd brush your teeth for you? Well. Like gum. It's a good

1088
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:17,900
part of that.

1089
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,020
Give me the next finger. Alright, which one do you want? Let's go Nick Cannon

00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:46,180
I was still small uh you look like I'm a I'm a yeet no you look exactly like yeet

1093
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,620
I'm the Yule of Known.

1094
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,580
Make my voice low.

1095
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,780
No, I don't have that.

1096
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,340
He doesn't have that.

1097
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,100
I thought you had the voice lows.

1098
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:54,820
You look like a...

1099
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:55,540
Uh...

1100
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,780
You know those bonito...

1101
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,060
Bonito.

1102
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,800
Bang.

1103
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,860
Bang bang.

1104
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,580
No, I don't know the bonitos.

1105
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,380
Can you tell me what are those?

1106
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,140
I was just thinking you look like an onigiri.

1107
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,740
Oh, like a food.

1108
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,540
Fish food.

1109
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,660
Yeah, the food made a fish.

1110
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,060
It's a rock and roll solo.

1111
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,060
Whoa.

1112
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,380
Oh, wow.

1113
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,380
Afro Circus from Madagascar.

1114
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:26,500
How did you do this?

1115
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
FL Studio, free trial.

1116
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
Wow.

1117
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,860
Do we have to wait?

1118
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,220
So is this one supposed to be for rapping?

1119
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,420
I thought you guys were going to rap.

1120
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:34,940
I thought you guys were going to rap over this.

1121
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,340
Rap over the rock, man?

1122
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:37,020
Nobody can do that.

1123
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,020
Yeah, you can't even drum.

1124
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,180
You can't rap over that.

1125
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,220
What are you talking about?

1126
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,060
And do it.

1127
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,060
Well, it's done now.

1128
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,420
Wow.

1129
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,660
How do you know the timing so well?

1130
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,660
That was smooth.

1131
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,260
I thought you guys were going to rap over this.

1132
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,700
I don't like this rock and roll shit.

1133
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,940
To me, I think that it is cock and bullshit.

1134
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,140
And I think it smells like poop.

1135
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,540
And I think that you look like a piece of poop.

1136
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,500
This is like a, this feels like a rap about your depression kind of beat.

1137
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,500
Yeah.

1138
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Okay.

1139
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,500
I'm so sad.

1140
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
My life is so bad.

1141
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,540
And Jack is going to do the rest of this part.

1142
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:14,740
When I was on the side of the bear, I tried killing myself once a minute.

1143
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,740
It felt so disrespectful to be acting in it.

1144
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,420
I didn't even like to be experiencing it.

1145
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,780
When I was acting, I felt like I was a giraffe who didn't have thumbs so I couldn't even kill

1146
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,980
myself because I couldn't hold a gun like that.

1147
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,740
How come animals don't have thumbs and so they can't even kill themselves if they really

1148
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,740
wanted to?

1149
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:35,340
If a horse had a thumb and it was acting in the bear, would it take itself out?

1150
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
I don't...

1151
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,340
Yeah.

1152
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,740
I think the rock and roll solo is coming again.

1153
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,020
Alright, there's another one?

1154
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,020
It's just on a loop.

1155
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,020
Well it's not over yet.

1156
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,020
You put two in?

1157
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:50,020
You put two rock in?

1158
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,020
There might be two rock in.

1159
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,020
You're just gonna every few seconds say it's about to happen again?

1160
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,020
I got evil thoughts in my brain!

1161
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,020
Everybody in the world is gonna get destroyed by my plane!

1162
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,020
I'm going to bring my plane to the whole world!

1163
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,020
And all their guts are gonna be whirled!

1164
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,020
Whirled around!

1165
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,020
With my big plane!

1166
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,020
You're gonna kill people with a plane?

1167
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,020
I kinda have a feeling

1168
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:17,860
I use my brain to concoct a plane plan. I'm a bad man. This is like 9/11 the musical.

1169
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:24,820
Do you understand what I intend to mean? Yes. I had a bit about that kind of,

1170
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:29,060
not even a bit, maybe just a line. All right, well, stop the finger. We'll hear the line.

1171
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:34,260
Well, just the, you know, so on 9/11, two planes flew into the buildings, right? Yeah. We're lucky

1172
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,600
lucky then crash him into the planet because then it would have been a huge

1173
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,120
accident.

1174
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,900
All right, the

1175
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:45,920
you haven't even wrapped one time you're afraid of this beat. This beat is

1176
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,560
bringing out parts of me that I never knew. We're lucky this isn't the fingers

1177
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,080
of death because I feel like they made a God in us. You think we would have

1178
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:55,020
died? You would have died on this way, would have had to drop the guillotine on

1179
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:59,620
us. No, no, I would live now in this finger. I don't like this finger. What

1180
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:03,500
about the next? What about jalopy beat? You do Hickey? Let's hear it. Let's hear

1181
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,900
I'm going to wrap over do he can do it. All right, do you beat from Patrick?

1182
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,220
All right, ready? Here we go. Yeah, I

1183
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,740
okay,

1184
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:19,700
it's tropical depression, pulling me down. This session is making me frown. I

1185
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,740
am I'm in a recession all around my town. I'm feeling like I'm in a circus. I'm

1186
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:30,420
in a circus with thirty kids walking around with Burkas. I'm in a circus

1187
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:36,460
I don't have anything except my shirt because I got two shirts on.

1188
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:38,460
Got my whole work on.

1189
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,460
I'll tell you what this song is about.

1190
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:42,460
Start it over.

1191
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:44,460
Ready?

1192
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,460
You want to start from the top?

1193
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,460
Yeah, because this is bringing to light a story that I have.

1194
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:50,460
Is it about the bear?

1195
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,460
Nope.

1196
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:58,460
Let me tell you the story about the time I was on set of the Bear and Jeremy Allen.

1197
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:03,460
Jeremy Allen White slipped me 600 mg of acid.

1198
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,060
Jeremy Allen White gives me a giant piece of cheese.

1199
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,660
Little did I know it was full of LSDs.

1200
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:13,060
Then I eat them and he tells me to start acting, but then I start sweating.

1201
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,860
And the director's going, "Dude, why are you acting so strangely?"

1202
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:18,460
And I go, "I don't know. Somebody must have drugged me."

1203
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:23,460
And it was Jeremy Allen White slipping toxic cheddar cheese in my throat like Sprite.

1204
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,460
And then I had to wonder what's happening.

1205
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,760
Jeremy Allen White must be controlled by the government.

1206
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,760
Never trust people.

1207
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,260
Well, he lives, doesn't he live in the neighborhood?

1208
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:34,260
We should go to his house and make him pay for what he did to Mike Cheese.

1209
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,760
Somebody I know saw Jeremy Allen White on a subway.

1210
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,760
He was dressed up exactly like a chef.

1211
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,760
That's a true...

1212
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,760
Someone I know saw him wearing a mask and a hat trying to hide his identity on the subway,

1213
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,760
except he was dressed up like a chef.

1214
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,760
Man, you play a chef on TV.

1215
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,260
People are gonna recognize you, man.

1216
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:54,760
This is a beat that you can't listen to for that long, 'cause it starts to make you feel bad.

1217
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Yeah, it has, this has a dark carnival.

1218
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,520
What is dark about this?

1219
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,520
This is an ICP.

1220
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,000
There is literally a chime in it.

1221
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,840
Let's just try rapping about happy stuff

1222
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,680
to try and counteract it.

1223
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,920
It's in a minor key.

1224
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,000
♪ Hey, it's me, I am at the circus ♪

1225
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,280
♪ And I am eating a lot of peanuts, come a circus ♪

1226
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,120
Okay.

1227
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,640
♪ Peanuts at the circus, got circus ♪

1228
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,480
♪ Peanuts at the circus ♪

1229
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,320
I hate this beat, dude.

1230
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,640
What is wrong with this beat?

1231
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,480
Turn this beat off, man.

1232
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,300
It makes me uncomfortable.

1233
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,140
What about the last one?

1234
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,840
I can't do that beat, dude.

1235
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,680
Yeah, that beat was--

1236
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,500
That beat is wack.

1237
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,480
Your beats were terrible, man.

1238
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,560
My beats were not both terrible.

1239
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,440
They were difficult to flow.

1240
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,440
They were unscrupulous.

1241
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,440
They were unscrupulous.

1242
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,440
What are you talking about?

1243
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
You told the word right out of my mouth.

1244
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,800
The first beat had a Nick Cannon type feel.

1245
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,800
Nobody knows what that means.

1246
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,240
Nobody knows who Nick Cannon is.

1247
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,240
The only Nick Cannon song I know is his Eminem diss.

1248
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,240
We're going to detox.

1249
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,240
Okay.

1250
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,240
Dr. Dre.

1251
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,760
We should get some Chris detoxing for a second here.

1252
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:45,760
This is definitely my favorite one.

1253
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:50,360
I still have one more, but we're going to cleanse the energy a little bit.

1254
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,760
Oh, that feels like burning sage.

1255
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,760
That feels good.

1256
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,760
It's like burning man.

1257
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:18,760
I'm

1258
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:37,200
like

1259
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,360
shirt please thanksgiving. Sing that to your uncle at Thanksgiving. He's in the living

1260
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,200
room no shirt on. He doesn't wear a shirt? You don't have any uncles? No uncles. What

1261
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:50,200
about your parents? Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving put on a shirt please Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving.

1262
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:59,200
Okay. Nice. Yeah that works. Okay we got the hook. This is like the commentary from Step

1263
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:05,240
Brothers. Have you all seen that? No. Uh uh. Step Brothers DVD commentary. Did they say

1264
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,360
It's a music, it's completely a musical improv. Really? Yeah. And they have Gilbert and Reenus.

1265
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,720
This isn't musical improv, this is rap. Yeah, this is freestyle. This is like epic rap battles

1266
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,640
of history type shit. Yeah. Which this next and final beat will... The last finger? Is

1267
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:29,920
exactly like a rap battle of history type beat. Let me just make sure it's on loop here.

1268
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,040
It's on loop. It's on loop now. Let's hear it. Alright, here we go. Cameron's final beat.

1269
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,760
The last finger, the sixth finger of music, everybody.

1270
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,800
Daddy finger, daddy finger, where are you?

1271
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,680
Wait, here I am.

1272
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,840
Here I am.

1280
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,640
It's time for my finger.

1281
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:11,840
Oh my God.

1282
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,000
You've expressed yourself.

1283
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,360
Wow.

1284
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,800
Express yourself.

1285
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,680
A little bit.

1286
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,880
This is incredible.

1287
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,400
Wow.

1288
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,520
This is like, this is like a mix of every beat we've heard so far.

1289
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,560
What?

1290
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,840
Oh my God.

1291
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,440
Why do you always have one really good beat that you come with?

1292
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,960
Well, this one is just a drum loop, so I can't take full credit.

1293
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,320
You can take the full credit.

1294
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,320
You press play on it.

1295
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,320
Let's replay that one more time.

1296
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,320
Yeah, I gotta hear the beginning.

1297
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
Play it from the top.

1298
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
Can you say it along with it, do you think?

1299
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
I don't think I remember what it says.

1300
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,320
I'll try.

1301
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Okay, you try.

1302
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
Let's give it a go.

1303
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,320

01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,320
I'm not sure.

1312
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,320
I'm not sure.

1313
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
I'm not sure.

1314
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,320
I'm not sure.

1315
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
I'm not sure.

1316
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,320
I'm not sure.

1317
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:18,320
DJ Dr. Dazzle, Tickle Monster Music, Real Alternative Comedy Show, Podcast about List, Five Fingers of Music, featuring JJ Jackson, DJ Fox, Joey Cagney, and it's time for Five Finger.

1318
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,320
The Bear Season 2 was not my best time in my life

1319
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,320
I didn't like it and nobody gave me an Uber there so I lost money doing it

1320
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,320
And then I went home and I was afraid of the airplane

1321
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,320
And then I got back and then I did the

1322
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:39,320
They put me in an outfit that didn't make me look like somebody not from Norway

1323
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:45,320
And then I had to quit acting now

1324
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:50,320
but it's okay because rap is my delicious activity.

1325
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,280
Oh my God. Wait, can you say your line from the Bear season two?

1326
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,240
Yo, aren't you the guy that invented, wait,

1327
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,360
you're one of the first people we knew to make a website.

1328
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:04,560
You're one of the first people we know to make a website.

1329
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,960
And then what I say something like nice, nice. And then Eric goes there.

1330
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,360
Oh, he's back at it again.

1331
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,800
Gotta be the best scene in the entire show, man.

1332
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,800
Where were those sex pulls in this song?

1333
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,800
Oh, we can't talk about it 'cause SAG is still on strike.

1334
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Oh. So we gotta delete the whole episode?

1335
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Delete the whole thing, man.

1336
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,800
Just put a frequency, though.

1337
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,800
Delete the whole episode, I don't give a motherfuck.

1338
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,800
Whoa, that's badass.

1339
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Yeah, keep saying it.

1340
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,800
Delete the whole ep, I don't give a motherfuck.

1341
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,800
Like, delete, ink my whole body.

1342
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,800
What? Remember that song?

1343
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,800
Delete your body?

1344
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,800
Delete my whole body.

1345
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,800
I turn into the potty, uh.

1346
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,800
You turn into a toilet?

1347
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,800
I'm the human toilet.

1348
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,800
This might be an exhausting episode to listen to.

1349
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,800
I'm the human toilet.

1350
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Nah, people like this shit. People are crazy.

1351
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,800
I guess I do. Somebody's gotta set this episode as a ringtone.

1352
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,800
Nah, I will.

1353
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,800
This is a good ringtone, actually.

1354
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,800
If a ringtone's not an hour long...

1355
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,800
Well, we're just talking over it.

1356
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,800
Yeah, we haven't rapped at all.

1357
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,800
JFK, assassinated with a giant bullet, some say.

1358
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,400
But I say that it was actually four bullets intersecting

1359
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,280
Doing dissecting of his head and directing

1360
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:17,280
There was a director there because I think the whole thing was a movie

1361
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:18,280
Yeah

1362
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:22,480
I think that it was a movie, I think Stanley Kubrick was in charge of it

1363
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,480
Or that's not his name, Stanley Kubrick

1364
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:27,000
I got a new brick that I built my house with

1365
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,960
And then I went back to take a shit

1366
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,000
At my new house, had a new toilet

1367
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,080
And then I had to drink my own spit

1368
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,720
'Cause I'm so damn thirsty

1369
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,400
Yep, hand me a shirt please

1370
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,880
Cause I gotta wipe up the spit that I spilled

1371
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,280
But I don't spill, I'm not a spiller

1372
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,920
I'm Ben Stiller

1373
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,520
Ben Stiller, Tropical Thunder

1374
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:45,520
Tropical Thunder

1375
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,760
(laughing)

1376
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:48,600
- Hey, wait a minute

1377
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,440
- Tropical Thunder

1378
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,480
- I saw a guy in the real world say that one time

1379
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,320
- Tropical Thunder?

1380
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,360
- I was in a bandia, a Russian bandia bath house

1381
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,200
- Wow

1382
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,080
- And these kind of off-duty cop type guys

1383
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,040
were sitting talking about movies

1384
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
He was like, "Dude, you gotta watch this movie

1385
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,080
called Tropical Thunder"

1386
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:03,920
- Damn

1387
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,740
- Now you said it

1388
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:05,960
- I watched it about five minutes to the beginning

1389
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,160
I watched all the ads today.

1390
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,460
Yeah, I'm making a thunder.

1391
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,260
You've never seen it.

1392
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,460
You need to plunder through a blockbuster to find this movie

1393
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,560
so you can muster up the courage to watch an R-rated movie

1394
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,060
and then go home and put on shoes, please.

1395
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:20,660
Have you guys battled each other yet?

1396
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,160
No, but I'm about to.

1397
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,460
Jack Fincher, you're going to kill your whole career.

1398
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,060
Yeah, you were in the bear.

1399
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,660
Didn't even see her anywhere in the movie or the show in the

1400
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,660
season 2.

1401
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,260
I thought the movie blowed.

1402
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,960
I thought it completely sucked.

1403
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:37,380
I think I don't give a fuck about movies or TV.

1404
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,100
Acting is not for me.

1405
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,300
I think that they should have made it about art

1406
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,040
instead of food, 'cause art is way better than food.

1407
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,100
You don't need food to live, only art.

1408
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:49,700
- What, am I supposed to respond to that?

1409
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:52,700
- That's rude, turn the beat up, that's rude.

1410
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:53,740
That's rude.

1411
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:56,260
Of course, you said, "Oh, we're battling?"

1412
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:58,660
And then I battle you and you don't even have the,

1413
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,660
you say, "Oh, what, am I supposed to respond to that?"

1414
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,980
That's fine. There's nothing I can do about it.

1415
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:14,060
But I didn't think of anything to do.

1416
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:19,980
What could you even say about me, man?

1417
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:25,100
Basically nothing that could be said about me and my feelings can't get hurt.

1418
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:30,620
Featuring Jack Benzinger sponsored by Icelandic glacial water.

1419
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,180
We got a case of that for free by the way.

1420
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:37,820
You fucking ball piece of shit.

1421
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,980
I'll come to your house and beat the fuck out of your dog and slit his fucking throat.

1422
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,220
Bitch, I don't even like you.

1423
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,900
I don't even fucking like you, man.

1424
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
I'll beat the shit out of you.

1425
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,900
That's right.

1426
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,900
I'm going to come and fucking kill you, man.

1427
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,900
I'm going to put a fucking knife and slice you up like tofu.

1428
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,900
Oh, I rhyme.

1429
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,900
There you go.

1430
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,900
Tofu.

1431
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:53,900
And guess what?

1432
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,740
Then I'm going to come to your house and kill you.

1433
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,780
And then I'm going to come to your house and I'm going to give you a big ass hug with a

1434
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,060
fucking knife that was going to be in my hand.

1435
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:04,980
And then, um, why'd you have to go?

1436
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:05,820
Why'd you have to make me?

1437
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:06,660
- Relax, it's a battle.

1438
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,780
- Instead of being violent, I wish you had been silent.

1439
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,620
- Yeah, don't be--

1440
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:14,460
- I wish your hat was violet, instead of this ugly-ass blue.

1441
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,460
It looks like poo.

1442
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:16,420
My poo is blue.

1443
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,580
I think poo is blue.

1444
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,500
That's 'cause all I eat is berries that are blue,

1445
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,520
and it makes my poo completely blue,

1446
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,580
and I think it's that color instead of brown.

1447
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,580
You should go ahead and move right out of town.

1448
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,560
Also, on your hat, there is a typo,

1449
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,580
and I think that you need lipo.

1450
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:30,420
- Damn, wait.

1451
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,500
- Change your name to Mico.

1452
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,020
Change your name to Mico.

1453
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,780
- All right, three versus one rap battle.

1454
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,620
You guys don't know who you just got into a battle with.

1455
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,220
It's me, 'cause I'm crazier than a (beep)

1456
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,540
with 600 bullion cubes on top of a castle.

1457
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:42,500
Now look at you.

1458
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,660
You, your name is Cameron.

1459
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,440
I just am so disappointed

1460
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,020
because you don't even remind me of a lantern.

1461
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:48,860
And look at you.

1462
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:49,980
Your name is Patrick.

1463
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,340
I'm gonna have to put you inside of the letter K

1464
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,300
'cause you're ketchup.

1465
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,700
And what's your name, Caleb?

1466
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,020
I already disrespected both of your friends,

1467
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:58,320
so now I'm putting you in the ground like cable.

1468
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,540
the way of a letter.

1469
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:06,580
You had a jumble. It's not really a freestyle. It's more of a jumble. I

1470
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:10,820
feel like I tried the rapper thing. It didn't quite work out. I might have to

1471
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,180
go back to acting, but they're probably not going to take me back after

1472
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,780
everything I said about the bear, so I might have to go into hiding sports

1473
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,220
sports. Okay, you're tall enough to play sports. I can do sports. You could

1474
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:23,060
fingerboard. I've seen you. I saw you earlier. I think

1475
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:28,940
you get sponsored by Black River Ramps.

1476
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:35,940
I feel like I have a, every time I come on this podcast, I say the first eighth of a

1477
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:36,940
word.

1478
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:37,940
It happens every time.

1479
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,940
Every time.

That's just...

1501
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,660
Don't spoil it at all.

1502
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,660
Stop spoiling it. That's the point of a teaser is you spoil it.

1512
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,640
kiss. I would say could I please have everybody direct their attention to

It's up as it will go.

1527
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,860
Um, okay, I just had some questions for you if that's alright.

1528
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:41,860
Um, do you guys pick up feces?

1529
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:45,860
Yeah.

1530
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:52,860
No, do you pick up human feces?

1531
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:56,860
Okay, what if I hide it in a bag?

1532
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:58,860
Like, will you check?

1533
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,860
They'll check that for human feces.

1534
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:05,860
How do you guys check that?

1535
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:11,860
He opens up the bag and he checks for that.

1536
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:13,860
*laughter*

1537
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,860
*laughter*

1538
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,860
Seems strange.

1539
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,860
*laughter*

1540
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,860
Uh...

1541
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,860
I think that's the end

1542
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,860
of the call, yeah.

1543
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,860
Yeah. And if you thought

1544
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,860
if you think... The driver will open the package

1545
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:31,860
and check for human feces, that's what

1546
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,860
that's apparently what *bleep*

1547
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:35,860
is going to do. I don't know if we should be saying

1548
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,860
their name, cause we just admitted that

1549
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,860
we could get... To prank call them? We could get

1550
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,220
here's in a lot of legal trouble.
