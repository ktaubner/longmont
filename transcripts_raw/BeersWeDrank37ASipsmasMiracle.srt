I'm trying to get that burp out.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,080
This is a journey into fears we drank

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,520
Fears we drank motherfuckers with Juvio Caleb and Rex Merry Cipsmas bitch

Yes, what brand new fucking intro with Eminem dog, yeah, wait

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,720
That's amazing news man guys welcome to 150th episode of beers we drank we're back again after a short

Snap it up for that. We have a correspondent who's on location in some part of Mexico doing I'm

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Guessing some kind of investigative reporting because there's so many things going on. I'm coming live from beer, Mexico

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,320
well, that's like tequila does the place where all the beer comes from and

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,600
You wouldn't believe the kind of fear they got in here. They got this weird beer. I don't know how to pronounce

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,020
Oh, I'm already about to be disappointed. Oh wait. No, it actually is a beer

20
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Oh, I thought you were supposed to take out a diet coke

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,140
Yeah, but they make it here Stella are twa. Yeah some sort of Alex

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:03,620
Citra I don't know. It's not such weird. Let me taste it from 1366 man put some respect on that

23
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,660
How do you fuck up a drink it was doing it was bubbling

24
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,620
That is just so late in the rifle and I love a stellar twang. All right, give me a rating man

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,900
That's a perfect seven out of ten

26
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay, finally a normal rating from you. Yeah, I like that guys

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,820
This I had I made a mistake

28
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,460
Made this mistake many times before and today's no different

29
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,500
I had my wife pick up my beer for me and she always gets me some she hates it. I do this podcast

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:52,500
is

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:01,300
tattooed pumpkin Bronx Brewing Co. Guys, this is a pumpkin ale. This is one of my least

32
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,120
favorite things on earth. I'm already halfway through it because Jubia took a long time

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,420
and I got thirsty. I'm going to take a sip.

34
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Yeah.

35
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,780
Okay. Honestly, I'm getting zero pumpkin off of this.

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Okay.

37
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:26,280
The can is very annoying to me, it's some kind of evil gourd with tattoos all over it.

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
It just tastes like an IPA.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,860
I'm going to give this a 5.9 out of 10.

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,520
And basketball?

41
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,480
This is like the third string shooting guard.

42
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,540
This is like a bench presence.

43
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,860
This is a vet, you know.

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,020
So actually, you know what, I changed my mind.

45
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,260
This is a development player.

46
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,980
This is somebody from overseas who played in EuroLeague basketball or something.

47
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,820
And they played a long time and they were just middle of the road.

48
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
Maybe a white guy.

49
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,060
This is a white guy.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,540
So whatever height comes along with that.

51
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,980
And I think there's a possibility that this guy could get better with some time in the

52
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,060
league.

53
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,980
But right now he's very middle of the road.

54
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Okay.

55
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,980
All right.

56
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,020
Well, now we go to our nun.

57
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
So I have...

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh, first roast of the podcast!

59
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,820
Wait!

60
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,100
You do look like a beautiful nun.

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,300
At first I thought you had a blouse on like a pirate.

62
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Well, this is...

63
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,740
Okay, hold on.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
This is my...

65
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,740
This is my...

66
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Your Team Liquid jersey.

67
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,220
This is my team liquid jersey

68
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,860
Hoodie that I bought right, uh that makes you look like you're a gun

69
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,940
How does it make you look at gundam

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,100
It makes you look like you're a gundam pilot. It looks like a bad power rangers

71
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,980
Uh hoodie. All right. I think it makes you look like you shop at uniclo man

72
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,460
I don't think it's doing much other than that

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Okay. Well

74
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,820
You're the penguin of 2023. I honestly don't want to say how much I spent on this. Anyway,

75
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:16,700
now you have to now you have to you should have said this $40. Oh, God, man. Oh, my God,

76
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:25,260
that is hurting me. I bought I brought from my fridge a another Bel Air sour. Okay.

77
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,300
A repeat beer. It is a repeat beer. I was going to go to the store. It's fine. That's I'm going

78
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,460
I'm gonna hold this up, but this is an L, but that's okay.

79
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,580
- So this is like an eight to me.

80
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,620
This is basically a perfect beer.

81
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,940
I could drink this all day.

82
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,540
It's delicious.

83
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
- A Bel Air sour.

84
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,220
So tell me how this differs from a normal sour.

85
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,180
- It doesn't make you feel bloated.

86
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,100
It doesn't make you feel like you're drinking

87
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,220
800 calories of beer.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,060
- Okay.

89
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,880
- It makes you feel like you're drinking

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,820
a normal amount of calories,

91
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,800
Because it's only 5.8%, so it's not like a sour monkey.

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,860
You could just sit and sip this on a warm day, on a cold day, for a job well done, to get

93
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
a job done, whatever you need.

94
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,340
It's a very versatile beer.

95
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,580
If you have no job.

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,420
If you have no job, you probably would be spending...

97
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,420
How much do these cost for a six pack, do you know?

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,580
I think it was like 12 bucks for a six.

99
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,100
Oh, that's not too bad.

100
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
That's not outrageous.

101
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,500
- Well, I would like to have an addendum

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,660
to the beer reviewing, now that we have a,

103
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,860
since we're having a repeat beer,

104
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,140
I would like to come in with something fresh,

105
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
something I don't have with me right now,

106
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,220
but I've just come back from New York

107
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,660
and I immediately left town, I'll get into that later,

108
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,820
and I tried my first Guinness, and my first St. Sal,

109
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,120
- But you have your first Guinness.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,260
- And my first, the Schieweck as well.

111
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,660
I had all those, and I can review them all

112
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,820
right here, right now, because I'm probably--

113
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,000
- Okay, yeah, no, these are three important beers to me.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,200
I love Guinness on Giraffe.

115
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,720
I had never had a Tsing Tsao before,

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,240
but that was an amazing beer.

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
And then what was the other one you said?

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
- The Zivek.

119
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
- A Zivek, yeah, that's a legendary beer in these parts.

120
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,960
- I will leave with the Zivek,

121
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,480
because I had it while we were doing

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,360
that You'll Have to Drink thing with Pat and Cam.

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
- Okay.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,280
- That is fully demonetized and censored on YouTube,

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
so I don't think that Vod's gonna ever see the light of day.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,960
- That's all right, man.

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,480
- I thought that was all right.

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,640
I really like the Zivek.

129
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,400
That's another like six, seven out of 10.

130
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,680
I really enjoyed my time with the Shivek.

131
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,780
I would gladly go back to it.

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,200
It was a great, it was really big.

133
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,820
It was a really big bottle.

134
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,600
And it was just great to drink it with friends.

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
- Yeah.

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,040
- I like it a lot.

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Second, we went to Chinatown with some friends.

138
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,160
We had some Chinese buns that were so delicious.

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,040
And I had my first Xing Cao.

140
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,740
And I thought maybe it was a little too much.

141
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,580
Because maybe we're not--

142
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,620
- Too much in what way?

143
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,220
- I don't know, I think the buns were just maybe so full.

144
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,860
- Yeah, that's not the kind of meal you need a beer after.

145
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,420
- Yeah, so I think in other circumstances

146
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,260
I would like this thing to sell more.

147
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,780
But in crushing it with a Chinese bun with it

148
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,540
was really not, it's time to shine,

149
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,460
so it's gonna go with a five for now.

150
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,300
- Okay.

151
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,720
- It may, I may change my rating

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,820
once I go back to Chinatown,

153
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,260
But it'll be that for now.

154
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,000
And lastly, my Guinness review.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I had some Guinness the last day in New York.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,860
I was hanging out with everyone at the bar.

157
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,260
- At Cozy, yeah.

158
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,860
That's where they have Guinness on draft.

159
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,240
- You left.

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,240
So it was me, Noah, Cam, Brian and Alex.

161
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,740
- And I was there too.

162
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,380
- And also Rex.

163
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,220
- Whoa.

164
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,580
I was on I've been you forget about your co-host. It's fine. No, it's fine

165
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:03,040
So Alex orders to get this for some reason and

166
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,780
He goes like oh no, I know how I get this. I was like, oh, that's funny me neither

167
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,300
So it's like oh, here you go. Take a sip and I took a sip and it was mid

168
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah

169
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,900
Okay

170
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,520
Okay, buddy, well you're gonna as somebody who lived in Boston for 26 months you're gonna have to explain yourself to me

171
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,840
It's been it's been said of the show before I don't fuck with dark beers

172
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,300
Light beers are where my heart's at and I thought you're a light supremacist. Yeah, I'm not gonna say that

173
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,940
He said yeah, you already said. Yeah, it's already confirmed. All right, I

174
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,540
Had a sip of Guinness. I didn't much like it or enjoyed it or find it interesting

175
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,300
So I was like, you know what that's enough for me. So in my eyes, that's a two

176
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,740
Wow, that is a strong anti-Irish sentiment.

177
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,680
Coming out of Jubio.

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,980
Coming out of the luchador himself.

179
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,660
That is, Guinness is an interesting beer because the first time I had it I also thought it was

180
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
disgusting.

181
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,100
The second time I thought it was even worse because I had it in a can and it just does

182
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,900
not translate well to a can.

183
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,100
And then I moved to New York after I had already long left Boston, I moved to New York and now

184
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,140
I enjoy Guinness.

185
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,520
And I think the reason I enjoy it is because I found out that it may seem like a heavy

186
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,260
beer because of the color and the texture, but it's actually, guys, it's one of the lightest

187
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,040
beers you can buy.

188
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:33,660
This is a beer that is like 4.2% and like 100 calories for a 12-ounce pour.

189
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,980
It just has this kind of malty taste that is, it kind of tricks you into thinking it's heavy,

190
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,980
but man, it's really not.

191
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
I don't know.

192
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,460
I didn't really, I'm going to fool through the parentheses.

193
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,020
It was just a sip, I didn't have a full beer.

194
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,100
- Okay, yeah.

195
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,500
- But even that, I was like, you know what?

196
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,700
I'm good, I tried it, I don't really think

197
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,180
I'm gonna like it.

198
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,100
So maybe I'll give another shot later on.

199
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
- What was the best drink you had while you were

200
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,340
in New York?

201
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,860
Not even, it doesn't have to be beer,

202
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,220
best alcoholic drink you had while you were in New York?

203
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,140
We had a lot.

204
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,140
- Okay, I think I'm gonna say the margaritaville.

205
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,220
- The margaritaville?

206
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,060
(laughing)

207
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:19,980
Margaritaville? Dude, the five o'clock somewhere at Margaritaville? We have to go through the

208
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,660
entire trip day by day. Okay. We're not gonna do that. We'll just talk about the legendary night.

209
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,740
What a legendary night. When we went to get sushi? Well, we started off with the most legendary night

210
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,220
start off at the M&M store. We went to the M&M store. We went to the M&M store. We had big plans.

211
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,020
Alex is not here, but you saw him last week. He bought a

212
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,420
Stupid amount of M&Ms. I don't think he finished him and he spent $35 USD on M&Ms

213
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:54,580
And I think he ate almost every single one. Okay, and while he in his five-day trip, which is crazy

214
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,780
Yeah, that's crazy

215
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,900
It was like a pound and a half of M&Ms little aside. It called them an M is real

216
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,620
No, it's a witness and he said it's true

217
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,660
moving on

218
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,140
We went to the M&M store

219
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,260
It was just a magical time where I think I was walking downstairs

220
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,620
Because we're always obviously we went all the way up and we're walking back down and I think I just like

221
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,240
Just need the fuck out of like someone's like bag or something and maybe like someone's child

222
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,920
And I just kept walking and the guy who was my victim. He just turns around and he goes

223
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,980
You say excuse me, buddy, and I just kept walking. That's racially motivated. Yeah

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,420
He could tell that you're from a place where they don't say excuse me. I didn't fuck with that

225
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,080
I just kept walking sour experience at the M&M store. Yeah, great

226
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,820
Thankfully after that we went we had we headed for that

227
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,940
Just the iconic New York slice at Times Square

228
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:56,540
Yeah, the worst one. I think I've ever had it was not great and it was also so expensive. Yeah

229
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,840
But and I burnt the fuck out of my mouth

230
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:07,440
So guys don't get a slice at Times Square also a sour experience next we turn it around

231
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,980
360 degrees walking walking and working away from it. Yeah fucking Margaritaville sixth floor

232
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,620
Guys when I tell you this is the best bar in New York City. I don't play about this shit. I'm up this this is my life

233
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,640
Okay, my life is fucking drinking. So this is the best bar in New York City, and it's not even close

234
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,640
This bar, you get on an escalator, it brings you up, who even knows how many floors this is.

235
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:40,640
Then you have to go to another, to an elevator to go up to the sixth floor.

236
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,640
And then you come out, perfectly dead bar.

237
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,640
They have thousands of drinks, all of them amazingly delicious.

238
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
They come out of a bottle, the guy doesn't make them at all.

239
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
They're insanely sweet, they're all blue.

240
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,640
And guess what happened to us guys?

241
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,680
we're sitting there and we look like also at the family

242
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,440
we look like a fucking family sitting there right over the picture for people

243
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
and if you want more proof that we look like a family to be proof

244
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,400
a guy walked up to us and said

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,280
do you guys want

246
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,240
a postcard a free christmas postcard

247
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
uh... free christmas card

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,040
done for you right now at margaritaville new york city

249
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,020
and we said by god i we do we really really do

250
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,980
So they got us together, brought out a DSLR, this is an expensive type of camera, and took

251
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
this photo.

252
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,340
Look at us guys.

253
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Look at us.

254
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,340
Look how happy we all are.

255
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,340
Look at me, man.

256
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,820
That's the happiest I've ever fucking been in my life.

257
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Oh my god.

258
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,820
Look at these drinks.

259
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,940
Look at the colors of these drinks.

260
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,860
Have you ever seen colors like this in a drink?

261
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,060
That was just, I mean, it was amazing.

262
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,420
There's no two ways about it.

263
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,020
That was the best bar experience ever.

264
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,620
i was great was so beautiful

265
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,720
it was fucking beautiful

266
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,140
and then

267
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,020
we will go ahead you you're telling the entire night uh... yeah

268
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,100
uh... after that

269
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,060
and i was before after that but we we have we'll head to the uh... to the tree

270
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,580
and was completely off because was november

271
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,980
yet we went to the thirty rocker to the rockefeller center tree

272
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,580
and it had not been turned on and people are still out taking photos of him i

273
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,420
think it was a very big

274
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,660
And there was a light show, there was a light show across the way done by some fashion house,

275
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Dolce and Gabbana or something.

276
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,100
I thought it was Dior, I forget.

277
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,500
Maybe it was Dior, whatever, it was one of these fancy brands.

278
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,100
It was really strange.

279
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,380
It was highly strange.

280
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,140
And guys, here's an example of how we've lost Christ in this country.

281
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,420
I remember seeing that the first time I went to New York City when I was 14.

282
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:48,220
I remember seeing that same light show and it was Christ, Mother Mary, Christmas trees,

283
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,300
snowflakes all sorts of wintery wonderland type uh... thanks this time

284
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,140
we go we sit in front of it

285
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,980
the light show begins

286
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,660
sagittarius

287
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,900
torus

288
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,940
aries

289
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,420
every kind of pagan symbol that one could imagine

290
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,540
a shamrock

291
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,540
blasted all over the downtown streets of new york city this is a disgusting

292
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,140
display

293
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,640
of atheism

294
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,480
in a way that i don't think should be allowed or legal

295
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,580
uh... in the state really didn't understand that like show that we look

296
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,700
at it for like a second or like a writer's kind of quick

297
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,220
was very boring is very loud

298
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,020
i really wish it seemed like they were taking advantage of people may be

299
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,500
checking to see if the tree was on

300
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,260
and remains they instead had their light show they said come look at this way

301
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,240
yet look look behind you

302
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,540
look at the so it

303
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,840
and that is the soft that puts in a sour mood but then

304
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,520
What happened next, Juvia?

305
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,760
- Dan, we had it, I don't know what the area's called,

306
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
but we went-- - The West Village.

307
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,120
- We went to the West Village,

308
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,560
and we went to this crazy cocktail bar

309
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,440
where you order a plant,

310
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,520
and they bring you a drink, basically.

311
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,920
- Guys, you order a plant,

312
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
and I know it seems like there may be

313
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,200
some kind of language barrier here

314
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,840
because of how he's describing it,

315
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,320
but I swear on my mother's future grave

316
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,600
that this is a bar where you walk in and you say,

317
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,640
"Give me the rosemary."

318
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,160
And they make a thing that tastes,

319
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,920
or that has something to do with rosemary.

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,960
And me, you know me, I'm a chocolate lover.

321
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,160
We had already gone to the M&M store,

322
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,680
but I didn't have my fill yet.

323
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,320
I got the cocoa nibs.

324
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,600
- Well, it was really funny because you ordered that,

325
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,280
and you didn't know, there was like a brown smear

326
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,160
on Caleb's glass.

327
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
- And I thought it was a leaf, y'all.

328
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,660
- And he thought it was, first he thought it was a leaf,

329
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,400
like some decoration stuff.

330
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,940
But then, approximately like 10 or 15 minutes

331
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,920
into us drinking our cocktails,

332
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,940
he just licks it and he goes like, "Oh, it's chocolate."

333
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,460
- It was chocolate and then I started using my teeth

334
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,060
in the fancy cocktail bar to scrape the chocolate

335
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,740
off of my $20 drink because I'm gonna get my money's worth,

336
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,580
man, it's that simple.

337
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,740
- Was it supposed to have chocolate in it or was it--

338
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,040
- Yeah, dude, it was Cocoa Nibs.

339
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,100
It was Cocoa Nibs, man, of course it's supposed

340
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,380
to have chocolate in it.

341
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,140
Was that my plant?

342
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,540
Yeah, that was the plant I ordered.

343
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,020
I ordered cocoa nibs.

344
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,620
Alex ordered pandan.

345
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,100
Noah ordered vanilla.

346
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,660
The vanilla was a complete milkshake for Christmas.

347
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,160
The vanilla was a milkshake.

348
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,540
But yeah, that was an amazing experience.

349
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,820
Avocado leaf because it was very delicious to me.

350
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,660
Yup.

351
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,180
It was basically a margarita.

352
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,260
It was the worst drink on the table,

353
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,100
I'm gonna be honest with you.

354
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,140
I liked it low key,

355
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,100
but I kind of liked the milkshake more.

356
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,340
It was a complete Christmas mood night type of thing.

357
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,340
It was, it was.

358
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,700
We were right next to the fire.

359
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,800
And then after that we leave, oh before that, I guess we can tell this, the Brian thing.

360
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,540
He goes to order like one oyster for each of us at the table and he goes like, "Oh, I'll

361
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,740
have this and I'll have five oysters."

362
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,100
And the waiter just like takes a beat and just like freezes up and she goes, "35?"

363
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,100
35?

364
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
I think I was like, "What?

365
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
35?"

366
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,100
She thought he ordered 35 oysters for the table.

367
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,580
He does his order again.

368
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,100
Five oysters and whatever drink.

369
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
And she goes like, "Oh, oh man."

370
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,620
She was like, "They were about to bring us 35 oysters.

371
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,460
They loved us so much that they were going to give us seven oysters ahead."

372
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,020
35 oysters would have been a crazy...

373
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,340
And this was before dinner too.

374
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
And had you ever had an oyster before?

375
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Nope.

376
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,620
What did you think of an oyster, man?

377
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
I liked it.

378
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
It's not bad.

379
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,660
I don't know when I would go back and order another oyster, but I liked it.

380
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,500
Well, when you're hungry.

381
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
But we'll get to that.

382
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Okay.

383
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,820
Where did we go after we went to Mace, the cocktail bar?

384
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,660
I think after we should let Rex take it over because this is when he joined the party.

385
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
That is true.

386
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:59,940
So I had been on an Adderall-fueled work binge leading up to a deadline, and I met them at

387
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,740
nine o'clock in ... Where was that?

388
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,900
part of the West Village still yeah West Village yeah to go to sushi Nakazawa

389
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,980
which is the zero dreams of sushi his son it's not his son it's his apprentice man

390
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,140
those are the princess well that is the same thing true because a master is a

391
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,860
father for life

392
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,700
Holy shit.

393
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,540
So it's a omakase restaurant.

394
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,740
So omakase is like a tasting menu for sushi.

395
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,380
They bring you like all these different types.

396
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,380
And it's $150 a person.

397
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
And did I pay?

398
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,380
No!

399
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Fuck no.

400
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,580
I didn't pay a dime, man.

401
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,140
Holy crap, I love my friends so much.

402
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,220
Yes.

403
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,300
And so we get there and they take us back to our table.

404
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,480
We are six young, disgusting men.

405
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,900
Everyone in this restaurant is like old money style New York.

406
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,020
Everyone's wearing a suit.

407
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
All the waiters were wearing suits.

408
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,060
All the people in there were wearing like comfortable, expensive clothes.

409
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:19,460
We got there and sat down and immediately a woman behind Alex started bawling, crying.

410
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,500
That's when you know you're in a fancy restaurant.

411
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,980
when somebody feels like they're when somebody's crying and they don't even

412
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,540
feel like they're making a scene yeah it's transcended the point of politeness

413
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,740
right yeah it's you know very small room maybe enough room for like 20 people

414
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,820
enough for them to notice that I was wearing a Nike hoodie to the yes he did

415
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:46,580
have they did pull Alex was wearing a paper jersey yeah most of us looked out

416
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:53,300
of place. Not me man. I had a nice cashmere sweater on. I looked amazing. So we, you know,

417
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,020
we get there and we're like, okay, so let's get some drinks. We open up the wine menu,

418
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,900
the drink menu, which is huge, like 30 pages long. And we just started scrolling through

419
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,060
it and being like, Ooh, this, this, this sake is $30,000.

420
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Yeah, they had a $17,000 sake.

421
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Wait, can we get the $17,000 sake?

422
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:25,060
I asked Brian if we could get it and I kind of, I 10% expected him to say, "Yeah man, let's do it."

423
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:31,060
But then we were like, "Okay, we'll get a cheaper Apollo sake," which is, you know, still expensive,

424
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
And then we'll get some beers.

425
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
And uh...

426
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,060
We all were like, "Can we have the Orion please?"

427
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,060
And the Japanese man in his suit was like, "Oh, the Orion."

428
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,060
- "Orion." - He said, "O-O-Rion."

429
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,060
- "Orion." Yeah, sorry. - Yeah, and I was like, "God damn it, man."

430
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,060
We've already-- we've been there five minutes, we've already been made into complete fools.

431
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,060
They gave us a rag that you're supposed to wash your-- supposed to wipe your hands with.

432
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Right? And I immediately put it on my face.

433
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,260
Like I was it like at a spa. I think you can write it. I think that was that'll mind if you do that

434
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,060
There's nothing wrong with that. I think they respect you do that

435
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,700
They put down like the the pickled ginger and then like a little wet map for your fingers

436
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,580
Yeah, and Caleb tried to pick it up with his chopsticks and be like is this food is this food?

437
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,980
Yeah, that was funny as fuck

438
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,940
So anyway, we finally start to get our sushi and it is amazing.

439
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,380
I don't even like sushi and that was-

440
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,660
It was divine, man.

441
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,020
Yeah, but it's also one of those meals where it's like,

442
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,740
you don't get- I was still kind of hungry after.

443
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,060
Really? I was stuffed, man.

444
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,380
20 pieces of like sushi is not that much.

445
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:57,400
Like that's that's like a full meal, but that's not like enough to last you for a day. Do you know what I mean?

446
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,420
No, you can't do Oh mad. You're not doing the oh, here's everything I hate doing one meal a day at sushi. Nakazawa man

447
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, you can't do that shit

448
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,260
I I'm just saying so for me I was like, you know, this is amazing

449
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,100
So they bring out, you know, it starts from

450
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,780
What did it start with was it was the salmon first? I think I don't know man. Yeah. Anyway, they bring multiple

451
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Yeah, they went salmon they went tuna they went

452
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,740
Eel they went all sorts of places

453
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,820
We went to every single part of the ocean

454
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,760
Yeah in a way that I was we went to parts of the ocean that I didn't think I was comfortable with I'm gonna be

455
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,160
Real they pulled out something called umi or ubi or doogie and this shit looked this shit looked like dookie

456
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,180
This actually looked like orange baby diarrhea sitting on top of a bed of rice and I thought that I was being pranked

457
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,760
I thought it was it was a what would you do kind of thing where it's like if a sushi restaurant served you a baby

458
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,300
Shit on a piece of rice. Would you eat it?

459
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:02,060
And then it turns out I would eat anything one funny thing was Brian ordered caviar and then you

460
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,540
Joined it like let me get the caviar

461
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:12,540
I had a little tiny bowl covered in gold flakes and I shared it man. He did share it cuz I'm a real one

462
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,320
And I the only other time I'd ever had caviar is some guy brought it to a birthday party and it was piping hot

463
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,660
And I told him I got a lot of satisfaction and telling him that I thought it was really disgusting

464
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,740
and

465
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,700
This time though. It was undeniable caviar rich people. You have amazing taste keep eating this. Yeah

466
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:38,260
It was it was kind of cool because they had multiple waiters because they have to like bring each individual course out

467
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,300
Yeah, it was like a Japanese man wearing like a grand Seiko

468
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,820
Middle-aged Japanese woman and then like a black nerd

469
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,060
Like a guy that is very clearly just into anime. Yeah

470
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,620
He's into sushi, man

471
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,920
Go sushi. Yeah, but yeah, so she and anime

So my man, yeah, I just watch episode 2 of the persona for animation. Yeah, but then a month

473
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:09,100
Right. It's big. I'm on my second. It's been a month and a half and I've watched two episodes of anime

474
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,740
It was done and I'm starting to like this shit, man

475
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,180
It was it was very good anime is dope, you know

476
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:23,960
Sushi, so it's fun to watch but uh eating sushi is more fun. I would say eating sushi is amazing guys

477
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,540
Today I went to the gym with

478
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,920
Patrick Doran no way. I went to the gym with Patrick Doran. It was amazing

479
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,020
Not that much to tell just teach him how to work out

480
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,820
But Noah also went to the gym today and he texted me about an hour ago and said that he was in the locker room

481
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:49,500
After, um, after working out, he did a back day and he was like, kind of checking out

482
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
his pump, right?

483
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,800
Nothing wrong with this.

484
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,420
This is what men are supposed to do in the gym.

485
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,060
Arnold said this, you're supposed to always be posing between sets.

486
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,060
But he's sitting there checking out his back and a guy walks in and says, looking good

487
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,580
man.

488
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,940
And Noah says, thank you, bro.

489
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,340
And then the guy says this, we all start somewhere.

490
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
*laughter*

491
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
How fucked up is that man?

492
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Me and Hillbill texted about this for 30 minutes.

493
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
What the who the fuck says that?

494
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
That's crazy!

495
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
That guy better have been the most ripped gentleman alive.

496
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Why was he ripped?

497
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
I didn't even ask dude.

498
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,340
I was so pissed off.

499
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I was at the dog park.

500
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
I was seeing fucking red for my friend.

501
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,340
Can you FaceTime him and ask him if he was ripped?

502
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,340
I'll text him right now.

503
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
I'll text him right now if he was ripped.

504
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,620
is ripped that's fine it's still rude but it's fine but if he if he was like a big

505
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,580
fat guy but like you know functional strength construction worker fat guy

506
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,300
it's so funny to be like to like don't do not lead with the rude thing to be like

507
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,500
really nice and just be like oh yeah yeah kill yourself yeah dude I mean it's

508
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:05,580
not that bad what about a criticism sandwich whatever happened to that you

509
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,980
You look good, we all start somewhere, but I started even before that.

510
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Say something like that.

511
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
Right.

512
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,860
Or, "I wanna fuck you, man."

513
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,780
That maybe as a sandwich would have worked.

514
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,780
Honestly, I thought that was going to be a gay sex story.

515
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,820
I think if you say thank you to a compliment, you have to accept that the person that you're

516
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,620
saying thank you to is going to...

517
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,700
They get to make a rude comment about it.

518
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,100
They have full, they're fully in control.

519
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,700
The second that you, that you, um,

520
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,900
Thank, thank you to a compliment comes from a position of power. Right. Right.

521
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,180
If I say, Hey man, that's a great hat. You don't look bald today.

522
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,500
Thank you, man. Yeah. See, but now you up to say whatever you want.

523
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,900
Exactly. You have the goodwill of the compliment.

524
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,700
You have a plus 30 buff to getting away with anything that you say now.

525
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,680
Yeah.

526
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:08,580
Like, imagine if the guy had just walked in and said, as Noah's posing, "We all start somewhere."

527
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,080
That would have been next-level rude.

528
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,580
Right?

529
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,780
That's just straight-up rude.

530
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,180
But that would have been the kind of rude where it's like, "Okay, we can just fight about this."

531
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,580
But the fact that the guy said, "Looking good, man. We all start somewhere."

532
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,980
That is like, "How am I gonna fight this guy? He just said I look good."

533
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,780
Yeah.

534
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,380
He may have wanted to take Noah under his wing to make him a big buff guy.

535
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,580
I think he wants to.

536
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
Thank you, but

537
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:39,740
Something Noah says slightly but like guy who just worked out on cable machines only with gloves for 20 years kind of jacked

538
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,140
He sounds mad to me. I'm gonna be honest. Oh, that is so he sounds pretty sounds mad

539
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,700
It sounds like this guy was fucking yoked this guy

540
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,300
Yeah

541
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,560
So that's a leech a guy being like I remember when I cuz I okay when I was in college. I had a friend who

542
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,260
he was like a

543
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:03,540
Special Forces guy and we would hang out on my porch and smoke cigarettes because he couldn't smoke in his apartment

544
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:11,400
and I remember like he was obviously just you know, fucking jacked like six four like massive and then I remember one day

545
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,700
I was wearing like a long-sleeve shirt. He's like, hey, man, that's like a nice shirt

546
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,340
You know, like I remember when I used to have your exact body

547
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:26,020
It's like okay man sure, you know that gave you some hope no it did

548
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,820
But that's the thing rip guys love to be like I remember when I look like that and then it took me another two years

549
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
To get where I'm at now

550
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:42,060
So as you read I don't think he also guys who were at the gym were retarded so you have to accept that

551
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,140
He probably didn't mean it to be rude. I'm rocking with guys

552
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,900
like wants to be like a

553
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,540
Like a bodybuilder like when he's still like 17

554
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,940
What do you mean me?

555
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
No, you were you like that?

556
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,720
When I was 17, I wanted to be a powerlifter. I wanted to be like an Olympic. I wanted to be like a

557
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,660
350 pound guy who could deadlift 1200 pounds. That's what I wanted

558
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,500
I did not care about I used to work here's this is a very funny thing about if anybody does weightlifting

559
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,600
They'll understand how funny this is when I was in college

560
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,540
my

561
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:28,000
My weightlifting maxes were I could squat 405 I could deadlift 505 and I could bench

562
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,620
125

563
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,820
Because I did not give a fuck about like trying to look good at all

564
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,740
I just wanted to and I would eat like 4,500 calories a day

565
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:44,080
That's so awesome, what did you what kind of music was in the headphone

566
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,640
With roughly I remember yeah

567
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
*laughing*

568
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
*laughing*

569
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,640
*laughing*

570
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
*laughing*

571
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
*laughing*

572
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
*laughing*

573
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
*laughing*

574
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
*laughing*

575
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
*laughing*

576
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
*laughing*

577
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
*laughing*

578
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
*laughing*

579
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
*laughing*

580
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
*laughing*

581
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,900
That might be the worst song ever and I was like damn there's some real shit right now

582
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,340
I really got to tackle my shit right now

583
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,380
Yeah, he says to the worst music ever or I would listen to to WTF with Mark Maron

584
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,760
while lifting

585
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,760
While lifting. Yeah, that's

586
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,040
When the Obama podcast came out and stuff like probably before that or maybe around then

587
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,740
Yeah, it was like I'd be like, oh shit man. TJ Miller just went on WTF. I gotta hit the gym

588
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Oh man, that's awesome.

589
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,740
It was amazing. Yeah. And now I'm getting everybody into the gym.

590
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Everybody started going to my exact gym now. And it's basically the biggest blessing ever.

591
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,740
Hold on, my dog's barking. I need to put him away. Give me a sec.

592
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,740
He's going to put him down. Julio, have you ever lifted weights? Have you ever been to a gym?

593
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,740
I went to a gym recently, but no,

594
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,740
I've never really lifted anything, no.

595
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,220
I

596
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:21,740
Try like my thing is I'll have like a moment where I'm like getting fat. I'm out of shape

597
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,300
I should get fit and then I'm like

598
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:32,220
All right time to just go as hard as possible and then keep going from there. Don't warm up

599
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,900
Don't do anything hurt myself immediately

600
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,660
Just like the worst thing you could possibly do people say that but I was you know, I was teaching

601
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,080
Patrick how to do weightlifting today and I think that I was taking it way too slow

602
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,920
I had him do a deadlift with a five-pound dumbbell like

603
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:55,300
And I was doing it I was like, I think I'm being a little too cautious about injury

604
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:01,420
But it is a little bit like if somebody first comes to the gym for the first time and they hurt themselves instantly

605
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:08,100
They're never gonna go again. Yeah, so you have to really ease them in and nobody knows how to do anything at first

606
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,100
So it's like, you know

607
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,420
What do you think?

608
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,820
Did he like it? I think he basically fell in love with it. I

609
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,920
Think I will say we got we got on the treadmill and we were doing like an incline walk

610
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,160
And I the heart rate monitor thing had to be broken because we were doing the incline walk in my heart

611
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,080
We were doing the same speed or he was doing a little less than me and my heart rate was like

612
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,860
151 on average and his heart rate I looked over it was a hundred and ninety-five

613
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,560
Like for his age like the absolute maximum that your heart can go

614
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,800
So there's no way that that's that it has to be a faulty thing. Yeah, I don't think that's

615
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,720
That might be real it might that's a thing. I really was questioning

616
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,540
I didn't bring it up because I didn't want him to be freaked out

617
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,300
I'm sure he has no idea like the max heart rate is but

618
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,620
Yeah, man, it was fun, dude. We got to get you to in the gym going crazy. Yeah, I remember

619
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,200
Do you wear like like the fitness bands of anything like that like like a fit Apple watch?

620
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,920
Yeah, I have an Apple watch that Cameron's fiance sold me for like 25 bucks, but it's the first version

621
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,420
So it doesn't do anything except basically track your heart rate

622
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,840
So I do that I and I remember to charge it maybe every tenth time I go to the gym

623
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:34,040
Yeah, one of my favorite things about those is they'll like try and tell you how many calories you burned like exercising

624
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,260
Yeah, and it's always so funny how wrong it is. Yeah, it will say that you burned like

625
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,060
4,000 calories doing a run for 20 minutes. Yeah, I remember I had to come off of DDR and it'd be like you burned

626
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,760
700 calories in the last hour and I'm like that is

627
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,360
Really can't be true

628
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,600
It's like

629
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
the Apple stuff like really like

630
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,320
Lenient with the how many steps it counts for you. Like I think it's

631
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:09,840
Fuckin hope not dude, cuz I'm getting like 15k steps a day and I feel this is a huge point of pride in my life

632
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,380
Right. So if that is wrong, then I have to rethink a lot of things that I tell people

633
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,920
I think it might be wrong. I think you should look into like getting in

634
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,600
Just like if you walk like two miles, that's like 10,000

635
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,100
No, I think five miles is 10,000

636
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,100
Depends on how big your step is. Well, I take little tiny. Yeah, I do like a Dexter's

637
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,720
laboratory style

638
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,380
Mr. Mr. Krabs, did you think that's how I walk? I think huge steps

639
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,200
Yeah, yeah, so if you're striding that's like you're not gonna get your steps in

640
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:53,000
Let's see. I will yo coat because he takes big steps. Yeah, that's why he gets 300 steps a day

641
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Right is cuz the big steps his steps are so big

642
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,320
I probably I'd say I walk probably a mile and a half round trip to the dog park a day

643
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,020
Two miles round trip to the office every day and a mile round trip to the gym every day

644
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:15,020
So it's like five miles or something booth if I go do it one extra thing I get to about 15,000 steps, right?

645
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,000
Yes, I feel fine about

646
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,100
But I don't believe anybody who says that I don't understand how people like lose weight by like

647
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,460
Walking for an hour a day that makes no you must be eating nothing if you're doing that

648
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,160
Yeah, like my grandpa lost like 50 pounds walking for an hour a day

649
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,400
If you go from doing nothing to something you will like lose a little bit of weight. I

650
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,560
Guess you're right like walking. It's like yeah, you just maintain because you burn calories, you know, I

651
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:52,980
Really I need to stop recently. I've started getting back into I got a stop it man

652
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,260
I've started getting back into candy

653
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:01,660
Which is bad, I've never bought candy I know

654
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,660
Okay, I bought here's what happened man

655
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,220
Halloween came around right and a month ago

656
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,260
Yeah, so I did it's been a month-long love affair with candy

657
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,940
Here's what I had to do the other day man all those M&Ms that I bought from from the M&M store

658
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,580
Which was the first time buying adult candy was buying M&Ms at the M&M store

659
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,500
Adult candy as an adult. I bought the M&Ms. I came home. I would eat six M&Ms every day

660
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,140
This is how fucking psycho I am about this kind of thing

661
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,420
I wouldn't let myself have more than six M&Ms, but I would always have six M&Ms

662
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,220
I did this for like one week and then I was like

663
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:46,900
I like ate six M&Ms and walked away from the pantry and did this I went and

664
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,100
then walked back to the pantry and threw away all of the M&Ms there's probably a

665
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,420
hundred fifty M&Ms left. You could have just given them the jam. No dude no I

666
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,300
can't have them dude I had to throw them away that's how much because I can't

667
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,660
control myself in more than I have one moment of self-control and with that one

668
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
I threw it away!

669
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,660
6 M&Ms is 100 calories when it's the brownie fudge M&Ms!

670
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,660
I can't be affording an extra 100 calories for no reason? I should eat 3 apples!

671
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,660
Those are really fire.

672
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,660
That's so funny.

673
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,660
So now I'm trying to change it around, now I'm switching out my candy for pineapple.

674
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,660
And today I've had 1 and a half pineapples.

675
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Just addicted to peanut butter.

676
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,060
I'm drinking these little naked juices. That's my sweet.

677
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,060
There we go, see that's fruit.

678
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
This is good man.

679
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Yeah, 140 calories.

680
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,060
That's good to have.

681
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,340
And then maybe probably 900 calories of like goldfish.

682
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,780
The snacks will kill you man.

683
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,620
The snacks are the worst.

684
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,860
The snacks will destroy you bro.

685
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,820
I also had to throw away my plantain chips.

686
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,820
Damn.

687
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,780
Because there were both of them?

688
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,780
No dude.

689
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,140
Because I love them so much.

690
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,140
I fucking love plantain chips. Salt and vinegar plantain chips are my favorite thing on earth.

691
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
You love them too hard.

692
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,140
And I love them too hard.

693
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
There's potassium in them, it's good for you.

694
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,140
Dude, it's fucking fried potatoes basically.

695
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
A plantain is a fucking potato.

696
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
No, it's a banana, isn't it?

697
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140
No, it's a different thing.

698
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,140
It's basically, in terms of carbs, it's the same nutritional profile as a potato basically.

699
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,140
So it's just a potato chip.

700
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
You ever seen a fat Irish person?

701
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,140
Yes!

702
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Yeah, a podcast with one. Never mind.

703
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,140
What are you talking about?

704
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
What the fuck are you talking about?

705
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,140
I've never seen a fat Irish person.

706
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Cam went to Ireland and came back and said that he was the fattest people he's ever seen in his life.

707
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,140
These people are, these people have the worst diet.

708
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
He said they eat Thanksgiving every meal.

709
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,140
This is not...

710
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Of course fat Irish people are fucking fat.

711
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Oh wait, my Thanksgiving review.

712
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Oh yeah, first Thanksgiving.

713
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,140

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,820
much just Christmas we do like the just a big dinner on Christmas usually yeah

719
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,380
That is sad as fuck because Thanksgiving is the best holiday.

720
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,380
The green spaghetti.

721
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,740
You should just come to New York every Thanksgiving.

722
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,380
I want to eat the green spaghetti, I still haven't had this shit.

723
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,380
I'll try it.

724
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,020
We'll see how it goes.

725
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,420
I really, I'm kind of shaken up by my experience with CVP.

726
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,420
They don't really fuck with me so much.

727
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,500
Oh yeah, yeah, you got kind of yelled at by Border Patrol.

728
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,180
I'm trying not to take three trips to the US every single year maybe.

729
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,380
Maybe we'll just lay back to two and one road trip

730
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,100
Maybe we'll do

731
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,140
Thanksgiving in Mexico next year

732
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,800
That's right, and you can cook us all sorts of Mexican food

733
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,860
Okay

734
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,980
Chili reeno. That's my dad's favorite thing. I

735
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,260
I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't really fuck with that, but yeah, we can do that

736
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:23,400
But you're gonna make it for my dad man. He's coming. It's coming. Yeah, bitch. Okay. I'm bringing Dave

737
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,580
Everyone can bring a family speaking of family and festivities. Can I ask you about Phil's birthday?

738
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:40,240
Yes, I had a birthday party for my dog and yes Rex didn't come you didn't invite me

739
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:49,940
You I thought I invited you that's on me I was I literally was planning to get mad at you for not coming on this

740
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,740
I forgot

741
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,420
Low key. Well, hang on from what I saw from the Instagram stories

742
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,000
I thought it was some sort of like you can only come if you have a dog or deal. Nope. Nope

743
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,200
It was just feeling clancy Rex definitely could have come. I thought he was in the group chat that I texted about it

744
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,880
I guess not. Oh, yeah. No, I'm not

745
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,420
Well, all right. Well, you can come to his birthday next year, you know by God's grace that he lives that long

746
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,920
You're gonna eat guys

747
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,740
50 M&Ms Phil turned two years old y'all

748
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:29,180
He'll turn two years old man. This is a big milestone for a dog. That's 14, dude

749
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,600
Feelings are starting to bubble up in his stomach for different girl dogs

750
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,240
And he can't act on them because his balls have been obliterated

751
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,500
His penis is about a quarter of the size that it once was he's not gay anymore

752
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:46,340
Nope, he's really he's lost his gay impulses. Damn. I

753
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,540
Can't believe I didn't you weren't invited Rex

754
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,220
I think I brought it up last night. I was like, yeah and Rex couldn't even fucking respond to the

755
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:09,160
Yep, that's just the kind of guy I am yeah not very conscientious, but that's okay

756
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:17,820
Well, I forgot you lived in New York cuz I haven't seen you in so long damn I

757
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,980
Don't have a chance of that. I'm busy. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he's too busy

758
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,220
He moves to New York and he doesn't and where all of his friends live and instead of seeing his friends

759
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,180
He doesn't see his friends guys. You know what the hell is wrong with him?

760
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,060
The thing is you have you have SNL hours, you know, they always say I

761
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:45,180
Think your microphone cut off. Yeah, what's the no it didn't bitch. It's 10. No, it didn't you fucking bitch

762
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,320
And it's back right? Yeah, that's amazing

763
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,180
Listen, you have SNL hours, which means you work until 4 in the morning, right?

764
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,180
You work like 6 p.m. To 4 in the morning if you woke up at 7 and you worked until 5

765
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,720
You'd live a normal life. I would I'm trying I uh, I

766
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,140
actually set myself back worse because I was working like 11 to 8 and

767
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:18,940
Now I'm waking up at like 2 30 in the afternoon. Yeah, that's terrible man. It's horrible. It's horrible because it gets like

768
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,840
Dark out at 430. Yeah, you need to wait you need one night or one day

769
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,340
You just need to wake up at 7 a.m

770
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,040
And then you'll keep doing that as long as you don't stay up too late after that

771
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,920
You just need to make yourself wake up at 7 1 day

772
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,020
730 on

773
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:41,720
It is fun Wednesday, and then I took a nap and just completely fucked it

774
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,220
Yeah, I've been having really scary napping dreams recently

775
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,340
I've been napping a lot and it's been putting me into a dream world where I had to explain

776
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,660
a fluffernutter sandwich to somebody in my dream last night.

777
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:01,660
A fluffernutter sandwich, it's marshmallow fluff and nutter, which is peanut butter.

778
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,100
And it is an amazing sandwich.

779
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,620
Well, you don't need to put the banana on, I don't really do the banana.

780
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,580
Did you talk about my crazy dream that I had while I was sleeping on Kim's couch?

781
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,140
Please tell me, man.

782
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,100
- Well, it's not very much to tell,

783
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:20,020
but it was both Patrick and Cameron were in my dream,

784
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,040
and they were both speaking perfect English,

785
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,060
perfect Spanish.

786
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,100
- Okay.

787
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,180
- It was just so crazy to me,

788
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,180
and then I don't think anything happened.

789
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,140
They were just talking to me in Spanish.

790
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,060
- Oh wait, that's interesting.

791
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,000
Do you ever have dreams in English?

792
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,500
- I don't think so.

793
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,500
I don't really--

794
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,700
- Wow.

795
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,940
- All your dreams are in Spanish?

796
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,660
- I don't remember dreams often,

797
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:46,260
So I wouldn't really tell you I just remember that because I woke up and in campus couch

798
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,560
And I was like that is so crazy. This couch is giving me powers. I think

799
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,980
Dream about your friends. Yeah guys

800
00:46:52,980 --> 00:47:00,840
Honestly Cameron and Patrick have been in at least three of my dreams every week for probably four years at this point. Yeah. Yeah

801
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:05,960
That's how much I'm thinking about these two and it's always us at a water park

802
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,320
It's never like how dreams are sometimes or something scary is happening

803
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:16,800
It's always us at a restaurant or us doing a roller coaster or something. It's never a bad dream with these two

804
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,320
highly recommend

805
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,520
You two on the other hand every night is a nightmare with you two in it

806
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:30,240
The complete evil versions of my other two friends. It is true. We are the evil versions of came and Pat

807
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,080
Yep, you look kind of bizarre world versions of them

808
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Yes, you are fully yeah, so you have the size where Patrick is the big one

809
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,440
That's you Juvio and Rex is the small Cameron. Yes

810
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,880
It really is scary that I keep finding myself surrounded by two guys that look exactly like

811
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,640
Them do you think you're Mario?

812
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,680
Do I think you know, this is a question I've thought about a lot

813
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,940
(laughing)

814
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:10,120
- No, no, I couldn't be Mario.

815
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,960
- Yeah, I think so.

816
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,920
- Why couldn't be Mario?

817
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,160
'Cause Mario's too, I'm too stoic to be Mario, man.

818
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,520
Mario wears his heart on his sleeve.

819
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,840
When he gets lava on his bum,

820
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,800
he runs around and goes, "Ai, ai, ai."

821
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,280
Me? - You do something like that.

822
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,000
- I wouldn't even tell anybody if I had lava on my bum.

823
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,840
- You're kind of Bowser to me.

824
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,520
- Thank you, man, thank you.

825
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
You have the statue of a football.

826
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,520
is

827
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,360
You're a fucking Goomba, man.

828
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
I think you are a Goomba.

829
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Racial slurs, I mean.

830
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,200
I think it, the more I'm thinking about it, you are a full Goomba from the ground.

831
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
From the ground?

832
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,400
That's where they're from, man, they pop out of that shit.

833
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Yep.

834
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
And Jubio is completely-

835
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,120
Then why, when they go back into the ground, do they die?

836
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,200
Well they get squished, but nice try, man.

837
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,480
Well if they come from the ground, they should be able to go back into it.

838
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,520
Okay, I'm not gonna argue with a Goomba, man.

839
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
Shut up.

840
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,520
(laughs)

841
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,420
- Juvio is Petey Piranha.

842
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,960
Silent, but big.

843
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,120
- And his breath is low-key fire.

844
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,000
- Yep, yep, straight up.

845
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,280
I mean, everybody has a full Mario crew

846
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,080
if they look around hard enough.

847
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,960
- Yeah, yeah, everyone's got the Mario.

848
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,520
- When are they gonna make another WarioWare game?

849
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,720
- They just did.

850
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,120
- Oh, well, that's amazing news.

851
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,120
I don't know, they just did one like last, I think two weeks ago.

852
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,620
Where are they gonna go with these?

853
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,120
You already, in the old ones you could already pick a man's booger.

854
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,120
I think it's time to kill off the Switch.

855
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
That's my idea.

856
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
That's my take.

857
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
Okay.

858
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Can I also do what with it?

859
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,120
Let's enter the gaming corner for a minute.

860
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
I think I agree.

861
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,120
The Switch has been out for what, 10 years?

862
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,120
Yep, basically.

863
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
Almost?

864
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Since 2015 or something?

865
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Mario Kart 8 is 10 years old, basically.

866
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Yeah, that's crazy. I

867
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,440
I bought a switch in like

868
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:16,160
2018 maybe and it was I'd already felt it felt so old then yeah, I like I couldn't believe I was like fuck

869
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,440
They're about to come out with another one as soon as I get this shit

870
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,520
Didn't happen man. It will never

871
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,240
Didn't fucking happen. They should make a new switch. There's this is

872
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Switch to work consoles. And by the way, this is this is the new wave. This is a new way

873
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,360
You're addicted you're addicted to your big phone with joysticks

874
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,940
I

875
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,300
Can't believe that I funded this habit. Yes

876
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,000
Like two full days just like

877
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,680
Just a setting up emulators

878
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,840
I'm just I I have a I have a switch with Mario Kart 8 and like all the DLC and

879
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,620
I just like got it all from and I've been playing it on the plane and on the bus

880
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,240
Like you wait you been you've been playing us a hacked switch. Yeah, basically, that's bloody illegal

881
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,080
I mean this man is admitting to crimes. There's no wonder Border Patrol doesn't want to fuck with you

882
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,640
man, fuck what a patrol

883
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,840
Don't say that shit. Don't say that

884
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:24,040
Yeah

885
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,420
Yeah

886
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,420
Just say I respect

887
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:37,800
Authority, I police. Yeah Cartman style. I thought I thought that maybe I would end up buying a steam deck

888
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,620
But then I realized that there's nothing that I would ever want to play on it that I wouldn't just want to play

889
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:47,620
I don't travel. I mean, I guess I travel a lot. But when I travel I just look at my phone

890
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,380
Well, you just want to play Valorant is the problem

891
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,920
Exactly or one indie game a year

892
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,840
But I don't need a steam deck to play that if I want to play the outer wilds

893
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,960
I'm not gonna play that on which by the way amazing game if anybody hasn't played it

894
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:08,880
Run don't walk you haven't played the outer wilds man. Maybe I'll play it on this dude. Do you like fucking?

895
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Existential bullshit

896
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,160
Wait, you love the thing instead of game. Yes

897
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
I'm gonna get into the video

898
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,700
With Kim, dude, I I don't I'm not fucking with the I the only games

899
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:31,840
I like are competitive shooters and like walking simulators that you make your girlfriend play to get into video games. That's it

900
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,560
I only like Valorant and dear Esther CS go and what remains of Edith Finch. I

901
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,080
like I like

902
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,920
fucking

903
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
overwatch -

904
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,840
And gone I'm just about to say and gone home

905
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,760
I couldn't think of another competitive shooter, but I do like gone home man

906
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:59,140
That's the only kind of thing I like but I also recently I'm starting to get into games that are scary in a way

907
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,440
That it's different from other games

908
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:08,320
I've started to get into games where you open it up. You start playing it and you're like, this is interesting

909
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,320
This is a bit weird and then it turns out that it's a haunted game. Are you familiar with this kind of game? No

910
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:29,960
and

911
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,680
games. How do I find it?

912
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,800
YouTube videos, man.

913
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,760
Yeah, I watch YouTube videos.

914
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,680
It called the scariest game ever, and it's two and a half hours long.

915
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,560
That's what I watch when I do the dishes.

916
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,240
There should be a game that says, boo, what's

917
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,640
what's more baby behavior?

918
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,800
Just watching how a video essays and get influenced by them

919
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,840
or just playing the same racing games they used to play on the PS2.

920
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,480
Probably the YouTube video when racing games are fun.

921
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:05,140
I used to play I just played dirt three or dirt four. I just played dirt before I

922
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:11,340
Used to play it way back in my WTF with mark Barrett era what was happening in dirt for I

923
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,500
used to play dirt three and

924
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,460
Listen to WTF with mark Baron. I'd probably play that for six and a half hours a day

925
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:26,480
That's not like what tribes ascend was out. I would only ever play tribes ascend and dirt three, you know

926
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,480
I'm almost tribes ascend and fucking she played rocket League. I

927
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,960
Played a little bit of rocket League never got that into it because I always played with mouse and keyboard

928
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,220
So we should get into that we should we should make a team which makes this you can't turn the rocket League. I'm down. Yeah, I

929
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,560
Feel like it's something I'd be good at I'm good at sports good at every single sport. I've ever played

930
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:51,920
It is hard the way that they they do when they do flips and they like meet the ball in there

931
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
Yeah, a lot you lost me man

932
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,400
The amount of times I've done that and just like kind of slap the ball down with no speed whatsoever

933
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,560
Yeah, just kill it. Yeah

934
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,080
It's pretty depressing when the thing is man

935
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,960
I've

936
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,880
competitive games have kind of been ruined for me by playing one that I'm good at because the idea of somebody like me entering a

937
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,520
Competitive lobby who's like really bad at a game like Rocket League. I just know that I'm pissing people off and actually ruining their nights

938
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,320
Well, you can do 1v1s. There is competitive 1v1. Yeah

939
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,600
Which is really yeah, oh, that's smart. Yeah, so that's what we're making a team

940
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,260
So we just piss each other off and we're like you are really bad at this game and we stopped playing it after one night

941
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,840
Yeah, cuz the most you can play is with up to three people

942
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:43,500
But I played the the hoops version. I probably put 200 hours. I hate that's such a stupid game mode

943
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,040
I love just basketball version. Yeah. Yeah, it sounds fun. Yeah, it was awesome. It's not fun

944
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,000
There's a tip-off

945
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,460
Yeah, that makes more sense to me because I don't fuck with soccer much man. Yeah soccer is gay I am from America

946
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:06,580
You guys need to open your hearts to new experiences. I wish I could hit a ball to the goal. That was far away

947
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:13,760
Oh, I wish I could kick a ball. That's so far. Okay. Wait, is that way are you being sorry in this impression?

948
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,920
Are you being a guy playing soccer is like I wish I could kick a ball

949
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:23,260
Yeah, I think he just does it man. I think that's the whole game

950
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,040
I wish I could

951
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,200
It's not boring using fucking a third of your body to play a game stupid

952
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,440
You should either use 1% of your body

953
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,160
I agree hands or all of your body you guys need to get into the rugby down there in the south. Yeah, I

954
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,280
think

955
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,280
people like like

956
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,840
Like school like American football

957
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:51,720
Like University like college American football rather

958
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,920
Do they play it in at Mexican universities? Yeah

959
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,000
Really?

960
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's just like two teams

961
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
In my town have any of those guys ever gone to the NFL. I think one of them

962
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,360
Over like one case, but I don't I don't remember his name. I can look it up later

963
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:21,540
But yeah, it has that been before but it's really it's not like big enough for it to like be an actual professional league

964
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,680
But it's a college like sports that some people follow

965
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:33,000
Wow college football really has grabbed the attention of fathers all over the entire world. That's an amazing. Yeah

966
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,040
Revelation that I'm having right now. Well, cuz it's a regional, you know, yeah, I guess you're right

967
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,000
It's specifically my town versus this other town, right? That's about football man growing up

968
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,400
We had the we I mean college football is pretty big in North Carolina

969
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:55,320
I would say big college basketball is way bigger, but our football team is the Carolina Panthers. So it's both right

970
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:02,760
It's both care. We didn't even get one just for North Carolina and and we fucking hate South Carolina from they put mustard and barbecue, man

971
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,280
Mustard in their barbecue sauce, isn't that crazy?

972
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,280
I'm not crazy

973
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,680
sense did. But go down to Myrtle Beach and tell them that, and they'll probably fall

974
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,580
over because they're so addicted to drugs. That's right. Yeah, see, even now I can't

975
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:28,500
help but barbing my neighbors down south. Yeah. And also, they were the, this isn't

976
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,620
probably true, but they were the last people to leave the Confederacy. I believe it, and

977
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:38,740
so do you. Yeah. Okay. And North Carolina didn't even want to be in it, man. North Carolina

978
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,500

984
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,960
There's no like booster support for hockey.

985
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,880
You gotta be like into hockey to play.

986
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,920
- Yeah, you have to have, yeah.

987
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,280
There's not like, there's no rich man

988
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,000
who's giving out scholarships to buy hockey clothes.

989
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,040

990
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,160
Any boy. - Exactly.

991
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,160
They put me in pads, man.

992
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,640
I was huge when I was a kid.

993
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,840
I was bigger as a kid than I am now.

994
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,680
- Yeah.

995
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:50,000
I was like 11 years old. I was a complete machine with football. I had no idea what I was doing

996
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,440
They called me butterfingers because I couldn't catch a pass

997
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,660
but I was the biggest kid and I played center and

998
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,300
I

999
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,300
Could block anybody man

1000
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,360
there was a there was a couple of seasons where I I was 11 and

1001
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:11,120
I they had to move me up into the next age range. So I was the youngest kid in my entire division because I

1002
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,060
couldn't make the weight for the 11 year olds and so I had to play with the 12 and 13 year olds and

1003
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:23,400
There was two different games where I didn't even make weight for that division because I was so fat

1004
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,920
Yeah, so I just had to sit there on the sidelines fatly

1005
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,920
Cheering on my team because I did I was I was under 115 pounds. That's sick

1006
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,740
Yeah, it was awesome in this one time

1007
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:41,660
I played so much Mario Tennis on the GameCube that I went and took tennis lessons for like a year.

1008
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:49,560
That's awesome. This one time you did something for a year? Yeah. Wow, that's a big, that's a very big commitment.

1009
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:55,020
Were you good at tennis? I don't think so. Was it the Mario Tennis for the Game Boy where you don't even play as fucking Mario?

1010
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,020
No, the GameCube. Oh.

1011
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:02,180
I played the one on Game Boy and it's like you're playing like infinite jest.

1012
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,140
You're not even, you're just like a random kid at a tennis school.

1013
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,260
Okay, yeah, it really it didn't make any sense to me there's an almost no Mario

1014
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:18,000
It's really sad he's on the fucking front of the cartridge let me be Mario man

1015
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,640
Yeah, I don't want to make my own guy. I don't play Caleb at the at the tennis school

1016
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,860
All right, man Mario baseball

1017
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:30,980
Almost baseball fun. That is true. Mario baseball was really fun

1018
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:34,620
I wish that's how it worked in I wish that that's exactly how baseball worked in real life

1019
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:40,660
Where if you got three Dominican guys you put them in an outfield together because they will jump on each other's heads to kiss

1020
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
the ball

1021
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,660
That really is how baseball should work that would be so amazing chemistry

1022
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:54,340
What do you think it's legal to jump on someone's head yeah, of course it is anything goes

1023
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,180
Yeah

1024
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,000
It's more legal than jumping on your opponent's head for sure

1025
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,580
All right, and make sense to me

1026
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,700
There's only one thing that's illegal to do in sports

1027
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,440
And that's be Josh Giddey. That's right

1028
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,580
That's right free Rex's boy

1029
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,700
All right

1030
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,640
