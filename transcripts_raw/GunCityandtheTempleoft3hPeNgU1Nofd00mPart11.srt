[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,700
Last time on Gun City, the Temple of Tepenguin of Doom.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,340
Our heroes finally made it in to the...

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,740
Wait, hold on.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,540
They didn't make it into the Temple of the Penguin of Doom.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,700
They went back to town.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,940
They talked with three weird guys.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:36,940
And they made a new Sullivan, who has become a fan favorite, and maybe already has a three-picture

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:46,620
deal with Paramount. Then they went to the temple. The actual Sullivan, Crud now, helped eat out a

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,740
door. So sort of continuing the theme there. And then they were let into a large atrium with

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:01,980
strange stone and other material on the ground of various, you know, origins.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:10,540
And they saw a large egg of some kind. After doing a bit of exploring and attempting to solve puzzles,

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,220
they realized that they should do matter over mind and slid down a mud, little mudslide thing,

14
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,060
and ended up in a room where they fought their analogouses.

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:29,060
*laughter*

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,060
Right.

17
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:41,060
After a near-death experience with probably the most brutal fight our heroes have ever seen,

18
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:50,060
they ventured down a secret passage through a staircase and discovered the lost city of Tamatau.

19
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,660
Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of other little things in between but that's a broad strokes.

20
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:02,660
I think you guys should be up to speed both the view list the viewers the listeners at

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,660
home and the listeners on the zoom call.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:16,700
But yeah, so Snoochie Boochies obviously seemed completely elated and excited seeing this

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
sort of vast town or city of some kind.

24
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
It looks like it's under a cave.

25
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,700
And I believe I described it a bit last time,

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,700
but just in case, I'll give a little bit more description to that.

27
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
But first of all, actually, I should say,

28
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,700
because you guys were knocked out cold,

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,700
and I was reading over some of the rules in the game,

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:58,700
and it's pretty clear, I mean already I fuck with the rules all the time, but I think it's pretty clear that you should be able to do a short rest, like half an hour, get one HP back, and you're up and ready to go.

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
I thought we rolled hit dice.

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Yeah, we rolled hit dice for that too. No, I guess I was, this was saying this mostly for me, I think.

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Oh, okay.

34
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Like, ah, the rules are, say, I'm sorry.

35
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
[laughter]

36
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Whatever.

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:18,660
But yeah, in case there's some sort of missing what it was called or what it looked like,

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:26,900
it looks like this Chrome 60s sci-fi, when there was sort of a utopian vision for the

39
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:33,380
future in the early, during the 60s and 50s kind of thing.

40
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,940
almost like a like translucent floors that you can see computer wires in it

41
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,260
despite all the grime because this is sort of like a city underneath like a

42
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,300
cave or like a city in a cave it's like underneath the temple you can still see

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,020
sort of like what its former glory would it would have been it shine and I think

44
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,980
I said this last time it looks like a Sid Mead painting which I suggest you

45
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,660
guys look up Sid Mead you'll get a sense of what I mean it's like a grimy Sid

46
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:15,660
me

47
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,620
pretty old. He looks like he has like powder all over him or something. Is this a guy from

48
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Devils Rejects? Yeah. He's got a blue nose. He does have a blue nose. Why does he have

49
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:37,620
a blue nose? Look at this guy. What the fuck? Everyone at home look up Sid Mead paintings.

50
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Church Sid Mead fappening.

51
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,540
A lot of good stuff here.

52
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:54,540
Um, but yeah, uh, uh, Snoochie Boochie is sort of like excitedly looking things over.

53
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,540
He's sort of like, "This is, this is the town I remember.

54
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,540
This is what I remember from my childhood.

55
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,540
This is the kind of place, this is what the Tamagotchis were capable of."

56
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,540
And, and you guys would see, like, all these, like, beautiful buildings, um,

57
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:19,660
But also like you'd see really incredible like artifacts probably worth a lot of tokens.

58
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Digital clock radios, Google Wi-Fi devices, Alexa's, like laser tag toys, Palm pilots,

59
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,460
techno robot dogs, you know those robot dogs.

60
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,340
Even massive things like a huge animatronic Weird Al commissioned by John and Hank Green.

61
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,840
tanning beds. There's like a bunch of tanning beds to around.

62
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,840
So it's a little bit eerie down here.

63
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Obviously, there's sort of like a lot, you know, a quiet is it's

64
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,640
pretty obviously abandoned.

65
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,140
You can sort of faintly hear a Furby singing.

66
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,740
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, like way in the background that

67
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,740
kind of makes it a bit and a Hulk smash from like a Hulk glove

68
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,840
somewhere else like you hear sort of like the ambient noises

69
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,440
of devices past but you guys can obviously investigate this

70
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,240
place or look around or see what it is.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,540
But I'm going to try to imagine like a massive beautiful utopian

72
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,140
city that sort of a grimy and filled with rock and mud.

73
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,640
Yeah, and it's designed by a guy that looks weird.

74
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,940
All right, investigating people can't choose the way they look.

75
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,240
I got a 14.

76
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,240
Okay.

77
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,340
Yeah.

78
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,640
I mean like depends.

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,240
What do you what do you I guess I said investigate but it's like

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
what are you looking for?

81
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,640
Do you want to find a way back up?

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
if you wanna find an artifact.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
- Yeah, are we supposed...

84
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,440
Is there something down here we're supposed to look for

85
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,100
to open the egg?

86
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,440
- Hey, is Snoochie Boochie with us?

87
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
- Hey, Snoochie Boochie, what's the deal with this?

89
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,760
- What do you mean, the whole?

90
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,680
- Well, I mean, this is like your city, right?

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,280
- Yeah, what's the deal with this?

92
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
- So what's going on here?

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
What's the deal?

94
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,040
- Yeah, what the hell is all this crap?

95
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,640
Okay, alright, that's fair.

96
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,200
Well it seems that the temple is the only thing that is standing from the city's past

97
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,840
and below here is where the city was.

98
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:26,280
So perhaps there is another way up through the city, because we are sort of in a cave,

99
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,000
but as far as what we might be looking for here to help open the egg, I don't know.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, look right there. There's the elevator from Willy Wonka.

101
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,500
And it's an egg key that opens eggs.

102
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,600
Oh, it's shaped like a key for an egg.

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,000
It's shaped exactly like the keyhole that was on the egg.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,180
Oh, you two must have hit your heads on the way down here.

105
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,920
Oh, I can see right there.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,120
We did it on the rock that makes you see the truth.

107
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,960
It's right over there.

108
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:05,960
I would like to play with Sullivan.

109
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Hey, hey buddy.

110
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Wow.

111
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,960
You want to play?

112
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
You want to play?

113
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I'm taking like a thousand pictures of Sullivan like you do when you like hang out with your friends in middle school like when you just got a baseball.

114
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,960
I realize he's just one of the rabbits from Raging Rabbits.

115
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I love him so much.

116
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Sullivan, let's go!

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Can we have a dance party with him?

118
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,960
I would like to boogie with him so badly.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Yeah, you guys boogie. Do you want to boogie a bit?

120
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Yeah, I boogie hard.

121
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I'm spinning on my head.

122
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah, roll a performance check to see if you all boogie.

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,960
he's like inexplicably in a bikini.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh yeah.

125
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
I got 22 dude.

126
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,960
Fuck, I'm tearing it up.

127
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,000
Nice, yeah, all of you did really well at boogie.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,560
You're all having a really good time.

129
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,960
I look at Suji Buji's like, "I'm impressed."

130
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Yes, actually.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,800
All right, so we did our part.

132
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
Now you figure out how to open the egg.

133
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,720
Okay, well, let's go towards where the ceilings are.

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
it's lower in the cave. Perhaps we can find something there.

135
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Because perhaps there's a way out. What about those stairs over there?

136
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,280
Those are the stairs we came from. Well, can't we go back up the stairs?

137
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:42,400
I mean, there was well, there was the slide. Look, let's just let's just walk forward.

138
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,520
Okay, fine. Yeah, I mean, you guys can also like do a

139
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,480
a bit of a a you can do like investigation checks to find your way through this place

140
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,040
or like a history check as well.

141
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,080
Yeah, it's a city history first.

142
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Okay, I'll do a history check as well.

143
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,160
Do a history check to see what you guys can recall about this place.

144
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I got a three.

145
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,280
I got a 24.

146
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,720
I got a yeah.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,160
Your archaeological prowess, Ray William Johnson, is really crazy.

148
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,040
You understand these cities pretty well and how they're structured.

149
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:31,600
Oftentimes they have sort of passageways that lead to some of the more utility buildings,

150
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,160
things that involve turning power on and power off and could help probably have different

151
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,160
pathways to get to a higher level inside of this kind of location.

152
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,040
pretty familiar with like the architecture and structure and sort of getting a sense

153
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,520
of the cave. You imagine that there's a certain like basically like a little bit more West

154
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,360
and like what you are thinking of as West because where you're facing is North. You

155
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:05,720
could probably find a way up. I would say with that kind of check. Okay, I I pick up

156
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,160
Sullivan and I play some I kind of like carry him on my hip with one hand and I start heading

157
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,360
in that direction. Whoa. And I feel like I said like tickling

158
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
his chin with my left hand finger. Ha ha you awesome.

159
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,720
He's learning a lot of words. You're getting a little too.

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh they grow up so fast.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,560
And yeah, so yeah, you guys walk a bit further

162
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
down in that direction. You start to see all these

163
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,320
beautiful sights and of the city of lost past you see sort of like

164
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,360
these monuments to other time got cheese they've come in past ten much I'm

165
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
in my chief

166
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,440
members the other names but they're there and

167
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm role a perception check all you right now

168
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,920
25 shit 14 forgot you're too good at perception

169
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,120
mmm just like a real life

170
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,320
in yeah I'm

171
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:14,240
1616 with a 25 Patrick Yoda you see you notice something sticking out of the ground.

172
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,080
In some of the rubble of one of these beautiful buildings.

173
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,720
A bit further in the distance a little bit off course from where the where Ray William

174
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,280
Johnson's leading you, but not so far off course, but you see something that that catches

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,200
your eye.

176
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,720
You see an N on it, actually.

177
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,480
What does it stand for?

178
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,040
One day that will work.

179
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Yeah.

180
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm going to go investigate it.

181
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Yeah, sure.

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Head over there.

183
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,000
You start moving away the rubble.

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,200
You find an N-gauge.

185
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,680
I pick it up and I open it, I open the phone and I start going through it.

186
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
It's like dead.

187
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,320
It's battery, it's like I take my battery out of my PSP and I put it in the N-Gage.

188
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Yeah for sure.

189
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Okay.

190
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,360
Yeah you put it in there and the N-Gage which takes double A batteries which also the PSP

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,600
takes, everything takes double A batteries.

192
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,240
you're able to start to you're scrolling through the context and it's written in like an ill

193
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,780
like a language that you you can't read at least right away.

194
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,280
Yeah like the Mr. Saturn font.

195
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,800
Yes exactly like the Mr. Saturn font but it's for Tamagotchis.

196
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,600
You can roll an intelligence check to see if you can read it.

197
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Okay.

198
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
It'll be history.

199
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Yeah.

200
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
19.

201
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
That's good.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:54,700
Um, yeah, so you get the sense that this belonged to a like

203
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,900
businessman who used to live in the Tamagotchi town.

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,900
I go through his email and I find out that he's the Craigslist

205
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,200
killer. Yeah, you find out he's a Craigslist killer.

206
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,700
The Craigslist killer was in the Tamagotchi town.

207
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,900
You would also recall I would say that this was something that

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,560
Leo, the collector, was looking for.

209
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
He's never been able to get an end gauge.

210
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I pocket it and I don't tell the rest of them.

211
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Okay, cool.

212
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Alright, yeah.

213
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Okay, so you head back, join the rest of the community.

214
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Well, I pocket it, I pocket it, because I think it's...

215
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Never mind.

216
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
I was trying to think of a motivation for it, but...

217
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Whatever. I'll have no motivation for it.

218
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
It's kind of funnier that way.

219
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,560
Alright yeah, you pocket it, and uh, as you're walking back, you hear a...

220
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Hey, hey Pat, what you got there?

221
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
How the fuck did you get down here? I thought you were up there!

222
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Yeah, well, woah, what the fuck? Woah!

223
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Oh, sorry, I forgot he was up there.

224
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Go back up there right now!

225
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Are you a genie?

226
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I rolled a perception check for him and he did so well, it was like, oh he probably noticed, but I forgot he was upstairs.

227
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,060
he's israel's sorry he just like floats you know it's not a good story the cave

228
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,180
floor

229
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,040
i think the rest of the

230
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,280
the and that guy's all right now let's carry

231
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,480
now let's figure out how to get back upstairs

232
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,080
so i think i have

233
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,800
you know if you guys are not going to keep walking

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,280
yeah yeah you guys keep walking towards the uh...

235
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,920
the direction rewind as we need to tell us that that's where we're going

236
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah, yeah, I know I was wrong.

237
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,720
And you reach and you reach a a large building that is is

238
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,920
weirdly like square shaped compared to everything else.

239
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,420
You've seen his head all these like weird angles and smoothness

240
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,320
to them and likes like all very nice and sculpted and this

241
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,520
one's sort of just like a fucking block, but you also see

242
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,220
that the top of it is completely flush with the cave floor

243
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,220
and you see Stoogey Boogey's and he says that's our way up.

244
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,120
We can get to the top of this building and blast through.

245
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,920
We'll probably get to the other side of the back to the temple.

246
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,020
It's cube shaped.

247
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,520
You said how tall is it?

248
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,820
Is it purple?

249
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,820
It's about like it's like 60 feet.

250
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,120
It's a pretty fucking big building.

251
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,420
So even though it's like a like a cube is a purple.

252
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,020
It's not purple.

253
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,320
No doesn't have a handle.

254
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,520
does it have it's a gamecube on it

255
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
now

256
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,700
is it a gamecube

257
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,800
maybe

258
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,920
uh...

259
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
okay i go inside

260
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,000
i have an idea

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,980
way

262
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,200
yeah there are there at what are the windows look like

263
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,920
uh...

264
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,900
they look similar to the windows you seen where they're just they're kind of

265
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,940
like uh...

266
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,120
these uh... they have like uh...

267
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,580
like a half uh... oval

268
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,540
with like at the top of the or like uh...

269
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:10,220
one two three sides it's sort of like the top of a hexagon on top of a half oval that makes sense

270
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:18,780
and how many floors is it how many floors is it it's about four floors does it have so okay so

271
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,460
i just teleport to the out of out until we're the top floor you want to above the top floor just go

272
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:34,140
out oh shit i have to i have to stop you can you bring me with you do it on the fly just just just

273
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,140
nerf him say bro I did this is I have to live with this I have to live with this

274
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:47,420
wait okay but I stopped for long enough I stopped for long enough to hear what

275
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:54,420
the puzzle yeah no because I want to I might want to save it for another

276
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,700
another thing now but I have to personal next time I got a fucking nerf this I

277
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,140
have to figure out other internal logic because here's the thing because I've

278
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,660
thought about it and I was like, "Well, I could, to stop him from teleporting, I could

279
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,660
do this, but it's like, no, I don't want him to just like spawn in the middle of a rock.

280
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,020
That's not fair to him." And this is a big enough dungeon as it is. I've thought about

281
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,220
all this, but you still find no fucking way to teleport. So I can't stop you. I'm not

282
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,340
going to stop you. That's being a fair DM who's learned his lesson about letting somebody

283
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,340
teleport every three seconds.

284
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
You should, uh, you should nerf my worm, too.

285
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
It's getting out of hand.

286
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Yeah, I'm...

287
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,900
I have literally said to you, I think, like, a few times, like, "Yeah, I don't think your

288
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,580
worms in your inventory anymore."

289
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,540
Uh, I'm actually looking at it right now, so...

290
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,100
Yeah, no, I'm sure it's back in there.

291
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
It says...

292
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
It says one.

293
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Actually, it says two.

294
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I have two...

295
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,660
Two huge worms now.

296
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,060
And if you keep talking, it's gonna be three.

297
00:18:52,060 --> 00:19:00,220
So I will say that what you just skipped was pretty cool, but it was also a whole thing.

298
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,180
So no, kudos to you, this is how the game is played.

299
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,260
Cameron, can you take me with you?

300
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
Yeah, I'll take everybody.

301
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
Oh yeah, take everybody.

302
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,100
No wait, I'm not going to take anybody so you guys get to see the cool puzzle.

303
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,740
No, it's, yeah, I'll take everybody.

304
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,300
It won't be good for them to do alone.

305
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,620
Oh my god, damn it.

306
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,820
This is real time watching a DM fuck up, so I hope everyone appreciates this.

307
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,420
It's like those videos where the developers watch people speedrun their games.

308
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,220
And they're just like, "What the fuck is this, dude?"

309
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,820
Did you feel a dawning sense of dread when I asked how tall the building was?

310
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,420
Oh, yeah, but I knew it had floors.

311
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
That's what I wanted to cut.

312
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,820
I didn't want to say, like, "It's 60 feet, and also there's no, like, it's a big gymnasium."

313
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
Like, I can't say that. It's a building.

314
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,940
I was too concerned about it being a GameCube. I wanted to ask every feature. I wanted to

315
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,440
know if it had the Game Boy Player.

316
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,740
There was a Nintendo stuff in there. There was...

317
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,320
It doesn't matter. I'm saving it. I'm saving it. I don't want to spoil it.

318
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,860
You're gonna see like a cube in another arc that we do and it's gonna be like, "Oh, and

319
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,860
it says no teleporting allowed. If you do, I'll kill you in real life." It's weird.

320
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,940
So yeah, so you guys make it back to the top.

321
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,180
(laughing)

322
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,380
- And there's another cube that's twice as big.

323
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,620
- This beautiful city, you get past it.

324
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,620
And you know what I should do next time

325
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,300
is say you can only teleport to things you can see,

326
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,140
which I think is the actual rules of D&D,

327
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,500
but I did not specify that.

328
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,100
These are all things I'm realizing now.

329
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,340
- That's like the first rule,

330
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,460
like first nightcrawler rule.

331
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,300
- I know.

332
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,140
(laughing)

333
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,620
I would just shoot my gun upwards and I'd be able to see through the bullet hole all the

334
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
way to the top and teleport.

335
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
Easy.

336
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
At least that would create sound.

337
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
You can't.

338
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Maybe I could do something with that.

339
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,620
No, you can't keep me down.

340
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,740
You're gonna try but it's not gonna work.

341
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,780
I'll just figure out how to get rid of it.

342
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,660
So you're back at the fucking top of this place except now you're back in the temple

343
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,860
except now you're on the other side of it.

344
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:24,300
the

345
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:39,780
are

346
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:59,100
a

347
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:13,080
to

348
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:28,360
you

349
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:43,280
in

350
00:22:43,280 --> 00:23:01,280
and

351
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,280
god

352
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:19,640
the

353
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:26,640
as

354
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:41,640
that

355
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:48,640
is

356
00:23:48,640 --> 00:24:07,640
I'm going to

357
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,200
the egg. Yeah, can I have the remote from click? You can't have the remote from click. You

358
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,260
could try to teleport inside the egg. I just want to see what's in there. You should try

359
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:27,000
to see if it's hollow or solid, probably, in case it's not hollow and you just teleport

360
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,440
into meat space. I knock on it. So yeah, you're back on this side. You knock on it, it's hollow.

361
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,520
I teleport inside to see what's up.

362
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,520
You see a fetus.

363
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,640
Oh my god.

364
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
Of a tamagotchi.

365
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Yo!

366
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,640
I take it and I take it and teleport back out.

367
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,200
She's gonna die.

368
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Yeah.

369
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,680
Sullivan is like, Sullivan sees you just appear with a fetus.

370
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
He's like "AHH!

371
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,960
What the fuck is that?!"

372
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,560
I don't take the fetus out.

373
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,160
I don't want it to die.

374
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Okay.

375
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Hey guys you made it back!

376
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
Shut up Crud.

377
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Alright.

378
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
I think there's a really cool puzzle downstairs.

379
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,160
In this giant cube that I think you might be interested in.

380
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Oh, okay. Should I slide down the slide?

381
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
No.

382
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,160
You know what, Crud, I've been thinking.

383
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
You know, maybe, maybe Crud.

384
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
What's happening?

385
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
Maybe Crud is not...

386
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Maybe your name shouldn't be Crud, you know?

387
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Really?

388
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah, maybe you just shouldn't have a name at all.

389
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,640
Oh, that's so much worse. Yeah, you're just gonna be like nothing

390
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:46,640
Okay, okay nothing yes, yeah cinnamon we're gonna call you nothing now

391
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,200
That's what we've been calling you the whole cinnamon the frog that's your fucking name

392
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,340
Right, right you guys that's what that was his name before yep, and now we have this new cinnamon I thought it was Suleyman

393
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:15,020
on

394
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,220
the i don't know i don't even remember it

395
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
shaughnessy

396
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,540
shaughnessy the frog

397
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,020
what but you you've been calling me so i'm i'm i'm just gonna

398
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,440
set the record straight

399
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,220
did somebody hear did somebody hear nothing just now yeah i think i heard

400
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,980
nothing okay alright i was a lot of it

401
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,260
i was walking away at all i was gonna walk away from the situation

402
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,740
where were the fucking day i'm gonna walk so while we're here yeah well he's

403
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,740
walking away I check the computer to see if the number is going down. We're in that room

404
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:58,060
that I couldn't figure out. You look at the computer and you see your ghost flying around

405
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:05,060
a grave. Is that it? Uh huh. Is that it? Do you guys remember how to do the puzzle? So

406
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:15,640
So from last time, what you would remember is that when you looked at the computer, you

407
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
got a really high roll.

408
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Yeah.

409
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,220
When you looked at the computer, you'd see a ghost of your face basically flying around

410
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
the grave.

411
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,520
And when you looked away from it, you'd hear like a "ka-chunk, ka-chunk."

412
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,400
And then when you turned back around, you'd see that the numbers changed.

413
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,280
Well, let's get the number back down to zero.

414
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,920
Can I, okay, what if I take out the, because I still have some of the Xbox games in my inventory,

415
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
right?

416
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,080
I don't think the solution is Xbox games, I'm going to say.

417
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

418
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

419
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,080
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

420
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,060
the computer right? Yeah. You have to have your back towards it? Yeah. So I give everyone

421
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:03,440
an Xbox game so we can use them as a mirror. Why, we just know how many clicks it's going.

422
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,760
Oh it's not, I thought it was a person. I thought, because you guys said it was like

423
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,400
a boo for Mario. So I thought that we would need something. Yeah, you look away from it.

424
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,600
Yeah, you look away from it, but I thought there was like somebody coming towards me.

425
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,080
It's a computer. Yeah, but I thought there was like a ghost in the room or something.

426
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:37,080
a

427
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
right now for the listeners.

428
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Yeah.

429
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
You listen for all nine clicks.

430
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
And then leave the room,

431
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
I guess, or turn around.

432
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Okay.

433
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Yeah, you turn around after nine clicks.

434
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
You see the pedestal

435
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
shoot up again.

436
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
And you see it sort of

437
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
go back down.

438
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
And yeah,

439
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
nothing else happens.

440
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
What's the number on?

441
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,080
It's going back. As you're leaving the room, you hear "kachunk".

442
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,080
And it's back down to 9.

443
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,080
So was it 0 when we turned around?

444
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
It was at 0, but then it went back to 9 when you left the room.

445
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
What if we...

446
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Oh, so just one person needs to stay here and look at it the whole time.

447
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay, Crud, just stay... just...

448
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,080
We get it back to 0 and then I say, "Crud, you have to stand here and look at this computer for the rest of your life."

449
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Yeah, 'cause you're kinda nothing. Like, it won't even probably register as, like, a thing.

450
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:46,460
the

451
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,380
that the golden thing on the pedestal

452
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,020
do you that golden i'd to do we have a whoever has it

453
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,380
to ever done i have it

454
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,280
somebody does it probably solvent does it

455
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,060
so i was a thing that's about his size and puts it on top of the pedestal but

456
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,380
is it

457
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,820
of self-invite

458
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,100
uh...

459
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,660
please tell me it's like oh yeah or a baby here and i think i guess you're

460
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,140
it's uh... it's uh...

461
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,140
while he's always

462
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,300
and i don't know what i'm talking about these learning everyday i'm so proud

463
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
and uh... yes and swear words while we're here

464
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
the penguin

465
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,340
this gold penguin which was a bop it

466
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,940
which became an egg which became a gold penguin

467
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,940
its mouth opens all the way open in your income

468
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,540
and like a beam of light

469
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,940
shoots out of it

470
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,340
uh...

471
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,260
uh... yet it turns a zero

472
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,020
and uh... it turns a zero and you can look through the window

473
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,540
and you see again that giant room filled with water

474
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,980
and you see a bit of light in it now piercing through to

475
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,220
we supposed to turn the

476
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,460
i think we turn them all to zero 'cause that's what the journal said yet term

477
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,700
although zero but the is the beam of light going towards the egg

478
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,940
i'm just trying to figure out like what how the puzzles work

479
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,540
just going out towards the room point ok

480
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,420
i think we should get the models here and then see what happens and then we can

481
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,540
figure out from there

482
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,700
because that's at least a thing to do

483
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,420
and so yes going what to do

484
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,860
yes you guys walk to the wheels you turn them all

485
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,940
to kitchen kitchen kitchen to zero

486
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,420
uh...

487
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,540
uh...

488
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,920
and uh... you see a beam of light

489
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,780
coming out from the a towards those windows

490
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,620
you see the room behind you

491
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,580
you see that we are door it was in front of you the couldn't get through it

492
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,420
seems to be like magically or technologically sealed

493
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,660
uh... you see it's a deluxe sparkle glow

494
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,500
and

495
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,060
you see the egg

496
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,320
start to shake

497
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,280
and

498
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,240
you see it's a to shake

499
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,400
a little bit harder

500
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,180
a little bit harder

501
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,420
and you see

502
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,380
non

503
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,260
other than

504
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,980
all baby tamagotchi hot like catch out but it's also a huge it's like a giant

505
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,300
baby tamagotchi and you see like suchi bujji's go

506
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:20,940
whoa wait that's not a real tamagotchi and you see the baby tamagotchi just

507
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,460
like bloop bloop like hop out and like just

508
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,140
crash through the door that was there into the next room

509
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,700
and yeah you guys figured out how to reset the kombu gachi clock

510
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,700
Let's go!

511
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,200
Easiest thing I ever did in my life.

512
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Yeah.

513
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
I think a big part of why it was so easy is that we got to skip.

514
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
Probably half of it.

515
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Skipped a lot, gave some hints, yeah.

516
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
But you guys figured it out.

517
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
Okay.

518
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah.

519
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm gonna dive into that hole with that little baby.

520
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Yes, you go into that next room.

521
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Hold on, pause, dude.

522
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
What the hell?

523
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
You're gonna dive into a little baby's hole?

524
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
And you see...

525
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
No.

526
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,480
uh... the baby time i got you again but this time now looks

527
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,120
he sees room filled with water is massive room

528
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,360
uh...

529
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,320
and

530
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,440
you're on what's like a metal platform

531
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,880
and the door behind you that just blew open

532
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,840
like just

533
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,960
shots that similar magical force field kinda comes up

534
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
and

535
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,360
he's had to realize that they're like these

536
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,800
mine carts on top of this pedestal on top of this like sort of conveyor belt

537
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,000
the overhanging this giant pool of water you're about fifty feet above it

538
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,700
and you see that those are filled with like

539
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,400
indiscriminate food pellets

540
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,340
uh...

541
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,200
and then you start to feel

542
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,660
the ground beneath you move

543
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,680
a_k_a_ the uh... the this metal bridge in front of you

544
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,000
uh... everyone role a uh... constitution check

545
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
saving throw I should say rather.

546
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,000
18.

547
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,500
20.

548
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
18.

549
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Nice.

550
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,200
Yeah,

551
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,880
like it moves so suddenly but you all managed to stand up and

552
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,680
stay up and then you watch as these mine carts start to funnel

553
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,700
into this towards the baby

554
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,700
and the baby's mouth just eats them

555
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,900
and then the

556
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,080
the cart the thing below you starts to go faster and faster

557
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,400
and faster.

558
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,800
and if you don't start running in the opposite direction you're going to end

559
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,800
up in that baby's mouth

560
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
uh...

561
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
and then

562
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,960
while you're doing that

563
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,040
uh... which you can react you could be characters that i shouldn't stop you

564
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,320
the

565
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,720
she

566
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,440
what

567
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,720
well i don't know what happens when you get you may have to figure that out

568
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,840
uh... and uh...

569
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,400
then you see that you see these cannons up top

570
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,880
that about like a whole lake and now policy

571
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
refifty feet up

572
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,020
basis room yeah about lakes there about seventy feet away

573
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,000
and another fifty feet near

574
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,640
you see them

575
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,180
point towards you

576
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,800
and

577
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,480
you hear them start to start up

578
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,040
and then

579
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,760
you see

580
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,680
them start to fire

581
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,780
what looks like

582
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,480
food pellets at you but these time this these times

583
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,200
they look like a little

584
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,280
uh... tomagotchi treats

585
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,820
sushi

586
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,380
burgers

587
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,140
all the little delicious tomagotchi treats

588
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,520
from the tomagotchi games that one's too big

589
00:35:47,520 --> 00:36:01,440
the

590
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,960
I think I have a pizza one.

591
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay, can you add like spaghetti?

592
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't have a spaghetti one.

593
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,680
Can we get like multiples of each one in case multiple people want one of them?

594
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
So we don't have to like split it?

595
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,080
I mean you're going to have multiples of each one because they're going to be shooting out

596
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,900
of a cannon towards you.

597
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,900
And the street is real?

598
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,360
You're going to have to roll deck saving throws for that.

599
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
Deck saving throws?

600
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,960
I'm going to chop that shit.

601
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,160
Uh yeah, you can certainly try that too.

602
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,360
You can do like an attack roll.

603
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Wait, so are we supposed to make sure that the Tamagotchi eats it?

604
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,360
I think he's not going to tell you everything, Pat.

605
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Oh yeah! Party time!

606
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Sullivan, get behind me! Okie dokie!

607
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,360
And he just sort of, he like jumps over you like Mario or Luigi or something.

608
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,360
No, he's perfect. He's himself and we're not going to bother him.

609
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,360
And, uh, okay, yeah.

610
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:09,440
you know that okay yeah yeah what do you mean yeah yeah say it back Wow

611
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,200
come on Sullivan you could say it back I pick up Sullivan to protect him from

612
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,080
from Ray William Johnson cuz I don't like the way Raymond Johnson's acting

613
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,440
around him right now I'm sorry I let I know I was moving a little bit if you

614
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:44,240
want

615
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,240
you guys hear anything? Oh my god! And yeah, roll for initiative you guys. 7. 4. Stellar.

616
00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:03,640
Jesus. Oh my god. Wow, those are some really good initiative rolls. 7, 4, and 2. Those are

617
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:12,520
actually bad. What are you talking about? And so, yeah, and then I'll roll for Snoochie

618
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:22,120
Boochies. Uh-huh. What did they get? They got a six. Fuck. They did really bad. That's really

619
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:30,760
bad for them. What did nothing get? Uh, nothing got... a nat 20. I'm not kidding. I'll take

620
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:42,320
another screenshot. I'm not kidding. All right, man. Oh my god. Yeah, he just like is the only

621
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,320
paying attention I guess, so, makes sense.

622
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Anyway, so, yeah. So, suddenly you see,

623
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,320
as this food is coming towards you, guys, so,

624
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,320
this is the order that you're in.

625
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
First, I'm going to need you all to make

626
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
dex saving throws as these foods,

627
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
these foodstuffs are coming towards you.

628
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I got a ten.

629
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Fourteen. Five.

630
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Okay, with that, with all those, you all just get like fucking pelted by this food.

631
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,520
And you don't manage to like catch it or anything.

632
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,160
So it just sort of like gets pelted at you.

633
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,360
And you're now you the you.

634
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah, and Sullivan again.

635
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,280
No, I just was trying to remember whatever.

636
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
Oh, yeah.

637
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Okay, yeah.

638
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:49,160
is

639
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:56,160
that

640
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,480
close to the mouth now.

641
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,760
Do I take any damage?

642
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,920
Of this baby that's going like, "Gom, gom, gom, gom, gom."

643
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Just open him out.

644
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
You weird.

645
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
It's like Pac-Man.

646
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Fuck it off.

647
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
You don't take any damage from getting hit by the food.

648
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
Meanwhile, I'll probably get in there too.

649
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,960
Suddenly you start to see rubber duckies start to appear in this massive pool of water.

650
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,880
Just like, "Boop."

651
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:35,320
the

652
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,040
they're not real rubber like nuts how far away are they

653
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
are you know what i mean?

654
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
nope that's canon now they're not real

655
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
they're not real so i don't have to worry about them

656
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,040
i hope they shut the fuck up

657
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
but they're floating right?

658
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
yeah they're floating in the water

659
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
ok and the water is toxic or no?

660
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
i don't know

661
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
i can't tell you that

662
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
he's so stupid he doesn't even know and he made it

663
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
yeah exactly

664
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,480
how close is the rubber duck in relation to the water

665
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
in relation to me.

666
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Let's take out your measuring tool.

667
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Oh right.

668
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,480
40 feet, 50 feet.

669
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Ok.

670
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Because I was thinking if I'm

671
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
in danger of getting eaten by this tamagotchi

672
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
I could just jump in the water and go

673
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
onto the rubber duck.

674
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
Because it's a big rubber duck.

675
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
We should test if it's toxic

676
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
first by throwing crud in.

677
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:46,360
the

678
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,140
move up a bit. But if you use your full movement, you'll be able to stay in the same place.

679
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,860
So Krud is just going to use his full movement to stay in the same place. He's just running

680
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:01,240
in place. That's all he's doing. Now, the cannons are going to go again. So they're

681
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,720
charging up their food and they shoot them towards you guys. So let's do either, you

682
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,120
know, you could do a dexterity saving throw or you can do like an athletics check if you

683
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,760
want to try to catch it

684
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,660
this year athletics

685
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,240
all all of us twenty

686
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,440
twenty-one all of you

687
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,200
okay i would do

688
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
i guess it is what it's it's better

689
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,040
uh...

690
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,200
uh... what do you know how many

691
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:28,880
okay

692
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,280
so yeah uh...

693
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,560
uh...

694
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,440
blowtoss and patrick you know that you managed to like snag

695
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,460
some of the food you catch it

696
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,160
uh... pretty definitely

697
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:39,920
uh...

698
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,420
Ray William Johnson, you got like knocked in the face.

699
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Cut by a durian.

700
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,420
Yeah.

701
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,420
A metal spiked ball just flies out.

702
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,420
Where the fuck, who the fuck put that in there?

703
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
So you're like knocked prone at this point.

704
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Which basically means like it takes half your movement to get up.

705
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
Okay.

706
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
So that's where you're at.

707
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,420
And now the rubber ducks are gonna go.

708
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,420
and they're just sort of like moving

709
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
towards you guys a little bit

710
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
so they are animate

711
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,420
well they have

712
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
directives

713
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,420
but they are not

714
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,420
they don't have souls

715
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
yeah they don't have souls

716
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,420
so I could take damage from one of them

717
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
is what I'm trying to ask

718
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
I mean I just took damage from a fucking

719
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
piece of fruit. Well that makes sense it was a projectile

720
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
yeah these things are projecting

721
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
towards you brother watch out

722
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,300
if you roll initiative and then something starts moving towards you, you should be afraid of

723
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,420
it. That's my personal rule of thumb, I think.

724
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:49,440
But now, looking at the initiative order, it is your turn, Patrick Ciota.

725
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,020
So I caught the food, right? I throw it in the tamagotchi's mouth from where I'm standing.

726
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,020
Yeah.

727
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,020
And roll athletics.

728
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:02,780
No, you're pretty close. You could just toss it in. It's got a big maw. This baby tamagotchi's

729
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,680
Like bomb bomb bomb and you throw it in there and you for a second it goes like

730
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Hmm and it just keeps going on Dom Dom after that

731
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,220
But it seems a little bit satisfied

732
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,760
So we have to satisfy it. And so yeah, you see snitchy boochies and he says

733
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,780
Yes, we must feed the time. I got you. We love to eat food

734
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:27,340
We need to eat food to live. How come we can't fucking eat normal. I

735
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,260
Don't know. I did not design this game

736
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,780
So I know someone who did yeah, yeah

737
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,160
I'm talking to him an awful lot in my head. All right, I forgot you sort of established that

738
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,500
Mm-hmm. You have a psychic connection to God. That's right

739
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,740
God is a little I don't know about God

740
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,500
All right. Well, yeah, I think God's too much. Yeah, that's a

741
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:00,580
Little too much. Ah, yeah, I get it. Maybe maybe that narrator should check his ego. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I'm God

742
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
God.

743
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Fucking Bruce Almighty over here, what the fuck.

744
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,420
Oh man, if only.

745
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,420
He's so cool.

746
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,420
He is cool.

747
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
Alright, yeah.

748
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,420
Well anyway.

749
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,420
Yeah, that's your action.

750
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,580
What do you want to do for your movement?

751
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Probably stay in place, I'll use my full movement.

752
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,580
Yes, you'll run.

753
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:27,060
Unless, I don't know, I kind of want to see what would happen if I jump in the water.

754
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,580
Maybe like put your toe in first.

755
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:35,580
the

756
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,020
up to about where we will be johnson is uh...

757
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,360
i stayed in place you know because

758
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,500
is using your full movement your full movement is using both your actions to

759
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,180
move out fuck okay yes that's danger yeah

760
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,660
uh...

761
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,340
so i hate danger

762
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,260
yet it is now stitching beaches turn

763
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,380
so uh...

764
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:03,140
Snoochieboochies is going to jump off this bridge.

765
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,860
Oh, can he reach?

766
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,280
No, he can't reach.

767
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,960
He can't reach that.

768
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:17,240
So Snoochieboochies is instead going to just sort of like run in front of you guys and

769
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,000
try to see if he can stop you guys from tumbling into the mouth of this thing as best as he

770
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,780
can.

771
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,660
So that's what he's going to do.

772
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,360
Now it is your turn, Blotas.

773
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,240
- Where am I on here?

774
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,380
- You are way in the back.

775
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,540
- Am I under Sullivan?

776
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,460
- You're over here.

777
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,840
- Oh, okay.

778
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,780
I have one of the, I caught one of the foods, right?

779
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,620
- Yeah, you did.

780
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,300
- So I throw it into the--

781
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,180
- 'Cause of your distance,

782
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,860
you will need to do an athletics check.

783
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,160
- All right, that's nothing for a guy like me.

784
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,260
- Mm-hmm.

785
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,260
- 19.

786
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,220
- Yeah, yeah, you fucking knock it out of the park.

787
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,300
And you see the baby Tom I got, you go,

788
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,800
Hmm.

789
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,800
These foods that are next to the conveyor belt.

790
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,700
Are these just are those actually like floating in the water there?

791
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh, no, those are just assets.

792
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I'm going to be using.

793
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
All right.

794
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,400
Yeah, and yeah, and it it you see it get kind of excited like go

795
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,520
and then you see it's transform

796
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,680
who into

797
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,320
a uh...

798
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,520
kid

799
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,160
sit on the dot g

800
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,760
and it lays down into the same thing works when i'm done done done done

801
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,460
uh... the outwardly now

802
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,360
i'll keep dole keep running away

803
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,320
and really johnson is your turn now

804
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:52,040
Okay, I'm gonna just desperately try to stay in the same spot. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just moving you over so I can see cool

805
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,300
Yes, you get up that takes half your movement

806
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,400
Then use the rest of your movement and you manage to stay in place

807
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:02,240
Using all of them. Well, you managed to move a little bit closer to like where where stoochie boochies was

808
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,220
So you're sort of protected by him, but you're pretty close to getting into this this teenager's mouth

809
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,900
Which is your own thing you got deal with?

810
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,080
Now we're back to the top of the order and you see this teenage Tamagotchi thing just go like oh

811
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,220
No, he's jacking off

812
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:31,400
That you do that in your bedroom you do that away from us if he's doing anything

813
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,940
He's there there's some shipping Jack for sure. It's just jacking out of his butt. He's pooping and this poop

814
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,940
That's how you jack off you freak

815
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:56,800
the

816
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,100
water as well.

817
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,200
And they have their own

818
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,800
initiative.

819
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,600
What the fuck?

820
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,300
That boy got brown come send him to the doctor.

821
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,200
All right.

822
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,300
It is now

823
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,300
solving the frogs turn.

824
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,900
Sorry cruds nothing's turn.

825
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,700
There we go.

826
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,100
Take you a minute.

827
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,300
So I guess it's nothing.

828
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,700
I said nothing happens.

829
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,100
Nothing.

830
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,100
Yeah, pretty much.

831
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,600
I mean like he's just trying to survive as usual.

832
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,200
I look at him and I'm like "Uh, nothing, are you gonna help?"

833
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,200
"I'm trying!"

834
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
"Sorry, did you hear something?"

835
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,200
"What the fuck?!"

836
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,600
And uh, yeah, now the cannons shoot more food at you guys.

837
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
So, what do you wanna do?

838
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Catch it. Catch the food.

839
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Did you have to use such a realistic poop image?

840
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
I thought that was good.

841
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Oh, I got a 7. Oh, I got a crit 1.

842
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Yeah, you did.

843
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
I get distracted by the poop.

844
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
the

845
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
the

846
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,600
the

847
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
the

848
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,600
the

849
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,600
the

850
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,600
the

851
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
the

852
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,600
the

853
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,600
the

854
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
the

855
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,600
the

856
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
the

857
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,600
the

858
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:30,600
the

859
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:45,600
this

860

1161
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,220
Hmm.

01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:13,660
Hey, hold on and I pull out a thing of Tums

1216
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,900
There you go, man, this is this'll fucking save your life

1217
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:26,320
He takes the Tom's ik I I got it he goes back into the top of God's your room it just fills it with shit

1218
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,700
and

1219
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,800
He points down to the B button

1220
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:40,440
Yeah, okay cool, yeah, it cleans up the poop and he goes down he's like I don't know why we we let ourselves

1221
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,500
Sleep in our filth

1222
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,180
We did that

1223
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,980
Money

1224
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:57,460
Yeah, well, there's only one door left and a head should be where the inward pass lies

1225
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:04,580
Are you already I'm gonna use my last hit dice to heal up do I have another hit I

1226
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:10,300
Have one left. So I'm just gonna use that and try and get to oh I have none. Okay, I didn't get to full

1227
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:16,840
I'm at 45 now. I have two left. I'm gonna use them both. Wait, it said I'd well, I'm at 39. I'm still good

1228
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:32,160
Okay, all right guys, let's go shut up somebody

1229
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:36,140
Okay

1230
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,220
see you guys walk through this door and

1231
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:44,680
It's this beautiful silver door and you opens you up into this final room

1232
01:15:44,680 --> 01:16:04,740
A picture of it for later at the post

1233
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:15,720
If you see these these four magnificent staircases and you see these massive

1234
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,300
statues of

1235
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,660
Celebrities gone, you know celebrities from the past who?

1236
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:28,700
Have used the n-word pass in its most rudimentary form like suchi puchi said earlier

1237
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:36,180
He's like these people were revered for taking advantage of realities shifting powers of the n-word pass

1238
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:49,860
And as you sort of walk by each of them, you can hear like a little tidbit like a radio, like a fucking Disney fucking hall of presidents thing.

1239
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,860
You guys want to check any of them out?

1240
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,860
I want to hear them all.

1241
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:57,860
You have to say them.

1242
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,860
Every single one.

1243
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:05,860
Okay, we'll start from the... yeah, you guys walk past the Jennifer Lopez one.

1244
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:16,980
In 2001, when the Puerto Rican singer used the n-word in her hit song with "I'm Real,

1245
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:20,300
Murder Remix," she was quickly condemned for her lyrics.

1246
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,020
"For anyone to think or suggest to say that I'm racist is really absurd and hurtful to

1247
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,940
me," she responded to the criticism.

1248
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:31,900
The use of the n-word in the song, which was actually written by Ja Rule, was never meant

1249
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,380
to be hurtful to anyone in any any way.

1250
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:37,580
And you really think they'd have done it?

1251
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,300
Second, you didn't get that one.

1252
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,100
Yeah, she didn't.

1253
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:46,300
The DM copied these from a really bad tablet website.

1254
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:50,660
You see, she didn't even have to apologize.

1255
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:54,220
She basically just said, well, the black guy wrote it for me.

1256
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,020
That's the power of the N word bass.

1257
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,700
you guys walk by the uh...

1258
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,340
tim allen one

1259
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:06,380
home improvement star tim allen stirred up controversy after he openly talked

1260
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:09,340
about why he should be able to use the n_ word

1261
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:13,820
i've had this argument on stage a million times allen told the temp pay times

1262
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:17,980
i do a movie with martin warren's and pretty soon they're referring to me

1263
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,180
hey my

1264
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,320
uh... cameron can you please be used for this

1265
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,300
i'm not gonna say it in real life but i've

1266
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,540
people make this better i think

1267
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,300
maybe not only that i don't think you want i don't know i don't know i was

1268
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,060
headed that it implies that he said it though you're probably just christ

1269
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:35,380
patches what the hell is that man

1270
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:39,100
i do a movie with martin lahr it's been pretty soon the referring to me

1271
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:42,300
hey my and words up except he says the word

1272
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,980
so i'm the n_ word if i'm around you guys but seven feet away if i say n word

1273
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,100
it's not right

1274
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:55,100
it's a very confusing to the european mind how that works

1275
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,100
*laughter*

1276
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,100
oh fuck

1277
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,100
uh

1278
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,100
you walk by Gwyneth Paltrow's statue

1279
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,100
the goop founder can't seem to avoid the

1280
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,100
oh i'm trying to do the voice

1281
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,100
the goop founder can't seem to avoid the faux pas

1282
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,100
Gwyneth came under fire last year

1283
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,100
when she tweeted a photo from backstage

1284
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,100
at a watch the throne concert

1285
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,100
with the caption

1286
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,100
n words in paris for real

1287
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:21,100
after

1288
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,100
after unleashing a fury online

1289
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:38,100
the

1290
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,600
Yes, they're not like a more recent guy who did this.

1291
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,100
So I'm kind of like space crab or something.

1292
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:49,100
Yeah, you walk by Lenny the space crab.

1293
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,600
There is I remember that one.

1294
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,600
Yeah, it was just patches.

1295
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,100
Who's this guy?

1296
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,100
Please, I have one for each one of them.

1297
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,600
Oh, never mind.

1298
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,600
That's no Gibson.

1299
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:27,280
the

1300
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,040
of Quentin Tarantino, the king of the N-word pass.

1301
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,760
He was able to say it as many times as he wanted.

1302
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,020
He can make anybody say it.

1303
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:41,360
The only white man to ever do it.

1304
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:48,440
And you see hanging on him like a lanyard is the N-word pass in all of its glory.

1305
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
This pass is going to...

1306
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:55,440
You know, this power is maybe too great for most.

1307
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,440
But...

1308
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:04,440
I will be able to use it every so often, just to restore a few members of the Tamagotchi civilization.

1309
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
There you go.

1310
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,440
Okay, I just...

1311
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,440
Thank you.

1312
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,440
We will not seek domination, I promise.

1313
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,440
You got the pass.

1314
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:16,440
I grab the pass from him, and I say,

1315
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:23,440
it

1316
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:41,440
the

1317
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:53,880
the

1318
01:21:53,880 --> 01:22:13,600
as

1319
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:25,480
all

1320
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:37,760
one

1321
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,140
would never betray you and I turn to nothing and I say and we'll have a talk

1322
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:48,920
about this when we get home I didn't do anything so if Sullivan didn't do it and

1323
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:56,500
nothing didn't do it the double agent must have been Jim oh my god Jim you were a

1324
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:03,540
bad guy the whole time um sure sure yeah I mean so you admit you're bad I shoot

1325
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,940
Jim in the face before before he has a moment to do anything.

1326
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:07,940
Okay,

1327
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,540
we're on this attack 1819 nice.

1328
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,040
14.

1329
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,040
Hey,

1330
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,940
not bad.

1331
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,240
Yeah, okay.

1332
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,640
All right.

1333
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,740
So I would say that you don't get him by surprise.

1334
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,640
He's kind of expecting you to attack him just because of like

1335
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,240
where you're

1336
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:33,540
You know what I mean? It's not like he didn't see it coming.

1337
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,340
He got a 22 on his initiative roll.

1338
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:39,340
So let me get him in here.

1339
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,240
Give me one.

1340
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,840
He's probably pretty easy to kill.

1341
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:46,040
Oh shit.

1342
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,540
Well, we got him pretty good last time.

1343
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:48,540
He's just like a guy.

1344
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,340
Where is he?

1345
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,140
Yeah, wait, how did we get him last time?

1346
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:57,340
I'm going to use that same ability again, dude.

1347
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,140
Just you wait.

1348
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:58,740
All right.

1349
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,340
I'm going to.

1350
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:00,140
I trust you.

1351
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,720
I'm gonna fuck him up.

1352
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,720
Take him down, dude.

1353
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,720
Mmm, shit.

1354
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,720
I thought I had him.

1355
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,720
Where'd you go, Jim?

1356
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:11,720
Looks like you don't even exist, Jim.

1357
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,200
Jim, you exist less than nothing.

1358
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,200
I win by default.

1359
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,200
Nope, nope, I exist.

1360
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,200
Fuck!

1361
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,200
No.

1362
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,200
Yeah, what if you don't, though?

1363
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,200
Yeah, what if you didn't exist?

1364
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,200
Yeah, prove it.

1365
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,200
Prove you exist.

1366
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:29,040
Tell me one ability you can do.

1367
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:44,040
So he runs towards you, Blotas, and he takes out an office pen and, let's see how he does.

1368
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
Yeah, that hits you.

1369
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,040
Dammit.

1370
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,040
You got 21.

1371
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:57,160
And he elbows you in the gut and roll a, he basically like elbowed you in the gut and

1372
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:04,160
is

1373
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,360
just to see if you can or slight of hand maybe even.

1374
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,260
That's fine.

1375
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:12,160
Yeah, either way he's able to grab the inward pass from you

1376
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:20,760
and you see bursting out of the another side of the place now

1377
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:26,840
is the five Crayola ninjas and you see them them all stand on

1378
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,440
top of each other and then all of them like to form and they

1379
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,040
they start to glow and you see Snoochie Boochie's like, oh,

1380
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:48,140
the

1381
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:54,880
It's not colored in but it's really sick. And that's what the they turned into. They see Jim with the inward pass. He says

1382
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,440
See now I can remake reality

1383
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,420
it's going to be

1384
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,940

01:26:17,340 --> 01:26:20,540
And your sound goes deaf.

1388
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:24,840
You can't hear what he's screaming and you see the suchi

1389
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,340
buchi's go.

1390
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:30,340
No, like his mouth is silent as he's yelling it and you see

1391
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:35,040
Jim scream and then like nothing happens and then he's like

1392
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,240
I've been like anime like when you like the heartbeats again,

1393
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:42,240

1394
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:46,340
what's what's happening to me and you see him like he's like

1395
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:51,420
transforming and he said he wished he wanted to remake his reality so he could

1396
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:56,580
be the boss but he is a mere mortal he cannot handle such things you see him

1397
01:26:56,580 --> 01:27:00,980
like transforming and and he's like growing bigger and bigger and his arms

1398
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:05,420
he's like breaking through his clothes he's butt-naked now he's like 10 feet

1399
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:14,420
tall and then you see like more clothes start to grow on him and it's like weird

1400
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:20,980
it's like coming out of his skin and it looks like some sort of brown suit and then a yellow

1401
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:25,380
shirt underneath and his head begins to morph and change.

1402
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,660
Oh my god.

1403
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:33,900
Out of his cheekbones, blood, bloody glasses pop out of his head and his hair, his wonderful

1404
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:41,020
lacrosse player flow just like recedes and becomes like this square cut on his head and

1405
01:27:42,020 --> 01:28:02,420
is

1406
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:11,860
call him a Dwight again for psychic damage. Shut up, no! I'll let that do psychic damage

1407
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:20,220
the first couple times. What do I roll? Just roll 1d4 and see how much you do. I like that.

1410
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:47,180
for

1411
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:54,180
and

1412
01:28:54,180 --> 01:29:06,620
the

1413
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:09,680
you can't really get around all this feed you can't really figure out how to tie

1414
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,760
it together it's like too big it becomes like a conceptual exercise to imagine

1415
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:19,100
tying something that big you're not really able to do it that's what your

1416
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:26,100
action for the turn you get some move since he's that big I'm gonna just like

1417
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:33,200
jump on his leg okay I'll be wrapping your movement I'm gonna grab his leg you

1418
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,680
You can like jump onto his like foot I would say.

1419
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,680
Okay then I do that.

1420
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,120
Okay yeah so he's like that big.

1421
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,640
So you jump onto his foot.

1422
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:50,720
And now it is the uh, it is now your turn, Blotas.

1423
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:59,800
Alright, um, I'm gonna use the same spell that I used on him before.

1424
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,800
I should say, by the way, N-word passes.

1425
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,800
It's like, just really tiny compared to him.

1426
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,800
Oh, okay.

1427
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:08,800
Yeah.

1428
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,800
Yeah.

1429
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,800
Okay.

1430
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
I'm going to use mental prison on him.

1431
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,800
Nice.

1432
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:19,800
Okay, describe, put mental prison in the chat and describe it.

1433
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,800
Describe what your prison is.

1434
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,800
Let's see what mental prison is.

1435
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,800
I can't figure out, there we go.

1436
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,800
Yeah.

1437
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,800
Do I read, should I read what it says?

1438
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,800
No, I can read that.

1439
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:38,800
My mental prison is because he's still freaking out that he's Dwight. This is the only prison I need, right? He's just in a room and there's a mirror.

1440
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,800
Damn.

1441
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,800
Yeah, it's deep.

1442
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,800
Damn.

1443
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:44,800
Yeah.

1444
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:54,800
Okay, and it is a Charisma, a Spell Save DC of 14 against his, I think it's his Charisma, right? Let's see.

1445
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,800
Intelligence.

1446
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,520
Is intelligence? Yeah. All right, cool

1447
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,900
He's pretty smart. Let's see how he does

1448
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:05,480
He's a Dwight

1449
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,480
Yeah, no, he's able to save

1450
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:11,720
But he's still 5d 10 damage, yeah

1451
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:15,200
It's a roll for that

1452
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:24,680
20 is it 5d 10? Yeah, I'm a successful. He still takes 5d 10. Yeah

1453
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:30,380
And so he sees the mirror break briefly and then it shatters in front of him

1454
01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:34,400
And he's still very fucking mentally hurt by that

1455
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:43,560
Do you know how much techno slam that cost it doesn't say on my thing. Oh, whoops. That's it's that's for one

1456
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,000

1457
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,160

1458
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:55,000

You're fine.

1579
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,400
He said probably.

1580
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,120

Easy.

1592
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:47,200
Why didn't you give more than one of us healing?

1593
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:48,200
Right, what the fuck?

1594
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,200
Yeah, it is your fault, you gave us all that teleporting and the worms.

1595
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:54,200
Why didn't you give us unlimited health?

1596
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,200
You asshole.

1597
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,200
Inside that puzzle was a bunch of health potions.

1598
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:07,000
Uh, yeah, it is now, uh, well, let's actually start with you, Patrick, you had a death saving

1599
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
throw.

1600
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,120
What do I roll?

1601
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,120
Just hit death save?

1602
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,760
Just d20, yeah, hit death save.

1603
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,760
18.

1604
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:13,760
Nice.

1605
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,760
Let's go.

1606
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,760
It's a victory.

1607
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,960
Okay, it is now your turn, Blotas, right?

1608
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:20,960
Or, yeah, yeah.

1609
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:28,200
Uh, alright, well, I'm just gonna use mental prison again.

1610
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,200
Because it does a lot of damage.

1611
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
So he's going to try to resist it.

1612
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,200
He doesn't manage to resist it.

1613
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:38,200
You made Pennsylvania Jim OP.

1614
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,200
He doesn't resist it.

1615
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,200
Yes, dude.

1616
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:43,200
Describe it. What do you do?

1617
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,200
This prison, he's in Jell-O.

1618
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:51,200
And he can just see a giant eye looking in at him.

1619
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,200
He's like, "Blech!"

1620
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,200
He's like screaming as he looks in this.

1621
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:00,640
So he is like completely trapped. His brain is trapped in it.

1622
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:07,680
He also takes 5d10. Yeah, he takes 5d10 and he is perceiving himself to be inside

1623
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:10,960
of this jello and he can't really, there's nothing he

1624
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,120
can like sort of perceive beyond it.

1625
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,080
If he tries to move beyond it or make an attack through it,

1626
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:24,480
you know, or reaches any of his body through this illusion

1627
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,480
perfectly encapsulated by the jello

1628
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,200
He takes 10 d10 damage

1629
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:32,640
Yeah, baby, which is pretty crazy

1630
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,060
Can I yeah, what's now that I cast that spell? Can I also try and stabilize?

1631
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:46,000
Somebody or is that like no, that's your that's sort of it. All right. Okay, so he's now I mean that was a fucking killer move. Um,

1632
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,800
Not killer killer, but he's he's looking he's pretty fucking killer

1633
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:54,840
All right, you drew... all right, I'm just not even gonna say what that is.

1634
01:40:54,840 --> 01:41:01,140
So, uh, it is now, um, your turn, uh, Ray William Johnson.

1635
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:03,440
- All right. - Uh, roll Death Saving Throw.

1636
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,940
Death Save, let's go.

1637
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,240
This is easy for you, dude, come on.

1638
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,140

1639
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,040
- Nice. - Yeah, you're saved.

1640
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,540
Okay, cool.

1641
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:16,740
It is now the Crayola's turn. It's going to try to use its Crayola drills

1642
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:19,140
to drill into Snoochie Boochies.

1643
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:25,220
Okay, it hits and it does a not insignificant amount of damage

1644
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:29,300
Okay, so chibuji's is looking okay

1645
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,180
Uh, but he's gonna try to attack sushi buchi's again

1646
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:34,340
with the drill

1647
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:37,460
He no, he's not and that hits as well

1648
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:44,260
And that's another bit of damage there. So you're looking fine. He's looking pretty bruised though as he's fighting

01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:47,800
Uh, the his civilization's mortal enemy the crayolas

he would be screaming and crying and trying to climb his way out i know he

1692
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,180

1704
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,860
usually correct his brain open and what he tries to climb out of the the jello

1705
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:58,260
yeah and he just

1706
01:43:58,260 --> 01:44:01,420
he doesn't look up when he's climbing and he climbs right

1707
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:04,980
into a state where and it just staples into his head and kills him

1708
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,940
speech

1709
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:14,540
you watch as his head like like just indents and punctures as if a stapler was in there

1710
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:22,220
like the sheer his sheer belief in that happening and psychic pain made him feel like his head just

1711
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:29,900
like got stapled and he's just bloody on the floor and you watch his body like shrink back down the

1712
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:36,300
normal size and you see a dead pennsylvania gym with an n-word pass in his hand run over a night

1713
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:54,220
to

1714
01:44:54,220 --> 01:45:04,420
me die. 8. Ok it's a negative. Fuck it. Perfect 20. That counts as 2 wins. So you're stabilized.

1715
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:12,780
Fuck me. Just let me die. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Nevermind I have to live. I need to

1716
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:23,060
see him grow up. I'm sitting here just like. Unconscious and still doing that. Making that

1717
01:45:23,060 --> 01:45:40,300
a

1718
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:41,300
Watch your language.

1719
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,300
Okay, yeah.

1720
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:45,300
That hits him, and he does it again.

1721
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:46,300
And...

1722
01:45:46,300 --> 01:45:47,300
That does not hit him.

1723
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:56,060
So he shoots a rainbow beam at him and it, like, sprays him a bit.

1724
01:45:56,060 --> 01:46:00,380
And then, uh, he shoots it again and it misses this time.

1725
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:03,140
Suchi Buchi fights back.

1746
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:05,300
damage to be like in the first to kill me then

1747
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:08,040
in this chance that i mean

1748
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:12,460
means that could have done me at pat pockets sucked it we lifted

01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:42,720
he kind of looks it in this moment.

1810
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:47,600
He looks just like drained of his health and life

1811
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,440
after doing something like that.

1812
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:53,080

01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:41,460
we're gonna have to figure out what happens next campaign

1898
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:43,560
when it's the uh... richie rich

1899
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:49,140
gun city rich rich and ray william johnson is a single

1900
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:51,760
johnson

1901
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:55,300
what do you mean a single mom on the one who made so i want a divorce

1902
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,260
uh...

1903
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,700
okay then i get it

1904
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,900
keep the kid because it's mine and not even yours at all.

1905
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,400
Even like a little bit.

1906
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,400
I have nothing.

1907
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:08,900
We can go to court if you want.

1908
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:12,260
I have absolutely nothing.

1909
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:13,260
And yeah.

1910
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:14,260
I unplug myself.

1911
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:19,140
I don't have a dramatic ending for this one like I did for the other one.

1912
01:59:19,140 --> 01:59:20,140
I don't really have one.

1913
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:22,140
I think this one was too crazy.

1914
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:25,020
So I go outside.

1915
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:26,880
I go with him.

1916
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:33,600
We all go outside, I look for the first white guy I see walking on the street, and I hand

1917
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:39,880
him the counterfeit n-word pass, just wink, and then vanish.

1918
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:40,880
Thank you.

1919
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:41,880
It's Robot Kramer.

1920
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:42,880
And scene.

1921
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:43,880
No, what's up?

1922
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:44,880
I knockout game him.

1923
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:45,880
Yeah, you bitch, you thought.

1924
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,880
Not on me.

1925
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:53,880
the

1926
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:59,840
not on this island

1927
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,800
for the

1928
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:01,880
the camera

1929
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:04,480
heads out here

1930
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,340
for the

1931
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:07,140
it's really a cheap

1932
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:14,140
the

1933
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:30,380
That's right, that's the whole adventure of Gun City and the Temple of The Penguin of Doom.

1934
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:34,020
Pretty unsatisfying ending, wouldn't you say?

1935
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:40,660
Well, here's an epilogue that will be a little bit better.

1936
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:46,440
With their newfound wealth, Ray William Johnson and Blotos Pishav married and decided to raise

1937
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:48,760
New Sullivan as their son.

1938
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:53,280
Ray William Johnson is a deadbeat dad who keeps trying to buy New Sullivan's love with copies

1939
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:58,760
of Gran Turismo 4, and Blotos has become a relentless career woman and supermom who just

1940
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:00,540
wants to have it all.

1941
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:05,580
They rent a studio apartment, a luxury in Gun City near Tiananmen Cube, where they spend

1942
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:11,940
their off time bullying teens in Dematrix 2 and laughing at New Sullivan's antics.

1943
02:01:11,940 --> 02:01:17,020
When the call for adventure comes again, will they rise to the occasion?

1944
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:23,180
Meanwhile, their old pal Patrick Yoda uses some of his tokens to build a huge hoverboard

1945
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:26,940
park under the Terry Shivell Memorial Cyber Highway.

1946
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:31,060
He tricks the city into thinking it's for the community, but he's the only one allowed

1947
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:32,060
to enter.

1948
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:35,640
The rest of his money is used to purchase a sandwich.

1949
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:40,560
They occasionally get together and talk about their time as adventurers and detectives, hoping

1950
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,020
they never have to do that kind of thing ever again.

1951
02:01:44,020 --> 02:01:47,260
And who was that other guy that was around?

1952
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:49,260
Probably nothing.

1953
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:55,220
Speaking of which, Sullivan the Frog, aka Crud, aka Nothing, left the adventuring assistant's

1954
02:01:55,220 --> 02:02:00,580
life for stardom in Gadsville, where King Gad employed him as a court idol.

1955
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:05,540
After experiencing a perfect blue type of scenario, Sullivan decided that Idle Life wasn't for

1956
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:10,660
him and he worked instead as a producer behind the scenes, producing hit songs such as "Kiki

1957
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:16,220
Do You Love Me Riding" and "Santoria" as performed by Haseki Tsune on her latest record,

1958
02:02:16,220 --> 02:02:20,100
Back From The Clink II - The Kawaii Desu Experience.

1959
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:24,620
Baby Gadd meanwhile left Gaddsville to go to Bullet Town, where he hopes his desire to

1960
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:27,780
be a great fight promoter will be more appreciated.

1961
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:30,420
King Gadd was devastated at his loss.

1962
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:33,960
you know, of his son going somewhere.

1963
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:38,920
"Leroy Peanutbutter and his 300 wives rule the rails and the soy wastes.

1964
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,680
No business ventures have been able to grow out there and it once again becomes

1965
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,560
an abandoned wasteland

1966
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,320
where freezing,

1967
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,840
poisonous soy pollutes the air.

1968
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:53,520
Suck-ass shit and the other whovians do their best to survive without this

1969
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,520
once profitable train rail."

1970
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,520
It's now, you know,

1971
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,840
now it's Leroy's.

1972
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:03,680
by establishing a trading relationship with Leroyder, where they give him a new wife and

1973
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:05,160
he gives them Lunchables.

1974
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:08,400
So far there has been no issue.

1975
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:13,000
With the endgage acquired and no one questioning his motives throughout the whole campaign,

1976
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,480
Leo the Collector was free to invade Sky Island, where he has since enslaved leprechauns who

1977
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:19,680
live there.

1978
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:24,720
Leo's goal of conquering all of the Sky Islands above Gun City is nearer to completion, and

1979
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:29,440
with Poppy Chuko and the Mad Suckler under the way, it'll be easier than he even imagined.

1980
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,320
Or so he thinks.

1981
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:35,700
With Gary C. Enterprises' hopes of opening a hot soda and cold dogs restaurant in the

1982
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:41,300
soy waste, or a cold dogs and hot soda, I don't remember the order, the lad returns

1983
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,360
to Dematrix 2 to expand his business.

1984
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:50,340
His partner, he partners with John Carlo the Bullfrog, who's only grown in power since

1985
02:03:50,340 --> 02:03:55,060
the last adventure and the business expands throughout Gun City but without our hero's

1986
02:03:55,060 --> 02:04:00,940
involvement. Stoogey Boogey now lives in solitude in his temple of doom where he hopes to regrow

1987
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:05,920
his civilization. The VR penguins have become his new countrymen while he slowly rebuilds

1988
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:12,920
the once great Tamagotchi people. The ramifications of such a thing, who can say?

1989
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:15,920
The god of Popo died.

1990
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:21,920
Lurking in the shadows of Gun City, however, are new foes and old foes,

1991
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:26,920
and old friends who've become foes, and also the other way around where the foes become the friends.

1992
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:29,920
What lies in wait for our heroes in leisure?

1993
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,920
What of Tullateralis and the Order of the Penis,

1994
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,920
and the mad Suckler still licking his wounds?

1995
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,920
Only time will tell.

1996
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:41,920
But I will say this.

1997
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:44,920
"Cameron will not be able to teleport at will."

1998
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:47,920
It has been driving me insane how I wrote that rule.

1999
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:51,920
So I thought it would be like as a bonus action in combat, right?

2000
02:04:51,920 --> 02:04:52,920
Then you get to teleport.

2001
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:58,920
But I then remember moving it because I was like, "Okay, well I don't want to move that's only usable in like a combat state."

2002
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:01,920
"I don't really like keeping track of that state in D&D."

2003
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:05,920
"It's a TTRPG, right? So things can be more fluid."

2004
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,920
"You know, role initiative is not strictly for combat."

2005
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,920
So I just was like, "I don't want that to be tied to that."

2006
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:35,920
I'm

2007
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,920
I'm really tired and I'm so horny.
