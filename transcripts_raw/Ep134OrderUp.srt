00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,360
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,200
- There it is.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,240
- That's how they used to start Power Rangers in space

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,280
is five, five, five, I think.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,200
- It's too scary for me when they put beloved characters

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,040
in space.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,240
How they gonna breathe?

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,160
- Yeah.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,360
- Leprechaun in space?

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,280
I don't think so.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,720
There's no rainbows up there.

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,760
yeah golden space he can't breathe in space because he's magic never mind

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
he's okay he's not a leprechaun is a magic he's short exactly no they do

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,560
count it down in the pad they don't say five five five I think I think one of

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,000
them I think when they're because they have like they're thinking of phone

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,640
numbers from movies maybe but I think they're their wrists some of them do

20
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,640
five five five I don't remember I haven't seen it in a long time I got

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,920
Power Rangers on the brain. Why? Have you defeated a big... No, I found a Zord in my

22
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,540
backyard. Did you defeat him? No. Why would I defeat it? I don't know what a Zord is.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,700
Zoids. You remember Zoids? Zoids is one of the best shows of all time. I never watched Zoids, but I

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,540
had a game for it for a Game Boy Advance. Zoids was the ultimate Toonami show.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,240
Oh yeah, that's why I didn't see it. You didn't watch Toonami, dude? No, I hated

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,040
Toonami I like to swim better. Because it wasn't some funny bullcrap about it?

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,400
No it wasn't. No you know the only... It didn't have Meatwad in it? Yeah the only

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,360
thing I liked on Toonami was Bobobo Bobobo Bobobo. That has to be the most

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,080
racist show of all time right? Is it? Bobobo Bobobo Bobobo the Japanese show

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,120
about a guy who uses his afro to defeat enemies? Look I was like in third

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah, no, it's basically going to change everything for us. Money-wise, we can't disclose an exact

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,480
number, but substantial. We'll say that much. We're making a lot of money on this.

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Even for us, this might be too big. Might be too much money.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,800
Yeah. I mean, we're small enough that this is like gonna push us over the edge.

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,120
Patrick's gonna have enough money to like pay a scientist to correct his sleep cycle artificially and it's gonna ruin the podcast forever

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Yeah, that kind of deal. Yeah. Yeah, dr. Dr. Dr. Melatonin. Yeah, he's gonna put a bunch of blue Z's in your mouth

57
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,640
After going to like a doctor to be like hey like a doc like I can't ever sleep there

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,400
I think there's something wrong with me. Just like hey, have you tried not using your phone and Patrick's like, oh

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, that's why I got these blue light blockers glasses

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
You have blue light blocker glasses?

61
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,680
I was thinking of getting those but then someone told me that you can just set your monitor

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,840
to a different color temperature and it works exactly.

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
Yeah, there's one built into the iPhone.

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Yeah.

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
It's called Night Shift.

66
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Yeah, I didn't know about the Night Shift.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't know that it was just what blue blockers did.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have it on all the time.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't know that.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's why I fall asleep everywhere.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, now...

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,280
I had it on my laptop for a while but it would go, it would like glitch out and I'd be watching

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,440
movies and it would just change everything to like insane colors. Yeah it

75
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,040
does change that's what I love about it is I'll like have it on when I play a

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,120
game late at night and I just can't see anything because it's just orange. Right

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,360
yeah but it'll also be like suddenly like one thing on the screen like turns

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,000
bright green for no reason. I feel like I'm in a Sunny D commercial playing

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Valorant. It's fucking rules dude but I can fall asleep instantly dude texting

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:06,260

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,860
like why are you want to eat a kangaroo so bad dude I don't know if I want not a

104
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,780
kangaroos in Australia breeding a desert so cool dude it doesn't just like guru

105
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,180
yeah yeah the way you get that as you put candy in its power it's kind of like

106
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,580
you put candy in the passion it absorbs it into it yeah yeah it's kind of like

107
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,380
your muscular frosting it's kind of like Pokemon where if like it's it's holding

108
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,380
something or it has something in its pouch.

109
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,220
- Oh yeah, yeah.

110
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,760
- Once it evolves, it turns into that.

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
So if you put a bunch of candy in its pouch,

112
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
you'll get a candy roo.

113
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,940
- A candy roo, yeah.

114
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,760
- If you put like--

115
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,260
- Isn't a candy roo that fish that crawls up your pee hole?

116
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,100
- Is that it?

117
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,260
Is that the name of it? - A candy roo?

118
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,100
(laughing)

119
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,920
- That's what it's called.

120
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,440
- That's gotta be the biggest like discrepancy

121
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,600
between name and thing that it does of all time.

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,440
- Oh yeah, I think that is.

123
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,080
- Yeah, it's called a candy roo.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,640
Dude, I want a candy roo.

125
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,560
Also known as a caniero, a toothpick fish, or a vampire fish.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,060
Does it give you sweet pee?

127
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,620
No, it goes up, it can swim up your pee- I've talked about it before, it can swim up your

128
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,440
pee stream, and then it gets in the hole and your meatus goes through the meatus into the

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
urethra.

130
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,660
It could not swim up my pee stream, not in a thousand-

131
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,660
No, it could.

132
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
No, it could.

133
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
You should see-

134
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,660
It can swim up, and then once it gets-

135
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,660
You got a lazy stream.

136
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
You should see my fucking stream, dude.

137
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,660
Your stream goes inwards.

138
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
It gets stuck in and it's got like-

139
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
No.

140
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
Yeah, my stream-

141
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,700
You suck water up out of the toilet with it.

142
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,500
My stream is like a, it's like a, like shooting a hole in an airplane.

143
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,380
Everything's just fucking flying out maximum velocity.

144
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:43,880
Blood?

145
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,120
Blood, piss, shit, everything.

146
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,620
Fishes?

147
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,420
Yeah, the fishes that have climbed up there previously.

148
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:50,920
Bones.

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,760
No, and that thing, when that thing gets stuck up there though, it's got like, I think it's

150
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,580
like something in its gills or something, it's got like spikes on the side of it.

151
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,820
Yeah, so you can't pull it out.

152
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,260
Yeah, so if you pull it out, you're bleeding out your thing.

153
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,460
That would feel good to me.

154
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Yeah?

155
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,620
Yeah, it's ribbed for my pleasure, dude. I want that fish in my wiener ASAP.

156
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,260
You think there's guys who are into sounding that have gone to like rivers?

157
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,100
There's guys who are into everybody--

158
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,700
No, no, you did-- let me finish.

159
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,420
Okay.

160
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,900
You think there's guys that are into sounding that go to the a river in Peru

161
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,980
just to pee in the stream with the hopes that a toothpick fish swims up?

162
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,380
Um, yes.

163
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:26,880
Yeah.

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,020
Those guys, yeah. There is a guy who thinks that the candy roo is-- it's not called a candy roo.

165
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,140
It's called the candy roo.

166
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:43,500
Zandru but not candy space rue. I'm reading this article about for on BBC about how um

167
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,620
about just like whether it's a myth or not what they do and listen to this this is a

168
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,380
this is a quote from the 19th century when they discovered it. Okay. The candy rue is

169
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
very small but uniquely occupied in doing evil.

170
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:04,960
A bitch that only knows evil and pain.

171
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,180
The German botanist Carl Frederick Philipp von Martius was the first European to document

172
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,580
candirus in the Amazon.

173
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,100
He described how local men tied their urethra shut when spending time around the water.

174
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,860
I think I'm safe.

175
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,740
Yeah, you live in America and you don't even take baths.

176
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,820
if I do if I go you take my baby if I go to Peru and I pee in a stream I can just

177
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,740
I can just get a clamp put it on my put it on my f-skin okay but listen to this

178
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,740
though this is where this is why that wouldn't work why I'll just be the

179
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,700
authors mostly focus on the vulnerability of penises to attack

180
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,460
perhaps because they themselves are all men but many emphasize that the fish do

181
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,580
not discriminate and will happily enter a convenient vagina or anus oh my god

182
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,100
If you're peeing out your butt off the side of a boat it can jump up in your thing.

183
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,660
Do you have to walk in all fucking corked up like Spongebob when he has his suds?

184
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,340
Just trying to not get a fucking candy ruin.

185
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,340
What is the solution?

186
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,340
Just don't swim.

187
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Yeah, don't go in the water.

188
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
What is wrong with you dude?

189
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Don't fucking swim in Peru.

190
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,740
When in Peru I guess I have to swim.

191
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,540
The rivers are so famous for how beautiful the water is.

192
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,140
Dude, this sucks so much.

193
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:23,460
I have to put a big cork in my wiener and I have to tie my butthole shut.

194
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,420
Yeah, sometimes it's worth it even though the water's infested with wiener demons.

195
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm just gonna swim it anyway.

196
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Trust me, trust me.

197
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,060
It's like floating in the Dead Sea, except instead of all the things that are cool about

198
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,820
the Dead Sea, it gives you a dead pee.

199
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
There's an actual evil fish.

200
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Yeah.

201
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Yeah.

202
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:54,980
the BBC describes as evil. I thought piranha would be the most evil fish but no.

203
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,940
No because they just eat stuff. They don't. Yeah. I want a candiru.

204
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,220
They're like little centibites dude. They want to, they're trying to pleasure you

205
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,900
and pain you at the same time. I want it to climb in my ass halfway and then I

206
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,340
become like a Peruvian version of Tanuki Mario.

207
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,860
Well if you take it. I can use it like a tail and I can swim.

208
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,060
I can fly. I can fly. If you poop while a candy roo is in your butt does it does you think it just eats it?

209
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,460
It eats all the poop yeah. Yeah. Well there's that's that's how evil they are.

210
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,740
They're so evil they like poop. It's like Pokemon again where there's a male and female version

211
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,220
that are different and one of them eats pee and one of them eats poo. Oh okay. And it's if you

212
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,700
use a pee stone on one or if you use a poo stone. And you don't want it to evolve in your ass. It's

213
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:55,080
exactly like Pokemon in that it's like it's like slow bro exactly yeah it's like

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,560
slow bro and Pokemon snap you have to like put an apple in front of somebody

215
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,420
so they put their butt in front of the water I would I would be fooling people

216
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,340

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,060

223
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:45,820
Yeah, they'll be like sucks it out. Why are those little fish in there looking at me get undressed and smiling?

224
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Yeah, they like

225
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,860
Yeah, why are they arranged like a school of piranhas but only when I unzip

226
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,060
Licking its lips when it sees me

227
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:04,220
Yeah, why are they forming together like a giant smiley face

228
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,740
Gee I don't know again my brother is right down the street

229
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,640
Go look for him. Yeah, you should dive through the mouth here. Yeah, this is a coupon that I have

230
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,800
It says penis demon removal

231
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,580
Yeah, what does this sign mean? It's like

232
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,460
There's a little like stick man

233
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah, oh, yeah, that's it's trying to warn you of all the prostitutes

234
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,480
This river he used to be a fluffer on porn sets, but then he moved to Peru and he's making a killing

235
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,700
He sucks the demon the penis demon right out you yeah

236
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,860
Man, can you imagine just this pure suction that has to happen on your penis to get a fish out of it?

237
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,860
Yeah, oh my god, especially when it's like ribbed

238
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:09,340
I can't get any out of my wiener if it's stuck one guy prostate one guy keeps coming back to the the clinic like

239
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:19,420
Okay

240
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:30,160
Raymond I'm stuck in the penis Raymond. I'm stuck in your penis. I swam up your p-stream Raymond

241
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,540
That would be a terrifying new version of honey. I shrunk the kids

242
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:43,220
Yeah, it's inside your penis it's kind of like an osmosis jones movie though, you know, that's what

243
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:54,420
You know, I'm just spitballing here fish rock who would be who would be the Kelsey Grammer character what would that like the dricks

244
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,300
That would be the doctor's tongue that slides down the penis hole. Yeah

245
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,500
and it has to grab the fish. That's voiced by Oprah Winfrey. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

246
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,220
Let's build out this, let's expand this cast. Okay. Bill Murray reprises his

247
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,460
role from Osmosis Jones. I think there should be different, there should also be

248
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,340
different like doctors use like different techniques. Like I think we

249
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,340
could have like, like you know, there's the guy who just sucks it out but then

250
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,700
maybe like we could have Sam Elliott is like kind of a cowboy doctor and uses a

251
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,020
lasso to pull it out yeah that's a really good idea he's got like a tiny he's like

252
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:39,620
well he got a fish in that layer pecker he got it makes it a lasso at a dental

253
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,500
floss and he just perfectly bullseyes it through and then he's and then he or he

254
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,900
sucks it out and then he spits it yeah into a spittoon right well yeah I don't

255
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:57,680
mean that I think a cowboy doctor is a good idea Brian Cranston could

256
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,300
kind of play like the straight doctor because I need more Bryan Cranston it's

257
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:08,460
been a while since he did something we could have like you know maybe Mickey

258
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,840
Rooney could play like a samurai that's like that's a pretty good idea yeah

259
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,080
samurai doctor and he does the thing where he like runs back and forth and

260
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,360
then the fish falls out like a bunch of pieces that's a really good idea we could

261
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,360
have Creed from the movie Creed yeah yeah he's a boxing doctor and he could punch

262
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,200
it out he punches he punches he does a speed bag he does a speed bag thing on his nuts and it creates

263
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,200
so much pressure that it shoots out the fish weiner throws oh that's so smart actually huh yeah

264
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,680
how did they actually have like a robot doctor like chappy yeah play but yeah chappy could make

265
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,200
another appearance candy rue removal and d and where to of course you can't have one without

266
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,600
the other dude oh here's a video of sucking it out no it's a somebody

267
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,100
getting its candy removal the video contains graphic images I don't think so

268
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,020
there's no way yeah maybe if you maybe you blow into the pee hole and it comes

269
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,380
out the butt oh they have like a oh man they got a little camera on a device and

270
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:16,340
they have to oh I think the camera is the device oh man why are you rubbing your

271
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
hands together like Birdman.

272
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Oh this is so gross.

273
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,340
You love that shit.

274
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
This is not going to make me act up.

275
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Why are you cocking one eyebrow?

276
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Oh dude this is so gross.

277
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
(Laughter)

278
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Yo that's the nastiest shit I've ever seen.

279
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
(Laughter)

280
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Damn.

281
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
Here's another video. Stephen Fry horrified by

282
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
candy roo fish.

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
Yeah he's horrified. He's screaming into his penis hole.

284
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,180
- Yeah.

285
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,040
- What a horrifying, what a horrifying country.

286
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
I would never go to Peru now.

287
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,560
- Yeah.

288
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,380
- Yeah, I think that's--

289
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,220
- Just because of that?

290
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,100
- Yeah, dude, I don't wanna risk it.

291
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,940
- Yeah.

292
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,760
- Yeah.

293
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,040
- 'Cause what if you, you know, if you're in Peru,

294
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,020
I mean, it's in South America, it's under the equator.

295
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,320
- Yeah.

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,360
- You know, it's hot.

297
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,600
- It's too hot, I'll go and--

298
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,080
- You gotta go swimming, it's hot.

299
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,040
- Exactly, yeah, you gotta cool off some way,

300
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
but I'm not gonna trust any source of water in Peru now.

301
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
- Yeah.

302
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,060
- I've changed my whole mind on Peru.

303
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,100
I used to be so pro Peru until fucking two minutes ago.

304
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
It's true.

305
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,620
Now I found out they have devils in the water.

306
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,380
They used to call me Peru Stew and then now I won't be caught dead in Peru.

307
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,620
Not in a million years, dude.

308
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,180
Not in a trillion years.

309
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,220
Not in a hundred billion years.

310
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,780

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
My bad.

325
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Can't really yeah.

326
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Alright.

327
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,140
So anyway just to continue the conversation we were having.

328
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
Yeah.

329
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Yeah.

330
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,740
The guac is extra.

331
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,880
If you recognize this quote you might be a little extra yourself because you're probably

332
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,720
a Chipotle fan like me.

333
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,820
If you read any of their hilarious bags of receipts you know they love humor just like

334
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,540
we do at Podcasts About List.

335
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Right guys?

336
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Absolutely.

337
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Oh man.

338
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,580
big ball of beans in a tortilla with meats, cheeses, and salsas to boot.

339
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,500
That's right. It's the burritos for me. It's the way they make me say bro-rito

340
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,380
for me. And I know what you're thinking. Doesn't Chipotle give you E. coli,

341
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,260
the deadly poop germ? Well, we at Chipotle, me at Podcasts About Lifts,

342
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,940
I like to say that there's no such thing as bad press. That's right.

343
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,180
When you press your giant burrito-sized and shaped and flavored poop out of your

344
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,420
poop hole, it's not going to be bad. This ain't no Taco Bell where it makes

345
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,140
your hole on fire like the ring a lion jumps through in the circus or a

346
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,260
motorcycle could jump through it too. Chipotle is the real authentic deal and it

347
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,540
hasn't had a Wayfair type scandal where they use menu items as a cover-up for

348
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,380
selling abducted orphans. Note, remove the previous sentence if Bohemian Grove

349
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,540
catering connection has hit the news by the time you do this ad read. Note 2,

350
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,020
don't read notes out loud they're for your eyes only. So use podcast about list

351
00:20:54,020 --> 00:21:00,460
special code P-A-T-R-I-C-K-P-E-D-O-P-H-I-L-E for one free bean and remember if the

352
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,500
chips give you diarrhea it's Mexican people's fault for making tortillas too

353
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,420
spicy and it has nothing to do with our traveling beef chef Stuart "Poop Glove" Jackson.

354
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,220
That's not the code. That is the code.

355
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,940
What's that? Let me order something real quick on Grubhub.

356
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,540
No, the code was "PAL20"?

357
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,660
Mmm, I don't... I'm looking at the same...

358
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,500
That's not what we got.

359
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,860
Did we change the code?

360
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,740
We didn't change it. I think they got some news and they changed it. They may have done some investigation.

361
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,260
Oh yeah, it says right here. It says we hired a private eye to verify the coupon code.

362
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,540
No, it says that they followed you around. They confirmed the coupon code.

363
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,380
Anyway, I don't even know what you guys are talking about because nobody sent us this.

364
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,980
Oh yeah, that's facts.

365
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,060
That wasn't the code.

366
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,660
Yeah, what's up?

367
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,220
What code?

368
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,100
We're just having a conversation here, Pat.

369
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,180
I know, but we're having a conversation about the fucking code now because that was not the code.

370
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,620
I just read out what I thought in my brain.

371
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:58,940
Yeah.

372
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,100
Yeah, and you said a different code.

373
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,980
I can show you my email.

374
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
- What email?

375
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,380
This is just a conversation.

376
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,720
- I can show you my thoughts.

377
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,420
- He wrote all his thoughts in an email.

378
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,020
- Yeah, wait, let me pull them up for you.

379
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,280
Yeah, it says right here, P-A-T,

380
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,540
I don't know what this spells by the way.

381
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,380
- No, it's P-A-L.

382
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,200
- R-I-C-K-P.

383
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,420
- It's P-A-L-20.

384
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,780
- No, it's just one of those like nonsense codes.

385
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,420
- No, it's like it's not a random string of letters.

386
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,820
- It's one of those nonsense code like P-A-T-R-I-C-K-R-A-P-I-S-T

387
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,660
- That's not it, no.

388
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,500
- No.

389
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,220
- Just like another one of those random codes like that.

390
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,060
- No.

391
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,940
- No, just come up with random codes.

392
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,340
- I don't like the code.

393
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,540
- Well, it doesn't matter, then don't use it.

394
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,860
- Yeah, if you don't like discounts, that's on you.

395
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,220
- It's not, no, those aren't the codes.

396
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,860
- Okay, all right, man.

397
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,700
They are the codes.

398
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,540
- Okay, all right. - They're not the, no.

399
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,860
- Let's just move on to the list.

400
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,900
- Yeah, let's.

401
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,380
- We'll just move on to the list, it's fine.

402
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,980
- We can, yeah.

403
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,180
- What's the list this week?

404
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,140
- I don't care.

405
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,220
- Somebody send it to me.

406
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,780
You care, come on.

407
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:09,920
No, today's list that we selected for our podcast is the 14 things you need to stop doing at

408
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,300
Chipotle according to a Chipotle employee.

409
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,780
I was going to send you guys this list.

410
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,460
This is like the funniest shit ever.

411
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
I know.

412
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,900
It's, yeah, I almost sent it too but I was reading it before and I was like they are

413
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,980
going to love this.

414
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,980
I printed it out like a book and I just read it in my off time.

415
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,700
I mean honestly relationship goals.

416
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
Absolutely dude.

417
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
And squad goals too.

418
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,820
Yeah, you know what?

419
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
I'm in a relationship with Chipotle.

420
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,660
Bro-rito, are you serious?

421
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
We should get that on a shirt.

422
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
Wait.

423
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Wait.

424
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
No.

425
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,740
Did you guys know that they actually have like sustainably sourced bags at Chipotle?

426
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,460
Just like a random fact I learned the other day.

427
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,660
I think I was watching the Discovery Channel or something and they said it there.

428
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Yeah, I saw.

429
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,740
I think I actually learned that in college.

430
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,380
I was talking to somebody yesterday and they told me that all the chicken at Chipotle is

431
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,220
sustainably sourced and it's all free range too.

432
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,420
Yeah they said they have substantially sourced beef there too.

433
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,780
Yeah it's all grass fed cows.

434
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:18,620
I heard the water and soda machines don't use slaves to crank it from behind the wall.

435
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,060
I heard there's not a little Coca-Cola slave in every freestyle machine who has to do hip

436
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,380
hop dancing to create all the drinks.

437
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,700
- Yeah, one of my friends told me

438
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,740
that their machines are never broken.

439
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,700
- They're never broken.

440
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,580
It's kind of amazing.

441
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,220
It's just like a weird fact that I learned

442
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
for no reason though.

443
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,380
- I think the friends kind of knew it could tell.

444
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,220
Or whatever.

445
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,060
- Yeah, you can just tell.

446
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,880
- Just like be respectful.

447
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,420
- They like clearly have that kind of vibe.

448
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,860
That like corporate culture vibe

449
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,540
that you like kind of want to latch onto.

450
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,380
Be like, oh, this is actually goals.

451
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,940
- And you guys know I'm a music fan.

452
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,740
And the music that they play at the restaurant

453
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,300
is always so good.

454
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,820
- Yeah.

455
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,540
I love the design of their stools and tables too.

456
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,540
And they always look so clean.

457
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,620
I get to sit wherever I want, whether it's behind a person or in front of a person.

458
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,940
Or next to somebody, make a new friend.

459
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,620
Yeah, and I love their boho vibe that they give off with their different things.

460
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,900
And boho stands for burrito huge.

461
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Yeah, it's really something the way that they kind of like, they shine a light on lesser

462
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,580
known creators by putting Aztec art on the wall.

463
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
That's true, yeah.

464
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,620
at the Mayans for real. Not many people know about the Aztecs. And the bags! Oh my god I can't get enough of these.

465
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,900
Well I already mentioned the bags. We could fill a whole episode about the bags. Oh my god some of the celebrities that

466
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,420
they get to write these stories on the bags and the cups. And the handles, they're just comfortable. And I've

467
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,580
actually been using the bags to pick up my groceries. Yeah? People say hey would

468
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,780
you like a bag or did you bring your own? I say does this answer your question?

469
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,300
Here's a Chipotle bag with a Jennifer Lawrence quote. Same with the tinfoil

470
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,780
bowls that they put the bowls in. Yeah. I've been using those as bags. You can clean those out and it's good

471
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,500
because those are compostable. That's true. Everything there is sustainably sourced, including

472
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,300
the employees. They all get them from prison. Yeah. And that's sustainable because you're

473
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,540
bringing them back into society and they become basically like your friends behind the counter.

474
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,740
And that's facts, dude. Let me just read the intro to this list really quick. I know we're

475
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,820
having like a normal conversation, but we just have to like kick it off sometimes, you

476
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,660
know, even though like no matter how much we love stuff, we just have to get to the

477
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,740
Yeah, sometimes we just get so lost in our casual conversations.

478
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,400
Absolutely.

479
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,660
Everyone loves Chipotle. Seriously, Chipotle is like everything.

480
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,540
So for the life of me, I can't figure out why, oh why,

481
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,040
some people in the world can't just be nice and make life easier

482
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,200
for the people that hold our collective burrito destiny in their very hands.

483
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,380
I've been- It's like they've fucking read my diary.

484
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,980
It's like they read it.

485
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,140
So in the spirit of all that is holy guacamole, wow.

486
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,100
Oh my god.

487
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,780
I implore you to stop doing these things that make Chipotle employees hate you.

488
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,500
I spoke with my best friend who just so happens to work at Chipotle as well as several ladies

489
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
in my neighborhood.

490
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Ooh, Casanova.

491
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
I got the facts.

492
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,900
Oh, it's a woman that wrote it.

493
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,500
Chips and Salsa Nova.

494
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Several ladies.

495
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,060
That, you know, I've also, I've been talking to several ladies in my neighborhood about

496
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Chipotle as well.

497
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Yeah, me too.

498
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,020
And not everybody wants me to spread the gospel.

499
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Yeah.

500
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,300
I have to say, lots of people are very hostile when I approach them.

501
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
Yeah.

502
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Hey, ma'am, excuse me.

503
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,340
Yeah, in the middle of the night, I walk up to women on the street.

504
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Chipotle now has queso!

505
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:22,980
They love it though. Mm-hmm. Do you want to read this bag with me? That's what I say. Yeah

506
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,820
Do you want to read? I mean, it's kind of like it's better than any book I've read

507
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,740
Definitely. Mm-hmm. Absolutely when they get Fred Armisen to write about beans. Oh, oh god damn Fred

508
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,100
Oh my god, Fred. You should if this was on a blog I would share it. Mm-hmm

509
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,280
Number one like it's kind of the type of thing where they like humor, but not comedy

510
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Definitely, they're kind of a British

511
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
sense of humor.

512
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
It's like a British Mexican sense of humor.

513
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
It's not like you're not guffawing,

514
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
but you're definitely going like

515
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
You're dryly chuckling.

516
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Yeah. While you're eating your wetly

517
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
buckled

518
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
chuckle beef.

519
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Definitely.

520
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Number one on this list.

521
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,100
Do not ask for a side of

522
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,100
diced tomatoes. What kind of a psychopath

523
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,100
would do this to an employee?

524
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,120
sick in the head you fucking freak somebody should kill you believe it or

525
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,060
not oh I'll go I'll go believe it or not the tomatoes are used for the salsa

526
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,940
duh yeah holy doesn't have a nice tomatoes waiting to be stuffed into a

527
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,780
plastic ramekin for you because tomatoes that sit in a tub for hours aren't fresh

528
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,380
not fresh not Chipotle oh absolutely mm-hmm there's one thing I noticed when

529
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I go to Chipotle it's just how fresh every ingredient is yeah absolutely just taste

530
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:48,100
it on your tongue you can tell just by how how abusive the manager is to the

531
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,260
people who are cooking the beef how much they care about how fresh it is they're

532
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,660
not they're not abusive they're encouraging in a negative way it's

533
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,820
called negative and it's called threats of violence used to a positive end in

534
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,460
society and they're all credible mm-hmm why do you think they have that giant

535
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,700
The thing doesn't toast the burritos.

536
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,500
They use that for threatening.

537
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,340
- It's a hand.

538
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,780
- You ever notice how it's perfectly sized

539
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,580
for like a hand or a foot or a penis?

540
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,860
- That's why they wear those gloves

541
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,680
to hide all their, they call them battle scars.

542
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,600
- That's why they have an oubliette in the back.

543
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,820
It's in case they need to forget

544
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,580
about any employees permanently.

545
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,380
- This means someone now has to stop what they're doing

546
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,260
and go dice tomatoes for you.

547
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,660
Unless you're Obama or Adele, who by the way I stand,

548
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,620
don't ask, period.

549
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,700
Or should I say period?

550
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,540
- Yeah.

551
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,740
- Because that's kind of the Chipotle way.

552
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
Chipotle actually loves, has been supporting

553
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,860
the LGBTQIA alliance for, I don't know, 50 years?

554
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,900
- Period, or should I say, hold on one second guys,

555
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,380
I'm going to Google Translate.

556
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,740
Period, or should I say periodo.

557
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,880
- So, yeah, exactly.

558
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,880
That's what I would say too.

559
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Periodo.

560
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Periodo.

561
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Sorry, I'm only 68 hours into Duolingo. I haven't gotten that far.

562
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
Number two, don't ask stupid questions.

563
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
You shouldn't be asking for that.

564
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Number two, don't ask stupid questions like, "How do you know you don't have it in the back?"

565
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Exactly.

566
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,880
It's just, their commitment to transparency is great.

567
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,880
because you can just see in the background of the restaurant.

568
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,980
You can see it all back there.

569
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
- Yeah, I mean one thing I like is it's transparent.

570
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,940
You can see the pipes that come from where the bathroom is

571
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,100
that go over where the food is made

572
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,780
and then they go into where the food is made

573
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,020
and then they go underground.

574
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,860
- Yep.

575
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,180
- And I know there's no leakage.

576
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,020
- Exactly.

577
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,860
- I follow those pipes.

578
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,900
I follow them with my eyes.

579
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,420
- Yep, I follow the employees with my eyes.

580
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,380
- That's right, that's why they have a hole in the wall

581
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,540
where the customer can see it all.

582
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,020
- Exactly.

583
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,700
So aside from the obvious answer they want to give you

584
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,300
consisting of something to the effect of

585
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,700
because I goddamn live here, I know what we have,

586
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,740
there is also the very modus operandi

587
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,140
of Chipotle to consider.

588
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,340
I encourage you to think about

589
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,920
what Chipotle stands for, people.

590
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,340
Fresh food.

591
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,940
- Amen, sister.

592
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,780
- Mm-hmm. - Yep.

593
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,280
- If they kept an enormous amount of excess food in the back,

594
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,420
how fresh do you think it's going to stay and for how long?

595
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,100
Duh, they know what they have and they know what they have prepped.

596
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Don't argue.

597
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,140
Yeah, are you fucking brain dead?

598
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Mm-hmm.

599
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Are you stupid?

600
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,860
Are you fucking dumb as a rock, you piece of shit?

601
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,540
Are you dumber than a fifth grader?

602
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,940
Yeah, you must be dumber than a guy who spends 20 minutes thinking about what his order's

603
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
gonna be when he's at the front of the line and everyone's waiting behind him.

604
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,900
Oh, don't get me started.

605
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,060
You must be a guy who enjoys Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler movies because that's the

606
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,900
kind of stupid people who are not welcome at somewhere like Chipotle.

607
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
Exactly.

608
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,140
Chipotle is of a higher class than McDonald's absolutely dude McDonald's is

609
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,300
for fucking trash people it's basically Chuds it's for absolute corn cobs chuds

610
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,060
who need to be just catch a catch a whiff so I mean it's just it's just like

611
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,180
slack-jawed spineless ghouls absolutely yeah

612
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:21,540
yeps yeah yips just absolutely fucking piss people who make $15,000 a year

613
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:28,540
year ago to McDonald's. Disgusting. Just ass clown fuck shits. Yeah. Omelette fuck crustables.

614
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,620
Completely. And that's why Chipotle is taking COVID-19 very seriously. And actually, you

615
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:39,620
have to have, when they take your temperature when you walk in, it has to be below 70 degrees.

616
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,420
Yep. They need to make sure that you're cold as ice, because otherwise you could be infecting

617
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:51,500
somebody. It's true. Number three is don't make stupid E. coli jokes. Oh, again with

618
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Oh my god.

619
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah.

620
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,340
Now mine just says, "Uh oh, we're having technical difficulties."

621
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Yeah.

622
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Scroll down.

623
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Oh, okay.

624
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
There it is.

625
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,780
"When you make an E. coli joke at a Chipotle restaurant, it's usually because A, you think

626
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,980
you have a joke the employee hasn't already heard.

627
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
You don't.

628
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,140
They've all been used, so give up on your dreams as a comedian.

629
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,380
You're neither funny nor original."

630
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
That's right.

631
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,380
Yep.

632
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,940
At a restaurant that has bags, you're not going to be funnier than a bag.

633
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,380
You're not going to be funnier than the Chipotle bag that they're going to hand you.

634
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,860
Yeah, and this is the kind of like, I don't know, this is the kind of straight white male

635
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,540
humor about E. coli that is just like so infectious in society, you know?

636
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Exactly.

637
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
I mean, I don't like to see that shit.

638
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,580
Like, this is like a, what are you, Anthony Jeselnik?

639
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,980
Like are you a disgusting pig?

640
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Give me an hour in a middle school and I can find you a hundred people who are extremely

641
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
funny without having to talk about E. coli.

642
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Absolutely.

643
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:52,500
you a hundred of the ugliest funniest girls who've ever told a joke. Fuck these

644
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,700
E.coli. I mean E.coli bros I'm done with you. You're never getting on the

645
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,720
Jesselnik offensive. Absolutely not. Yeah. No way. You're auditioning for Guy Code in the middle of

646
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,760
Chipotle? Yeah. No. Don't get me wrong. That hasn't even been on the airwaves for years. Exactly dude.

647
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,620
Spike TV is dead and Chipotle killed it. It was on MTV but that's fine. You

648
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:17,180
didn't know that see I don't have to know crap like that you know don't you care

649

651
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,980
squatty potty and I read the jokes and it's some of the funniest shit I've ever

00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,200
beans that they have at Chipotle that's absolutely I mean yeah they're out of a

659
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,200
can the boy they grow them they use the manure out of the you know what yeah

660
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,640
they have a whole hydroponic farm in the back where they grow beans.

661
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,840
But yeah it's just so funny that I just had these around I don't know it's just like I'm

662
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,000
kind of I'm kind of like what quirky Chipotle fan sometimes sorry guys.

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,160
We didn't finish or B you feel the need to make sure that they know to be extra careful

664
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,880
with your food as to not infect you with E. coli.

665
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,560
If you're afraid of the food or the prep why are you there?

666
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,220
The situation was handled and we all know it and are gleefully back to waiting in lines

667
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,940
that wrap around the block for our burrito goodness.

668
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,520
You're an adult, you should be able to figure this one out.

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520

00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,880
fraternity with and one of the best businessmen no businessmen, that's

706
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,020
From I learned from other podcasts you you're supposed to like they want you to be like kind of mean to the thing

707
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,800
It's like people think it's like funny. Well, I would never I would never be mean to them

708
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,160
You're right. I'm

709
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,440
You're right, I'm fucking up. I'm sorry. Yeah, but Chipotle

710
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,320
I'm sorry. You have some of the most delicious

711
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,920
Jennifer nickel right now and I think you did a great job. Yeah, Brian nickel

712
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,860
You actually have an extremely bang of a wife and there's nothing stupid or fart about your company

713
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,120
And thank you for the opportunity, sir

714
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay, number four stop filling your water cup up with soda, oh my god, I hate these freaks

715
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,020
I get a water cup all the time, but I fill it up with water. Yeah, I fill it up with maybe carbonated water.

716
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:26,220
I actually buy a soda and I fill it up with water just because I want to give them more money without taking any of their syrup.

717
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,380
Yes.

718
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:33,440
Exactly. Yeah, cuz syrup costs money. You know, that's like six or seven cents. They gotta get that out of trees. Exactly.

719
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
Yeah, they have to get it out of a Coca-Cola tree. You know how long it takes?

720
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,080
You know how many gallons of sap it takes to get the syrup? Probably millions.

721
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:48,260
Takes 40 400 gallons two gallons of syrup to make five million gallons of soda and we're wasting this

722
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,540
And that's just fucked up to the max

723
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,220
I don't do that shit because I don't I'm not gonna disrespect one of the most yeah

724
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:00,880
Yeah, sustainable and an amazing work culture restaurant priests it they treat their slaves well

725
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,560
Mm-hmm exactly the syrup slaves who?

726
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,800
Harvest the Mountain Dew syrup from the they don't have Mountain Dew they have coke products do the mountain tree

727
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,880
What they don't have mellow yellow yellow yellow do that again?

728
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,860
Yeah, okay the slaves who harvest the mountain yellow tree

729
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:24,820
No, some of them mellow yellow tree are some of the most well treated slaves way better than the slaves in Star Wars

730
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:31,220
Yes, yep, so absolutely they don't make they don't make them sit. They don't have a city

731
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,340
They don't have to sleep in the hut. They don't have to sleep in the sandcrawler

732
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,780
Exactly. They get a sleeping bag outside under the stars.

733
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,300
They get a normal. In beautiful Antarctica.

734
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
They get a normal metal bed like anybody else.

735
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,480
Mm-hmm.

736
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,500
Sheet metal, all sheet metal, 100%.

737
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,280
Well, it's the same stuff, it's the same foil

738
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,640
that goes over the top of the bowls when you get just to go.

739
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,480
Yeah. Yep.

740
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,300
Yeah.

741
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,260
Yep, and they get bag pillows.

742
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,100
Yep.

743
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,980
Yep.

744
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,140
I would, dude, I wish I was living as a slave

745
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,300
for Chipotle right now.

746
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,140
Oh my God.

747
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,860
Seems like my everyday-- Consider me one already.

748
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,940
Yeah, my wallet is becoming like a slave

749
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,780
to Chipotle pretty recently.

750
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,080
you know especially during the war I mean recently like and also just like 24/7

751
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:16,500
before Korea pre yeah pre-war you know before Quentin Quarantino mm-hmm my god

752
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,580
absolutely yeah who's not welcome at Chipotle by the way too rude yeah oh

753
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:26,500
yeah and his movies scary yep number five don't be the one who doesn't

754
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,100
understand that blenders break see listen I know you're good you're headed to

755
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,220
- So, Chipotle, you're saying,

756
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,740
"I'm gonna get a barbacoa smoothie.

757
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,060
"I've been looking forward to this all week."

758
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,560
You show up, they say, "Sorry, it's actually under

759
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,920
"maintenance because we had to blend a bunch

760
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,140
"of barbacoa smoothies to feed some of our slaves."

761
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,120
- We were trying to shred a head of lettuce in there

762
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,680
'cause we ran out of shredded lettuce.

763
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,620
And it shot out and it beamed one of our employees

764
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,220
in the head and he ate his skull.

765
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,560
- A whole fucking thing of lettuce just cut off

766
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,100
part of our employee's head.

767
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,260
actually the Bloods and the Crips had a shootout in Chipotle and they actually shot the

768
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,300
blender to death. So we can't really make you a barbacoa smoothie right now. You'll have to come

769
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:14,300
back, I don't know, in five minutes. And one of these Karen's, right? I mean, stop me if I'm wrong,

770
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:20,220
but a Karen will be like, "Uh, excuse me, I want my meat smoothie ASAP." And it's like,

771
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,540
come on.

772
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,700
It's like, what? Come on, your name's not Rocky.

773
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,260
Yes.

774
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,300
And that's like, come on.

775
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,500
Your name's not Yams.

776
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,460
And that's the kind of thing that like a Chipotle--

777
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,220
It's like, come on, your name's not Ferg.

778
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:34,660
Chipotle's tuned in with hip-hop culture as well. Yeah, come on. Your name's not rock. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Come on

779
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,460
Your name's not ASAP

780
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,220
Yeah, one of them. I don't remember. I think you said all the ones I know

781
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,260
Yeah, but I just want you guys to read the first little sentence of this one though

782
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,500
Cuz it's like I know we read some crazy-ass shit

783
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,520
We find on the internet sometimes but I just can't imagine like what kind of person writes this. Oh my god

784
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,900
It says I know it's hard for you to accept but sometimes

785
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,940
This in quotes fecal matter hits the oscillating rotary propeller. Oh

786
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,100
Yeah, in other words shit hits the fan oh

787
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,580
Yeah

788
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,980
yeah, I'm glad they went with the first one because

789
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:18,580
Wow, yeah, that's insane. I mean yeah because after they said that first one I was saying to myself

790
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,020
Explain like I'm five. Yeah, you know. Yeah, I was saying change my mind

791
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,900
Yeah, and then they and they did I was saying am I the asshole

792
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,220
When the shit hits a fan, there's nothing the employees can do about it

793
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:36,120
In other words, they just may not have the precious vinaigrette your girlish figure requires today get over it

794
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:42,280
Stop acting like a petulant three-year-old newsflash. This is not the worst curveball life is gonna throw you

795
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,960
I'm sure you'll find a way to cope and that's very true. Sometimes I come in counterpoint though could get cancer or something

796
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,180
to me

797
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,180
Not getting my Chipotle order

798
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,740
That is maybe the worst curveball life is gonna throw. That's worse than that's worse than the big C. What Caleb is saying.

799
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,200
Yeah, I mean the real big C is Chipotle in my eyes. Yep. Yep

800
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,380
No, no negativity only positivity. That's right

801
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:15,800
Number six don't order over the phone. Who? Okay, grandma much? Yeah. Yeah, what do you what do you?

802
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,860
Dialing up your rotary phone you old bitch. Yeah, what did you use? What did you use the

803
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,540
What did you talk to an operator to get you there? Yeah, we fucking stupid old bitch. Yeah

804
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:33,940
Are you an immigrant? Yeah, I ought to break your knee. What wait? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

805
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,340
That's your chip. No Chipotle. No, what are you talking about? What don't say that? Don't

806
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,020
We'll cut that out ladies and gentlemen of earth. It is

807
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,940
2016 just

808
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:53,460
Yep, it is just like Millennials don't understand why old people insist upon leaving voicemail when they could just text you the employees at Chipotle

809
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:58,580
Don't understand why you feel the need to pull them away from what they're doing having fun working Chipotle

810
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,900
So that they can have a 10-minute conversation with you about your order

811
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:07,420
They have the internet you can order online and they have a fax machine. They know how to use them

812
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,300
See, that's what we're saying is instead of calling you should send them a fax

813
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
With your order.

814
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,500
Yeah, because what do you, you're so old school you're trying to use your phone.

815
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Send them a fax.

816
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
You know what is on a fax machine?

817
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
A phone.

818
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,360
They have a phone on it.

819
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,780
That's a really good point, but don't call that.

820
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,300
Don't call the fax machine, all you hear is.

821
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:34,340
I send them, I mean, every morning when I'm getting ready for my breakfast order to walk

822
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,660
in and pick it up, I send my local Chipotle a fax and it says, it's a piece of paper that

823
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,100
says my burrito.

824
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,100
And they know exactly.

825
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,940
- Yep.

826
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,780
- 'Cause you're one of these next guys.

827
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,620
- I'm a regular.

828
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,940
They know my computer's handwriting.

829
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,360
The font, I mean.

830
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,760
The font I use, Wingdings.

831
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,600
- Yeah.

832
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,440
(laughing)

833
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,760
Number seven, don't be the customer who comes in every day

834
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,980
and asks the same stupid questions every day.

835
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,080
And they have a little script here.

836
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,180
If you guys wanna read this.

837
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,020
- Okay. - Oh, okay.

838
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,220
- I think you and Caleb would be great.

839
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,400
- I wanna be employee.

840
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,580
- I wanna be employee.

841
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,940
- Oh, okay, well either way,

842
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,980
I'm happy to be an employee or a customer.

843
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,620
let's just pretend it's two employees talking to each other.

844
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,060
- Okay, but one of the employees is named customer.

845
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,900
- Yeah, okay.

846
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,420
Are those black beans?

847
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,620
- Do they look black?

848
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,020
- I guess, smiley face.

849
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,680
- Do they resemble the same black beans

850
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,860
you ordered yesterday?

851
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,340
- Yes.

852
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,860
- Then yes, I'd have to say after using my Sherlock Holmes

853
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,580
like powers of deduction that these are indeed black beans.

854
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,620
- Oh my God.

855
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,300
- Yeah, narrator line, Patrick?

856
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,580
I think you get the point. Yeah, you fucking, you are such a piece of shit if you don't know

857
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,420
how to order a Chipotle. You're like a, you're an animal. You are lower than a human. You

858
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:55,420
are pond scum that should be fucking incinerated. You dog shit piece of ass. Stop asking, do

859
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:02,620
you know guacamole actually costs extra? You fucking mongrel. You should be put down in

860
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:07,980
the street. Piece of shit. Some of you guys, yeah, they just need to, some of these people

861
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,380
it's like you just got to knock him out yeah when you see you should you're

862
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,820
allowed you should be allowed to punch the person in front of you in line at

863
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,540
Chipotle if they are taking too long I need my stuff I mean really it's why I

864
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,940
have a doom wad of Chipotle is just in case there's a situation like that where

865
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,580
you know there's I've got three Kyle's in front of me in the line oh don't get

866
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,260
me started and they're saying and they're saying oh which is which is

867
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,740
- Which is white rice and which is black rice?

868
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,900
I only see one color.

869
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,740
- Wow.

870
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,580
- That is some Karen shit.

871
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,860
- Yeah, and the only color, green,

872
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,580
like the Monster Energy logo.

873
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,400
- Definitely. - Yep.

874
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,240
- Yeah, that's some Kyle shit.

875
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,500
- If you don't know how to order Chipotle,

876
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,540
you should be thrown in the trash

877
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,860
like a half-day-old tortilla

878
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,100
instead of being donated to a shelter.

879
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,980
- They should have a machine

880
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,560
like they use to kill the little boy chickens.

881
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,400
- Yep, definitely.

882
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,220
- And they throw all the Kyles in there at Chipotle.

883
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,100
- I agree.

884
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,100
I've been saying this for--

885
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,500
- There should be a trap door--

886
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
- 48 minutes.

887
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,900
should be a trap door in front of the Chipotle sneeze guard and you stand in

888
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,900
front of it and if you're taking too damn long you get thrown in a rancor pit

889
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,440
definitely dude defo for shizzle mm-hmm I would pay to have a rancor and

890
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,380
startled in a Chipotle yeah we'll get an animatronic Disney World rancor and he

891
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:29,220
will be he will be and get this they can milk him use it for sour cream well

892
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,580
- Oh! - That's definitely true.

893
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,740
That's definitely fucking true.

894
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,680
- So good, that'd be so good.

895
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,420
- Pat, you wanna handle number eight for us?

896
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,340
- Don't be a person on your phone while online,

897
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,860
especially when it's busy.

898
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,740
I'm glad I handled that.

899
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,860
- What, what's up?

900
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,980
- So finish it though.

901
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:44,820
- Okay.

902
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,100
- He started, he finished. - Fellow citizens,

903
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,740
I understand that you believe that your phone call

904
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,180
is indeed the most important thing,

905
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,460
not only in your life, but indeed the world.

906
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,500
Maybe it is.

907
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,020
Maybe you're on the phone with a high-ranking

908
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,620
government official discussing a detailed plan

909
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,340
on how to cure cancer or create world peace.

910
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,180
However, if this isn't the case,

911
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,620
get off the damn phone and pay attention

912
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,220
to what's going on in front of you.

913
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,380
- And that's actually Chipotle official policy,

914
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,220
is if you're on the phone,

915
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,020
they have every right to ask you to leave,

916
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,260
but if you say, sorry, I'm on the phone

917
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,680
with a high-ranking government official

918
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,740
discussing a detailed plan on how to cure cancer

919
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,340
or create world peace, they have to let you do it.

920
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,900
It's just kinda, I mean, that's just

921
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,740
for the kind of company they are.

922
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,860
- I mean, that's just how great they are to their customers.

923
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,720
- Yeah, it's 'cause they believe in cancer

924
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,480
and they believe in world peace.

925
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,720
- I also like, I really like on this,

926
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,000
we're just like a comment about the website

927
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and not really so much Chipotle.

928
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,980
I just love the image they've selected for this one.

929
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,800
It's kind of like a blue, light blue picture

930
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,560
with some line drawings of forks and whisks.

931
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,520
- Well, then you're gonna love the next one.

932
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,360
- You're gonna love the picture, number nine.

933
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,960
- It's the exact same picture.

934
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,760
- Oh, it's the same one, but bigger.

935
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,240
This website, I mean, they get it.

936
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,060
That's all.

937
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:51,900
I mean, I don't wanna talk too much about it.

938
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,520
- They understand foodies like us.

939
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
- Oh yeah, I don't want it to sound forced,

940
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,760
but they get it.

941
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,720
- Yep.

942
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,020
- SpoonUniversity.com, check it out.

943
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,520
- Oh Pat, do you have something to read?

944
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,360
- Oh yeah.

945
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
- Do you have something to read today or something?

946
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,440
- I do, I do have a poem that I wrote.

947
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,680
- Oh that's so beautiful dude,

948
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,680
I bet it's about something that you love more than anything

949
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,920
as poetry usually is about.

950
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,920
- I mean, it is Valentine's Day when we're recording this,

951
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,920
so I figure, hell, why not talk about,

952
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,120
Why not spread some love?

953
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,680
Why not talk about love?

954
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,520
- Definitely.

955
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,580
- And this is a poem I wrote about love.

956
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:31,120
It's called "Loving Lifestyle."

957
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:35,640
When I was a much younger lad,

958
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,240
I went to Chipotle with my dad.

959
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,020
As we stood in line, it said chills down my spine,

960
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,960
and I thought, how could a restaurant have it all?

961
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,760
From delicious corn slaw and Mr. Pibb in a cup so large,

962
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,120
I turned to my father and I said,

963
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,840
"Dad, did we just arrive in heaven?"

964
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,200
He said, "No, son, we are just in Chipotle."

965
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,440
Fajita veggies, sofritas, and barbacoa.

966
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,820
I hope that this meal is never over.

967
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,000
Salads, tacos, and lifestyle bowls.

968
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,640
Without Chipotle, my life no longer feels whole.

969
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,280
Tapo Chico, Corona Lite, and Grapefruit Izzy.

970
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,400
Hell, it's no wonder why Chipotle is always so busy.

971
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,900
I miss my grandma so much, I wish I could text her.

972
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,780
And yes, I know that the guac is cost extra.

973
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,420
Romaine lettuce, cheese, and sour cream.

974
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,700
This restaurant is a white boy's dream.

975
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,660
Keto bowl, high protein bowl, vegan bowl.

976
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,180
When I'm at Chipotle, I wish I could eat it all.

977
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:38,780
Awesome chips and hot queso blanco.

978
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,580
This bullshit's turned me into a bucking bronco.

979
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,860
If I ever see you put soda inside of a water cup,

980
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:48,580
you will know that your time is now up.

981
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,540
Carnitas steak and beautiful chicken.

982
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,600
When you're done at Chipotle, your fingers get my licking.

983
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,500
- Okay, he did that.

984
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,100
- White rice, brown rice, and pinto beans.

985
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,420
Chipotle will show you what life truly means.

986
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,620
Thank you, Chipotle, for all that you've done for me.

987
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,540
I hope when I am to be wed, it is inside your establishment.

988
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,340
And that's called Loving Lifestyle by Patrick E. Doran.

989
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,180
- Jesus Christ.

990
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,520
- I mean, he ate that up.

991
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,060
- Yeah, is that the one that you're doing on the moth lighter?

992
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,900
- Yes.

993
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,620
- Wow, that's gonna be really powerful.

994
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,740
That's gonna be like one of those viral videos.

995
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,580
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

996
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,420
- That's gonna be huge, dude.

997
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,940
- I hope I can change the world with my poetry.

998
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,420
- Yeah, that'll definitely overtake that video

999
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,940
that guy crying about his dead daughter.

1000
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,500
That'll be like a million times sadder

1001
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,380
and like more touching, you know?

1002
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,260
- I mean, yeah, this is about me and my father.

1003
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,500
- Yeah, I mean, yeah, dude.

1004
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,340
- Yeah.

1005
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,060
- Father-brother bond.

1006
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,900
- Mm-hmm.

1007
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,500
- Yeah, that's like unshakable.

1008
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,140
- It's like another level of stuff.

1009
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,780
I mean, Chipola gets it too, so.

1010
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,620
- Yeah.

1011
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:51,700
- I'm hoping that they hear this and they put it on one of their bags, fingers crossed.

1012
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:53,980
- Oh, dude, okay, buddy.

1013
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,580
I think that might be a little unrealistic.

1014
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,180
I mean, you know, that's for people like David Sedaris or...

1015
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,180
- Yeah.

1016
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:09,060
- Well, hopefully I can be like them one day and get my writing on a Chipotle bag.

1017
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:14,180
- Well, you're gonna have to navigate through the wild world of humorism before you get

1018
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:15,180
that far.

1019
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,180
Let me tell you what.

1020
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:21,020
let's do an announcement for the fans let's say any we're looking for fan art

1021
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:28,060
bag fan art yeah maybe you want to put any specific text on a Chipotle bag yes

1022
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,300
that'd be like I'd love to really sick yeah yeah yeah and maybe you know who

1023
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,260

1024
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:42,700

1025
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:53,200
does happen please put poem by P.E. Doran. Mm-hmm mm-hmm P.E. D.O. No it's not how it's

1026
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,440
stylized. You can drop the end of the last name. That's not my poem name. It is your

1027
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,420
signature is how you like sign check. Well you know what my poem name is. It's like R.L.

1028
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:10,240
Stein. No my okay then my poetry name is Poet of Thunder. I don't think so. So if

1029
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,520
you do that put it so yep so we're putting PEDO Thunder at the bottom of the bag

1030
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,460
no yep that that works great number nine don't be the customer that gets asked if

1031
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,680
they want chips and a drink only to say no and then later at the register after

1032
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,260
you've been rung up ask for chips and a drink anyway yeah what the fuck is wrong

1033
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,940
with you yeah you should be sterilized if you do this you should absolutely be

1034
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:38,040
forced sterilized yeah you should be castrated you should have your hands

1035
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,160
chopped off like a like a thief in Saudi Arabia. Hey when when somebody this is

1036
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,880
this is a the guy when he this is a guy on one day he comes up he goes hey I'd

1037
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,120
like yeah actually I want a chips and drink after all this is him coming back

1038
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:57,320
to Chipotle the next day yeah I'll take a chips and a drink after all. He got

1039
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:04,320
chopped he got snatched. Yeah now he's a he's a what are they called? Boys. He's a boy

1040
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,320
Definitely, yeah.

1041
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,320
You know you want the chips and the drink. Of course you do.

1042
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,320
You always do. Everybody always does.

1043
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,320
But if you are indeed one of the people concerned with your healthy lifestyle,

1044
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,320
consider that the burrito you have just ordered is roughly the size of your torso.

1045
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Yeah, that's a big-ass burrito.

1046
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Ask yourself if the added calories of chips and drink really matter in the wake of the realization you have just made,

1047
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,320
and commit to a decision and go with it.

1048
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,320
But do so BEFORE you get to the cashier.

1049
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,040
This saves him time and energy so they can crack right along helping the other well adjusted

1050
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,040
folks in line.

1051
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,440
Yeah, unlike you, you're a mental health disaster.

1052
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,960
Yes, good, moving on.

1053
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,800
Ooh, number 10 has another script.

1054
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,280
And a Michael Scott gif.

1055
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,920
Number 10, don't be the so-called regular who justifies a demanding attitude with frequent

1056
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,920
patronage.

1057
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,320
Okay, I'm done being the customer.

1058
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
Somebody else take over the reins.

1059
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
I'll be the customer.

1060
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,880
Yeah, I bet you will.

1061
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,240
I would love to be a Chipotle customer.

1062
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:05,720
just start. Okay. Can I have a side of diced tomatoes? I'm sorry we don't have

1063
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,100
any pre-diced tomatoes. What we did have has been used in the salsa. But I come

1064
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,060
here every day! Okay, well I work in here every day. We don't have them. Should I

1065
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:21,020
call in a grief counselor? Are you gonna cry like a baby? The thing about this one

1066
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,860
is like if they'd if the customer had read the list they'd know not to ask for

1067
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,120
diced tomatoes. Right, definitely. They should print this out and keep it in

1068
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,320
front of the restaurant. Yeah, they should put it, absolutely, I think it would solve a lot

1069
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:37,080
of problems. Yep. Number 11, don't be vague when specificity is obviously required.

1070
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,120
Another office gif, one of the, I mean, what's a better show? You wouldn't walk

1071
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,960
into a Baskin-Robbins and say, "I'd like ice cream," and then blankly stare at the

1072
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,580
man/woman behind the counter as if they have a crystal ball and magically knew

1073
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:53,480
what flavor of ice cream you want, would you? Of course not. So why then would you

1074
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,240
shuffle down the food station, look at employees standing in front of six

1075
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:01,120
troughs of obviously different meats and tell them that you want meat and your

1076
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,120
burrito and look at them. Who knows? But somehow it happens all the same.

1077
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:09,280
#UnsolvedMysteries. Yeah what are you? Are you fucking Rose Kennedy?

1078
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,480
Are you being lobotomized? What is wrong with you? I think we might need to get the BuzzFeed

1079
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,440
Unsolved guys on this one. Yeah absolutely. Oh my god. They would go to town. They just

1080
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,280
have like a goofy rapport that I think would... mm-hmm. Yeah. Definitely. I don't have to

1081
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,320
spell it out for you guys. Yeah. Number 12. Don't be the one to ask what do you mean

1082
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,120
guac is extra. Ugh. They got a nice meme on here. Anyone want to read the meme?

1083
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,320
Yeah, I got you. Guacamole is an extra two dollars and it's a woman who's

1084
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:42,280
crying. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. It is kind of funny. Yeah, talk about first world problems.

1085
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,040
Yeah. Oh, sorry guys, I just saw the picture of the woman under the text. Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,400
It's pretty fucking... that's fire. Retweet. This is what hits you in two waves. I'm gonna retweet that one.

1087
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
I'm going to pin this to my Pinterest.

1088
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,400
Absolutely.

1089
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,840
Let's see here, pin.

1090
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,920
Oh my god.

1091
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,920
Can I pin this too?

1092
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,920
Hold on, I have to sign up.

1093
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,720
I'm going to pin this on my body with a tattoo.

1094
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,720
One second.

1095
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,920
I'm going to create a QR code for this page.

1096
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,920
That's such a smart idea.

1097
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,460
All right, I'm downloading it.

1098
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,080
You low-key a genius.

1099
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:16,980
I'm going to share this QR code to Instagram.

1100
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,980
Are you really?

1101
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,160
Oh, then I can scan it from there.

1102
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,320
Dude, I love QR codes.

1103
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,740
I love shareable shit like that.

1104
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,320
Number 13, don't be the customer that orders a kid's meal during a rush with no kid in

1105
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,320
tow.

1106
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
That's right.

1107
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,920
If you don't have a kid, don't order a kid's meal.

1108
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Exactly.

1109
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,300
We can tell.

1110
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,800
We can tell that you're not a kid.

1111
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:46,080
Unless you have a mental IQ of 90 or less.

1112
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,220
First off, what the hell are you doing in Chipotle?

1113
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,220
And if you have a mental IQ of...

1114
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,720
It's a restaurant for smart people.

1115
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,080
Okay, mental IQ over 90, you can order anything. You have to order adult's meal.

1116
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:05,680
90 to 40, you gotta get a kid's meal. 39 or under, it's a bowl of water for you.

1117
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,920
You might as well be a dog.

1118
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,320
Because you're a dog, here's a treat. Yeah, be gone.

1119
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,320
Call me when you've listened to all of Cereal. You know?

1120
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,440
Get smart!

1121
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:27,100
like the movie yeah and Terry Shivo we Chipotle is a fucking restaurant for real

1122
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,720
people with thoughts and souls you know get out of here you might have to put I

1123
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,380
would love to put yeah Chipotle and Terry Shivo's feeding - it could have

1124
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:44,680

1125
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,840
you're slow enough that you don't have the you're incapable of dreaming yeah

1126
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,980
definitely I mean why would we expect you to be able to dream of a better food

1127
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,980
yeah you're just a nothing person and I don't want to ever see you're like a

1128
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:01,840
you're like a zero yeah zero or less you're like if you're like if somebody

1129
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:05,380
like ripped the paper that we were all animated on there was a scary hole

1130
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:10,540
absolutely right where you are definitely and it's no use to pour to

1131
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,620
put chipotle into the hole because it's just I love to pour some chipotle into my

1132
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:20,420
hole. Okay well that's kind of disgusting. My mouth hole. You're actually, oh okay now

1133
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,420
you're making me really hungry. So let's finish off this list so I can go get

1134
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,340
some chipotle. How's that sound? Yeah. Yeah. Number 14, don't be the customer who

1135
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,700
makes a redundant order. Yeah. Yeah. When a customer has something like, "Can I have

1136
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:39,300
some cheese in my quesarito?" The employee may say, "What do you think it's called that for?" Yes, yeah sorry. Do you not know that

1137
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:47,680
that queso Rito is Spanish for queso burrito yeah cheese burrito for cheese

1138
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,860
queso Rito idiot the employee may say yes but what he or she really wants to

1139
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,620
say is it's a hybrid of a queso dia and a burrito it's already filled with cheese

1140
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,740
mm-hmm so the next time you visit your friendly and inviting neighborhood

1141
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,460

1144
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,900
the employee in front of you. Do not tantalize the employee. Stop molesting Chipotle employees.

1145
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,740
It's, they don't, listen, you gotta stop doing that. Knock it off. It's a big problem.

1146
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:32,780
If you dangle a coin in front of the sneeze guard, the Chipotle employees don't know any better.

1147
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,340
They'll try and jump through the sneeze guard. They'll shatter it with their forehead. Their

1148
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,780
Their head's gonna fall on the meat,

1149
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,060
and the meat's gonna be not ruined,

1150
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:45,740
but their face is gonna get really messy,

1151
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:46,780
it's gonna waste a little bit of it.
