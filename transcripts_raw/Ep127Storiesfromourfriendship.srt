00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,460
- Yeah.

79
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,780
- You have to bend over and pick it up, Dad.

80
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,780
- Yeah, I'm just like placing like a trail of cigars

81
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,820
that he keeps picking up and bending over to get,

82
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,200
and it'll lead to my room.

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,160
- And then what?

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,820
- And then there's a heart made out of cigars.

85
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,700
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

86
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,540
- Yeah, and then I'm like--

87
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,780
- It's cool that Dad loves cigars.

88
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,420
- If you wanna smoke one of these cigars,

89
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,680
you gotta smoke every last one of 'em, Dad.

90
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,740
- It's cool that guys love cigars.

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,840
- It's just cool.

92
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,340
Cigars just gave my grandpa bladder cancer.

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,560

yeah so you think it would go you think the cancer would land in your ass

96
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,540

112
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,820
because your mom's evil so I feel like I can make fun of her easier.

113
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,540
What? How is my mom evil? She called me stupid one time.

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,060
She did. She has called you cocksucker a couple times.

115
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Every time I've seen her she calls you like either like a pedophile or

116
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,500
yeah some kind of she says something insane about somebody.

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,100
Yeah that's true and it's just it's I mean

118
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,700
it's classic sort of middle school tension between you. The last two times

119
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,060
the last two times that i talked to her was she called patrick a pedophile and

120
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,380
then she called me and caleb a pedophile the second time

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,660
yeah i think she's just got a thing for pedophiles i think she just thinks it's

122
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,420
funny to call you i don't i don't think she's a thing for pedophiles i think

123
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,820
she's a thing for pedophiles no i don't think don't don't insinuate that my dad

124
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,780
is a pedophile my dad's a great man yeah i think she

125
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,780
might be married to a pedophile that's the only explanation say that

126
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,780
No, you guys would like my dad.

Yeah, I think I like you as much as I like your mom.

128
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,300
I think my dad did get mad at you one time, Caleb.

129
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,100
Why, because I just came on to your mom too hard?

130

-Okay. -Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,200
-I'm gonna mentally -- -See, now more and more,

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,800
more and more, I want to see this fight.

174
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm gonna mentally -- You want to see your dad die?

175
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,600
No, I don't want to see him die.

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,800
I just want to see him go -- I mean,

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,100
I want to see him go a couple rounds against you.

178
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm gonna wear -- I'm gonna dress up like a goth

179
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
and scare your dad to death.

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,680
that we get boots with spikes on it. I'm gonna be dressed up in a full gladiator outfit. I'm

181
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,840
gonna have a spear and a net and I'm gonna trap your dad and I'm gonna pin him against the wall.

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,920
You're not gonna trap my dad. You can't trap your dad in a net. You couldn't even go one

183
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
round against my dad. I could go a thousand rounds with your dad. Now all right you know what?

184
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,040
Yo if I was with your dad right now I'd never tap out. I could keep going with your dad all day.

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
yeah right we gotta see this now i think both you have to i basically i do i'd go to the boxing

186
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,080
ring like the night before and i'd set a bunch of traps in the ring you do it that way you do

187
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,400
have a mcallister style box a big a big trip wire that makes a giant pendulum swing down and chop

188
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,600
his head off if he steps out of the corner you didn't say no booby traps that's true that's a

189
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,720
big thing that they don't realize that they don't recognize in boxing is that uh booby traps are

190
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
completely fair game. Completely. That's what Michael Tyson was doing. Michael Tyson.

191
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:17,840
Michael Tyson. That's technically his name. That's what Mike Tyson was doing was, you know,

192
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,680
he was doing a booby trap when he bit a baby boy. I hate when I fight Mike Tyson, I slip on all the

193
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,320
marbles that he throws all over the place. My ear flies into his mouth. I hate when I get glued to

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:43,080
to

195
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,280
fifty times. Yeah, I thought it was sixty-five.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,940
Whatever it is, it's the funny number.

197
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,200
Just like, how do you not defend yourself after like...

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,280
also, how does that person not get tired after like eight punches? I think he must

199
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,440
have been like...

200
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,640
well, eight times eight is sixty-four. He must have been tied to one of those like wheels, like a medieval torture

201
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,760
chamber. Yeah. And a guy was just there, just going in on him. Yeah, eight times eight is sixty-four, so then

202
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,080
it was probably eight guys circulating with one punch. He was standing in a circle doing this.

203
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
that might be true

204
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,640
uh... all you know he was sitting okay argues on a result of office chair he's

205
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,480
on an office chair spinning around and they were punching his belly

206
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
one at a time uh...

207
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,360
yet and it was a frat party

208
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,840
and i think it's like one of the it's like those black and red to take turns

209
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,560
hitting

210
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,720
a thing with the hammer

211
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
yeah i see those videos

212
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,440
and i mean i mean i think how many spins of that be in the chair

213
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,560
what's the numbers so it's eight guys punching one time sixty four times how

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,400
How many spins would that be? Would that be eight spins?

215
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Eight. Yeah.

216
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,680
Come on.

217
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,200
You did it in reverse in front of us.

218
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I know.

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Yeah.

220
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah.

221
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I did figure that out.

222
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,560
That's the one time on the pod I've done math correctly and I completely, I completely

223
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
backtracked.

224
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,960
It kind of seemed like you were bragging that you could do part of it.

225
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
No, I wasn't.

226
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah, eight times eight, 64, man.

227
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,880
That's one of the only, like, things like that.

228
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, hey, what's that? 64, eight times eight?

229
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,120
That's what you said.

230
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
I wasn't bragging.

231
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I wasn't bragging.

232
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,400
- I'm casually doing the easiest math in a bragging way.

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
- Yeah.

234
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,060
- I mean, five plus six,

235
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,720
that's gotta be like 11 or something.

236
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,880
- Yeah, I mean, but I don't know.

237
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah, what is that?

238
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,160
No, what is that, guys?

239
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,640
Oh my God!

240
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,480
- I was right?

241
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,300
I mean, what are the odds?

242
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,560
- I was guessing, dude.

243
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,040
- Oh my God.

244
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,160
Easy guess.

245
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,840
You wanna see me do it again?

246
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,200
- You know, I'm honestly, I'm proud of myself.

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
That's all I need.

248
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
- Pat, do you wanna see me do

249
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
the biggest math problem in the world?

250
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
- Sure.

251
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
- You wanna see me do it again?

252
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,760
- Oh my God, no, come on.

253
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,200
And that's how I'm going to destroy your dad mentally,

254
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
psychologically.

255
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
- You will never wear my dad down.

256
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,920
- I'm going to mail your dad raw meat for a month

257
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,000
leading up to the fight, just to intimidate him.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah, and I'm going to say, this is bad to be you.

259
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,160
This is the last guy I fought.

260
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
- I'm going to come into the ring.

261
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going to have a boxing glove on one hand

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
and on the other hand,

263
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm going to have a Freddy Krueger glove,

264
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
but instead of knives, it's feathers.

265
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,080
And I'm going to tickle him to death.

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
- That's right.

267
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,160
- I'm going to talk to my man, Donkey Kong.

268
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,000
i'm a time in downtown to get that glove that he uses in super mario baseball

On the phone at 1 a.m. And he was small

288

291
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:59,740
this

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,500
- Yo, I have a better ratio of wins to losses

293
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,660
than Ninja right now. - You look like Ninja too.

294
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,700
Oh, we should get Cameron the headband for Christmas.

295
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,860
- We should get Cameron Ninja for Christmas.

296
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,300
- Yeah, we should get Cameron Ninja gear.

297
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
- Whoa.

298
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,940
- I'm going on, all right, Cameron, what's your address?

299
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,380
Cameron, what's your address?

300
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,200
- What?

301
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,040
- Cam, what's your address?

302
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,980
- Your address in two, three, your poop.com.

303
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,500
- Don't just say it, just say it.

304
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,940
- Oh my God, is it seriously your address?

305
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
That's such a funny address to have.

306
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,340
How'd you get that? Did you have to pay extra for that address?

307
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:31,940
Yeah.

308
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,440
You should be able to get a vanity address.

309
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,940
Like a license plate, right?

310
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,940
They have to put like a custom street sign that goes right next to your house.

311
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
That's a really good idea.

312
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,940
It's all done, the mail is all done by GPS anyway.

313
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:54,440
If you put it in the database at my address, it's like Diarrhea Street 4, then they can find it.

314
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:54,940
Right.

315
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,300
Dude, that'd be so cool to be able to walk by a house and just see like, oh, these people

316
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,620
paid $500 so they could live on diarrhea street.

317
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,300
And guess what?

318
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,020
It's per house, so their upstairs neighbors have to deal with it too, even though they're

319
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,260
a 90 year old couple.

320
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:17,700
Yeah, it would have to work only for like resident, like people who live in homes.

321
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
I don't think you could do it for an apartment.

322
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,980
I'm buying a vanity address for the Burger King down the street and I'm not telling them.

323
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,260
(laughing)

324
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,380
- Yeah, and I'm gonna call it McDonald's.

325
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
- Oh my God.

326
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,100
- Yeah, it's McDonald's on GPS.

327
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,020
But that'd be sick, man.

328
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,140
You could get, it'd be just be, that'd be so sick, man.

329
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,100
- That'd be the coolest thing to get of all time.

330
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,220
- Yeah, I don't know.

331
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,180
I think, you should be able to do vanity everything.

332
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,380
You should be able to do a vanity phone number.

333
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,260
- Yes, you can, I think.

334
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,460
- You can kinda do that, right?

335
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,220
- Yeah, you could definitely pay for a 1-800 number.

336
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
- You should be able to do a vanity

337
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,740

- There's one, two, and there's one, eight.

353
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,380
- And then what's the order of those numbers together?

393
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,320
the the british way we're going to six episodes seasons

394
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,400

395
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,080

you know that's a very happy

401
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,320
the british brain can't process like too many episodes at once so they have to do

402
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,560
what i can't get more higher than six years ago

403
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,640
so they just get stuck

404
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,820

why?

424
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,920
do british people still use shillings?

425
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,820
yes

426
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,720
is a shilling still a thing? yep

427
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,120
yeah they still use little picture little gold coins with

428
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,800
they do, they do

429
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,380
yeah they do use those though

430
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,480
yeah they do

431
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,340
like

432
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,340
In Canada they do that too, like a loonie is like a coin.

433
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,100
You can, in the UK, you can trade a chicken for stuff.

434
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,660
You can buy an Xbox with six chickens.

435
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,500
What is a shilling, Patrick?

436
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,340
Bring that back.

437
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,340
A shilling, five shillings is one crown.

438
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,500
Yeah, I'm sure they can use that, Pat.

439
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,500
But then two shillings and six pence is a half crown.

440
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,940
Wow.

441
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,060
But--

442
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,500
What's a couple of quid?

443
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,620
but two shillings is one florin which is a two bob bit

444
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,740
and twelve pence is one shilling but that's also a bob

445
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,320
and six pence is one six pence aka a tanner

446
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,860
see this is why i like that they make fun of us for using like inches and feet and miles and shit

447
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,460
and then you have stuff like this

448
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,140
yeah i mean i'll trade you one king's toe

449
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,300
but then you go down the list and then four pence

450
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,460
is one groat

451
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,340
three pence is one thruppence, two pence is one tupence or a half groat.

452
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,460
Yeah because two pence tupence. That's what I knew.

453
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,700
You know what's kind of weird thinking about it? You know in Fortnite,

454
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,380
Fortnite in the U.S. is just like an awesome game where you can dance and be

455
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,340
the Mandalorian and baby Yoda, but in the UK it's actually just a week.

456
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,500
True. Okay. One pound is 20 shillings.

457
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,220
How many shillings are you weighing right now?

458
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,780
Well, one shilling is 12 pence, obviously.

459
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,820
Okay.

460
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,860
Wait, how many pence?

461
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,620
Listen, we got enough pence over here.

462
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,380
Yeah, we got one pence too many.

463
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,940
That's right.

464
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Oh, this is old British money.

465
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:16,140
[Laughter]

466
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,820
Oh, shit, this is old.

467
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,940
Oh, shit.

468
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,060
Oh my god, that makes so much more sense.

469
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,140
Yeah, no, and they, I mean, they don't have any new money, so.

470
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,620
I'm gonna call the Bobbies on you so soon.

471
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,980
[laughter]

472
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,300
God damn.

473
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,700
Fuck the Bobbies.

474
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,100
[laughter]

475
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Hey, Bab!

476
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,940

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,580
Yeah?

480
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,380
Yeah.

481
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,980
They locked my partner up.

482
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,180
The Bobbies did.

483
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,780
Yeah.

484
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,740
The Bobbies rolled up.

485
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,900
the bodies pulled up

486
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,820
with the body bodies pulled up with the with the musket

487
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
yet it's not going to cut him

488
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,260
bobby's pull-up is one of the musket

489
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,680

that is just a guy

493
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,820
a lad allowed to be a bloke but i think a bloke how many letters of blood

494
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,500
I think a bloke is an older lad, and a lad...

495
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,820
You can call a group of lads blokes, but...

496
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Are we allowed to say lad?

497
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
No.

498
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,820
No.

499
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,260
We're just saying it because we're nasty.

500
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,380
Dude, we're culture vultures right now.

501
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
Yeah.

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,940
I hate being a culture vulture today.

503
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,860
Oh, I hate being a British culture vulture.

504
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860

You're being a culture vulture, mate!

507
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,580
It's so funny to me when, like, a tweet will go viral that's like, like, wow, do British

508
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,500
people do that accent all the time and then there'll be a bunch of quote tweets that are like

509
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,180
like i can't believe americans retweet americans retweet stuff like this they sound they're the

510
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,580
ones that sound so stupid all the time and every time i see one of those i just i just can't help

511
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,580
but imagine that it's me like the americans sound so stupid they think they're so smart

You're describing nobody.

732
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,360

733
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,680

she's older than me now did no you guys have to speak to a faster than you

739
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,480
she grew up faster than me because she was a virginity to horses that's

740
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,800
You guys have never heard that?

741
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,800
No!

742
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
You can break a women's...

743
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
This must be a southern thing.

744
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Yeah, probably.

745
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,000
No, girls sometimes will break their hymen riding on a horse.

746
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,640
This is probably something your mom told you in home schooling.

747
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Yeah.

748
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Well...

749
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,640
That's true.

750
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,640
That might be true.

751
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,880
Yeah, that might be true.

752
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,960
She also said that my hymen could never break.

753
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
Because it was protected by God.

754
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,600
I can't break my hymen.

755
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Yeah.

756
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't know why.

757
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:52,760
for years. I just one day I can't wait till my hymen breaks. You can try to break my hymen

758
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,440
but I'll just curl my tail up to cover it. You're not getting in there. Every night I

759
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,760
sit there with a ball pen hammer trying to break my hymen. I got a hammer and a nail down

760
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,600
there and I'm trying to get through. I've got a hammer, a nail, and a blanket of glue.

761
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I'm like Michelangelo down there, dude. I'm trying to sculpt something beautiful.

762
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
[laughter]

763
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,100
Dude, if I could just break this hymen, dude, everything would be better for me, man.

764
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,600
I've got a hammer, a nail, a plank of wood that says "No Girls Allowed" and I'm slamming it.

765
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I think my luck might be turning around! I just broke my hymen at work!

766
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I got a...

767
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,100
Don Knotts breaking his hymen?

768
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,100
I'm wearing a welding mask and I'm going to town with a blowtorch down there. I'm trying to melt it off.

769
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,300
Dude, I don't even want the stuff that happens after you break it.

770
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,300
I just want it gone.

771
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,900
Yeah, just get rid of it.

772
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,660
Hey, I don't care what you do with it.

773
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,660
I just want it gone.

774
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,660
Who was it?

775
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,660
It was T.I.

776
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Right?

777
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,620
T.I. said that he had a doctor inspect his daughter's hymen every month.

778
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
Every month, dude?

779
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,100
Yeah, something like that.

780
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,700
What a freak.

781
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,540
I think I could regrow it.

782
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,420
Didn't he say, like, no, I was joking, like right after or something?

783
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
I think so.

784
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
When people got mad at him.

785
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,540
should say there

786
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,740
my that he was a joking but definitely

787
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,240
the p_r_ person at atlantic records is like

788
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,260
please just say that i was

789
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,940
the from funniest joke of all time

790
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,040
as a kind of doing i was doing the i was doing uh... a funny bit

791
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,780
yeah i was doing a character actually yeah i think i think my son of the

792
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,260
doctor every month to make sure nobody pulled his tail

793
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,220
uh...

794
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,380
the doctor checks the area around

795
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,640
around his i remember being worried there's no stretch marks

796
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,180
i'm really worried that my hymen would break when i was like a kid that the doctor would

797
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,260
be able to tell that i jacked off

798
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,340
yeah and he would tell my parents like

799
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,720
he uh... he has come before

800
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,940
and then i'd go to jail

801
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,820
or something

802
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,820
yeah well it's a good you don't do it before you go to the doctor that's the

803
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,020
thing

804
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,460
true

805
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,780

806
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,540

you falsely to music and then like that music comes on shuffle or something and

937
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,560
you listen to and you can just you just think of your bed

938
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,600
no that's all you can think of no no there's this one album i would listen to all the time to fall

939
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,520
asleep and now i can't listen to it without just thinking like man sleeping is awesome actually

940
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,160
you know what psychosocial by slipknot does that for me because i used to listen to it when i would

941
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,960
go to bed in like sixth grade yeah i listened to one time i listened to danny brown while i was and

942
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,640
fell asleep by accident. I had a dream where I was at a Danny Brown concert.

943
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,840
Do you guys have any smells that give you a boner?

944
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,120
What?

945
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,120
Why am I so nasty today? But yeah, I'm sorry. I just I've been thinking about this.

946
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,920
There's a hand soap that I used to use as lube when I was growing up to jack off and

947
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,280
when I smell it, it gives me a boner.

948
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,960
That might be the key to going.

949
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,660
Yeah, we're gonna we're gonna figure out we're gonna figure out that smell

950
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:16,040
What is the brand hold on it's

951
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,520
Fuck, it's soft soap. I think

952
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,860
Yeah, it's the blue soft soap. Oh

953
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:30,460
Yeah, that could wake me up from any like drug-induced coma instead of like smelling salts like just fucking yeah

954
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:45,460
a

955
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,460
I'm getting to that soap no matter what.

956
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,460
Number 6, watch scary videos.

957
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,460
Can you guys watch something scary before you get a Nike Mare?

958
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,460
There's a script here.

959
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, not really much of a script.

960
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,460
It's more of a monologue.

961
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,460
Camera, do you want to read the monologue?

962
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Okay. Should I do any special voice for it?

963
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
Uh...

964
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
[laughter]

965
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
I just think it would fit the...

966
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
I don't know, I don't think it would fit the character.

967
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:33,060
to

968
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:37,380
voice I can do guys besides Scooby Doo. I can do the Crypt Keeper now.

969
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,900
Alright, well read it in the Crypt Keeper. Okay.

970
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Oh, this baby elephant is eating the tiger alive. Now it is looking straight into me through

971
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:55,140
the screen. Oh my gosh, blood is dripping out from his mouth. Wow, the baby elephant is

972
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:02,060
really coming out of the screen? Um, something like that. EEEE!

973
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,500
You sound like my auntie.

974
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:11,260
I don't know what the Cryptkeeper is, but no cap, you sounded like a pumpkin.

975
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,660
You sounded like a pumpkin and I'm-

976
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,460
The Cryptkeeper is a scary skeleton who says scary things.

977
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,860
He's the scariest skeleton of all time.

978
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,460
Take it back, dude.

979
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,420
Wait, but he's just like a normal guy, right?

980
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,300
He has like a normal job and a family?

981
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
Oh no.

982
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,620
He lives in the scariest house of all time.

983
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,140
Please say "psych" dude.

984
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
I can't.

985
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,140
I'm sorry.

986
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,780
Oh fuck.

987
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,980
Is there any way to delete your brain so you can't remember something?

988
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,100
Because I'm going to get so scared at lunch.

989
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,860
Number 7, play Slenderman.

990
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,140
I would, oh my god, are you kidding?

991
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,580
I would never do that.

992
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,380
I convinced myself Slenderman was real.

993
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,380
Yeah?

994
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Yeah, for a little bit.

995
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,180
Because there was this like, I would always bike home from my grandma's.

996
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,580
Yeah, it was yesterday.

997
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,580
It was yesterday.

998
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,460
I would bike home from my grandma's, there was all these trees, and I was like, that

999
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
motherfucker's in there.

1000
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,300
Is Slenderman in the tree?

1001
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,300
He's in the tree, dude.

1002
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,300
you know what I'd be scared of confusing him for a tree and then...

1003
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,800
Okay, number 8 has a script and it's a good script.

1004
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,300
Okay.

1005
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,800
Open the front...

1006
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,300
Number 8, open the front door and run around the neighborhood.

1007
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,800
We got boy, mom, and narrator.

1008
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,300
Okay.

1009
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,800
I'm sick of being a girl and I'm sick of being a boy.

1010
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,800
I'll be the mom this time.

1011
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Okay, I'll be the boy.

1012
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,300
Yay, it's recess!

1013
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,800
You would be more excited if you were a boy and it was recess.

1014
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Yay, it's recess!

1015
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,300
That's right.

1016
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:28,800
Yeah.

1017
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Okay, do your job now.

1018
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,080
68 minutes later. Are you serious? That's your narrator voice dude? Come on. Take it

1019
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:49,600
from the top. Okay, alright. Yay, it's recess! 68 minutes later. Shoo, I'm so... MOM! I'm

1020
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:58,600
going to tickle your feet for punishment! Mom, that's not punishment. Whoa, what is he

1021
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
he's saying here.

1022
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,160
What the fuck is he saying?

1023
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
Also there's no...

1024
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
None of these scripts have made sense.

1025
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
It has nothing to do with opening the front door.

1026
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,760
This one has made the least sense though.

1027
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,840
This is just like kind of a fantasy about your mom tickling your feet.

1028
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,440
This feels like one of those like jav porn titles.

1029
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,860

I'd be more in shock to see him do it.

1033
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400

I just said five messages in a row

1065
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,320
They're spaced an hour apart

That's true, I did do that.

1070
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,960
Yeah, I sent you guys a picture of my poop.

1071
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,880
Yeah, I sent a lot of troll faces too.

1072
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,840
Your poop looked like a tadpole.

1073
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,280
It was too dark of a picture, I couldn't really see what was going on.

1074
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
That's why I thought it was funny, because I took it while I was on the toilet.

1075
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,880
Also I'm looking and there's pubes in the toilet as well.

1076
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,200
That's one of the worst photos of all time, dude.

1077
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:22,200
horrible. Yeah that's not good. Number 12, get naked and dance around the street. I think

1078
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,080

1079
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,920
going to jail. Yeah that's true. Ooh. Skipping ahead here, number 15, try to summon Satan.

1080
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,680
Top comment. I'm a wizard. No one tell me I ain't, cause I summoned a ghost yesterday

1081
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,360
in my backyard at 8 o'clock. I found this ritual online and it worked. I don't know

1082
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
if I trust this ghost though. Oh well.

1083
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,360
[Laughter]

1084
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,360
Here's another comment. At this point I feel like satin.

1085
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,360
Yeah, I guess I've tried to summon Satan I guess before.

1086
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,360
Yeah, have you guys done rituals?

1087
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,360
I mean I've like sat in my bed and I've like prayed to the devil to see if he appeared.

1088
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Did you guys ever try to do a seance?

1089
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,360
No. Have you guys ever tried to kill yourself just with your brain?

1090
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just like sit in bed and you're just like...

1091
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,360
Dude, I've thought about that. I've done that recently.

1092
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:15,400
and see if I could kill myself. I mean there's gotta be some thought that's just insane enough

1093
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,240
that just kills you like just having it will kill you like see I never just try to have a weird thought.

1094
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,640
It's the way that it lights up your neurons. Yeah I just always try and yeah something just like causes a

1095
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,120
massive stroke and makes you die. Yeah. There has to be some like Konami code for the brain that

1096
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,400
kills you instantly. Yeah there's this story I read about like it was like we should try to think of it.

1097
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:36,840
It's a sci-fi story about like these terrorists that invented a fractal that if you look at it

1098
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,280
It like freezes your brain because like you can't process it because it's too complicated

1099
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,100
Whoa cool thing in the world dude. Yeah, they try to do that with pig poop balls

1100
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,380
It'd be funny if Pat was in that story and he was just completely immune

1101
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:58,120
Just looking at like like a yeah looking just looking like I like into another dimension. Yeah

1102
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,840

00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,340
- 70 at the max, dude.

1194
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,180
- Yeah.

1195
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,000
- What the, you're--

1196
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,540
- You know what, sometimes I'll watch it at full volume.

1197
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,460
- Take it back, dude.

1198
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,300
- Don't do that.

1199
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,300
- Don't, you're-- - You never need full volume.

1200
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,220
- There are kids that listen to this.

1201
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,060
- I'll listen at full volume.

1202
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,580
- You're endorsing a dangerous--

1203
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
- Nine-year-old children that listen to this, Patrick.

1204
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,400
- And they all have a Samsung soundbar

1205
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,460
that goes to like 50 decibels.

1206
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,360
- So?

1207
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,800
- They're gonna see the movies too loud.

1208
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,620
- So?

1209
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,840
- And then they won't be able to hear anything at school.

1210
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,540
- You know who really has a fucking problem

1211
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,760
with this is my brother.

1212
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,560
- Talk your shit.

1213
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,640
- Yeah, let's do it.

1214
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,480
- No, it's been pissing me off.

1215
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,280
- Talk that talk, dude.

1216
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,280
- He, I swear that we'll be streaming sometimes

1217
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,120
and I'll have to text him.

1218
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,120
- Can we get a beef alert?

1219
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,360
- I'm beefing with him right now.

1220
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,560
I'm beefing with him. - Beef alert.

1221
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,760
He listens to his, he plays his TV too loud.

1222
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,680
He watches these fucking Viking shows.

1223
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,800
Don't know what they're called.

1224
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,040
He's watching these damn Viking shows.

1225
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,800
- More than one?

1226
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,440
- I think it's one show.

1227
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,440
- My brother is fucking Viking shows.

1228
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,000
- I'm so sick of his fucking Viking shows.

1229
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,560
- So what kind of like TV are you into?

1230
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,120
Mostly Viking.

1231
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
- Viking stuff.

1232
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,160
- Mostly like Viking is my genre.

1233
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,400
- Yeah, and full volume too.

1234
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,560
I like Viking full volume.

1235
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,720
Viking full volume is my show.

1236
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,720
That's my favorite genre.

1237
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,720
It's like a rom-com.

1238
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,200
What's your favorite genre other than Viking full volume?

1239
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,200
Viking full volume.

1240
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:25,120
Hey, do you guys want to come over after school?

1241
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,640
We're going to go watch Viking full volume.

1242
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,240
We're going to watch a Viking full volume movie.

1243
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:36,360
I'm in the mood for Viking full volume right now.

1244
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,360
It's gonna be the loudest one we can watch.

1245
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,360
[laughter]

1246
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,800
Yeah, we're gonna watch a really quiet samurai movie, if you guys wanna come over.

1247
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,400
We're gonna watch a clown movie on mute.

1248
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,400
We're gonna watch the mutant clown.

1249
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,400
Whoa.

1250
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
What was that about, dude?

1251
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,400
I think you actually...

1252
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
We were joking around.

1253
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,720
I think you may have just invented the coolest genre ever.

1254
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,440
A mutant clown?

1255
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,920

01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,600

1259
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,040

A million goblins, Lord of the Rings.

>> What else? >> Lord of my things.

1271

1273
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,360
>> And?

1274
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:43,200
>> And need some more new toys.

1275
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,320
>> Mm-hm.

1276
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,760
>> I'm just getting stuck in that.

1277
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,880
>> And I need more toys.

1278
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,040
>> And more toys.

1279
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,120
>> And more toys.

1280
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,520
And I need toys and I need toys.

1281
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,020
And I need more toys.

1282
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,520
And everybody starts snapping, dude.

1283
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,020
Like the goofy, like an extremely goofy movie.

1284
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,620
I get angry like a bull seeing the color red.

1285
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,120
Uh-huh.

1286
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,920
I start charging the audience 'cause snapping, 'cause I think

1287
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,320
they're snapping in my face.

1288
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,620
Yeah, you think they're waking you up.

1289
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,120
Yeah.

1290
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,820
Yeah.

1291
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,020
Number, the last three, number 49, turn on every light in the

1292
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,420
house.

1293
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,320
I did this when I was 12 and got into so much trouble.

1294
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
Number 50, play dirty.

1295
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,520
Yes, sir.

1296
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,920
Number 51, do yoga. Do some unusual yoga poses.

1297
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,720
I would never do unusual yoga.

1298
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,520
In my eyes, dude, all yoga is unusual.

1299
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,520
Why is that?

1300
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
Um...

1301
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,520
It's just kinda weird. You're on the floor.

1302
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,520
Yeah.

1303
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,520
Can you do yoga on your bed or on the couch?

1304
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,520
If God wanted you to look in the shape like a tree,

1305
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,520
He would have put your soul into a tree's body.

1306
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,520
That's also true.

1307
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
Namaste.

1308
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,520
