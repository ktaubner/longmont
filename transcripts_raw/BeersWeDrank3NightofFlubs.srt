1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Perfect. All right, let's go. All right. Okay. And so now that we're actually

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,440
Recording you could show me your blue foot your blue beer

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:17,780
A seagram's escapes Calypso, Kalata, and I would like to it's 3.2

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:28,400
Right here

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm gonna say this is flavor beer so oh so it is beer is

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:42,800
You intercepted my just complete bullet that I was about to throw directly into your chest and destroy you yeah

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,600
That is not beer that is that is juice

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,220
Smirnoff ice, but that's a flavored beer. I got just about the most opposite beer in existence

9
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I got a Voodoo Ranger IPA. I've never had one of these. I've never in my life had one of these. I'm really pretty, I'm a little bit scared.

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:14,040
And then I have, my second beer is kind of an overcorrection I'd say.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,040
That's a blurry beer.

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
That's the blue plot from Fortnite.

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,240
that we're gonna end up with a pocket of 75 shields.

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,120
I got a classic brown beer.

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,920
Oh, a Mick collab. I almost grabbed one, dude.

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,920
Now I'm glad I didn't.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,560
There will be one of these days where we press record

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,120
and we lift up these cans and it's three identical fucking beautiful...

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
What beer would we be drinking?

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Maybe like a hard orange juice or something that we picked out

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,960
because we were feeling a little sick.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Yeah.

23
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,880
I really didn't want to do this today because I had too much beer over the weekend.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,360
But you know, what can you do, right?

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
I went to a German restaurant.

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,560
Went to a beer garden German restaurant.

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Did you?

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Which, was it in LA?

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
It was in like Long Beach area.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Oh, okay.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Yeah, it was, so really good appetizers.

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,560
We got poutine, we got a pretzel, we got like Brussels sprouts.

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,880
I had two salads that were really good.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,000
And just awesome.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,400
And main course, two sausages and mashed potatoes and whatever German noodles.

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Dog shit.

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Tasted awful.

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Really?

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,480
Mashed potatoes were cold.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Just came out cold.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
No!

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
No!

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
No!

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Dog shit.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,480
dessert, brownie with ice cream,

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
little bacon crumbles on top, and the fucking--

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
- That was good, right?

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,480
- Apple cereal, delicious.

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
- Amazing.

50
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
- So go there.

51
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
- The entree matters the least.

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
The only thing, I go to a restaurant,

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
I get two or three appetizers, right?

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I get one entree, I always order it in a panic mode

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,480
right there at the end, because I'm with the wife and she,

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
do women do this to you guys,

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,480
where you go out to a restaurant,

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,220
And she goes, you say, "I'm gonna get this."

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:23,120
You confidently say, "I'm going to get the hamburger."

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Right?

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,780
- Yeah.

62
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,280
- And she says, "I'm gonna get..."

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,680
She says, "What if you get the hamburger

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,540
"and I get the diarrhea soup and then we split?"

65
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,120
(laughing)

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
Right?

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,760
They always say, "We'll split.

68
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,800
"I'll get the actual shit sandwich

69
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,920
"and you get the amazing lasagna

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,840
and we'll eat both have half and I go I don't want to eat shit and diarrhea she

71
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,280
goes well I do and I want a burger and I said bitch you should be 400 pounds in

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,760
pick a fucking dinner

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:12,200
he got the man got the yummy nummy chicken schnitzel sandwich

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Borscht is a soup right?

75
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
It's a soup.

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Diarrhea bowl.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
It is the diarrhea soup.

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
You got the bratwurst there?

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
They didn't have bratwurst, they were out.

80
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Went too late.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
So I got one that was like

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
some sort of like spicy duck

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
sausage, I thought it had cheese inside

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
but it was a little gross.

85
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Yeah, cheese in a sausage

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
is so hit or miss man.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
Because sometimes they put way too much

88
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,880
It's just got the wrong texture.

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
- It's good when it's like,

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,440
sweating out of the sausage.

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,280
- I don't like that.

92
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,280
When it comes out like pores, that is odd to me.

93
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,240
It's a little, especially a white cheese

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,200
coming out of those holes is very pimply.

95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,520
I really don't like it.

96
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,120
And a little bit, if you have a dirty mind,

97
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,200
it's jizz, but I don't, so I don't think

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,120
about that kind of thing.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,960
- Come on.

100
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,040
- See, I didn't even want to bring that up, man.

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,480
I didn't even want to talk about that.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
But yeah, when I go to a restaurant,

103
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,360
I feel like I just wanna eat the appetizers.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
I wanna eat four bites of my entree, take it home,

105
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
I don't care if it was good or bad.

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
And then I wanna eat the dessert.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
- Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,140
- And for the dessert,

109
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,600
and the dessert better be the best thing I had that night,

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,120
or else I'm gonna fucking flip my lid on Yelp.

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,000
I will go crazy.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
- Do you guys use Yelp a lot?

113
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
Do you guys review places?

114
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
- I'm a Yelper.

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,680
Josh got me onto Yelp.

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,520
- Really?

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,320
- I only ever feel compelled to review a place

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,200
on Google Maps or some shit like that.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,680
when I know it's like a small place,

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,340
I'm like, "Oh, I really like their stuff."

121
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,560
So when I help 'em out, other than with money,

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
so that's when I review.

123
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,640
I never really feel like--

124
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,120
- Yelp is better. - Giving a bad review.

125
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,560
- Yelp is way better than a tip, right?

126
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
Like you don't have to tip if you leave a Yelp review.

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
- Yeah.

128
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
They actually take off your bill.

129
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,200
- Yeah, exactly.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,640
If you do a survey when they hand you that subway receipt,

131
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
they say there's a survey on there.

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,560
If you do that survey, no tip.

133
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,400
I'm not tipping.

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,940
yeah well it's like a tiered type of thing as well like if you also follow them on twitter

135
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,020
and instagram and facebook now they give you money

136
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:23,080
and not the business by the way the waiter the waiter is giving you money out of that

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,240
little flip of ones why don't more guys more thugs and gangsters why don't they rob waiters

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,560
they always have one dollar bills in their little batman belt

139
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,560
Probably because it's smarter than Rob's strippers.

140
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Probably easier too.

141
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:48,440
To die like Catwoman?

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Getting some clear?

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,440
What would be the last thing you'd say before dying to Catwoman?

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I love you!

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Something like "kitty cat claws"

146
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
Maybe some really classic lines.

147
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
"Oh her pussy's right behind me, isn't it?"

148
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:17,280
Probably most guys who die by a woman's hand, probably their last, either what they say

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,840
or what they think is probably "Man, I'm about to kill this woman."

150
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,960
"There ain't no way I'm about to kill this woman."

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
I know who's getting home tonight, it's me.

152
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,920
And then they die by a woman's hand.

153
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,120
- Yeah. - Yeah.

154
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,960
- There's no way my wife is gonna cut off my penis.

155
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,800
- Yeah, probably the last words of a lot of men who dies,

156
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,700
what are you gonna do, bitch, kill me?

157
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,940
(laughing)

158
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,600
'Cause they think that's so funny

159
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
that a girl could kill them.

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,000
- Yeah, but you know how men are,

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,720
we gotta make a little joke at the worst possible time.

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Otherwise, are you even a man?

163
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Nah, of course not.

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
You haven't made a situation worse for the woman by an ill-timed comment.

165
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Definitely, because you just couldn't help yourself.

166
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I couldn't help it.

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Yeah, sorry baby, I'm too funny.

168
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Can I just say that?

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I hope I made it off.

170
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
You're just as precious as that.

171
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Rex cannot stop doing that, whatever, everyone he meets, regardless of what.

172
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I can't do that.

173
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
I can't stop doing that to literally anyone.

174
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Just regardless of gender, age, wealth.

175
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I think that's a net neutral.

176
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
That's a zero.

177
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Exactly.

178
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
All the sugar too?

179
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
That's just yummy.

180
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Well, that is a true nootropic.

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,720
If nootropics are measured on how fast they kind of make your brain work, sugar has to

182
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
be up there, right?

183
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
It's up there with caffeine.

184
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Yeah

185
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:05,160
We should ask you some props and

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,600
Logical situations and what you do in them. Yeah, you find yourself like debating more now that you're taking these

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:22,420
This guy's gonna be debating the fucking mailman in 40 minutes

188
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,420
It made me laugh and it made me go on the back of my...

189
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Sorry.

190
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
He doesn't have a how to tackle that one camera entirely.

191
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
I wish, dude.

192
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
That's fine.

193
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,420
You could call the ambulance to my house and watch the guy in the background.

194
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:47,420
If you, if I was, if we were in a situation where for, and I know this is already unrealistic,

195
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,480
but I got hurt and you had to call an ambulance.

196
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,540
And I was in the back of the ambulance.

197
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,520
Would you guys be like, and they were like closing the door,

198
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,180
would you put your hand in and say,

199
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,960
"No, I'm riding with him."

200
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,820
Or would you say, "Nah, bye."

201
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,220
If you said, "I'm his sister."

202
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,780
- Yeah, that's what I would say.

203
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,340
- Or if Jubio said, "I'm his father, I'm his grandpa,

204
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm his papacito."

205
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,780
- That is my mijo, let me in.

206
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,700
That is my amazing Miho.

207
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,820
I am his T.O.

208
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,980
Please let Mio into the car.

209
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,460
- No, let Mio in the car.

210
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,660
- Yeah.

211
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,780
- Would you ride with me?

212
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,620
- Of course.

213
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,860
- Yeah, that'd be a free ride to the hospital to see you.

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,340
And that way I don't have to pay for the Uber.

215
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,540
- And I don't have to get flowers 'cause I was in the ambulance.

216
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,820
- Yeah, you're right.

217
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
I probably won't remember that.

218
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,980
I'll probably be dead.

219
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,420
But what if I, you ever think about that

220
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,680
when you get into the ambulance, right? And then they start driving to the hospital and

221
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,380
you just instantly die before you even leave the driveway. Right? They're like, "We're

222
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,420
going to take him to the hospital." And then before they even turn the siren on and the

223
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,660
guy's dead. It's kind of...

224
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,020
That's never happened to me. When's the last time you've been in an ambulance?

225
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,340
I've never been. I was supposed to go one time.

226
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,340
Really?

227
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:15,660
I had the sutures from my tonsil surgery.

228
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,420
They exploded and I was bleeding.

229
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,220
I lost like a gallon of blood at my grandma's house.

230
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,220
And my grandpa called the ambulance because he thought I was going to die.

231
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,460
And they were like, "Okay, we're going to take him."

232
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,300
And my grandpa was like, "All right, cool.

233
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Put him in the ambulance."

234
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,180
"Wait, how much does an ambulance cost?"

235
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,900
And the guy's like, "$600."

236
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
And he's like, "Nah."

237
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,460
Nah, and then and he was like I was like okay let's take your car and he literally

238
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,220
was like we can't take my truck because you'll get blood all in the cab so

239
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,140
your mom's gonna drive she lives 35 minutes away she's gonna drive in pick

240
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,740
you up in her shitty car and then take you to the hospital. That's so sick. Yeah he's a beast dude.

241
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
- Shout out to Peter.

242
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,860
- Yeah, well you made it.

243
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,700
- Yeah.

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,380
- During my Adderall days, there was a time where,

245
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,980
you know, I've been sniffing and taking a couple dabs

246
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,540
and really just having a good time, drinking beer.

247
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,300
And then suddenly was on, just woke up on the ground,

248
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,140
not feeling too great.

249
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,980
- Oh no.

250
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,940
- Clearly had something happen.

251
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,100
So they called like 911 and they came.

252
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
They were like, "Hey, fine, you wanna go to the hospital?"

253
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I was like, "Hmm. Yeah, I'm good. Just leave me on the doorstep. I'll get it up in a minute."

254
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Yeah, I would rather die than lose $600 for a fucking car ride, bro.

255
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
For real.

256
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,100
What, because you got extra TVs in there? That's why I paid $600? That's bullshit.

257
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Yeah.

258
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
What have you been in an ambulance for?

259
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Oh, when my accident happened.

260
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
When the thing fell on your head?

261
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,100
I forgot about that!

262
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Yeah, when a wall fell in...

263
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
You were so nonchalant about that.

264
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Yeah, you died.

265
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
But you were in an ambulance?

266
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Yeah, so a wall collapsed on my head and my foot.

267
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,100
And it mostly did no damage to my head, I don't think.

268
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I think it did a lot of damage to my foot.

269
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
You're definitely different.

270
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm normal.

271
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,100
So an ambulance came in and some paramedics were checking me out.

272
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,600
They were like, "All right, yep. Yeah, I think you're hurt."

273
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
So they took me into the hospital in an ambulance.

274
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
And I made it. I didn't even die.

275
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
How much did that cost?

276
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I don't know. I think the...

277
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
some insurance.

278
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,600
So the guy... I mean, it was an accident.

279
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Like, there was...

280
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
the guys were responsible, so they had to pay

281
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
for everything.

282
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Did you ever sue them?

283
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I wanted to, but no. I didn't.

284
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Too hard to do that kind of thing.

285
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I always think about that. Like, people who slip

286
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
and they break their leg at like a barber shop

287
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
and then they fucking sue everybody.

288
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
they sue the owners and shit.

289
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Like how do you have the time to fill out all that paperwork

290
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,940
and have the patience and you have to put on the fake

291
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,420
neck brace and your arms in a sling

292
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,960
and you have to be wary of a private investigator

293
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,040
taking a photo of you with a pencil.

294
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,960
That's just not a good life to live I don't think.

295
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,680
- Yeah and you also have to like pay a fucking lawyer.

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,600
- Yeah.

297
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,160
- Before you even get any money.

298
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,960
- Sounds like that.

299
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
- The way Caleb said that made me think

300
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,000
of like a five year old boy.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Like, you know, the paperwork.

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,240
(laughing)

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
You slipped on my crayons.

304
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,640
(laughing)

305
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,840
Yeah, for that.

306
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,680
- Yeah.

307
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,500
- You know?

308
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,000
- Yeah, that's funny.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
- You couldn't do that these days.

310
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,800
Me and Drew have been talking about how basically

311
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
there's this plague slash disease

312
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,760
that's been eating the entire nation,

313
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,920
just slowly by, and let's be real,

314
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,040
started on the West Coast and it came to the East Coast,

315
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,040
and it's basically wokeism and wokeistic language,

316
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,640
thought patterns, which we're not woke,

317
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,240
you know, I'll say something right now.

318
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,620
Fuck, crap, you know, like I just fucking,

319
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,440
just steamrolled that, right, can't say that.

320
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
- Yeah, shit.

321
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,280
- Yeah, ballsack on the Queen of England on her mouth.

322
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,880
That's what I think.

323
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
- Oh, she's dead, too.

324
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,840
- That was obviously too far,

325
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,520
And that's what woke, but wokest would say, Oh, you went too far.

326
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,960
It's over for you. You have to go to Guantanamo Bay or Guantanamo.

327
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,720
Gay probably now. And then, and

328
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,480
yeah, guys all on yo gay. And then I don't know,

329
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,560
they'd probably keep going, but I can't do that because of my straight. But,

330
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,320
yeah, man, it's really, it's a sad state of affairs, you know?

331
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,080
Yeah. They're, they're really getting it really proactive. Last night,

332
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,240
I stepped out of my apartment and I didn't notice

333
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
until I was outside that they completely locked me

334
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,280
out of my apartment, they woke me up.

335
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,120
- Right.

336
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,960
- They snuck in.

337
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,160
- They snuck in, they took my keys.

338
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,280
- Out of your apartment, they put them back.

339
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,920
- Yeah, they just put them back in the apartment

340
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,680
and they locked the door and I was just stuck.

341
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
I had to order McDonald's to the exit of my apartment.

342
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,400
- Wow.

343
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,520
- And the guy was like,

344
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,160
a burger and some nuggets.

345
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I think the quarter pounder I think was what it was called.

346
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Yeah.

347
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
What do you call that?

348
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,280
Like a 3 meter?

349
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,840
The 4 centimeter burger?

350
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,240
Nah, I said what I called it.

351
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
The cheese?

352
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Asshole.

353
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,200
Yeah, the quarter kilo con queso.

354
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,480
And then the woke mob almost flooded my apartment as well while I was locked out.

355
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
They fucked up my...

356
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Water or with vitriol?

357
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,480
With...uh...mostly water from the toilet

358
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
that was leaking out of the toilet

359
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
into the floor.

360
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
They like the toilet.

361
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Cause women's pussies touch it.

362
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Yeah.

363
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
As far as I know.

364
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
So, I'm pretty much, uh...

365
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
I'm pretty much like an anti-woke, uh...

366
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
uh...figurehead now.

367
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
And I'm treating stuff like...

368
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Women are fucking stupid.

369
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
And I'm...I love meat.

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Yeah.

371
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,160
Yeah, that's my new money thing. I mean a knob of butter for dinner

372
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:23,880
Because of how gay the TV is because of the last of us episodes are getting gayer

373
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah episode. Yeah

374
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,120
The movies based on a PlayStation game every fucking episodes gay nah

375
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,640
No, that's too. That's too far

376
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:43,360
That's too much

377
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, dude, and they don't tell you they snuck in they think through your keys inside before you locked it

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,720
They don't tell you how fast the woke mob is do their speedy motherfuckers a lot of short

379
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,160
Yeah

380
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:06,160
You know they say you ever heard that thing where they say hey you want to see the woke mob destroy America

381
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,480
from the inside

382
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,920
Yeah, you'll see it do it again. That's a

383
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Damn.

384
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Yeah, they're so fast.

385
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Yeah.

386
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Pretty fucking crazy.

387
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I do...

388
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,040
Yeah, I had my run-ins with them, but what were you saying?

389
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,480
We should do a Fox comedy show.

390
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,920
That should be the goal for this show.

391
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
We could definitely parlay this.

392
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,560
I know people these days who live in northern California.

393
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
We could rename it.

394
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Oh, Whiskey We Sip.

395
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Oh.

396
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,720
- We sit and talk about the good old days.

397
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
- How about this?

398
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,920
- I don't think I've ever had to whisk it in my life.

399
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
- You, me, and you.

400
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,520
- Oh, right.

401
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,000
- We have a show on FX called The Speak Easy.

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,660
- Oh my God, yes.

403
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,840
- You walk down there, it starts with,

404
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,920
I'm walking down, right?

405
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,120
I'm looking for my first job, right?

406
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,080
Jubio, he's polishing the counter, you know?

407
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:14,320
me saying shh, shh, because it's a speakeasy. And then you come out, you're completely Mr.

408
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,080
Krabs. In fact, we just put you in a Mr. Krabs outfit and you're the boss. You have red skin,

409
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,400
you have a blue shirt on, and you're wearing stilettos.

410
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Yup. Huge stress.

411
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:35,160
I try to get a job, but this is the thing, and this would probably work these days with

412
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:42,640
the Woker audience. What does a speakeasy need? A cabaret act, right? So I come in, I'm bald,

413
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,560
I'd make an amazing drag queen. You guys dress me up, you fucking give me amazing, beautiful,

414
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,880
amazing tits with toilet paper, you give me an amazing toilet paper ass, you give me a

415
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,080
toilet paper vagina that cover my toilet paper penis with toilet paper. And then you send

416
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,560
me out and I'm doing Jessica Rabbit stuff, right? I'm putting my high heels right on

417
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,320
a guy's chest and I'm grabbing his tie, pulling him towards me, going for a kiss, going away

418
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,960
last second, right? And then finishing my song. Do you guys think that would work on FX?

419
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
I think so.

420
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah, well it depends on the song.

421
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,720
And we could say "Junio got hit in the head by 9/11"

422
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
"I got my ass up in the air sometimes"

423
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,080
True. But if I was doing Taiyo Cruz or another pop thing like that, do you think that would

424
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
work?

425
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Yeah.

426
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Like the voice of an angel, a female angel?

427
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,880
Yeah, I think it will work. I think we'll get cancelled after the first season because of how raw it'd be.

428
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,680
That's okay.

429
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,080
That's okay. Getting cancelled after the first season.

430
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,780
Getting cancelled is good.

431
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,280
Yeah.

432
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,680
As far as I think.

433
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,380
Yeah.

434
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,580
In my woke mind, getting cancelled is probably...

435
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,580
My opposite of woke mind. I want to be cancelled, right?

436
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,180
Right.

437
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,880
Man.

438
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,380
I'll say some cancel shit right now.

439
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,280
What's up?

440
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,420
Michael Jackson didn't do it, he's innocent.

441
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,620
Go ahead, cancel me.

442
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,740
Go ahead and try and cancel me, man.

443
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,480
See if I give a fuck.

444
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,060
He was just a...

445
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,980
What was that?

446
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,220
- They're breaking into Rex's house.

447
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,380
- I think they're-- - They already.

448
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,060
They heard the feedback from your headphones

449
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,660
and they thought you said it into the mic.

450
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,500
(laughing)

451
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,820
The thing about Michael Jackson, man,

452
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,340
is that he was a kid.

453
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,100
right as a kid and what did you do when you were a kid

454
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,460
you first i think you know

455
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,620
it's not a single kid

456
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,500
you ever saw a race

457
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,260
when i was talking nine years old i was fuckin every nine-year-old i know

458
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,140
certain michael jackson he's just a kid on the internet

459
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,380
so i don't understand why we have to

460
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,820
pretending he didn't make some of the best music ever made

461
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,100
you know also

462
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,940
what do you have

463
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,620
Woody Allen, he was an old pedophile at heart.

464
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,460
Right?

465
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,580
What does an old pedophile do?

466
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,220
He raped his daughter.

467
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,060
Yeah.

468
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,880
So it's like--

469
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
And is that so wrong?

470
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,020
I mean, yeah, but he was just, he was that at heart.

471
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,860
You know what I mean?

472
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,460
But he made good movies.

473
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,460
I haven't seen any of them.

474
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,260
I really can't comment on them.

475
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,580
Someone, I know somebody who saw them in,

476
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,580
saw him and son, what's his wife's name?

477
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,420
His wife's daughter?

478
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,240
Sun Yi.

479
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,880
saw him and Soonyi at a restaurant and he was like they are so in love.

480
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,160
I believe it. Amazingly in love. Good for them.

481
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Yeah. We should say a man and his creepy stepdaughter.

482
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,280
Yeah of course dude but girls love their daddies.

483
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:49,480
Yeah. Right? That's true. They needed Lana Del Rey 20 years ago.

484
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,040
Yeah. Would have been fine. He would have made it. No one would have cared.

485
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,280
Exactly. They needed Lana Del Rey as a bodyguard for when they're in public because of how huge she is.

486
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,840
There we go. Yes, sir.

487
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,320
Fucking bitch.

488
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,400
No, she's a nice lady. Yeah, I know. Yeah, we love to have her on.

489
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,760
We would love to have her on and I'm sure she'd love to be on. She's got 14 PBRs, right?

490
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,080
Bud heavies.

491
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,440
No.

492
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,760
I'm kidding, Lana baby, if you're listening.

493
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Which you are, I have insider information.

494
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,280
You are, yeah.

495
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
To completely, yes.

496
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,200
I really wanna get a celebrity to endorse beers we drank.

497
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,960
We don't really have one for Potabelt List.

498
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,180
Not a lot of celebrities.

499
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,100
We have Nate Roos.

500
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,920
We need, I mean, listen.

501
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,220
Nate Roos is great.

502
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,860
Nate Roos is great, but I need somebody who's like

503
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,440
at the Oscars or something, you know?

504
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,440
I need an Oscars level celebrity.

505
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,440
out. Meet Lizzie Kaplan. How about that?

506
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Who's that?

507
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,440
She's an actress. She's like Scarlett Johansson, but worse.

508
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,440
I don't think I've ever even heard of this woman.

509
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Yeah, I don't know who that is.

510
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Have you seen Party Down?

511
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Oh, I haven't seen Party Down.

512
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Despicable. Have you ever seen Party Down?

513
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
How about, uh...

514
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Nah.

515
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
It's good, dude.

516
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,440
Should I watch the new season on Peacock?

517
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm a I haven't watched it. So I can't

518
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,140
Yeah, I can marino yeah, he says the M or R in the new one

519
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,080
And a Wow so the woke mob is lost again, that's another elf

520
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,120
- Kevin Hart says Kevin Hart

521
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,160
And so what Kevin Hart?

522
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,960
Is it is the behind the scenes a blooper reel? No

523
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,760
Okay. Oh, wow

524
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,140
They let that make it to air yeah

525
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,120
Yeah, we can't do that anymore

526
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:00,640
Didn't they take

527
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,080
Those because the woke mob is one they couldn't bring back a 20 year old show that the inward

528
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,400
It would never happen

529
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,720
What was the was it 30 rock that they deleted a bunch of episodes because they're racist

530
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,840
That was the woke mob winning

531
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:24,960
I think people got mad at "Always Sunny" or something and then 30 Rock was like "Okay,

532
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,200
I kind of get what's happening here" and they took him down.

533
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,520
The thing is, if you watch 30 Rock, every episode of that show has like 50 racist jokes in it.

534
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
Yeah, and it's awesome.

535
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,040
It was the funniest show.

536
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,040
A young woman made it.

537
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
It's allowed.

538
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh, true.

539
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:50,040
Oh true. Well you know who started that trend of deleting all the racist episodes?

540
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:58,040
No. Bugs Bunny, Hanna-Barbera. True, oh Mickey Mouse! Yeah you're right.

541
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
It was the old cartoons. That's it, that's it. Yeah you're right. Actually Dr. Seuss even.

542
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Yeah. Right? And I know some of those, if you ask me, I'm sure some of those caveman

543
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,240
caveman paint, some of the cave paintings,

544
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,780
they were saying some unsavory,

545
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,520
they had some unsavory sexual dynamics

546
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,400
that have been scrubbed from history.

547
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,240
I would guarantee that, right?

548
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,120
Some rock that's like above the stick figure's head

549
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
that's about to hit a woman.

550
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
Some anthropologist guy just came through

551
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,940
and turned it into flowers or something.

552
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,920
- Yeah, now they're saying that there's only

553
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,360
stick, man stick figures fucking other man stick figures.

554
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,960
- Yeah. - But we know that's not true.

555
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,280
We've seen the circles and the dots.

556
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,960
We've seen the circles and the dots.

557
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,600
You can't pretend that that was never a thing.

558
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,360
The circle and the dot and the triangular bush

559
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,160
at the bottom of the stick figure.

560
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,000
Yep.

561
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,820
The fuck is going on?

562
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,800
Playing Pivot, right?

563
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,360
Making pornography in Pivot, the animation application?

564
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,680
Nope.

565
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,840
Fucking Newgrounds ass.

566
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,160
Dude, oh God, Newgrounds ass?

567
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,400
I'm on Newgrounds, I'm on the adult page.

568
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,240
Yeah.

569
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm fucking--

570
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,280
watching stick figure sex orgy 2

571
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm fucking the yellow gumball from Shaolin showdown. Oh wow, but with giant boobs

572
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,440
Quick, what's your favorite beating fuck games?

573
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,680
From new grounds who Julio meet and fuck

574
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:29,600
It's in development like that one that much yeah, it's in development. It's not out yet. It's a beta

575
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,360
I

576
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,120
Never play I got really scared of meat and fuck games

577
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,720
There was something to me that was like if you're watching like okay

578
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,960
So I don't know if this makes sense, but when I was a kid if I like watch porn

579
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,760
I would like I would like watch it with like one eye closed and one like half open

580
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,720
Because I and I would like kind of watch it with a blurred vision

581
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:59,800
Yeah, like this like watch like how George Bush senior would watch porn just like kind of like this right and then

582
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,000
And that was like almost too much.

583
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,640
And the idea of playing a game,

584
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,160
like I thought playing a game

585
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,780
where you could like fuck people in it

586
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,380
was basically, biblically, just as bad as having sex.

587
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,040
- Yeah, if it was too active?

588
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,200
Too much of a viewer input?

589
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,100
- Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

590
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,320
- I don't know if I ever did a mean fuck game.

591
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,480
- Really?

592
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,320
- No?

593
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,140
- No.

594
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,880
I think by the time I was old enough to think about that,

595
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,560
just watch. You were into visual novels weren't you? No. I didn't get into visual novels until I was like 22.

596
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,920
That's so much worse. It is so much worse. Juvia what was your favorite meet and fuck?

597
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,160
Because you opened this conversation so I know you have one.

598
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:51,240
Yeah. Princess Peach. I don't know they're kind of the same. They always like just go to a bar

599
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,200
and there's a girl with big tits. This guy's had so much fucking meet and fuck sex.

600
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,800
They're all the same just tears in the rain to this guy. Yeah, let me nothing to me now Wow no. I'm on steam playing

601
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,880
Coco life sim and just doing something really bad

602
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,780
Yeah

603
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,960
Yeah

604
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,280
I'm looking at looking up someone's life

605
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,060
You remember when you play a new grounds game that wasn't like a sex game

606
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:21,700
And there would be hidden sex in it or like hidden boobs or something. Yeah, it was so awesome, man

607
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,840
Frank's adventure three

608
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
Hot Coffee, Grand Theft Auto.

609
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
Which one was Hot...

610
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Grand Theft Auto.

611
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Was that the... wait, was that the name of the mission?

612
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
No, I think... I don't know, dude.

613
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,840
What are you talking about?

614
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,840
There's a thing called Hot Coffee for Grand Theft Auto boots.

615
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Oh, okay, yes. In San Andreas.

616
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Yeah.

617
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Oh, yeah.

618
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
I was never horny enough to be like, "I want to see video game boots."

619
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,340
because I could find regular boos just as easy.

620
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,640
That's like too much work.

621
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,720
You know what I mean?

622
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
- Yeah.

623
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,560
- You can just type boos.

624
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,400
- But it was kind of better

625
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,360
'cause you could earn it, you know?

626
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,280
- Yeah.

627
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,480
Yeah, you could earn it by just selling a mod for Skyrim

628
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,480
and just killing a woman and stealing all her clothes

629
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,640
and now she's completely naked.

630
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
- I've never played Skyrim.

631
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
- Really?

632
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,640
- It was okay for the time.

633
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,560
- No, you should play it.

634
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
You, especially 'cause you have VR, you should play,

635
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,020
there's a setup that I want so badly,

636
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,220
where you play Skyrim VR.

637
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,660
Skyrim's one of the only,

638
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,440
one of the only games that has full body haptic feedback

639
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,260
in VR, it's been modded in.

640
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,220
So if you get a full haptic body virtual reality suit

641
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,520
and you like put it on, when you go near like the stream

642
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,720
or like the river in Skyrim,

643
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,560
you feel like water droplets hitting your like legs.

644
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,600
- Whoa. - And I heard that,

645
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,840
and I was like, "This, that is, I would never leave."

646
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,480
- I think I should pay $10,000 to experience

647
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,180
what it would be like in your water.

648
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,880
- Dude, you're a guy with money.

649
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
You should have a haptic feedback suit.

650
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,320
You should have one of those things that's like

651
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,200
just a ball that you run on and you fall in place

652
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,800
and you look like a fucking idiot,

653
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,120
but it works in the game.

654
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,640
You should have all the custom guns, katanas, everything.

655
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,220
- Yeah, you're right, I should.

656
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,820
You should have a go-kart that you ride around in LA.

657
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:29,140
You should get in the Microsoft Flight Simulator and you should get the four levers that are

658
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,140
right next to each other.

659
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:37,100
I don't have the right kind of autism to be in the Microsoft Flight Simulator.

660
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,340
Boom Boom Volleyball, this was the one that I used to play on MiniClip.

661
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,300
On MiniClip?

662
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,420
You would hit a bomb back and forth and then there was some cheat code you could put in

663
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
to make him go topless.

664
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
Awesome.

665
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:55,500
I would, I didn't really know how to jack off but I would imagine what jacking off was

666
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,820
like whenever I'd look at that.

667
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
I'd figure it out.

668
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Yeah.

669
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,820
I learned how to jack off from listening to Stan Uptown.

670
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I figured it out.

671
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
What?

672
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
Okay, who?

673
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
I don't remember, there was no specific one.

674
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
It was, you know, before.

675
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,820
No, you have to say it, you have to say it.

676
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,820
I don't remember.

677
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
I don't remember.

678
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,820
I don't remember.

679
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
I don't remember.

680
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
I don't remember.

681
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
I don't remember.

682
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
I don't remember.

683
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
You have to say who it was.

684
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
It was probably maybe Ron White.

685
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,820
Maybe someone along those lines.

686
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
Interesting.

687
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
If you had said Louis, then I would have known

688
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
that you started jacking off very late in life.

689
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Yeah, no.

690
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
I mean, come on now.

691
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,820
I was jacking off very early.

692
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
You're kind of listening to stand-up comedy

693
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
too early in life, I might say.

694
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
Yeah, no, 100%.

695
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Yeah.

696
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
I learned so much

697
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,980
So much of my sexual knowledge comes from stand-up comedy between the ages of 10 and 13.

698
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,180
Just listening to it, learning.

699
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,780
Did you listen to Pandora Radio?

700
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
No.

701
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,620
That's how I discovered all stand-up when I was a kid.

702
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
Just watched Comedy Central.

703
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,820
Yeah, I guess I watched Comedy Central, but then I would also at night...

704
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,860
I've always been somebody who falls asleep with headphones in.

705
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,820
Like ever since I've had headphones, I fall asleep with headphones in.

706
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,700
and I remember watching, I saw Tenacious D pick of Destiny on TV and I was like,

707
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,820
Tenacious D is my new favorite band. So every night I would go on to Pandora and I'd fall

708
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:27,780
asleep to Tenacious D radio. And then it just has it, it's labeled as comedy and like rock or

709
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:33,060
whatever and I would just thumbs down all the rock songs and then get like, you know, fucking

710
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Matt Brawner standing up there.

711
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,820
You know? Yeah.

713
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,820
I used to love musical comedy.

714
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,820
Me too, man.

715
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,820
When you're like

716
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,820
under 12 years old

717
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,820
and you listen to musical comedy for the first time.

718
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,820
For me, it went way past that.

719
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,820
I probably, I think I had a Spotify

720
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,820
playlist called Musical Comedy

721
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,820
that I made when I was 16.

722
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,820
That was like all just like,

723
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,820
I still like Lonely Island.

724
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,620
We were watching a Lonely Island video the other day that was very funny.

725
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Stephen Lynch?

726
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,620
Stephen Lynch, dude.

727
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:20,980
I remember being, I always did this, I would listen to Stephen Lynch and Rucka Rucka Ali

728
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,140
and then when somebody else would talk to me about it I'd be like, "You know what the

729
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,580
crazy part about them is?

730
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,260
They actually have really beautiful voices."

731
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
That's great.

732
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
That's great.

733
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:37,900
My favorite Stephen Lynch song was the one about the peanuts.

734
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,100
And I was like, that's my favorite one because he really lets the pipes out.

735
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
He really lets them go to the wall.

736
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,100
He does have a beautiful voice.

737
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Isn't it amazing?

738
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,100
And he crushed, dude.

739
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Oh, dude.

740
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,900
He crushed the live tracks on those albums.

741
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
He was destroying.

742
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Yeah.

743
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
You can never crush as hard as a musical comedian.

744
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I was more into Tobuscus and Ray William Johnson.

745
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I understood what a black woman was because of Stephen Lynch.

746
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Jacking off and you learned about black women from Stephen Lynch.

747
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah, I understood how to respect them.

748
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,900
Speaking of Ray William Johnson, I was in Providence this past weekend.

749
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,780
weekend the green room signed by Ray William Johnson at the Providence

750
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,000
Comedy Connection. Wow. Damn. I like put my hand on it to see if I could feel

751
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,780
some kind of energy coming. Yeah. His presence? Yeah. I think that he's

752
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,300
probably I would guess from that era of YouTube he's probably the most like kind

753
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,700
of mentally well guy from that era. I wouldn't say that. No. Not a shot. He

754
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,700
He never had like a big public weird breakdown or like controversy, right?

755
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,700
He just like kind of faded into obscurity.

756
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,700
I guess, but he's like 40 something, he's like 50 years old and he's still doing like

757
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,700
TikToks on YouTube about how

758
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,700
your mom is being annoying and how the teacher is really gay for giving you homework.

759
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,700
See, but that to me is mentally...

760
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Like Shane Dawson is just ruined. Right? Shane Dawson is...

761
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Yeah, but Ray William Johnson.

762
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
Do you think about how...

763
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
I guess Ryan Higa is probably okay.

764
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
Yeah, what was his username?

765
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,700
Do you remember that username?

766
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Ryan Higa, let me look it up on...

767
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Hold on one second.

768
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,700
Ryan...

769
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Yeah, do you ever think about how old YouTube was?

770
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,700
Kind of like the founding fathers of modern culture?

771
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,700
It's Ryan Higa, is what his name is on Twitch.

772
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
Oh, okay.

773
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Yeah.

774
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,700
It definitely was, dude.

775
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
was dude.

776
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,540
Like Shane Dawson, what he became, it's now Sam Smith.

777
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,700
He just copied his whole thing, just being a fat gay guy.

778
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:04,740
You think Sam Smith's called Shane Dawson?

779
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,620
He's like, "Oh yeah, annoying fat gay guy, I can do that."

780
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
I guess you're right.

781
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,820
Yeah, I know this isn't the right time to do this, but I think I'm recording on the wrong microphone the whole time.

782
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:23,820
You've been recording on the wrong microphone? Yeah, that's fine. I'm recording on OBS anyways. Yeah, yeah, we got you.

783
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,620
I thought that you got really bad work news, so I'm glad that it was just about our

784
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:34,140
our side project. Are you guys excited to have a side project now? I love it. Yeah, it's awesome.

785
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,620
I've always wanted to have a side project.

786
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,860
Yeah, we could do anything that we want with it.

787
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:46,380
we could just like we could get crazy here we could do the chips eating episode

788
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,300
where we just eat chips into the microphone for an hour. I would love that.

789
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Chips we ate. Chips we watched.

790
00:37:52,300 --> 00:38:03,140
Yeah. Oh, okay. Kind of crazy with it. I was wearing my neck brace in Providence and

791
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,860
oh yeah by the way if you ever have to burp on this show, do it directly into the mic.

792
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,200
- This is a man's show, okay?

793
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,440
We make a point that we talk about,

794
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,240
you know, I thought the beer would scare him off, right?

795
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,920
Turns out these fucking bitches,

796
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,800
they will listen to the 30 minute point, right?

797
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
But then we start talking about jacking off,

798
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
masturbating, right?

799
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,320
But then we drop Ryan Higa, they're out by then, right?

800
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,020
And the ones who aren't, the burp will scare them away.

801
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,320
(burps)

802
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,920
- Every time Rex drinks out of his beer,

803
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,320
He gets a new perk for the zombies machine.

804
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,600
He's getting fucking, you're getting the fast reload and the ammo pickup.

805
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,520
True, you're running way way faster now.

806
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,520
You're running so fast there's a trail behind you, like a little ghost, like in KOTOR.

807
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,160
I really want them to make another KOTOR game, man.

808
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,400
It's really, I try, you know, I love those games, I love KOTOR 1 and 2.

809
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,280
my favorite games ever and I tried playing Mass Effect people like it's

810
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,520
like a better version I think that game sucks I think Mass Effect is a Mass

811
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,920
Effect yeah I think I like Mass Effect 2 but the Mass Effect 3 is like really

812
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,640
dropped the ball yeah I guess every any which is like the same whatever Mass

813
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,320
Effect I played had a some mission where you go to a snow planet and it was such

814
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,600
bullshit like boring like I'm driving a fucking Hummer yeah through the snow for

815
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:40,600
hour I just I gave up on it I couldn't do it anymore.

816
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:46,760
My only memory of Mass Effect was I had never played Mass Effect 1. Mass Effect 2 came out

817
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,640
and I tried to pirate it. My mom had the worst internet possible. Just awful.

818
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
AOL?

819
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:00,120
Yeah. It was like a step above AOL. Like they stopped having AOL and she got the worst possible

820
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:09,200
It was Thanksgiving and so like my cousins were staying over and I was pirating Mass

821
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Effect 2 which was like 10 gigabytes, massive.

822
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,240
Talking about a two day download, right?

823
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,920
And I remember all my cousins had to do like homework and they'd be like, "The internet

824
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,160
is just impossible to use here.

825
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,480
I wonder what's wrong with it."

826
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I have no clue. Knowing full well that I was using all the bandwidth to download Mass Effect 2.

827
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,480
And then I never played it. I just downloaded it, played it for like an hour and unsold it.

828
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
That's awesome.

829
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
You gotta play it, man.

830
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,480
It was just ruining their weekend.

831
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I need a new game to play.

832
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Play the Atomic Heart. Game looks awful.

833
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,040
Yeah, it kind of looks like poop to me.

834
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,480
People said that it's like a new Bioshock, but I was like, alright, every time a new game

835
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,320
comes out I always get like someone annoying in the chat being like, "You have to play

836
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,300
this, you have to play that, you have to play that."

837
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,860
So what I've been doing now is I just look up on YouTube, like, "Atomic Heart Walkthrough"

838
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,360
and I just skip around until I find something really annoying, like the main character talking

839
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,840
to an annoying character and be like "Oh, this game sucks!" and just throw it off.

840
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,440
And never think about it ever again.

841
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,480
That's smart. That just deletes it from your brain. You've already categorized it as terrible.

842
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,440
Yeah.

843
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,480
I've got a new theory that main characters should never speak anymore.

844
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,360
How do you guys feel about that?

845
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,040
I...

846
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,920
The wife is playing the Hogwarts game.

847
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,560
Really?

848
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,720
Not me.

849
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,920
I would never, never, never do that.

850
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,320
I would never do that.

851
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,920
Because even the men who listen to this manly show know that that is wrong.

852
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
It is wrong.

853
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
To play that.

854
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,920
If you play that game, you're fucking disgusting.

855
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
It is awful.

856
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,520
You fucking disgust me.

857
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
Yeah.

858
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
It's despicable.

859
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
Shit.

860
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
If you play that game.

861
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,720
If you watch the movies, you're an amazing queen.

862
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:17,720
But the guy who plays the main character, it's so effective.

863
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,560
They got a guy who just sounds exactly like Daniel Radcliffe and sounds exactly like Harry

864
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Potter.

865
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
And it raises me to...

866
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Does he say something like "flippendo"?

867
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
What's that?

868
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Have you ever played the old Harry Potter games?

869
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
Uh-uh.

870
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Really?

871
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,400
I played the one on the DS.

872
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,700
I only played, I played it and it was kind of like this game

873
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,460
where you could like walk around and shit,

874
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,420
but I just went to, I just liked doing the classes

875
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,500
because I was like--

876
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,340
- You wanted to do it all the time.

877
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,840
- If I was in the Harry Potter,

878
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,060
if I was in Harry Potter, I'd be Hermione.

879
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,140
- If I was in Harry Potter, I would do it all day.

880
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,220
- I don't wanna fight a troll.

881
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,600
I wanna learn, I wanna learn how to do this.

882
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,820
It seems very easy.

883
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,300
The fact that you have to go to school

884
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,460
to learn how to do this and say a word

885
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,620
means that a lot of these, and I don't mean this in, you know, don't take this the wrong

886
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,940
way, a lot of these wizards, and maybe it's just the British, I think mentally disabled.

887
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
I think a lot of them.

888
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,620
The fact that you have to go to a school to learn how to make a U shape with a piece of

889
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,980
bark and say "stupendous."

890
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:25,860
I think if you have to go to that special education, it should require you to go untrained

891
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,620
for seven hours a day.

892
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Definitely.

893
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,980
And the other thing is, how hard are these to learn?

894
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,540
Every single one of these fucking words have a Latin root.

895
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Yeah.

896
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Right?

897
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Yeah.

898
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
Like how...

899
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
That is...

900
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,540
Yeah, anyway.

901
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,140
There's no wonder a piece of crap came up with that whole fucking universe.

902
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,140
Yeah.

903
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,780
Yeah, well it's not only like special education.

904
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,420
It's like people who are different from others.

905
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,740
They got different abilities.

906
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,740
Yeah.

907
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,740
They're differently abled.

908
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,740
In different ways.

909
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,620
They're differently abled from the normal people.

910
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,620
And they think the trees are talking to them.

911
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
Yeah.

912
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
And that there's ghosts.

913
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:07,460
Yeah, as a guy as an anti-woke guy, I'm a little bit confused about how to play that game though

914
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,180
because on one hand

915
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,180
There's a women in it

916
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,900
The person who made it is is a bad person right

917
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:24,480
As a guy who's anti-woke. I'm like thumbs up. That's amazing. Yeah, but then the people who made it

918
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,120
They're putting all this crap in there. Here's a girl. Here's a guy. Here's a two guys. Here's two girls

919
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,120
Two guys. Yeah, Ali and I were back there.

920
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Two guys, there better be a ping pong doubles match going on, right?

921
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Two girls, they better be scissoring. Turns out that one was true.

922
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,120
And so I'm a little bit conflicted about this whole game.

923
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,120
But luckily I'm not playing it and my wife is.

924
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:58,120
And she's so stupid that she doesn't really understand the whole political thing.

925
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,120
She's just enjoying the video game.

926
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,080
political statement right and I'd say I tell her sometimes like you know that

927
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:09,200
you're essentially wearing a swastika tattoo directly on your head one on

928
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,000
your back and one in the middle of your stomach yeah she usually does this

929
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,040
usually takes one head for off because what do you say

930
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,520
was that huh and I go nothing do they solve the the the banker else in the

931
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:45,520
games and let me tell you Rex turned it up to 11 literally took the computer they

932
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,800
opened up the rendering computer right right they opened up the disk drive they

933
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,400
They put in a paper copy, an original 1935 paper copy distributed by the Ford Motor Company

934
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,080
of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

935
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,400
They put it in the DVD drive, they shut it, and they got some amazing, amazingly Jewish

936
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,320
monsters that handle all the money in this game.

937
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,720
Yeah, totally different from real life too.

938
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,760
Long silence from me and Jubio.

939
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Yeah, don't laugh at that.

940
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,120
That was a test. I was testing you. I don't even know what that means.

941
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,120
That's one of the protocols.

942
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,120
Is that I have to test you to see if you like that show.

943
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,520
I personally am a big fan of Chase Bank and the Disney Channel.

944
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Yep.

945
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,160
Wait, is Disney... Disney was... Disney was...

946
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Disney was... hated Jews, right?

947
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Hated them. Couldn't stand them.

948
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Yeah.

949
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
Do you feel like I could be...

950
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Do you feel like I have a Jewish soul?

951
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:56,160
I mean you live in New York, you've been infected by the disease.

952
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,320
Your soul is tainted.

953
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:05,140
Do you think in another world, because I feel like growing up I was like, I really wish

954
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,360
I was Jewish.

955
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,040
Jewish is way cooler than...

956
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
Really?

957
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Yeah dude.

958
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:15,880
I feel like in middle school I heard about like the Sabbat and shit and I was like that's

959
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
so much work.

960
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Why would anyone ever want to be Jewish?

961
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:30,880
You know what I wanted to be? When I was a kid, I was like, "You know who's the number one guy in terms of who, if I could trade my look and family history for right now? Lenny Kravitz."

962
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Yeah.

963
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,880
I was like, "Lenny Kravitz is number one, dude. I would be Lenny Kravitz in an instant."

964
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Lenny Kravitz works because he's also, you know, part of a church.

965
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
That's not Jewish.

966
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:49,800
Yeah, I think that I I just I loved like I really loved Mel Brooks movies when I

967
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,840
was a kid I'm pretty obsessed with Mel Brooks and it really got in my head I was

968
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,980
like Jewish guys just have just a way cooler thing going on they can be short

969
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:05,520
and people think it's kind of neat yeah that's if a normal European guy is short

970
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,040
it's kind of embarrassing you know yeah yeah but it's almost like an excuse if

971
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,000
you're short to be like oh no I'm Jewish right it's quirky and it's not even that

972
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,400
Jewish people are shorter or something it's that you're thinking well he's

973
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,280
probably gonna make up with for it with a personality and he's probably very

974
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:30,960
smart you know what I mean yeah no I see what you're saying that's very sweet of you to have such a kind of human touch

975
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,720
I really do I had a yeah I was pretty obsessive about Jews I used to just try

976
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,720
to find them in my home town.

977
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,000
Yeah, make sure everyone knew where they were at.

978
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,040
Yeah, you know, I'd go up to there,

979
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,920
and just so I would remember where they were,

980
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,400
I'd go up there with some red paint,

981
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,440
just draw an X on their front door.

982
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,280
Right.

983
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,100
And that was--

984
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,000
Probably pointed them a little,

985
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,200
kind of like this, with the car.

986
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,800
Yeah, exactly, hey, they're over there somewhere.

987
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,520
You know, walk by, go, hey guys, good to see you Jews.

988
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,520
Love you.

989
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,620
- Oh look, there's the Jews.

990
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,920
Look at them over there.

991
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,560
That's a nice time.

992
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,760
Thanks for being here.

993
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,300
- You bring out the worst in me, Rex.

994
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,400
You bring out all the worst things in me.

995
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,640
- Dude, Eddie's threatening to be closer to you physically.

996
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,680
You're gonna get put in jail.

997
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,520
- That is true.

998
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,920
- They're gonna kill you.

999
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,520
- I will protect him.

1000
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,840
- Do you think you can make it in big bad New York City?

1001
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,600
- I think I could.

1002
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,560
- Yeah, I met, I talked to some people today

1003
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,200
who live in Los Angeles, who I'd never talked to before.

1004
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,420
And I, it really, I was like, "God damn, dude.

1005
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,360
"That is the worst place on earth."

1006
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,000
- Yeah, I do not.

1007
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,620
Every second I'm here, my soul dies a little bit.

1008
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:55,080
- Any given person from Los Angeles is just a,

1009
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,420
just nothing.

1010
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,220
- Yeah, it's a different type of,

1011
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,520
'cause they're like weird,

1012
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,240
but they're weird in a different way.

1013
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,000
People in New York, they're also weird.

1014
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,680
You know, it's like almost cool in a way.

1015
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,640
Not cool, cool is a really strong word, but cooler.

1016
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,080
- It's cool.

1017
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,080
- That's at least how I feel.

1018
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,480
I've done my time here.

1019
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,280
- Well, that's where his roots are.

1020
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,120
He's just going back to mother base.

1021
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,960
- That is true.

1022
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,200
That's not false.

1023
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,440
There's the ocean here.

1024
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,960
It's like my sound, you know?

1025
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,120
- Where do you think New York City is?

1026
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,000
- Probably by the ocean, but it's cold.

1027
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,880
(laughing)

1028
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,880
It's probably close to water.

1029
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,380
Yeah, it's kind of close.

1030
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:44,000
If you have to go out in a jacket, it invalidates the ocean.

1031
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,600
I guess you're right, yeah.

1032
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,960
Yeah, so the ocean, it's the same thing when I was in college, when I was at UNCW.

1033
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,640
UNCW has some amazing programs, has a great film program, a great English program.

1034
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,640
I think it's second only to the Iowa Writers

1035
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,400
graduate program, the big one.

1036
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,080
So I thought when I went there,

1037
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,800
I was like this is a great school, this is awesome.

1038
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,580
It's in my hometown, how great is this?

1039
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,280
But it's five minutes away from a beach,

1040
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,680
so the people who decide to go there

1041
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,720
are just the biggest morons in the world.

1042
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,040
And here's the worst part, they're right.

1043
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,240
- Yeah, they are right.

1044
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,960
- You should spend all your time

1045
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,560
within five minutes of a beach.

1046
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,960
The ocean is the best part of the earth.

1047
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,280
- Yeah, 100%.

1048
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,320
They're 100% right, but I hate that.

1049
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,640
- The people in Los Angeles are so happy, man.

1050
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,480
- Yeah.

1051
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,840
- And we have an ocean here.

1052
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,000
We can go to Rockaway Beach,

1053
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,700
but you're gonna get bird shit on you,

1054
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,160
you're gonna get human shit on you,

1055
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,400
somebody's gonna throw a Frisbee and break your teeth.

1056
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,880
You have to like, you have to like figure out,

1057
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,080
like you can never, as many times I've been

1058
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,360
to Rockaway Beach, I've never been able

1059
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,360
put down a towel as a perfect rectangle.

1060
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,100
It's always turned into a bit of an S, right?

1061
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,880
I'm turning around somebody else's blanket

1062
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,580
and there's some lady's asleep

1063
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,520
and her knee is popping out of her fucking towel

1064
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,400
and I'm afraid to touch it.

1065
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,040
- Well, you know what the solution to that problem is?

1066
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,120
Just go to Cancun.

1067
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,680
- Oh, okay.

1068
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,640
I like, and Cancun is in America, yeah?

1069
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,240
Essentially, yeah.

1070
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,140
Okay, all right, then I'm a bit interested, I would say.

1071
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:41,580
It's very US-centric, how they've built it.

1072
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,160
If you've been to Cancun, you have never been to Mexico.

1073
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,720
Yeah, very true.

1074
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,080
Cancun, that's what my grandpa says,

1075
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,840
he says, "Cancun, the cartels have a deal with Cancun."

1076
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,080
They say, "Because you make so much,

1077
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,880
"we own part of your hotels,

1078
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,220
"we will not come in and cut off the heads

1079
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,260
"of every single man, woman, and child

1080
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,240
"who's staying in that hotel."

1081
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,600
But he says if you go to somewhere like Mexico City,

1082
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,280
which I hear they call the, what do they call it?

1083
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,040
The Papa, the Papi?

1084
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,920
What do they call Mexico City?

1085
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,480
- They call it the City of Angels.

1086
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,380
- The City of Angels.

1087
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,000
If you go there, Mexico City,

1088
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:26,080
They just basically, it's like the final days of Afghanistan.

1089
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,320
You know, people are jumping,

1090
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,360
are throwing their babies,

1091
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,080
trying to hit them into a plane cockpit so they'll be safe.

1092
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,520
It's a very scary place,

1093
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,960
so I don't think I'll ever go to Mexico.

1094
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,800
- No.

1095
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,440
- Unless we do, unless any comedy clubs or theaters

1096
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,040
would like to give us some kind of amazing deal

1097
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,400
on a show that we could do in Mexico.

1098
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,840
I think even if we don't get that good of a deal,

1099
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,440
it would be very, very cheap.

1100
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,240
- How many tickets do you think we could sell in Mexico?

1101
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,520
- I think I was looking at the breakdown demographic

1102
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,680
on what's the thing, Anchor?

1103
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,680
- Anchor.

1104
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,680
- And there's definitely the most fans in Mexico City,

1105
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,600
in Mexico, for Paul.

1106
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,920
- Every time I look at that, I'm like,

1107
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,420
these people have a VPN.

1108
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,420
No, it's stupid.

1109
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,420
No, because you can click on it and it'll give you a breakdown.

1110
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:31,420
There's a lot of people in Sonora, in different states where it doesn't make sense to VPN

1111
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,420
it to.

1112
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,420
So I think we could definitely sell out some room.

1113
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,420
Okay.

1114
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,420
So let's take a look.

1115
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,420
Hold on.

1116
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,420
All right.

1117
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,420
Geographic location.

1118
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,420
Location these flavored beers

1119
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:52,380
All right

1120
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,300
79% United States

1121
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
Yes, 7% Canada

1122
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,780
Mm-hmm. Let's go. I'm gonna keep scrolling down till I hit Mexico

1123
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,860
We have mmm Columbia

1124
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,540
Mm-hmm, Taiwan

1125
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,780
Israel

1126
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,180
Yeah, well you see

1127
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:16,460
- Israel is in our top 20.

1128
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,660
- It's like when a band-- - Israel, Hong Kong.

1129
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,940
- It only goes to like Mexico City

1130
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,340
for like the Latin American date.

1131
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,660
All those people from like Israel and Pakistan

1132
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,060
and South Korea are gonna fly to Mexico to see us.

1133
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,300
- I don't even see Mexico on here, dude.

1134
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:34,220
- You must have missed it. - How did you find it?

1135
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,980
I must have missed it.

1136
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,740
I must have missed it.

1137
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,900
Dude, how is, where the fuck is Mexico?

1138
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,320
What does the Mexican flag look like?

1139
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,740
It's probably like a--

1140
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,620
- Like the Italian flag.

1141
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,140
- Oh, okay, all right, sorry.

1142
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,140
So Mexico is between Poland and Ukraine.

1143
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:53,780
- Yep, geographically too.

1144
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,640
- Yep, the most in Mexico City.

1145
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,780
- Wow. - Does it have a number?

1146
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,260
- No, it just gives you percentages.

1147
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,260
- Basically 25% of our Mexican listeners are in Mexico City.

1148
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,700
- Okay, but how many listeners are in Mexico?

1149
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,540
- How many what?

1150
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,340
- How many listeners are in Mexico?

1151
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,020
- It doesn't say, it just gives us a percentage.

1152
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,340
- What's a percentage?

1153
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:19,740
It should be enough where people in Mexico City and people around there

1154
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,540
would probably come and just fill that little room.

1155
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,040
Yeah.

1156
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,040
I would say so as well, yeah.

1157
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,240
Yeah, so if we could do maybe somebody's living room

1158
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:37,440
or maybe a classroom that might work.

1159
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,140
Yeah.

1160
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:44,640
We can do it in Julio's place and we can sell souvenir stinky beers.

1161
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,640
Well, I'm not even close to Mexico City and I only have one stinky beer left.

1162
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,640
Thank you very much.

1163
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,640
What, did you drink them all?

1164
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:57,140
No, I only had two and I drank a quarter of one and I threw it away.

1165
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,140
And I have another one that's unopened and I'm still scared of it.

1166
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,640
I don't want to open it.

1167
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,640
Don't you just want to see?

1168
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,140
Were they all stinky?

1169
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:14,820
They weren't all stinky, but the one or two that I did have, like right when I bought

1170
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:22,140
them, were still like a type of flavor that I wasn't going to drink.

1171
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,980
Like these I can drink.

1172
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,980
These are like…

1173
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,980
I love all trash.

1174
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,980
Can you just drink these?

1175
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
No, way too strong.

1176
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,980
Way, way, way too strong.

1177
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,980
These are giving me like a headache from all the sugar.

1178
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Yeah, I can't believe it.

1179
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,980
I can't believe it.

1180
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,980
I can't believe it.

1181
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,980
I can't believe it.

1182
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,980
I can't believe it.

1183
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
I can't believe you're drinking those, dude.

1184
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,980
Can you just have a normal beer one week, man?

1185
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:49,980
Yeah, maybe next time. I forgot to go to the store and grabbed these out of the mini fridge.

1186
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,980
Oh, okay.

1187
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,980
You know what? Beersters are just like a concept, like a social concept.

1188
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,980
Anything could be a beer, technically.

1189
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,980
I guess that's a good point.

1190
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,980
Yeah, so next week it could be anything that we're drinking.

1191
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,980
Maybe I could have a root beer.

1192
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:11,820
I don't like to drink soda anymore.

1193
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:12,820
I try not to.

1194
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,020
I also don't drink beer anymore because it will make me fucking fart.

1195
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,020
Yeah.

1196
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,460
I think the last time I tried drinking actual root beer that's not Dr. Pepper, I had a crazy

1197
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,740
headache and I didn't even finish it.

1198
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:28,020
Guys, I'm going to open up this second beer.

1199
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,020
I could try recreating that.

1200
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,700
Yeah, well, because we're going to do movie Mondays after this, so I'm like, you know,

1201
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,700
it'll carry over.

1202
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,660
This is a Heineken Silver.

1203
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,900
So this is similarly 4% alcohol.

1204
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,900
Yeah.

1205
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,900
24 fluid ounces.

1206
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,900
It's stronger than this 3.2%.

1207
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:51,440
Might as well just be fruit juice.

1208
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:57,340
So that's why I got the Imperial, or the Voodoo Ranger, I got the Voodoo Ranger IPA, and I

1209
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,180
said, "Man, that's so strong.

1210
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm gonna be ready to cry after I finish that.

1211
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,620
And I kind of am.

1212
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,280
I was very strong.

1213
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:08,260
And now I will have this amazing Heineken.

1214
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,620
And then, you know, I'm looking at a 9.45,

1215
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,460
9.50 bedtime tonight.

1216
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,620
- Yeah, so in one hour.

1217
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:19,020
- I'm gonna eat just the very end of the corner

1218
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,020
of a 15 milligram edible gummy, right?

1219
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,220
And I'm gonna do that in 30 minutes.

1220
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,460
And so what I'm gonna do is we're gonna go on stream,

1221
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,380
We're gonna start watching movie Mondays.

1222
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,580
And I think the movie we picked out

1223
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,660
is about an hour, 25, hour 30.

1224
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,780
We're gonna get one hour in,

1225
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,900
that's how long it takes for the gummy to kick in.

1226
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,940
And I'm gonna say, "Guys, Phil has to go out.

1227
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,120
"I have to go right now, bye."

1228
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,980
And then I'll click into call.

1229
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,660
So I got basically my entire night put out.

1230
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,580
- Well, you do know that you don't need to do any excuses.

1231
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,180
Like, you're free to go at any point.

1232
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,580
- Yeah, but I was talking to somebody about this last night.

1233
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:58,500
Anytime I get way too high, I'm way too proud to say,

1234
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,780
I'm too high right now.

1235
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,260
I've never, ever uttered those words.

1236
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,980
Never, not even like to, not even,

1237
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,380
not to my closest friend would I ever say,

1238
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,380
I'm way too high right now, I need to go to bed,

1239
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,920
I need help.

1240
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,820
So I will just make it happen and then be like,

1241
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,220
guys, (groans)

1242
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:23,220
it's 3 p.m. (groans)

1243
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,500
- And I'll leave.

1244
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,340
- Yeah, I took a nap.

1245
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,160
- Yeah.

1246
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,000
- Oh great.

1247
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,260
- I need to get back on my nap.

1248
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,100
- I took a nap.

1249
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,540
- I love naps.

1250
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,620
- 2.30 to 3.30.

1251
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,660
Perfect nap.

1252
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,540
- That is perfect.

1253
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,980
Although they say that that's the worst possible

1254
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,300
duration of a nap.

1255
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,140
- An hour?

1256
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,960
- An hour?

1257
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,500
- It needs to be either more than an hour and a half

1258
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,920
or less than 30 minutes.

1259
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:51,680
Something about, because I think when you do an hour,

1260
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,640
you slip into the in-between stage of sleep

1261
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,840
where you're not really resting

1262
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,400
and you're not getting like deep sleep, you know?

1263
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,640
So there's not anything going on for you.

1264
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,440
You're basically only napping enough to get a dream

1265
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,720
and then you come back out.

1266
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,040
So you're just all confused.

1267
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,520
- Yeah, I didn't have a dream.

1268
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,400
- I really have a dream.

1269
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,880
I really don't have dreams.

1270
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,200
- I didn't say my creativity fails.

1271
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,720
- Yeah, that you would have had a dream.

1272
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,000
I woke up this morning and I didn't have a dream,

1273
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,380
but I did wake up thinking, dude, she keeps,

1274
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:31,920
all around the house, she keeps hanging up t-shirts

1275
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,400
and stuff to dry and forgetting about it.

1276
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,080
And then we go to sleep and I wake up

1277
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,480
in the middle of the night and I'm sure,

1278
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,720
I'm so sure it's a specter.

1279
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,080
I'm so sure it's a poltergeist.

1280
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,440
And so I sit there and I have the most scared

1281
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,320
I've ever been in my life,

1282
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,280
like sitting in a trench in World War II.

1283
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,900
that level of like physical fear,

1284
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:52,440
adrenaline rushing through my body.

1285
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,280
- Yeah, you've been up to your ears.

1286
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,680
- And then I realize, yeah, and then I realize

1287
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,640
it's my South of the Border t-shirt

1288
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,100
that is sitting there.

1289
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,380
- Don't look now, but if you see on your webcam

1290
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:06,080
over your shoulder, there's a shark specter

1291
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,780
jumping off from the ground.

1292
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,020
- I looked, okay.

1293
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,520
- What's your favorite t-shirt?

1294
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,560
- My favorite t-shirt?

1295
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,400
- Yeah.

1296
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,520
Hmm

1297
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,340
Probably my t-shirt that says it's a t-shirt

1298
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:29,180
That I bought for $40 when it was like I spent my my only $40 I owned on it

1299
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:34,260
It was like when I was really really broke and it's a guy playing pool and it says

1300
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:40,080
Yeah, yeah that same shirt it says why work when you can run the tables amazing

1301
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,000
And I almost never wear it because it's a white t-shirt, so I get really scared. It's gonna get stained

1302
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,880
Mm-hmm and some guy at a show one time offered to buy it for me for $200

1303
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,640
He was like that was the coolest shirt. I've ever seen. Will you can you sell it to me and I said buddy

1304
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,620
Wait ten years and add two zeros, right?

1305
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:06,780
Yeah. Well, you know what my favorite my favorite shirt is the one that you gave me Caleb from South the border

1306
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,960
It's a black shirt and it says what?

1307
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,680
something about being a crazy tamale or some shit

1308
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,400
I'm such an amazing friend.

1309
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,240
You are.

1310
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,060
I'm such an amazing friend.

1311
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,840
I found the other South of the Border shirt

1312
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,160
that I meant to give to Rex at the office yesterday,

1313
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,600
or two days ago.

1314
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,460
Or not two days ago, a week ago.

1315
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,120
But I found it and I was like,

1316
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,840
okay, because I forgot to give it to Rex

1317
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,680
and it's been almost, it's been over six months,

1318
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,760
this is just my shirt now, I'll get him something else.

1319
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,800
No, that's fine, I have one of your shirts

1320
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,120
that I've just stolen and appropriated.

1321
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,960
What is it?

1322
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,920
It's the one with an alien that says

1323
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,080
take me to your dealer.

1324
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,400
Oh yeah, thank God.

1325
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,000
I definitely lost so many clothes on the tour

1326
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,520
and I was about to be so sad

1327
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,920
if it was one of my favorite shirts.

1328
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,120
Yeah, no, it's not.

1329
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,520
No, that's fine, you can have that one.

1330
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:00,080
For me, favorite, Monster Energy logo on the front.

1331
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,960
If you can read this, it's show off on the back.

1332
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,120
I love that shirt.

1333
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,080
I would buy that shirt from you.

1334
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,280
That is an amazing shirt.

1335
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,400
Yeah.

1336
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,400
Yeah, I don't remember where I saw you wear that.

1337
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,440
It was recent.

1338
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,800
I saw you wear that and I was like,

1339
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,040
God damn, that's an incredible one.

1340
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,040
I think I definitely wore that in New York.

1341
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,540
Remember?

1342
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,040
Yeah, last time.

1343
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,040
It's gotta come with me everywhere.

1344
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:21,540
I take it.

1345
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,840
Of course.

1346
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,540
I would hope so.

1347
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,540
It's like the nuclear codes.

1348
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:25,040
Yeah.

1349
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,040
Never let it out of my sight.

1350
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,540
Guys.

1351
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,040
That's enough.

1352
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,040
That's enough beers we drank, I think.

1353
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:32,540
It certainly is.

1354
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,040
Unless, uh...

1355
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,540
I mean, do you guys have anything to say to close it out for the people, man?

1356
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,040
What, I mean, this has gotta be, by the way,

1357
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,540
this has gotta be...

1358
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:47,140
the number one podcast on the Patreon right now.

1359
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:47,980
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1360
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,620
- Every single episode people are going, what?

1361
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,580
Wait, they do two episodes a week

1362
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:56,900
and also this bonus episode that is a better version

1363
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:58,780
that has upgrades on two of the hosts

1364
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,980
and one of the hosts stays exactly the same?

1365
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,980
(laughing)

1366
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,300
- Yep. - It's crazy.

1367
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,740
- Did they do that? - Amazing.

1368
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,580
- It'll take over.

1369
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,580
- It's the best value-- - It'll have 15,000 followers

1370
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,700
on our Twitter account. - Yeah.

1371
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,180
Guys, juice beers we drank.

1372
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,260
- Yeah, out of which we drink.

1373
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,780
- Rex doesn't get a single dollar of the money.

1374
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,620
- No.

1375
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:19,060
- Right, this is free labor, but we need--

1376
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:19,900
- I do it a lot.

1377
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,620
- Here's what I want, the dream that I have

1378
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,980
is that one day, it's called the Podcast About List,

1379
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,720
Patreon, but more people are subscribing

1380
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,300
for beers we drank.

1381
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,460
They're not even listening to the Pod About List,

1382
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,860
they're like, what the fuck are you talking,

1383
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,220
Pod About List, I've never even heard of it.

1384
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,060
- Yeah.

1385
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,460
- Right, wait, Pod About List, isn't that the company

1386
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,820
that owns beers we drank?

1387
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,340
- Right.

1388
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,840
- And then this is the most popular podcast in America,

1389
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,840
That's what I hope for.

1390
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,840
I think that's, we're on track.

1391
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:51,440
And we're, you know, we're drinking beer at Joe Rogan, we're drinking beer at Bobby Lee.

1392
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,960
We're on Tiger Belly.

1393
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
Right?

1394
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
Yeah.

1395
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:01,560
We're drinking IPAs called, you know, Dog, Head.

1396
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,560
Dog Tits.

1397
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,560
Tom's Blood IPA.

1398
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,560
Yeah.

1399
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,480
I would love to drink one one day.

1400
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,040
Alright, bye guys.

1401
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Bye.
