00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,080
Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,900
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,200
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,480
- Oh.

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,320
- Oh.

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,160
- Oh.

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,640
- I'm sick of what the news media's turned into these days.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,480
- Yeah.

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,440
- How do you like your new phone?

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,680
- We used to have, I love it,

14
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,520
we used to have Walter Cronkite announcing

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,640
that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated.

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,320
Right now, it's all just Jensen Ackles, nude ass and sexy and the boys.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,960
I fucking hate that shit, dude.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,920
I mean, we used to have Rachel Maddow doing the whole Mueller report, right?

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
And doing all this investigative.

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah, and expose.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,640
Real fucking hard-hitting shit.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,000
Now we have Chris Carmack, naked and erotic gay scenes in Nashville.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wow.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's crazy.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,520
Yeah, I just don't understand how this qualifies as news.

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,520
I mean seriously, Love Him on Grey's Anatomy had no idea he played a gay character.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,840
He's so sexy, more Chris please.

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,240
What I mean like how is what kind of news anchor uses this kind of language?

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Yeah.

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
In these videos, by the way.

32
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,240
What is it?

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Are you reading CNN?

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,800
Gay, I mean it doesn't, yeah I think it's a CNN network site.

35
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
It's gay-male-celebs.com.

36
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,160
Because look, I'm looking at CNN right now.

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,840
I'm looking at that.

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,480
Darryl McCormick nude cock and sex scenes.

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Yeah, how does this make...

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,360
What does this have to do...

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,600
Like, look here, like...

42
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,160
I mean, yesterday, I don't wanna...

43
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,880
Like, there was a pretty tragic story,

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,120
but all they're talking about is

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,560
Robin Thicke paparazzi shirtless beach photos.

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
I know, it's like, can we just focus on...

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Like, there's actually horrible things going on,

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,440
and all they can talk about is Adrian Grenier,

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,360
one of the most desired bachelors in Hollywood,

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,560
is definitely this guy.

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,760
His curly dark hair is perfectly combined with his cute smile and amazing body.

52
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,560
He may have hairy legs, but we assure you that his junk is shaved.

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,060
Because within this tape, you can see how this kinky bastard plays with it.

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,960
It's kind of weird.

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
People really care about whether or not his junk is shaved or not.

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,060
You guys are talking about like, like these like articles that are getting written.

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,260
But I mean, I don't know if you guys have been watching like the videos they

58
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,360
post to these websites too.

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,860
I mean, the news is totally off track.

60
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,460
Like yeah, this there's, you know, it was the 4th of July yesterday.

61
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,660
There's a lot of stuff went down.

62
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,780
And here, I mean, all I'm seeing is a video called "Gibby the Clown Fucks

63
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,300
Jazamine Banks Outside in Broad Daylight"

64
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:31,380
Exactly! That's insane. And it's like, what, this is newsworthy? Why is that, why is this trash on the news?

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,740
Fetty Wap! The January 6 hearings are happening and all I can see on the

66
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,980
fucking news is gorgeous hunks, nude, and extra scenes from north of the border.

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,340
It's fucking insane, dude.

68
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,420
An election is coming up. First of all, Roe vs Wade is overturned and all these people

69
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,380
can talk about is Fetty Wap and how nowadays he's one of the most popular rappers

70
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,540
of this rap is not a good old stuff because all the rappers were known for

71
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,600
their sex tapes he used his popularity of film some ebony girl

72
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,660
on my god how that's

73
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,140
and i'm i'm on the front page of c_n_n_ right now and i'm seeing another video

while

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,380
And I guess they're more concerned about the clowns on the getting fucked by a drone

80
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,540
than the clowns in Congress.

81
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
That's right.

82
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
Focus on...

83
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,060
And it's like, why does CNN.com think I want to watch this video called "Evil Clown Fucks

84
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,300
Teen"?

85
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,660
Why are we focusing on Nate Cernkovich's nude big cock scenes?

86
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,380
How about the nude big cock scenes in the White House?

87
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,380

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,780

They're really talking about that nowadays.

105
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,460

It's a completely different flavor.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,800
Thought he did me a favor.

153
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,580
Turns out, he's not a saver.

154
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
- No.

155
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
I am a saver, it was only a dollar.

156
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,720
But he's about to savor the drink that he drank.

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,420
The flavor.

158
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,920
The flavor of the savory drink that he's drinking.

159
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,420
And he's not thinking, just drinking, just slurping.

160
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
And he wants more things.

161
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
He's slurping the flavor that is purping.

162
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,920
He's getting the flavor into his mouth, on his taste buds.

163
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,420
Purping, I mean pink.

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,920
You're a waistoid.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,420

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,920

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,800
Yeah, I don't even want to say the name of the holiday. Yeah, I don't even want to tell

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,440
you what yesterday was. I call it a certain day in July. I call it Cameron's birthday

174
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,000
actually. I call it my Grandpa Rick's birthday because it's actually his, I knew about him

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,480
before I knew about you. Yeah, that's fine. But then if he dies, I'll call it your birthday.

176
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
Okay, that's fair enough.

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Fingers crossed.

178
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Okay.

179
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Grandpa Rick.

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Okay.

181
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Ricky.

182
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Ricky.

183
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
That's his legal name, Ricky.

184
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
His legal name is Ricky.

185
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Yeah.

186
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
That's cool.

187
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,600
He didn't find that out until he was like 40 and then he looked at his birth certificate

188
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
and it said Ricky.

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
How do you not find that out?

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
What do you mean?

191
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
He didn't have his birth certificate.

192
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
What did he think that his legal name was?

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Rick or Richard.

194
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh, okay.

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,680
Yeah, he would always put Richard on stuff.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,280
That's usually the name somebody has when they're named Rick.

197
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,240
But his mom is just like a hillbilly who just named him Ricky.

198
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,680
Have you ever seen that movie, the something world of the whites?

199
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,800
It's a movie about this family.

200
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah, your house.

201
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Yeah.

202
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
It's a movie about this family in Virginia.

203
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,080
This is some kind of something world of whites.

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Yeah.

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,040
It's a world of whites.

206
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,640
It is definitely a world of whites.

207
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:32,240
But it's this family, Jesco White is the dad, he's like an Appalachian tap dancer.

208
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,880
And one of the daughters is named Sue Bob.

209
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Sue Bob?

210
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
That's a cool name.

211
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Sue Bob.

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,400
Have you seen that movie?

213
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,960
That's short for SpongeBob.

214
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,200
He's my daughter SpongeBob.

215
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
And my son Patrick.

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
Southern people have the most fucked up names.

217
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,560
Have you seen that movie about the, like that NASCAR guy?

218
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Talladega Nights.

219
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
It's Ricky Bobby.

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
It doesn't make any sense.

221
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Two first names.

222
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,560
Ricky Bobby.

223
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,440
first name Ricky Bobby yeah like how much of a southern fucking hick do you have to

224
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,600
be a redhead said some of the things to a hick in a redneck and also I watched the

225
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,980
movie he's actually range ideas about Jesus they're like insanely just the

226
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,960
religiosity just made me almost want to fucking vomit yeah of them of the

227
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,360
movie gay character shafted the gay character don't care no characterization

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,000
no no he didn't show him getting shafted I should have that's what I'm saying

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They should have showed it unapologetically gay.

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It would have been a pretty good representation of gay life.

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's true.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But it wasn't.

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I heard that that...

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He was gay because he was sponsored by Paranay too.

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I heard that the gay actor, the gay man from that movie actually is well known.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know if you guys have seen this movie.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He played the brat.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The brat?

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, from that movie, Brat.

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So, is that like the pest?

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, it's from that movie, Brat, where the brat goes around to different places in America.

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And he's being like a total brat.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,400
like a total brat. He acts like super cranky because he's a brat. He probably needs a nap

244
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,000
or something. He like ruins the national anthem. Oh okay. The brat. Yeah. I'm sick of these.

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,200
He's like I don't want to do the national anthem. Yeah. I think that's what he's doing.

246
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,040
Yeah. And then there's that guy who's like I want to sit on a plane with no sound. And

247
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,640
then he's like yeah. Then there's that guy who he meets who's like you know what we do

248
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,320
to brats where we don't like the country that brats come from. I'm sick of these brats from

249
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,800
other countries coming over and demanding toys and stuff. Oh yeah. It's like why are

He has a fast he hun died. He injected him with formula one. He

he went head on died and he and he went to another plane of existence. Yeah, a

276
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,940
Yeah, and what is with everyone getting into formula one now? It's the cool thing. What are you talking about?

277
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,940
I know like three you fucking you can't say

278
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,660
Everybody's getting into I know three different people who I feel like I've seen one the fuck are you two even?

279
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:02,900
What planet are you on? I've never even I don't even know what formula one is I didn't either

280
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,120
I can't really know long ones or the wide ones. I don't know that's the long ones

281
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,720
I think and the wide ones are NASCAR

282
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,440
car. But those are the ones that look like a praying mantis? I can tell you it's not

283
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,320
the small ones. Those are hot wheels. What the hell? You've seen penises on cars? I didn't

284
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,240
say... My dick is much closer to a NASCAR than a Formula One. I thought you were going

285
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,320
to look up what a Formula One looks like. No, I have a... Mine looks like a Star Destroyer

286
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,040
from Star Wars. No, it doesn't. Mine looks actually like a Death Star. If it looked like

287
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,600
a Star Destroyer or a Death Star, you'd actually have a serious problem.

288
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,080
It looks like a Death Star if you hold it closed while you're peeing.

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,360
You know what's so funny to do?

290
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,800
As a kid, when I was like, tie off the end of the...

291
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Do you ever push...

292
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,440
Tie off the end of my foreskin and I would pee.

293
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah, or you would like thread a piece of floss into your wiener and pull stuff out

294
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
of it.

295
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
That is really good.

296
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,760
You ever put a piece of pencil lead into the tip of your penis?

297
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
No.

298
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
No?

299
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Me neither.

300
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
There are people who like sound like urethral sounding.

301
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah, I don't even know what that is.

302
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
There's people that are into that.

303
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
I don't get that.

304
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I don't get it either.

305
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,720
I guess that the rod goes down and all the way into the through the tip and pokes into

306
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
your prostate.

307
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,680
I think it goes to the ball.

308
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't think it pokes your prostate.

309
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,720
I don't think you do it that far.

310
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,440
I've seen a video.

311
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
I've seen, you've seen a video of the guy drilling into the his penis hole?

312
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
No.

313
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,080
like a drill he's just drilling remember that website kids in sandbox it's the guy

314
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:50,880

315
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,440
bigger hole no woman is sticking like a sex toy into the hole can we stop can we

316
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,520
just stop it's icky yeah that's actually kind of much what is nasty about that

317
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,480
it's natural. It's not natural. That's natural. That's how

318
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
mommies and daddies make you. That's fucking cap. That's how

319
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,080
mommies and daddies make you. That's just lying. No, that's

320
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,960
true. Do you think it's just completely normal to lie about

321
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,040
what mommies and daddies do? Mommies and daddies do your

322
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
reasonable sounding. No. Mommies and daddies, daddies and

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,400
sparkle goes from the daddy's mouth into the mommy's body and

325
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,740

up their friend, who's he's a pool boy, a pool boy, and they both fuck him and

327
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,900
that's how you're born. The no man daddies have little homunculi inside

328
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,300

329
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,540
try to get out you get out of the balls, because the balls are me. The balls are

330
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,020

333
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,100
a penis a penis comes out of the hole well how why are we bring penises into

334
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,460
this is kind of nose on the other end of that hole but they they suck the glue

335
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,860
out of the penis and then you're born from that glue I think it was a

336
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,820
a situation where first they show the camera how much glue they can fit in

337
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,940
their mouth yeah yeah look my mouth isn't even sticking closed from all this glue

338
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:38,140
yeah yeah there's so many videos of mommies and daddies I would have to go

339
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:48,460
with a Gabby Carter very talented mommy very an amazing glue holder Gabby Carter

340
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,300
you're well done. I heard that mommy's and daddy's are mommy's talk to a stork

and the storks.

344
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,800
The stork comes in and takes the baby away. Whoa really yeah and the mommy the

345
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,600

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,340
I was born on September.

There's a beard and a big red belly and look at look at he's

352
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,640
exhibiting jolly behavior.

353
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,040
Yeah, you want I don't have a jolly bone in my body. You know,

354
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm the least jolly guy in the world. We need to do a cookie

355
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,440
test to see if he's actually my son. I mean low-key. That's the

356
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,120
plot of Elf though. Yeah. That's not the fucking plot of Elf. That's the entire plot of Elf.

357
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,280
That's reverse Elf. He didn't have a fucking, oh he didn't fucking, he's fucking an Elf.

358
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,880
You did not watch the director's cut. Also, how the fuck, James Conn is like 5'5" Italian

359
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,960
guy, how the fuck does he, the mommy is tall. Will Ferrell's a NBA player. Sometimes I'll

360
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,960
see there's like a tall mommy and a tiny daddy. Really? You look that up specifically? No.

361
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,200
mommies and small daddies. Smallest daddy. Yeah. And a big mommy. Huge mommy. Huge mommy. Giant.

362
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,320
Huge mommy looks like Bigfoot and it's a drawing. It's a drawing? It's a drawing. Have you seen the

363
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,600
ones where the mommies and daddies eat each other and they go, "Oh my belly's so full of a daddy."

364
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,120
Yeah. I really like that. I've seen the ones where the mommy eats the daddy. But the mommy

365
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,540
looks like surprisingly much like a Sonic. I've seen one where the mommy's a Pokemon. I like

366
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:07,120
those where a Pokemon, where mommy's dressed up like a perfect Pokemon right or 2B

367
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,000
from that one game yeah and they eat 2B from near Atomata yeah and then

368
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,880
they'd swallow Scorpion from Mortal Kombat yeah as a daddy though and they

369
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:26,000
go oh I'm so full of him yeah and you can see the little and the line of yeah the

370
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,680
mommy's butt is big yeah cuz that's where the food goes yeah good daddy go

371
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,880
maybe the food put gets pushed from the belly into the butt sometimes a baby can

372
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,040
be made from two mommies I've heard of this yeah I think they did that on Glee

373
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,160
and I've heard about two daddies situation too but I haven't done a lot

374
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,240
of two daddies videos and let me tell you I heard that sometimes it can be

375
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
It stinks in there.

376
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,120
A little baby can come from as many as five to ten mommies and daddies.

377
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,320
Two daddies is just too much glue and not enough little holes.

378
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,960
Yeah, it's mostly glue in a two daddies video.

379
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,040
But the glue actually mixes up with other...

380
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:15,000
I heard the strongest baby comes from one mommy, ten daddies.

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
Ten daddy businessmen.

382
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Yeah.

383
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:23,680
on a train in Tokyo. In a strange land. Oh yeah. Sometimes the daddy's a tentacle. Yeah and

384
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,880
that's okay too. Yeah. You know sometimes a daddy is an actual. That's a scary baby though.

385
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,160
Yeah that baby's gonna be scary. In certain videos the daddy is actually just a

386
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:39,120
cucumber or a vegetable. Yeah. I've seen videos where it's two daddies. Yeah. And

387
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,000
and they're doing real estate. Really? Believe it or not. That's like a dad job.

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,380
yeah we're not that hard I've never seen a male realtor really yeah yeah yes it's

389
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,700
mostly mommies doing yeah there's a lot of realtors but they flip the script and

390
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,240
it's two daddies in a real estate situation and do they make have a glue

391
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:10,060
party they have a glue party but he beat with a with a fist really oh he's trying

392
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:18,360
get he's helping him he's trying to wipe his butt. He's trying to pre-wipe his whole butt so that he doesn't have to wipe later.

393
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,580
So he reaches in and wipes out all the poop so that you like hey your daddy or other daddy

394
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,420
you're gonna have like three or four days where you don't have to wipe. They use

395
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,640
something called a fleet before and they get all the poop out. What's a fleet?

396
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,640
It's nothing. I don't know. What the fuck is a fleet? What are you talking about?

397
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Brand. Brand of what? Douche. Oh, come on! That's too far, dude. From South Park?

398
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Giant douche from South Park. That's fucking disgusting. And it's grosser. It's gross when you see two daddies.

399
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh shit! Yeah, I heard sometimes it's like now it's like there's like mommies and

400
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,440
daddies but the mommy is the daddy's mommy. Interesting. I don't even know

401
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,360
that works but yeah mommy is the daddy's mommy. But they're also mommying and

402
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:20,000
daddying together. They're doing mommy daddy together. They're doing mommy and daddy.

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,240
the daddy's daddying the mommy and the mommy's mommying the daddy. Oh that makes a lot of sense

404
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:31,440
actually. But the mommy is the daddy's mommy. Oh okay. So there can be two mommies but one of them's a

405
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,040
daddy? I've heard legend of a thousand mommies. Really? I've never been able to find it from my

406
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:44,640
research. You know one there was one mommy who set a record she had like 400 daddies daddy her in like

407
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,100
one day. Wow. Yeah. That looks like it stinks in there. It completely stunk up

408
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,660
the entire room. Honestly, the mommy and daddy smell of that room would probably...

409
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,260
It'd probably be comparable to like an earthquake shelter.

410
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,420
Yeah. I'd go in there with a power wash tool. I'd spray all the

411
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,580
daddies off. Yeah, it's like the scene in like a Roland Emmerich

412
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,980
movie where there's a thousand people in a basketball stadium. How do mommies get

413
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,900
made. Do they get... Well, mommies come from two daddies. Do they get shot in the...

414
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,740
That's why they have videos of two daddies because they're making a

415
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,660
mommy. When they're born, so they clip off a daddy's penis when you're born, but

416
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,860
then do they shoot a hole in the front of a mommy with a gun? See, I think what

417
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,380
happens, because I've seen videos... I've seen videos where it's one mommy and

418
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,820
two daddies and the two daddies do two daddy things and then the mommy's just

419
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:46,500
there watching no she's just there there's a video where mommy is eating

420
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,860
salad in the kitchen and two daddies are doing a daddy mommy scene really mm-hmm

421
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,380
you ever seen the one where the mommy does mommy stuff and the daddy is a is a

422
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,580
chocolate cake she just sits on it yeah and she makes me a chance you poots

423
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,300
really good mm-hmm I don't really like those videos yeah yeah I don't really

424
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,780
like mommy if it wasn't if it wasn't for like the pursuit of figuring out how

425
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,500
babies come from I probably wouldn't be watching where the mommy was just a

426
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:25,180
normal mommy but then did daddy was actually just a pitbull it's really

427
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:32,460
interesting stuff yeah yeah yeah no I'm actually disgusting breath it's not it's

428
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,020
some of those videos are not some of them are not yeah not not okay yeah and I

429
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,340
don't know why the hell they're on the news yeah yeah it's no so it's like I

430
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,340
know the reason that they're on the news I think is just to educate people it's I

431
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:50,420
think parents don't want to they want to kids like us cuz it's hard for us kids

432
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:56,960
you know especially like future rap star future skateboarder mm-hmm future

433
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,380
artist you know I mean like we all have our own kind of like cool trifecta style

434
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,820
style shit three peas in a pod. Shout out to my key chain. I got you for your

435
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,660
birthday. Yeah. So like I don't I feel like we're so focused on kind of

436
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,580
figuring out our own identities in this like exactly as day and age as teens

437
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,580
that it's fucking tough as fuck to actually learn about life skills like

438
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,420
mommying and daddying and I know well the thing is though I don't I like I

439
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,580
don't want to open up like Fox News or whatever and I don't I don't yeah. I

440
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,500
mean well I mean if I if I forced you know the CNN websites out or whatever

441
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,700
I gotta get my news somewhere. It's like I open up Fox News and I don't want to

442
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,700
read about the daddy train. Yeah. The daddy train that they're conducting on a mommy.

443
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,580
It's like, bro, I'm only 15 years old. I can't actually manage working on my new rap lifestyle

444
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:51,580
and also trying to fucking understand mommy and daddy and which hole is better for daddies,

445
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,740
which holes have mommies in them. And the thing, it's so confusing too because I'm trying to learn

446
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,620
about how it works with mommies and daddies some of the and some of this some

447
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,260
of these videos that I'm saying that I'm learning about it's litter it's just a

448
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,740
mommy and she's talking about about daddying mm-hmm but it's just a mommy

449
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,180
it's like I don't understand how this works what am I supposed to do you go on

450
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:18,380
a CNN front page and there's a there's a video where a mommy's mommy's meat is

451
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:25,660
spinning really yeah holy shit a mommy a mommy's meat is spinning that's

452
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,540
insane. Uh-huh. Yeah, like I don't know, like I just not, I just not even care about

453
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,000
showing that. And it's playing 80s music. What the fuck? Yeah. See like that's

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,220
honestly like just a previous generation status. Yeah. Like 80s. That's like an

455
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,820
entirely different generation that had a different music scene. Yeah. And an entirely

456
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,860
different kind of movie that we'll see.

457
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
There's a...

458
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
What?

459
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
That is so true.

460
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Yeah.

461
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:01,260
It's like at least if I'm going to have to watch this, at the very least, play some, you

462
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,340
know, like modern cutting edge hip hop.

463
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,940
Maybe play like a remix made by Flo Rida.

464
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
Or like...

465
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,940
I'm trying to decide if I'm going to be a thug rapper or straight nerdcore with it, and then

466
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,180
all these news stories are making my fucking, making my penis get strong.

467
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,820
some jpeg mafia yeah like that guy was actually lit af in the military yeah and

468
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,740
it's like these 80s rappers and movies don't understand you know not bring him

469
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,420
an 80s movie into the current Netflix style status yeah and try to make that

470
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,700
they don't have movies on Netflix they shouldn't they have actually homages to

471
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,580
it like stranger things was actually one of the most fucking groundbreaking

472
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,220
pieces of cinema because of its modernity that's what they're trying to

473
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,780
do now they're trying to turn 80s movies into Netflix errs and which team are you

474
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,220
team Steve or you team Jonathan I'm team I'm minecraft Steve because he's

475
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,940
actually got building abilities yeah and smash brothers I guess I'll put that

476
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,980
down as team Steve yeah yeah so I just don't know I think it's will I don't

477
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,880
understand like like I don't mean to paraphrase a song but like we are the

478
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,140
kids of America uh-huh and I mean nowadays you're seeing movies like

479
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,780
Top Gun Maverick it's like and it's like okay the play these these planes were

480
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,460
high-tech in the 80s yeah but this is gonna have to be spaceships or laser

481
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,060
or cars or something like the planes we all know planes go side to side like

482
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,620
this for the future type movie I could go up and down like we get can we get a

483
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,260
neutron movie yeah come on we get a neutron movie just trying to not mean

484
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,980
that's what that's right more closer to the day run no let's think about a tron

485
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,700
movie where instead of blue line I mean red thing I would actually be in saying

486
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,940
that you went I think you wanted a nude nude drama that's why that's why the

487
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,340
new matrix is so dope because it's basically about the dopest of the

488
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,340
the internet, meeting people on the internet, meme culture, for the win.

489
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Top Gun, I mean the shit like Top Gun, it's like they're flying in planes and

490
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,340
it's like, okay, you guys have nicknames? Nicknames? That's 80s. We have screen

491
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,340
names now. Exactly. We have gamer tags, right? Because we're a generation raised

492
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,340
on new shit like MSG. And none of these news anchors or anything on CNN could

493
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,340
even last a minute in a cod lobby. They won't cover it. They're too busy talking

494
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,340
about Justin Long as a baby cock on a kayak. They're too fucking busy talking

495
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,060
celebrities and their daddy parts bro. I'm actually trying to fucking invent new

496
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,340
kinds of music. I'm trying to listen to music while I do my tasks. I'm thinking

497
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,940
of a new blend of rock and hip-hop and trying to actually express myself

498
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,380
through that bullshit about different shit I'm going through with my fucking

499
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,220
grades. And it's like yeah and it's like every news website nowadays has these

500
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,380
45 minute videos about like court jester is fucking this other slut in the castle.

501
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,860
It doesn't make any sense. It's like that's so old.

502
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,700
Yeah.

503
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,940
(laughing)

504
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,620
We don't have castles anymore.

505
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,020
I don't even know what a castle looks like, bro.

506
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,860
What's that, like Gotham?

507
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,700
I saw, there's one castle,

508
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,140
there's only one place you can go to see a real castle now

509
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,200
and it's medieval times.

510
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,780
That's the shit that I'm talking about, right?

511
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,860
How come there's no restaurant that's future times?

512
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,980
Here's the thing, we used to have the Flintstones

513
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,540
and now we own that Jetsons tip.

514
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,360
Yep. Right?

515
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,200
Yeah.

516
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,460
Because I honestly, the Flintstones,

517
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,140
I don't give a fuck about your rock shit

518
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,420
and about fucking dinos and bullshit like that.

519
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,140
The Jetsons, I'm way into the robot maid status,

520
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,740
who she actually has a microwave in her vagina,

521
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,780
and that's the shit that I'm rocking with these days.

522
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,660
- And Judy Jetson, 16 year old wife.

523
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,500
- Yeah.

524
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,220
- She's only 16, the father is like old as hell.

525
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,620
So it's like a mommy, a young mommy, old daddy thing.

526
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,300
- Yeah, which is these days becoming more and more

527
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,180
just like absolutely fucking futuristic, yeah.

528
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,060
- And that's weird.

529
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,340
- It's fucking weird, yeah.

530
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,260
And let's just go back to a normal time.

531
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
I agree.

532
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,260
I know.

533
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,680
We can't, we can't, I mean, we just can't keep having these videos.

534
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,120
My first public caveman fuck beauty who came from the sea.

535
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,540
How the hell is that news?

536
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
Exactly.

537
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
That's old.

538
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
It's not news.

539
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Yeah, exactly.

540
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,540
That's the oldest shit ever.

541
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
The sea.

542
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
And why is the-

543
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,840
Caveman gets a woman to fill with cum.

544
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,900
And why is George Jetson on that treadmill?

545
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,140
Bro, what the fuck is the sea or the ocean?

546
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,100
Because I've only experienced water parts these days.

547
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Yep.

548
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Me too.

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,500
actually insanely high drop in the bath and I've actually had a couple of baths,

550
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,940
but those are even getting old by the day. I can't wait to get to showers.

551
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,200
Yeah showers are on another level because there's actually no dirt in them.

552
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,420
Yeah, but a bath is a basically a dirt pile. It's a puddle, a complete dirt

553
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:24,440
puddle, so it's like mud. This is old news. Okay on on xn xx that's that's a

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,920
Yep, absolutely, because he was actually if you do look, you don't know this. If

585
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,560
you do your research, your investigation, he's out there sucking women's blood,

586
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,160

BS right that's true I guess I guess a lot of people don't know this but women

592
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,660
were executed for being witches but a lot of men at around the same time and

593
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,300
like Salem and shit were actually burned because they thought they were were

594
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:22,460
wolves damn turns out they were just you know just a guy who's a very hairy

595

I'm so scared to live in that time.

596
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,800
If God is real, then you will never have to.

597
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
That's the other thing.

598
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,460
How about fucking report, if you're going to report on old bullshit, why not the fucking

00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,860
He was literally water to wine, bread and fish for fucking hundreds of people.

00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
And he could float.

602
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,820
And he had a floating ability, especially when he interacted with a water source.

603
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,820
Look at over there.

604
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Look at that picture of him.

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,960
I'm over 18 listen you shouldn't have to be 18 to watch porn

669
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:07,920
They put those trigger warnings at the beginning of all the porn websites, it's like that's bullshit

670
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,640
it. Right? How the fuck am I supposed to learn shit? A guy goes to Las Vegas to gamble and

671
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,400
he loses all his money. He doesn't even have enough for a cab, but he flagged one down

672
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,840
anyway. He explained to the driver that he would pay him back next time and gave him

673
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,080
his phone number, but the driver told him, "Get the fuck out of my cab." There's the

674
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,680
F word they were talking about. He walked all the way to the airport and got home. Some

675
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,800
times rolls by and he decides to go back to Vegas again and this time he wins big. He

676
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,700
gets his bags and is ready for the airport with all his new winnings. There are a line

677
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,420
of cabs and at the very end he sees the driver from last time that kicked him out. He stood

678
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:44,280
for a moment thinking how he can get his revenge on that driver. So he gets in the first cab.

679
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,140
How much is it to the airport he asks. The driver says $15. Great, how much is it for

680
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,640
a blowjob on the way there? The cab driver says get the fuck out of my cab. So he goes

681
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,780
to the next one and asks the same thing. How much to the airport? $15. How much for a blowjob?

682
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,500
And the cab driver also tells him to get the fuck out of his cab. He does this all the

683
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,140
way down the line of drivers, each one kicking him out. He finally gets to the last driver,

684
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,860
one from his last trip. He asks, "Hey, how much to the airport?" Driver responds, "15."

685
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,680
The guy hands him 15 and says, "Great, let's go." And so the driver leaves, slowly passing

686
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,040
all the other drivers who are staring out their window while the guy in the back smiles

687
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,380
back with a thumbs up.

688
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,380
Bruh!

689
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,740
It's like, listen, fucking, I don't-

690
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,940
That's disrespectful to service workers.

691
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,300
Literally these guys, first of all, taxi cabs are one of the last bastions of free speech

692
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
in this fucked up shit.

693
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,620
Yep, you can say whatever you want in a taxi.

694
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,340
Say whatever you want. Listen, if you want to listen, you can literally ask them, like,

695
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,460
you get into a cab driver right it's usually a patriot he's listening to the

696
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,500
Tim Nealon show and he you can't have him turn it off to what in ubers they

697
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,500
say weird things in ubers you get us you get into an uber bro you're there

698
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,060
fucking 15 songs they have a 15 song caroline polachek playlist that they

699
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,140
play five times in a row. I was some gay bullshit. I was in an uber a few days

700
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,260
ago and the uber driver told us that in the future he said in the future maybe

701
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,460
there might be zombies in the road. Wow. He said that to us. Holy shit. Yeah, he

702
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,260
really did. Liberal dude. He played the fucking Telltale Walking Dead game. Yeah.

703
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,560
Because that's the intro. That's the intro? That's the intro. That makes so

704
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,160
much sense. Yeah, so he obviously, which that game is about what? Fucking emotions

705
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,160
and bullshit like that. And you actually, it's a walking simulator. Yeah. And you

707
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,560
Aguilera. And you know what his GPS... It's like what happened to using a military

708
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:29,200
the commander you wanted is you know what his GPA was at for his fucking his

709
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,380
eighty thousand dollars. I like probably like eight point. Oh, because they

00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,740

712
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,800
University. Yeah, yep, he's literally there's a class at Wentworth where you

713
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,840
just put a guy's butt in your mouth. I heard they found new t rex bones. I

714
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,540
they found new t-rex bones and they destroyed them because it was a male

715
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,620
t-rex. They actually, no, they thought, well I heard that, then they also

716
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,780
found girl t-rex bones and they actually gave all the bones to different OnlyFans

717
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:04,420
women so they could put them in their vaginas to make more money. Yeah, I heard that too.

718
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:10,020
You make money putting a bone in your thing. It's a fucked up world. Is that true?

719
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,220
With fucking fucked up shit, right? Is that really true? Yeah, that's why I picked up a mic.

720
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:22,820
fucking spit to spit yeah it rhymes okay yeah it sounded like you're using the

721
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,660
mic for something else when you said that no I'm not use oh my god did this

722
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,180

723
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,300
one should we exchange our phone numbers are you kidding that would confuse the

724
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,140
people who try to call us what that's a good point that actually this is the

725
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,500
first one I'm that's like a Confucius saying here's one here use us yeah

726
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,320
there's two these two are the same Confucius he was sent by Mao Zedong to

727
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,820
confuse us into being complete communists that's true that is so true

728
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,140
but look this one here I got this German girl's phone number she was being

729
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,940
difficult about it but I eventually got it it was nine nine nine nine nine nine

730
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:09,220
nine nine nine nine and then that's as possible OC I just got is that you

731
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,940
You should read the one that's right above that.

732
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,260
I just want to hear this one.

733
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,260
Yeah, 'cause like if you're a real fucking patriot

734
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,020
that you don't see this one, it's between these two jokes.

735
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,860
Let me read this one.

736
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,660
I asked a girl for, a Chinese girl for her phone number.

737
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,600
I asked a Chinese girl for her phone number.

738
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,500
She said,

739
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,380
nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.

740
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,220
No, that's not what it says.

741
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,680
What did she say?

742
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,000
Six, six, six.

743
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,580
No, that's not what it says.

744
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,420
Three, six, two, nine.

745
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,220
- All right, so you're basically as bad as the fucking people who write these fucked up--

746
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,020
- I said, "Wow," then her friend said she meant 666-3629.

747
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,820
- You're basically a fucking anti-Christian piece of shit.

748
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,260
- How is that anti-Christian?

749
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,460
- As a true American patriot, I always put phone numbers I want to ignore

750
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,340
under the contact "Freedom" because I always let freedom ring.

751
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,860
- Oh, so it's a joke to you?

752
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,100
- Freedom is a joke.

753
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,340
- Is this a charity to you to fucking do-- what are you, you're a fucking weird owl?

754
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,820
Fuck you.

755
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,860
- Some people literally live inside a computer.

756
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,460
- I know, it's fucked up.

757
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,140
and they're they they have they're forced to live in a computer and it's like you

758
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,900
think it's funny to joke about that. Do you know if Stephen Hawking still has

759
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,260
his old phone number? Every time I call a machine answers. Like Stephen Hawking was

760
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,540
actually one of the most fucking amazing like like pure images of American

761
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,780
masculinity. Uh-huh. Right and he's like one of the last bastion. And he was

762
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:32,180
American. Yeah he was. Duh. He was a full-blooded American. Okay with this one. I think he didn't have

763
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,420
full blood. I think that was the issue. This one actually is actually really

764
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,780
really patriotic. I'm actually liking this one. I'm going to read out for you.

765
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,580
Was at a Capital One cafe and asked the waitress for her phone number. Oh now

766
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,660
they start guarding personal data. Damn. Yeah. That's actually pretty good.

767
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,340
Take that Banks. Yeah that's right. I fucking hate the shitting Banks.

768
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,420
Yep. Alright see this is bullshit. Wait here's another one. Yeah. That I just

769
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,660
saw that's total bullshit. Yeah big surprise. I asked a newly immigrated

770
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:09,740
Asian lady for a phone number. She replied said sex free sex free sex tonight took me a minute to realize she meant

771
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,820
636 3629

772
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,620
Seem like that one is actually fucking mad racist. Yeah

773
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:20,060
Yeah, I don't know why you chose to read that like insanely racist and you just like chose to read that racist bullshit

774
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:24,100
You literally chose to share that to thousands of people just now. Yeah, really?

775
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,420
There's thousands of people listening. No, I don't think so. Oh, I

776
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:36,820
I've deleted the phone numbers of all the Germans. I knew from my mobile phone now. It's Hans free like that's actually anti like Germany

777
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,860
That's not even nice to them either. Yeah, I asked a cute statistician if I could get her phone number

778
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:50,540
She said probably not that's kind of like a saddest story and short of amount. I don't really understand that more ship, but whatever

779
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,580
Let's see I

780
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,780
Gave a girl my phone number and told her to text me when she got home. I guess she's homeless

781
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:04,700
Here's one here's one here. There's a weird one because it's a involves a child

782
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,420
It says little Johnny

783
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:13,180
Asked a newly immigrated Asian lady for a phone number

784
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,820
and

785
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,700
She replied sex sex sex free sex tonight

786
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:26,780
Is there more is that this the whole thing

787
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,780
Oh, and then it took little Johnny a minute to realize she meant 636-3629.

788
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,780
Oh, okay.

789
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,780
And they're just letting kids do this now?

790
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,780
I have another one here about little Johnny that's even more liberal.

791
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,780
Wow.

792
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Big surprise.

793
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,780
The teacher in little Johnny's school asked the class what their mothers did for a living.

794
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,780
One little girl said her mother was a doctor.

795
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,780
Another said her mother was an engineer.

796
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,780
When it was little Johnny's turn, he stood up and said, "My mom's a streetwalker."

797
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,820
Walker. Naturally, after that remark, he got sent off to the

798
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,220
principal's office. Then, fifteen minutes later, he

799
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,940
returned. So the teacher asked, Did you tell the principal what

800
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,740
you said in class? Johnny said, Yes. Well, what did the

801
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,620
principal say? He said that every job is important in our

802
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,060
economy, gave me an apple and asked for my phone number. Wow,

803
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,620
so the principal's a pedophile. Great is a penny. Want to be

804
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,460
there? I think it's okay for a principal to pay a pedophile.

805
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,420
This is another one that I saw that's fucking bullshit leftism

806
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,800
Yo mama so fat when she steps on a scale I see my phone number and then it says

807
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,720
under that says it's completely okay to be fat these days. Wow. Yeah. It's just

808
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,760
sadness is actually better than skinniness. Yeah. And also it says it

809
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,400
says fat women are actually better than women who are so fucking skinny you can

810
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,880
see every single one of their bones. Yeah. And it's like what dude it's like

811
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,240
yeah. This is bone is the hottest shit of all time. The bones a hot part of the

812
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,320
women. Yeah. Just little bones. And it's like I hear this joke I'm like what if

813
00:49:53,320 --> 00:50:00,400
my phone number is one yeah here's a perfect woman she's completely so skinny

814
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,760
that she doesn't even exist and you she's only you can see the bikini part of her

815
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:11,040
okay what do you guys think that's interesting yeah I'm intrigued which

816
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,840
they would probably think oh great hello why hello thanks for calling the mental

817
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,800
health hotline yeah big surprise they're doing mental health jokes as if that's

818
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,520
fucking real if you are obsessive-compulsive press one

819
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,040
repeatedly. If you're a codependent, please ask someone to press 2 for you. If you have

820
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,320
multiple personalities, press 3, 4, 5, and 6. If you are paranoid, we know who you are

821
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,880
and what you want. Stay in the line so we can trace your call. If you're delusional,

822
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,760
press 7 and your call will be transferred to the mothership. If you're schizophrenic,

823
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,200
listen carefully and a small voice will tell you which number to press. Blah blah blah

824
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:46,240
blah blah. If you're dyslexic, good bullshit. If you're, um, if you have low self-esteem,

825
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,420
please hang up. All our operators are too busy to talk to you. First of all, that's

826
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,380
That's like fucking way more than nine numbers.

827
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,100
Yeah, that is way more than nine.

828
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,620
And listen to this one here.

829
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,900
This is some liberal fucking bullshit.

830
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,860
Your mom is so fat when she steps on a scale I see sex, free sex, free sex tonight.

831
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,500
Oh, and it says right there it's actually a Chinese girl's phone number.

832
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,980
And it says your mom is Chinese.

833
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Yeah.

834
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,980
Wow.

835
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
That's messed up.

836
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
Listen to this one.

837
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,740
I mean, this is kind of what I think they want to do to the Constitution.

838
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:20,940
this is 20 things to do before you die. I don't know if you guys see this one, but

839
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:23,620
if you want to go through this, I mean, these are kind of like they want to add

840
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,180
these to the Constitution. These are things that people have to do and it's

841
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,700
number one is look at see-through glass and when someone is on the other side

842
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,500
shout, "Oh my god, I'm hideous." It's like, really? Come on, man. That's rude. That's

843
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,180
fucking rude. Bring a big chair into the elevator facing away from the door and

844
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,580
when someone walks in, dramatically turn and say, "We've been expecting you." Look at

845
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,920
- I'm gonna read this fucking bullshit.

846
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,580
This is about some bullshit medical doctor crap here.

847
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,420
- Okay.

848
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,160
- This one's disgusting to me.

849
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,120
But I'm gonna read it just so everyone knows

850
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,140
how pissed off I am.

851
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,220
Doctor, my husband just can't have enough sex.

852
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,480
A married woman goes to her doctor's office

853
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,600
and starts complaining.

854
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,740
Yeah, go figure.

855
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,740
- Yep.

856
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,160
- It's just too much, doctor.

857
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,180
My husband just wants to sex me up all the time.

858
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,240
In the bed, in the kitchen, in the backyard,

859
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,740
after dinner, before breakfast, standing up, sitting down,

860
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,280
and I can't take it anymore.

861
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,240
Is there something that I can give him?

862
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,240
The smirking female doctor then takes a prescription pad,

863
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,740
writes something, and says,

864
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,540
"Here, give him my phone number.

865
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,280
"It's sex-free sex, free sex 2-9."

866
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,720
- And this is just some bullshit, a salesman position,

867
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,120
right, and they think this is okay.

868
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,920
English is not my mother language,

869
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,540
so ignore any grammatical mistaking.

870
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,800
They think that that's okay for someone

871
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,700
not speak English first of all. Yeah. And so here's the actual fucking joke. A guy

872
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,260
is interviewed for a salesman position. The interviewer asking the guy to take

873
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,960
his laptop saying, "Let's see if you can convincing me to buy this laptops. I want

874
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,480
you to walk in again thinking of me as a customer." The guy walked out as the

875
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,800
interviewer said but didn't came in. The interviewer calls him to get in but the

876
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,820
guy isn't there anymore. The interviewer realizing that the guy had just stole

877
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,720
his laptop so he went to check the guy's phone number from his resume and start

878
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,080
calling him. The guy answers and the interviewer speaking immediately say

879
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:19,280
bring me my laptop now it has all my work documents, which the guy replied on to by

880
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,760
saying are you buying it. It's like listen buddy go back to your fucking

881
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,120
country. It's that fucking simple. Which guy in the story needs to go back to his

882
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,920
country? Both of them. Okay I have this one's kind of intellectual. Are you guys ready for

888
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,440

either of the guy who's completely fat at the top of the time people always

909
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,200
for a girl with a fat top and a tiny little ways and a black shirt, short SJW blonde hair,

910
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,200
right?

911
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,880
Jeans on, so, "Hey, pretty mama."

912
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,920
And I said, "What the hell are you talking about, you fucked up girl?

You almost look like a guy."

914
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Yeah.

915
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,920
Yeah.

916
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,440
Look at this one here.

917
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
This is disrespectful.

918
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,760
This one is just disrespecting officers of the law.

919
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Yeah.

920
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,200
And it's so fucked up that they have to deal with this shit.

921
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,200
I think it's bullshit.

922
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,680
It's bullshit, but let me tell it.

923
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,800
a police officer told once told me

924
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,520
will never forget nine eleven and i said

925
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:01,520
of course you own it's your phone number sex free sex free sex tonight

926
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:07,960
and that's they're saying that's the cops phone and listen everybody knows

927
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,680
that when you will need to call the police you call six six six set three

928
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,320
three six two nine six three six

929
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,720
three six six six three six and i would i would i have now what i would i'm

930
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,360
I'm really asking about this joke and I'm curious about is that's not enough

931
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,000
numbers for a phone number. They're missing the area code and normally I'd

932
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,360
think okay well if the area code might just be the area code we're in but this

933
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,480
woman's Chinese I don't know any area codes in China. It might be a Chinese area

934
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,520
code and I might get the number completely wrong. It's a different joke.

935
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,080
There's a different joke. I was just remembering one that we told earlier.

936
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:48,400
Basically, if an SJW wrote it, it's probably San Francisco area code, Seattle area code,

937
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,080
Austin area code, Worcester Brooklyn area code, North Korea area code.

938
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:02,600
There's so many hipsters in North Korea, they all have the same hair cut.

939
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:11,440
Because Donald Trump is the 45th president, the hotel in North Korea is missing the 45th

940
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
floor.

941
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Really?

942
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
I'm serious.

943
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,440
That's so fucked up.

944
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,000
The hotel, all the...

945
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
What happened to you?

946
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There was something crunchy in that drink.

947
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
What?

948
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,320
I think there was a grain of sand in this Arizona energy drink.

949
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,880
That's how you know that it's honestly organic.

950
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:32,600
like guys. I heard the hipsters in in North Korea. They go to well first of

951
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:36,160
all they go to Starbucks. Yeah, yeah, that's a no brainer normally and we go

952
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,780
to Starbucks week. Some people will get coffee cake. I heard in North Korea.

953
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:46,180
They get they get yellow cake uranium because they like really nuclear. Oh in

954
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,440
North Korea, because they're so hipster people go and they say what the hell

955
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,320
nobody's walking around. It's like nobody lives here. There must be some

956
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,940
kind of camps. First of all, they're not in camps are all inside. They're on

957
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,320
phones yeah I heard that in North Korea they're so hipster that a lot of people

958
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:06,720
actually get killed for trying to swim across the mainstream or if we're trying

959
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,400
to go to under trying to go under yeah trying to leave the other yeah trying

960
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,000
to yeah they know how they go underground they try to cut yeah kind of

961
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,880
yeah it's some bullshit happening over there the Kim family is fucking complete

962
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:27,880
gay hipster bullshit. Him? Like Eminem's wife? OMG I just put that together.

963
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,880
Holy crap. Eminem? Wait like the candy? He's actually named after candy?

964
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,880
That's some gay bullshit. I thought he was an actual fucking patriot because of bagpipes

965
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,880
from Baghdad, but it turns out he's not. Another thing I heard about North Korean

966
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,880
hipsters apparently, and I mean I just heard this, but I heard that you know

967
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,280
you know, after they kill them for trying to go into the mainstream. I heard that

968
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,120
they violate the bodies before they're cool.

969
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:05,960
They're still warm. It's pretty good and they like they like turn them up or

970
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:10,100
that's bad and food that's bad. You know probably loves that the fucking gay

971
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,960
brothers, Ben and Jerry, the ice cream,

972
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:25,920
ice cream is actually been joking and jerry's john jerry illson yeah

973
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,080
Jerry basically you know how that ice cream gets made they been fucks Jerry in

974
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,400
the butthole and he comes out all the cream into the ice cream that's how they

975
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,480
make the fucking Stephen Colbert it's so good and Stephen Colbert was actually

976
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,360
insanely fucking Republican for a long time and then they fuck and then he

977
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:44,200
changed up yeah he changed up when when he finally you know what you know to

978
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,200
The vaccine.

979
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,200
The vaccine did that to him.

980
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,640
The vaccine as soon as he got the Pfizer shot, you know.

981
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,440
As soon as he got the Fauci-ouchie, I think is what they were calling it.

982
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,440
And then he does this whole, he does a whole song about the vaccine on his little show.

983
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
Yeah.

984
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,960
And it's like, listen buddy, first of all, not to bring it back to Eminem, but like if

985
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,600
you listen to even fucking four songs from Relapse, you'd have an entirely different point

986
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,600
of view.

987
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
Have you seen that video?

988
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,600
No.

989
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,920
The vaccine?

990
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,520
Why would I see anything?

991
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,120
It's a video, it's Stephen Colbert, and then a bunch of people dressed up like needles

992
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:18,060
come out and it's sickest shit ever and what does he do what did he like beat

993
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:23,360
the shit out of the needles like a family guy chicken? Nope he does a dance with them he

994
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:28,980
does the peewee Herman tequila dance with them. Oh because there's tequila

995
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:33,700
because there's worms in the... Peewee Herman. Yeah that's right because there's worms in

996
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:38,080
the vaccine is that what he's trying to get across? Yeah I don't know I think so

997
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,980
probably I heard there are worms. Or maybe he's trying to say the vaccine will make you

998
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,140
so anti-heterosexual that you'll actually get into singing?

999
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,140
Yeah.

1000
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,140
Yeah?

1001
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:52,220
Where rapping is actually what straight people do, but singing is like a girls and gays kind

1002
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,220
of thing?

1003
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,220
