It was awesome dude.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,160
Yeah that's one of those shows too where you go back and you watch it and it's

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,200
like the animation has progressed so much since it came out.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
This is like scary.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
It's terrifying.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
It's like hoodwinked.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,920
Yeah it looks like a demo of like what anime like before animation was they

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,420
made movies of like this could be this could be this is what this is what we

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,700
could do with the computer you know those those videos where it's like a ball that

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
fights a square yeah yeah and they're like this is gonna be something pretty

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,280
soon it looks like a game that you have to play with a control switch yeah it's

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,540
a game that you play with a light switch is what it looks yeah mm-hmm there's

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,540
only on and off yeah but damn was it a good show the writing the characters they

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,720
had a lot of music into the candy bar and the movie there's a soda the movie

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,960

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,640
that's really not that much well but it is because I want to put on the on-air

34

sign anyway that's true we do have an on-air sign now do you guys the movie

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,200

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
one on DVD I watched that movie so many times I saw it in theaters I saw I think

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,880
it does have a little bit of a cop-out though which is like when your parents

38
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,440
go away you might get a tummy ache that's fucking bullshit ultra was the

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,080

Steph Curry long bomb half court.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,640
- Yup.

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,460
- And that was one of them, dude.

48
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,300
- Pretty tired today.

49
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,920
I've been not sleeping good again.

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,760
- Me too.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
- Yeah.

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,420
- I don't know what it is.

53
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,120
- You know what you need to stop doing?

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
Tossing and turning.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
- That's true, yeah.

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,520
- You should not.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,620
- Another thing to avoid is waking up

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,540
in the middle of the night.

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,300
That also will keep get you tired.

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,520
- I did go to bed early last night and woke up

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,520
and then I just stayed up until I was sleepy again.

62
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,980
And that was at four.

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,480
when I went sleepy again.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,400
- You need to knock yourself out with a big bone.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,360
- I have melatonin.

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,120
I should start running into walls.

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,480
- You should get one of those--

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,760
- I should get a low pole.

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,320
- Yeah, with your bed right underneath it.

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,400
- So when I wake up I just hit the fucking--

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
- Well no, you run into it to go to sleep.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,080
- Oh dude, it's so, like literally yesterday,

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,800
or two days ago, Joe walked into that fucking pole

74
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,520

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,320
Joe it's so fun Joe cannot go on this side of the no he's of course he's a big

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,720
double jeopardy if we try to try him for it again yeah yeah so he's already been

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,920
exonerated no no guilty he's found guilty we could find him guilty again yeah

80
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,520
they basically you guys branded dassy'd me and which ones oh that's the the

81

putting her body in a car or something what is that movie called making a

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,960
murderer that really had dude that was like the worst cultural phenomenon

89
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,600
because it was like the fucking this one was it with that or Tiger King which one

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
was worse you think Oh Tiger King obviously Tiger Kings way worse but like

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,440
that was like I didn't watch making a murderer but Tiger King was annoying but

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,640
it was like fun to make a murder was so boring it was so boring in every episode

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,320
it was like well did he do it he did it but in the next episode he doesn't but

94
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,680
in this one yeah does the same thing with six fucking episodes of that true

95
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,040
crime so cry it's all it's all annoying cereal is so fucking annoying the this

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:58,960

99
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,360
name true crime is like what like people you know when people like complain about

100
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,960
about like Martin Scorsese and they're like,

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,220
oh, he only makes the same movie over and over.

102
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,700
Like true crime is the actual thing of that,

103
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,960
where it's like every true crime thing

104
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
is literally exactly the same.

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
- The truth is, yeah, it's like,

106
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,160
honey, you shouldn't have gotten murdered.

107
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,000
- Yeah.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,820
- It's like--

109
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
- The truth is that crime is pretty boring.

110
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,500
- Yeah.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,880
- We're almost, the only cool murder--

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,900
- That's the thing, I always,

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,860
so I would listen to like,

114
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,500
listen to like a few true crime things before,

115
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
or like watch them, and it's always like,

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,920
the thing about it is like,

117
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
when you watch a TV show, you're like,

118
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,480
I want a cool like climax and like really like I want something awesome to have

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,640
yeah and the end is always like and then they found out it was the guy they

120
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,680
thought it was all along he went to jail that's that's the that and then it's

121
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,480
like oh like this I'm always this case remained open because the cops were fat

122
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,600
and stupid they never knew they never figured out who it was but it's always

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
like I want to watch it and I wanted to be like it like it was actually his

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,280
twin brother all along and there was an alien that's why you guys seen the jinx

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,800
no I still have the only good true crime thing yeah that one it's this guy this

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,280
like five foot I keep following the Herman Miller I'm not going to it's like

127
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,480
it's like this five foot tall like Robert I know of Robert and he's just

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,200
he's just like moving through life murdering people and then all the cops

129
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,920
are like so stupid like there's a he fully got away with a murder in Texas

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,560
because he dressed up as a woman and came back and pretended to be like oh

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,160
like a woman who lived next door instead of himself yeah, and he was like and

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,880
the cops like yeah, my man, she was not the not the most beautiful lady I ever

133
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,280
seen, but yeah, I read this book that was like about like this guy who's like

134
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,680
the conspiracy theorist who believed that, like all serial killers are like

135
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,320
like primed by the CIA or whatever and they're like the cops are all like like

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,000
trained to like let them go and like let them do their thing and it's always

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
like it's always like he was able to kill like ten people before they caught

138
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,100
them, because they were like the cops were so devilishly clever to like to

139
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,380
fight to accuse people that weren't him. It's like they're all just like really

140
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,900
stupid, yeah, and Robert Durst is literally like he's so he's so like

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,500
bad and like self incriminating the entire time. He keeps being like well,

142
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,060
and then I killed I mean I didn't kill yeah like in the interview and then the

143
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,020
show ends with him. He leaves his hot mic on and he goes to the bathroom. He

144
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,720
is peeing and he just goes like I killed every last one of them yeah he's like

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:49,920
like every true crime thing ends like that what's the um that the that's the

146
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,680
only one that is like that no no the arrow the arrow Morris one or yeah yeah

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,560
the fucking uh fucking thin line of something or then blue line line yeah

148
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,000
the thin line is yeah yeah that one the old one is being like well what do you

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,640
think I did like yeah the same thing yeah like the good ones and with the killer

150
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,520
just being like yeah there's something what yeah there's something to me so

151
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,800
specifically cool about Robert Durst because he like they asked him to do

152
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,880
this interview like 15 different times over like 10 years and he just kept

153
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,200
doing it and coming in and just being like well if I did kill him I chopped

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,960
his legs up and put him in a trash bag yeah and then he just keep he just has

155
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,840
no idea when to stop because he just thought it was cool he's in a movie yeah

156
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,120
which I feel like is that's that's like what if you're a serial killer that's

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,800
like probably what you well you just jealous of his brother Fred yeah yeah on

158
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,200
mainstream success you know if you watch a movie actually is jealous of his

159
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,360
brother his name is not Fred though oh really yep he's jealous his brother took

160
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,360
over the family company what's in he comes from money right yeah like billion

161
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,920
trillion zillion dollars Wow no way he wasn't CIA or something this guy like

162
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,880
like the old true no this guy was a this guy yeah the MK ultra thing is just

163
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,440
because every serial killer was like abused by their parents as a kid I like

164
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,320
a ultra and that's what I'm K ultra is is basically like being abused like

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:30,040
you're a child let me kind this ultra Robert Durst mom jumped off of their

166
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,680
house when he was a kid and he watched it and he was like yeah that make me go

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,960
crazy. That's literally like always what it is. It's just like just chill out,

168
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,280
relax. Why are you being so fucking weird about your dead mom? It's so funny

169
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,120
that that like one of the like warning signs of like a psychopath or a serial

170
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,560
killer is wetting the bed. I know I feel like I feel like the actual the thing

171
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,040
that makes them psychopaths is that people make fun of the people say it's a

172
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,760
warning. So I also feel like it wouldn't it wouldn't make you a serial killer at

173
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,040
if nobody talked about it.

174
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,880
- I also, I always--

175
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,320
- If everyone is just cool about you

176
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
being a little kid wetting the bed,

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,680
like if everyone's like, "No, it's okay,"

178
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
but everyone's like, "Oh, look at this

179
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,200
"fucking little pee hound, dude."

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,600
- I always liked that one of the warning signs

181
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,320
is like, that they write down is like,

182
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
yeah, torturing small animals.

183
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,560
- Yeah, that's a warning sign for any--

184
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,720
- Yeah, you're like going to WebMD,

185
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,640
you're like, "All right, my son is torturing small animals,

186
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,000
"let's see what this could be."

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Oh no, it's actually really bad.

188
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
- Ah, crap, you're grounded!

189
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,140
found it might be a psychopath yeah. Well at least he's not peeing the bed yeah

190
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,560

191

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,960
- This is a Dianetics false memory.

233
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,920
- My sister broke my arm when I was--

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
- Triple bunk bed. - You guys had like

235
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,080
rotating beds on like a track,

236
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,280
like the doors in Monsters Inc.

237
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,940
- No, I had triple bunk beds.

238
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,900
I had triple bunk beds.

239
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,680
I had Yu-Gi-Oh sheets, I was on the top bunk.

240
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
My little brother was in the middle bunk.

241
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
He had Spiderman sheets and my older brother

242
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,600
had SpongeBob sheets. - Did you like Yu-Gi-Oh

243
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
as a kid?

244
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,320
- I did, I was Yami Yu-Gi for Halloween when I was six.

245
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,060
- Really, wait, do you have a picture?

246
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,980
- Nah, I don't have a picture of it, but I had--

247
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,780
- Can you ask your mom for a picture of that?

248
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
- There might be a picture.

249
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,480
My Aunt Maureen-- - I need to see that picture

250
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,760
if it exists. - Took a shit ton of pictures.

251
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,520
But when I was four, my sister, my cousin Ryan

252
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,120
was babysitting us and we were playing,

253
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,280
like we're playing some game and my sister kicked me off the top like I was

254
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,840
like holding on to the like the ladder that goes up and my sister kicked me off

255
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,600
and I fell down. How did you have ceilings high enough for three? Did you live in some kind of great hall?

256
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,160
They lived in a cathedral. No, the ceilings weren't, they were just tall enough.

257
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,440
I would wake up and hit my head on the fucking ceiling all the time. They lived in a cathedral with a giant spider-man mural on the ceiling.

258
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll call my mom right now, I'll ask her about the triple bunk beds. She's just gonna lie to you

259
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,300
like she lied to you and you were a kid no dude I had triple bunk beds dude I

260
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,900
just this is impossible for my head triple bunk you have a photo no your

261
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,460
parents never thought to take a photo of your your triple bunk bed the only

262
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,980
triple bunk yeah exist there's no dude it was a wooden it was a wooden triple

263
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,640
bunk bed a wooden triple getting less believable by the second we would like

264
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,240
draw on the fucking. It was made out of magical you. And it was made out of paper too so we

265
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,400
could draw on it. And it had a chalkboard paint on it. And it tasted like every flavor. It

266
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:33,960
had a candy cane leg. A candy cane leg? And the third top bunk floated above the other

267
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,400
ones. Yeah it was actually completely magnetic. That's how they. Yeah it had triple bunk beds.

268
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,160
You didn't have triple bunk beds. I did. I had a pet cheetah. There wasn't enough room

269
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,400
in our house. My brother was actually a monkey. Yeah, I had laser shoes. Mm-hmm.

270
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,400
My sister had her own room and then we had a triple bunk bed that stretched

271
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:04,320
across multiple rooms. I didn't age 65. I had a Murphy bunk bed. It was just tall enough that like it

272
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,440
could fit in the room but like not tall enough. So when I was like sometimes I'd get up in

273
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,160
the morning just fucking hit my head on that. I think that explains. I think that's

274
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,360
why I just can't fucking think at all. That's probably why you think you have a

275
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,680
triple bunk bed, it's because you were on the triple bunk bed and you hit your head so many times.

276
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,840
Dude, I had triple bunk beds. You didn't have triple bunk beds. Yeah, I did. You might have had three sets of

277
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,280
bunk beds. No. I believe that before I believe that you had a three-story bunk bed.

278
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,240
I had a three-story bunk bed. You did not have a three-story bunk bed. Look up triple bunk beds right now.

279
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't even want to know if it's real. It's a real thing. I also know that it

280
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,880
wasn't real whenever you were a kid. No, it's sounds like a new. Yeah, that

281
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,800
took that takes a while to invent. Yeah, that sounds like a SkyMall kind of

282
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,680
invention. Yeah, that's a shark tank thing. That sounds like a Skynet kind of invention. Yeah, exactly.

283
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,440
Whatever it is, it's also morally wrong. Yeah, definitely.

284
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:03,440
You calling mommy? Yep. Go crying to mommy. Hey, I had triple bunk beds as a kid, right?

285
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Yes you did. Bullshit! Liar! You used to... You'd call it all over them, you destroyed them, and you used to bang your head off the top.

286
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I told you! I fucking told you guys! You think you're the only one that can make a call, huh?

287
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Amanda pushed you off, you were climbing up to the top, and Amanda kicked you in the face, and you went straight home.

288
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Alright, let's talk on the phone.

you called your mom and she said literally every exact thing that you

300
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,980
said without being prompted. It's like she brainwashed you into things like

301
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,020
she might be the original the original every morning when you're a kid you

No, she did say you destroyed the sheets. We should have. We should have probed

00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,660
that. She didn't say I just said I destroyed the bed. She said you told him

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,320

Well, it's not going to be St. Patrick's Day when this comes out, so I didn't think it was important.

427
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,960
But it's St. Patrick's Day.

Not all green.

441
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,560
He's got no green.

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520

The pinch fest is not...

449
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,280
Dude, I will literally get the pinch cops involved.

450
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,840
This is green.

451
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,320
Nope.

452
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,880
The pinch cops...

453
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,760
You don't get to...

454
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,720
You have put a thing of scotch tape on your shirt.

455
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
That doesn't count.

456
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,360
He...

457
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,160
Oh, dammit.

458
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,280
He's halfway down the office already.

459
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,840
He's gone.

460
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,720
Now we can talk about the real issues.

461
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,440
Yep.

462
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,000
That's right.

463
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,160
(howling)

464
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,080
- Dude, having two mics is honestly pretty sick.

465
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,040
Is this fucking up the audio at all?

466
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,640
- Why would it, no.

467
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
It's just gonna sound weird.

468
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,480
- It's gonna sound weird?

469
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,020
- It's not gonna, yeah. - That's fine.

470
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,180
(laughing)

471
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,480
He's wearing one green, green glove that he, that...

472
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,720
(laughter)

473
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,560
Can you move your hand in that?

474
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,960
Yeah, it doesn't look like you can move,

475
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,440
that glove is too small.

476
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,280
That glove is for...

477
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
It looks like a prosthetic hand.

478
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,000
That glove is like, Alex and Joe bought those.

479
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,760
They, we've already established, they have huge hands.

480
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
That is not gonna, let me see it.

481
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,440
No.

482
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,760
(laughter)

483
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,600
I like it now.

484
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Can you make a fist?

485
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh, dude, you can't even...

486
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,780
- I can try it, yeah.

487
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,520
- Yeah, you're faking it.

488
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,360
- Dude, that...

489
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,200
(laughing)

490
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
- It looks so funny, dude.

491
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,600
Yeah, but I'm wearing green now.

492
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,440
- That's true.

493
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,600
- Can we all admit that this is green?

494
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,920
- At least I got one pinch in.

495
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,200
It wasn't even a good pinch, though.

496
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,040
- It's true.

497
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,200
- And now I have a beautiful hand.

498
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,440
- Oh my God, dude, that looks so weird.

499
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,200
- It looks crazy.

500
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,120
- Wait, tuck it under the thing.

501
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,540
- You're Dr. Strangelove.

502
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,880
- Yeah, 'cause that looks like,

503
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,460
It's green enough that if you told me,

504
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,100
if somebody had a hand that green

505
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,080
and you told me, oh yeah, this is what diabetes

506
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,760
does to your hands when you get it.

507
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,600
Like your hand turns green.

508
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,640
- It turns your hand into a glove.

509
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,000
- I think it looks pretty cool.

510
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,280
- That green looks like enough of a shade of skin.

511
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,120
- Yeah, that's true.

512
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,400
When it's the back of the hand, it does kind of,

513
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,360
- The way your knuckles are in it,

514
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,400
it's tight enough that it looks like skin.

515
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,240
- Don't pick your nose with it.

516
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,080
- Aw, don't pick your nose with it.

517
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,900
- That's nasty.

518
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,740
- Stop.

519
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,560
- Stop.

520
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,400
- That's nasty.

521
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,240
(sniffing)

522
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,700
- Oh.

523
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,500
- People have to listen to this.

524
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
- That's so gross.

525
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,460
- He's gonna wipe a booger on Cameron.

526
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,320
- I'm just gonna put it on my pants.

527
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,160
- Yeah.

528
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,660
- It's not even your glove, you're ruining that glove

529
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,500
with toxic boogers.

530
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,340
- That's Allison Jo's glove.

531
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,900
- I don't care.

532
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,740
It's my green.

533
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,340
- It's making your hand look smaller somehow too.

534
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,180
- Yeah.

535
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,000
(laughing)

536
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
It's so funny.

537
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,300
(laughing)

538
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,740
It looks like I don't have a real hand in here.

539
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah, it's it's it looks like exactly like a prosthetic hand. Yeah, but it is real

540
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,820
Did you chop your hand off like you know, oh do what was that fucking um

541
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,180
Not er it was on TLC. It was basically a show about the ER

542
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,740
but it was on TLC and is like real like Ian like real surgeons and

543
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,820
There's this one episode I saw where a guy chopped off his own hand

544
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
What?

545
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,900
A guy chopped off his own hand for like some rea-- like he was going through like psychosis

546
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,760
or something and like brought the hand in a cooler and was just like, "I need you guys

547
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
to reattach this."

548
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Whoa.

549
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Yeah.

550
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Oh.

551
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,780
I saw that when I was like seven.

552
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,860
Somebody told me recently about some--

553
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,740
Was it Alex talking about ER?

554
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:48,700
No, someone was telling me that they like saw a-- they saw somebody like walking down

555
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,020
the street and they thought that they were like like it was like a crazy guy

556
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,340
like dressed in like like a hospital gown and they thought that they were he was

557
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,500
like eating shit he was like eating something like red and brown out of his

558
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,500
hand and the person realized he was eating his own hand oh my god that's

559
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:14,780
crazy eating is a dude it's so nice you know I'll say it I would never do that

560
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,060
that yeah, that'd be fucking stupid. I know it might be good, though. You don't

561
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,400
know never do that. I don't know the hand is I mean the part of the body. I

562
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,860
would eat. I did not eat my hand in one single bite. As soon as I went behind

563
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,660
that curtain, I'll tell you that much imagine if you if I saw a guy walking

564
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,060
down the street like think about how much it must hurt to be eating your hand

565
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,980
that must taste really, really good for him to keep doing that

566
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,080
right true. Yeah, it's got to be good. Yeah, like you wouldn't be eating his

567
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,240
understand if it was disgusting right. His brain was probably telling him this

568
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,140
is prime rib baby a little bit of sweet baby prime baby raise. This is prime

569
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,740
rib and you're at the super bowl after party and everyone is congratulating you

570
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,340
for throwing a touchdown. You gotta put a little stubs on that one. Yeah, he's

571
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,620
gonna have a stub after. You gotta put stubs. Yeah, accidentally spilling some

572
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,740
like barbecue sauce in your hand and just looking at me like well.

573
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,220
It's already there. This is the only time it's gonna taste good.

574
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,020
I might as well take a big bite right now.

575
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,100
Do you think this is funny to do?

576
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,620
I think that's really funny to do.

577
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,300
Yeah, you're holding it like a Lego.

578
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:18,800
What?

579
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,180
Oh, I-- oh my god, you're right.

580
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,180
That is a Lego.

581
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,300
I have a Lego hand.

582
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,380
Yeah.

583
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,220
That's crazy.

584
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,180
The way you're holding it, though, it like--

585
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:27,720
I don't know.

586
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,620
You're doing some like Klaus Nomi movements with your body.

587
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,780
Who's Klaus Nomi?

588
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,620

the color what

657
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,940
uh... do you really do it so it is you can work with ever

658
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,020
this was the same way they looked wet

659
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,920
uh... plastic

660
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,700
is shining a hate no me today

661
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,940
yeah is in a way you know where green anymore here

662
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,240
all all

663
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,300
with the peace

664
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,580
He's picked up a hammer.

665
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,500
Just be careful.

666
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,460
It's hammer day.

667
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
It's not hammer day.

668
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Hammer day is tomorrow.

669
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,260
This would be a horrible way to die.

670
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
A hammer?

671
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,580
Have your skull caved in.

672
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,180
You know this might be...

673
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,900
Two guys did it to one guy in a video.

674
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,780
This might be an unpopular opinion but I think that maybe, I think pretty much every way

675
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,140
would suck to die.

676
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,460
Yeah people say like oh that would be an awful way to die in general.

677
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,260
Yeah dying just sounds fucking shit.

678
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,500
I also don't think it matters how you die because then you're dead. Yeah true except maybe like

679
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,700
maybe like

680
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,940
Dying sex to death dying by getting my fingered so hard yeah that feed sex to death would still suck as you die at the end

681
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,340
Of it. Yeah, you know it's good is sex without death at some point to try that

682
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,660
At some point during the the the sex to death it's gonna start to hurt

683
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,620
Yeah, I don't think even if you have a heart attack while fucking it's like I don't think

684
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,380
Cut, you know, like you're--

685
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,220
But doesn't--

686
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,040
That's the noise you would make.

687
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Like the tortoise.

688
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
(tortoise squeaking)

689
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,540
Yeah.

690
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,380
(tortoise squeaking)

691
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,220
Yeah.

692
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,220
The cumming already hurts so bad that like it--

693
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,560
(laughing)

694
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,520
It doesn't, like you could sneak in a heart attack

695
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,360
and I wouldn't even--

696
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,200
I'd rather die than cum ever again.

697
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,940
I wouldn't even notice, right?

698
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,940
I mean, I do it a lot, but it does hurt so bad.

699
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,100
It hurts my entire body, dude.

700
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,820
Yeah, it feels like I'm getting hit with a ray

701
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,140
every single time I cum.

702
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,180
Yeah, I mean, yeah, even when people are like,

703
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,580
know like you know dying I'd rather just not die yeah I'd rather feel everything

704
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,620
leading up to the death by sex and then stay alive after I think that would be

705
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:05,220
my choice. That would be a good way to go out I think. What? Like it would be so

706
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,640
funny if like it's like you know those stories where it's like yeah my

707
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,580
grandfather was a fucking stud he died while fucking it's so sick and it's like

708
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,260
that you find out like they were running a train on my grandpa.

709
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,900
They're running a train on my grandpa. He got fisted so hard

710
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,700
that it ruptured. They ruptured his intestine and they touched

711
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,260
his stomach and that would be a good way to go. That would be

712
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,660
cool. Oh my God. Imagine imagine they're fisting your grandfather

713
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,580
and he pulls out his fist. He's holding a hot dog

714
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:46,100
whole a whole big bite. In bun. Yeah in the bun. Hot dog in bun. Ketchup perfectly kind of

715
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,740
squiggled down the entire dog. That's why they loved my grandpa down at the cock. He could suck a

716
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,020
whole hot dog bun and all all the way down to his belly. He was a shooter.

717
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,820
He's a dog shooter. Yeah. Yeah. Remember that video? The hot dog shooter?

718
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,100
Yeah. They pull out their hand and just like a just a just a torrent, just a

719
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:16,420
drench of just diet coke. It's the moment like when a samurai runs by you and you're like

720
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,860
oh yeah that's it. It has that like it has that like that white kind of layer that

721
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,940
comes out from a soda fountain when you get coke. Yeah it's like when you when you

722
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,460
look close enough. It's before it thinks to add the syrup. Yeah when you when you look at the

723
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,140
coke freestyle machine you can see like the soda and then the two syrups like

724
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,020
squirting on the other on each side. Yeah that's exactly. That's the thing about the

725
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:42,820
coke freestyle machine little bit of syrup not too much syrup that's why it's

726
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,980
perfect perfect amount of syrup every time here let's go to Qdoba right now

727
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,620
it's going on God's green or look at that fucking even talking about you look

728
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,220
at the coke freeze look at the stream at the coke freestyle machine it's two

729
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:01,700
syrups on each side what does that why

730
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,020
- Okay. - Look at--

731
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,860
- That's smart.

732
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,620
- I'm like recusing myself from this one.

733
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,060
- You gotta take a closer look

734
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,500
next time you look at a Coke freestyle machine.

735
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,980
- I get that, but what about that is impressive to you?

736
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,460
- Just the spirit of ingenuity.

737
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,760
- That they put syrup in soda?

738
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,300
- That they put the perfect amount,

739
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,820
they have a robot that puts the perfect amount of syrup.

740
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,140
- So you think every other thing

741
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,100
is fucking it up the entire time?

742
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,620
- Look, sometimes you get a bad fountain drink

743
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,900
at like a Burger King.

744
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,740
- Well yeah, sometimes-- - The syrup dispenser's broken.

745
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,180
dispensers running low on see you're running low or like the dispenser I

746
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:41,100
think I've had that happen at a coke freestyle though sorry to burst your

747
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,820
bubble but yeah it's happened to me yeah and I don't like to talk about it are

748
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,380
you kidding no I'm not you're not just saying this because we're on the air

749
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,620
sort of got it happened I think they should get rid of the I think they

750
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,580
should get rid of the soda fountains they're replacing with soda mountains so

751
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,720
so if you want to get soda, you gotta climb all the way up to get it,

752
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,280
burn some damn calories. You gotta mine the syrup.

753
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,500
And you gotta hit a... Oh, I struck coke!

754
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,460
It's like finding your Kyber crystal. Yeah, exactly.

755
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,220
You have to fight a rancor to get yourself...

I'm dressed up like a prospector and I'm walking down the street.

759
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm looking in the windows of restaurants and I'm like,

760
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,820
"There's Coca-Cola in that restaurant!"

761
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,340

911
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,280
What did he just say? He said it's so hard to open his mind without drugs.

912
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,800
He's reliant on CBD for creativity. I didn't drink any of it. You're addicted.

913
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,360
I would have never thought that you could handle some bullshit like that.

914
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,360
I can't.

915
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,600
How many milligrams of CBD are in there?

916
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,600
I drank something.

917
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,320
I drank a thing of...

918
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,480
Oh man.

919
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,480
He's already so high.

920
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,480
It's already hitting.

921
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
He's so high.

922
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,360
Listen pal, you might be a junkie, but I'm a punkie because I don't respect authority

923
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,840
and they want you to do drugs.

924
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,160
So I rebel by not doing it.

925
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,000
This is the only escape we have, man.

926
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,600
I hate these damn kids sitting on the corner drinking CBD soda, getting high out of their

927
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,680
fucking minds, giggling to each other, playing the penis game.

928
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,120
Oh my God, I hate that shit.

929
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
So what is...

930
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,840
I know so many people who are teachers now that I'm like...

931
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,840
It made me realize one, every teacher I had was like 20, every assistant teacher.

932
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
Yeah, they're young.

933
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
They're all like my age.

934
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
That's why they're so hot, man.

935
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,480
Because they were nice and young.

936
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:32,320
time in second grade. Did you fuck your teacher? I had sex with my dead teacher.

937
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:39,840
I had sex with my teacher and she was 94. I wanted to fuck my teacher so bad she was uh

938
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,600
I never had a teacher that I wanted to have sex with. It was all

939
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,760
strictly a business relationship. You had business? You made business with her?

940
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,080
No. You did your business in her mouth? I did my math and I turned the paper in.

941
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:00,000
Whoa. Did you ever calculate her number? No. I wouldn't want to. Cameron left to pee

942
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,600
and now I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee so you're gonna you and your high mind

943
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,160
are gonna have a moment. Hey don't go don't go a Cheech and Chong and out on

944
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:17,240
me. That's okay. I was gonna say something before I forget. Oh oh the penis game. It's

945
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,400
so funny like there's like so many people I know who are like assistant

946
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:27,480
teachers or like teachers now that are like my age or older or like you know

947
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,960
and it's so funny that like I've seen I've seen and heard them basically play

948
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,840
the penis game with me. It'd be impossible to not. It's like how do you

949
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,760
not laugh as a teacher? You have to train yourself once you become like an assistant teacher. You gotta like hate fun.

950
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,800
You got exactly you gotta uh-huh you gotta train yourself not to laugh at the

951
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,820
penis game it's like yeah it's like it's like fucking how do you not let I could

952
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,240
make me realize I could never sensitizing like the the like showing a

953
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,980
drone operator yes dude that's what that shit is they're desensitizing them like

00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,320
the like the SS yeah it's true they're trying to get them to be fucking and

955
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,700

956
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,200

Do you have the rotating cast of substitute teachers?

958
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh, yeah.

959
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,700

We had this lady.

961
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
There's a lady named Mrs.

Inc.

964
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,500
Yeah, and she was my, she would substitute Spanish sometime.

965
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,200
Were they just kids of the school's parents?

966
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,800
Yeah, that's what mine were too.

967
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,600
Yeah, her kids were like long gone and she was just this

968
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,000
old died. No, no, did you get you know what the best was was like if you had like a

969
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,800
long-term sub like if your teachers like if your teacher had a miscarriage or

970
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,840
something and I took me out for a few months and you got like you got a

971
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,160
long-term sub who was just like and it's never like they're just the same as like

972
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,960
others so like it's not like they're like more skilled or anything so it's

973
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,040
just literally every day yeah just only for this one I had that - oh dude we had

974
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:09,880
like that was like our only mean sub was this long-term sub and she I remember it

975
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,320
It was Miss Sullivan, she was pregnant, she had her baby, she was on maternity leave,

976
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,620
and she miscarried the baby to life, I guess, and it's a bit similar thing.

977
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,140

She's in the ocean.

1067
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,760
That's like one of those nightmares where you're like, there's like something that shouldn't be in that place.

everything is just terrifying there is literally when you're a kid life is

1072
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,840
unfair and then when you're growing in the world when you're a grown-up you

monkey and a crazy frog yeah what else is in here lights camera this is almost

1075
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,860
exactly what I thought I was good. I thought that I was going to work in this

1076
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,280
office when I was a kid, but I was going to be doing like real business stuff.

1077
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,880
I thought I was going to work in this office, but be a firefighter.

1078
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,280
Pretty much. But this is where I imagined working.

1079
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,560
Yeah, I was thinking I was going to be in an office like with chairs like this,

1080
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,480
but I was going to be a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

1081
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,080
I thought I was going to be a doctor when I was 11.

1082
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,960
Yeah, we went over that.

1083
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,720
When you were 11?

1084
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,880
Recently. Yeah.

00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,360
We can't rehash this.

1086
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,160
We can't rehash it.

1087
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:46,960
We had a whole big thing.

1088
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,160
I watched a lot of Scrubs as a kid and I was like, yeah.

1089
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,480
you're a funny doctor. Yeah, I'll be the funny doctor. I don't know what I

1090
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,760
thought I was going to be. I it's so I literally there's like a old like

1091
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,560
drawing that my mom saved from like kindergarten where it's like a

1092
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,120
worksheet is his like when I grow up, I want to be dot dot dot and I drew

1093
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,280
like a green blob and just wrote a frog.

1094
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,200
It's embarrassing, but I'm getting there. I'm pretty close. I think as

1095
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,960
soon as I got out of the firefighter thing, I was like I'm going to be a

1096
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,120
stand up comedian. I wanted to be a cartoonist. I wanted I like I was

1097
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,220
obsessed with the far side. I was like I want to be I want to be like Gary Larson

1098

Gary Larson's a goat. He is the goat. I wish I want to meet him before he does

1099
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:30,720
so badly. I need to show him my drawings. I draw a lot of cool things. This is called the smiler.

1100
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,140
The smiley face. I do think it'd be so cool to just make like far side things

1101
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:41,680
where the captions are just. You just look at smiley faces. The smiler.

1102

01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,780
How do you... You don't have to establish... Everyone knows from the name.

1135
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,980
No, you got to establish it.

1136
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,480
Rethink so.

1137
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,480

1145
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:06,180
that I'm trying to work on with the website but Squarespace sucks ass and and

1146
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,540
and we need to protest against them, because they're stopping me from doing

1147
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:13,160
all the awesome stuff I want to do on the website. You were going to make a you

1148
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:17,780
were going to make he's going to put the scary mace game on the website. Really

1149
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,300
yeah, then we literally can't do anything with squares. We should just put

1150
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:26,300
the page. That's what I wanted. I was just going to put a bunch of like cool

1151
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,020
math games on. Oh really you can't do it. I mean I okay. I was trying to do

1152
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:33,500
something else on Squarespace. I was getting mad about not being able to do

1153
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:41,000
I'll tell you after I'm gonna find a way to do it. Okay. Hmm. It used to be like you could host like a thing on fucking like

You can't like it sucks

1157
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:52,120
You should be able to just like every game used to have an embed code and then you could just put it on your website

1158
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,880
And it was so easy. I bet I bet there's still something you can do that with I bet I can just get I bet there's
