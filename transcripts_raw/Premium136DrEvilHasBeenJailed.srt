30
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,080
that we could do to mad libs episodes in a row

31
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,800
children

32
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,880
world

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,960
children and i mean in the school

38
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,280
twenty four hours i've watched that

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,000
I've watched that 20 times.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm like, I'm that guy is cool.

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,320
Dude, yeah, it's it's past the point where it's like this name.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Jake Novak, Jake Novak, open invite.

43
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
Come on the podcast because we're sitting grad.

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
We've done it before.

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Okay, we'll work our magic.

46
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Can you believe that?

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,840
And we're sitting grad like, Nope, I don't believe that.

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Okay.

49
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,280
I it's it's past the point for me where it was like at first I was like, Oh, this is

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
some cringe bullshit.

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,620
it. But actually now I think this is based as fuck.

52
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,720
Really? Yeah, it is pretty based.

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Honestly, at least politically. It's politically based but also like musical

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,360
theater but it's like, it's honestly... I don't know if the music is fire. I think

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,020
the music might be... No, dude, it's so cringe that it's based.

56
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,160
I think I've removed the part of my brain that reacts to things negatively because I

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,720
think I just like everything now. Me too.

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,760
Like I watched that first video of that guy and I was like, "This guy is honestly cool.

59
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:33,560
the

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,040
He basically stole it from us. Yeah, once you get past the like there's a part of

61
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,720
your brain that you have to you have to help. There's a part of your brain you

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
have to help. I'm saying that for the most part. I would say betterhelp.com.

63
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,200
Yep. Yeah. Use code "blist" to get 20% off your first session. It does suck to get 20% off your first session.

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,920
Because us as the first three guy cast member. Well yeah, we wouldn't be hired like SNL

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,920
SNL. Right. We wouldn't be hired like Lonely Island or something like that. No. We'd be

66
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,600
one can see one guy would be for the first three guys wardrobe would be so big

67
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,640
mm-hmm long the wardrobe would be so we why it depends on how we stand so smart

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,300
yeah because we could do we go up or wide yeah or diagonal that'd be way we'd

69
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,780
need two other guys I think I think they have that's what they have at least 50

70
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,640
years of experience over there all stilts second of all stairs and third of

71
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,880
all ramps but that's fucking bullshit and you know it it's not bullshit we could

72
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,760
be in the magic of performance in a sketch we'd have to get we'd have to get we'd

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,280
have to be good at it only do sketches about about kids trying to sneak in a

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:51,640
movie we do sneaking into an abortion clinic yeah well just be sneaking in a

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,040
different into an abortion clinic to save a remember when you were kidneys to

76
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,640
sneak into a bar no yeah well yeah yeah because they're putting the fetuses into

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
Pepsi bottles and I wanted to steal all the Pepsi.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Yeah, they're doing Joseph Mangala experiments on them.

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,240
I wanted to taste what Pepsi tasted like before they put the fetus in it.

80
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,440
I wanted to see what the stem, yeah the stem cell.

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Sneaking into an abortion clinic, it's perfect when you do the two kids stacked on top of

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,440
each other in a trench coat thing because you walk up and they're like, "Oh, you look

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,640
too young, there's no way we could do an abortion on you."

84
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,240
And you open the trench coat and they see a little kid's face and your crotch and you

85
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
go, "Oh my God, this is the perfect time for us to kill this baby."

86
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,680
Oh my God, it's being born. We have to we have to we actually know we don't have

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,920
to let's wait 10 minutes. We're gonna wait 10 minutes make sure actually let's

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,400
wait for its first word and then we'll put an ice pick through its spinal cord.

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,560
Yeah and then we're gonna use like an electric net from a sci-fi movie. Yeah.

90
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,440
To capture it. From Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. Yeah we're gonna do

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,200
the big the opening scene from Jurassic Park and we're gonna herd your your baby

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,960
into a cage. And yep it's gonna go to Baby Park. They should do a version of the

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,940
office that takes place at a Planned Parenthood. Yeah. And you're in the

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,640
break room and Stanley is microwaving a six-year-old. You're in the break room?

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,680
The camera. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot the camera's a character. The camera is.

96
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,500
The sound guy becomes a character in season 7. In a mockumentary style movie or show, the camera is the

97
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,760
audience member. The office plays itself. You just blowed my mind. Exactly. I blowed

166
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,080
I mean they make you sweat. Yeah.

167
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,960
I love wearing jeans.

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, jeans, that's wrong though. That's incorrect. I hate wearing any other...

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,240
The only thing you can wear in the summer is shorts or underwear.

170
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,660
These are cutoffs because I love wearing jeans so much. I wear pants... I like pants.

171
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,160
I don't like wearing shorts all that much. Yeah.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,720
My uh... I'm getting nervous because I got a pair of pants. My favorite pair.

173
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
the pair that fits me just right,

174
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,160
'cause I've been skating in them.

175
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
- We all have one of those pairs.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
- So they just fit you just completely,

177
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
just like a glove. - Completely.

178
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,880
The length, perfect. - Just perfect.

179
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,120
- The length is perfect. - Oh my God.

180
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
- I got them, you know why?

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,360
'Cause I got 'em-- - 24 inseam?

182
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,000
- I got them hemmed up to that, yeah.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
- Yeah, that makes sense.

184
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,640
- Yeah, I spent like, I think I spent like $45

185
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,700
getting all my pants fixed so that my tiny-ass legs

186
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,480
would fit them. - I honestly,

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
don't even try to explain it to me.

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,240
I have no idea how hemming works, what that is.

189
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,280
Any part of tailoring, it scares me.

190
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,720
where's it should all you know you have to do stuff go all you have to do is go in with

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,720
some cuffed and then just say like can you shrink them to this length

192
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
yeah but is he a wizard? that's the same that's like genetic modification you shouldn't be

193
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
doing that that's that's all that's gonna be like Jurassic Park your pants are gonna

194
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,160
go crazy on you because they put on pants are going crazy on me because I keep falling

195
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,280
down on my left side and then there's a hole that's the genetic modification so you shouldn't

196
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
tailor your pants they'll make you fall down big surprise you're getting fucking owned

197
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,280
yes the outline of my wallet so there's a whole starting in the form of my wallet

198
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,720
and i'm nervous that i'm going to go on the train one night my wallets gonna

199
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,160
fall out my pants

200
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,080
we don't have anything important in your wallet

201
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,200
what are you talking about? you don't have a driver's license

202
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,640
yeah i do. no you don't. i have a license

203
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,240
i have all my debit cards, i have my social security card in here. that's a bad idea

204
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,040
yeah why do you have that in there? what's wrong with you? i have my blood donor card

205
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,560
i have my registered voter in new hampshire card

206
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,960
None of that is important except for the only thing you have in there shouldn't be in there.

207
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay, you know what? Then I'll just leave this in the office.

208
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,560
That's actually a better place for it than in your fucking wallet.

209
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah. What else do I have in my wallet?

210
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Especially as a guy, you leave your card at every other bar you go to.

211
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,960
One day you're gonna go to the hospital, they're gonna use your social security.

212
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,560
That's not true anymore. I don't leave my debit card at bars anymore.

213
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,060
You're gonna use your social security card and you're gonna leave it there and then you're gonna call.

214
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,060
I memorized it too, so I don't need it.

215
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,960
Can you put my social security card in an Uber?

216
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
You still need it.

217
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
029...

218
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:37,080
It ain't 029. It's 029 because it's Massachusetts. What? Is that how social security numbers

219
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,800
work? I thought it was just a count. Because my mom has the same one. I think they just

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,640
count every guy that's born. My mom has 029 also. They just do it in order. My mom's social

221
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:51,480
security number is 02960112. How does yours start with, it doesn't start with two numbers

222
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,600
not three? No, it's. Look what I found the other day though. Oh sick. I finally found.

223
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I've been paying them some money lately, some free money.

224
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
I haven't been to the gym in a minute.

225
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,560
- Yeah. - And I've just been--

226
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,000
- I've been paying them, I've been paying--

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,280
- I'm too lazy to cancel it.

228
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,520
- Yeah, it happened to me.

229
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,440
I've been paying them since 2017.

230
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,080
- The thing about that, the Planet Fitness

231
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,640
that's near the train station, that's a bathroom.

232
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,480
- Yeah, that is a serious bathroom.

233
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,600
- So I'm gonna keep paying for that forever,

234
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,720
whether I go or not. - It's a great bathroom.

235
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,080
- 'Cause that's the bathroom that's right next

236
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,260
to the train station that I get off

237
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,360
when I have a longer walk home when I need to pee.

238
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,860
Planet Fitness is a is there's so many of them. It's a great bathroom subscription

239
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,460
because it's cheap. It's like you pay pay $24 a month. You can go to any Planet

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,920

241
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,160
Planet Fitness app. So I've been paying for the black card for I think five

242
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,040
years. That is some celebrity ass bullshit. Yep. I have a celebrity ass life.

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,160
God damn that's awesome. I've been paying for the black card. Let me tell you

244
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,960

249
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,360
Can the guests be bathroom guests only?

250
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Yes.

251
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360

So I get a guest and then what else is in here? My account, my membership.

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,100
that looks up tattoo meanings, don't look up this one. It means that you actually like

spiders. It means you got bit by a spider. That's really terrifying. Yeah, it was an

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,500
best drinks ever. Yeah, or a zoo without 100 animals in it.

276
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Yeah, zoo without 100 animals.

277
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Oh, I can use the tanning bed at Planet Fitness.

278
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Whoa! They have a tanning bed?

279
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
They have a tanning bed. Have you seen Final Destination 3?

280
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Hydro massage.

281
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Hydro massage? Like the one in the mall that I never got to do?

282
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Use a total body enhancement.

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I want to enhance my total body.

284
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
My body totally.

285
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Use of any Planet Fitness worldwide.

286
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I think Planet Fitness might be

287
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
like, you mentioned Final Destination

288
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,220
there's a tanning bed kill in Final Destination, there's weightlifting,

289
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,980
there's a weightlifting death, there's a gymnastics death,

290
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,340
50% off, I think you should stay away from Planet Fitness in general.

291
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,060
50% off all selected drinks. That Final Destination is like,

292
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,420
it's dangerous to be healthy. I think five is the one with the

293
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,460
gymnastics one. Oh yeah, you're right. But yeah, no, in general, it's, I mean, I

294
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,740
guess the message of those movies, he's doing the cable pull downs.

295
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,580
Yeah, yeah, and it fucking yeah, and I that was so sick. Yeah, it's a great

296
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,740
kill, but when I was a kid, I was like why would they design a machine like

297
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,980
that? That's like so stupid to have like two things on hinges that can meet in

298
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,940
the middle and crush your head, but they just made up that machine. It doesn't

299
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,940
exist. Yeah, but why wouldn't you just do it like a that's that's what he

300
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,500
walked into walked into the gym and he saw that like he was like looking at all

301
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,620
the machines are taken. It was like that like just like the death machine. The

302
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,920
the Grim Reaper like sitting next to the family. I just finished using this one.

303
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah, I'm all done. Yeah, just finish my last set. Four of his friends have died.

304
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,820
Let me just wipe it down real quick. Four of his friends have died because a fly

305
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,520
landed on a window. Yeah, and the message of that movie is don't do stuff.

306
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah, it's a great. Well, no, you know what? Actually, I guess it's don't

307
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,920
survive a horrific disaster. Yeah, you should just die. Just die in the first

308
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,020
place. It's way better. It's way better to die on a roller coaster or in a giant

309
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,140
pile up or an airplane or a bridge or a bridge was one of the bridges one of

310
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,780
them. The bridge one's really good or a a race track. If don't never watch or

311
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,740
owns a race track one of them, they're all watch. They're all sitting watching

312
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,500
like NASCAR or something and the the car crashes and like the tire flies up and

313
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,900
and well, I'm a tire yeah. There's a tire. I mean a bunch a bunch of people

314
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,860
die like all the other ones movies. I could with this doctor pepper. I can

316
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,900

317
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,340
subscriptions are we all paying for? I pay for let's see I pay for a bunch of

318
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,220
streaming services. I think, but the streaming services are nice because

319
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,700
actually to have to keep subscriptions. Yeah, the streaming services are

320
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,940
perfect, because you split that between you, your girlfriend and your

321
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,780
girlfriend's dad. Yeah, those are yeah, so it's only comes out to a dollar

364
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,960
suffering it's yeah beautiful to me um yeah when I was like in the third grade

365
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,440
it was like I was supposed to go on a field trip that I really wanted to go to

366
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,800
and it started raining and then I skip my mom heard me because I saw the rain I

367

went I hate you God whoa damn yeah you're going to hell for sure that's

368
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,880
fucking you can't say that I you said I cuz I thought God controlled the weather

369
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:39,520
he does so yeah so I was right to say I used to God used to control the weather

370
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,160
other. Yeah, now I don't want to say who controls. It's yeah, they use harp

371
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:49,360
technology, cloud busting, first, that may be true, but you also, you, you,

372
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,800
you're, you're mad at God because you questioned his, his completely perfect

373
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,400
judgement and, and plan for your day. Yeah, you realise they're gonna die on

374
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,200
that field trip. Like he, the, everything that he does, he does for a reason. I

375
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,440
think, I think we are going to the Autobahn Society. We are going on a field

376
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,880
trip to the Satanist Church. Yeah you guys were yeah you were going to a rock concert.

377
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,040
You were going to go see Kiss and God stopped you. Yeah.

378
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,520
Because the Autobahn was sick. He saw there was a demon in that band. Which I it's not for there's no

379
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,440
reason why he's a demon other than his makeup. You know his tongue. Why are you

380
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,240
insinuating? I just want to get ahead of everybody saying calling me an anti-Semite.

381
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,880
what nobody was even thinking that yeah it's a demon who's Heim Witz

382
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,360
Gene Simmons Dean Simmons real name is Heim with his name is Chaim wits that's

383
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,600
fucking awesome yeah sure they should have gone by that name that's a lower

384
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,760
name than Gene Simmons yeah cooler we're gonna like be a debt like a demon big

385
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,000
tongue I'm having deja vu right now I think we've talked about all of this

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,600
before we've definitely talked about kiss yeah yeah we talked about how it's

387
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,240
that's so funny that they've just become businessmen.

388
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,440
- I always thought that Kiss,

389
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
you think that with a name like Kiss,

390
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,720
they would actually have big lips.

391
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,560
- Yeah.

392
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,400
- But they should have been called Lick.

393
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,240
- Lick, yeah.

394
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,060
- 'Cause they have big tongues.

395
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,900
- Lick or Face Paint.

396
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,240
- Yeah, exactly.

397
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,160
- The Rock and Roll Face Paint Team.

398
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,720
- All the bands should be just rock and roll.

399
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,960
- The Rock and Roll Face Paint Team.

400
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,960

- The American Rock and Roll Face Paint Team.

404
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,960
- America, listen, America's not getting beaten

405
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,120
for rock and roll and face pain. No yeah, okay, Japan might have I mean I don't

406
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,960
know Japan, totally has it over us in face paint. It's rock and roll face

407
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,300
paint. First of all, it has rock and roll. Japan has obviously I'm just

408
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,320
correcting faces face pain is a separate. It's a separate event has

409
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,600
better rock abilities than the USA. They do have a you seen Scott pilgrim

410
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,960
versus the world. No, it's a Japanese move. I did see that actually about

411
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,880
rock. I forgot actually look at it as it's a rock and roll move. It's more

412
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,360
about punk rock more about it having a it's more about having a girlfriend.

413
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,800
actually fucking so true yeah yeah guys that movie is about having a girlfriend

464
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,160
wage workers are just all they do is smoke smoke cigarettes and go to the

465
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,680
bathroom. Yeah, their attitude is foul. That's what I did when I worked minimum

466
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,900
wage. Yeah, but then you become a real man, a real job. The only thing more

467
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,020
foul than a minimum wage workers attitude is their breath from all those

468
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,760
that is actually dark. Yeah, that they blast yeah, stop blasting those darts

469
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,520
not blasting darts. I'll be fucking bad for you. Yeah, you realize that you need

470
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,880
to be working the whole time. You can't take a five minute break every hour. Do

471
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,840
you not fucking realize those sticks are completely cancerous? I'm not yeah.

472
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,020
First of all, we're not paying you to kill yourself with cigarettes.

473
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,500
Paying you to kill yourself at my whim.

474
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah, exactly.

475
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
I'm waiting for you to jump off of my building through psychological torture.

476
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah, you should be breaking your back.

477
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,100
I'm paying you to run as fast as you can in the forest and then I try to catch you.

478
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,700
I'm not paying for you to smoke.

479
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,700
Exactly.

480
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,100
You know what you should be doing is you should be obeying my order when I order a filet-o-fish

481
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,660
and then I hand it back to you and say, "Can you freshen this up?"

482
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,980
You should know what that means and you should do it.

483
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,740
And here's a hack.

484
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,980
If you go to McDonald's and say, "Can I have that fish filet made fresh?"

485
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,980
They have to do it.

486
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
Yeah.

487
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Can you freshen this up?

488
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Yep.

489
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,980
You order it first and then they fresh it.

490
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Yeah, they freshen it after.

491
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
They put it in the fresher.

492
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,620
They get a new one out of the freezer.

493
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,780
You could order it and you get it and it's fresh.

494
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,780
That's too easy.

495
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,780
You have to order it.

496
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
You have to see it.

497
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,780
Also, you pay extra for a fresh one.

498
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,500
That's why you wait until they give it to you to ask.

499
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,700
Not enough people order the filet of fish so they sit under the heat lamp all day.

500
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
That's true.

501
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
That's an actual true fact.

502
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Is that true?

503
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
The fresh ones though.

504
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
I'm checking on crack right now.

505
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,460
The fresh ones sit under a cold lamp, which is how they keep fresh,

506
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
because it's like the ocean.

507
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
What is?

508
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,180
The fresh fish, the fresh Filet-O-Fish they keep in a separate room and

509
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
they're under a cold lamp.

510
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
It's a, yeah.

511
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Oh.

512
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,180
It's like it simulates the ocean water.

513
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
It's a big metal room.

514
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,180
To keep it as cold as possible.

515
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
Yeah.

516
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Yeah.

517
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,180
Because the ocean is really cold.

518
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
It's a room filled with salt water.

519
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
That's actually good.

520
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
That preserves stuff.

521
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
And you say, can you freshen this up?

522
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,180
And they dip it in.

523
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,100
Do you guys, I don't understand why we have so much technology,

524
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,340
kinds of phones every kind of brand of phone right why different colors

525
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,860
iPhone and a thousand different colors that's a different conversation for a

526
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,680
different day but I am with you you can have 80 different cars yeah right

527
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,180
different colors of different colors of cars every different kind of car can

528
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,180
have up to four colors many colors even more than four you can have a house

529
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,060
built in a day painted any color okay you can have a television that has its

530
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,900
three shows any color on the screen nowadays they could have built room in

531
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,980
one day there they easily could have been 3d printed. I would have been read you

532
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,140
can 3d print something the they have you can actually buy items on fortnight

533
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,060
cosmetic items. You have all this technology yeah, but we can't turn

534
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,380
fucking ocean water into fresh water.

535
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,620
And how am I supposed to believe that well, it's all you can do all you have

536
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,740
to do everything out because they because they because they have you just

537
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,420
boil it. No, you can you you drink the ocean water and then you pee it out and

538
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,140
then they use the pita water thing that's smart yeah you're smartest fuck Cameron

539
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,540
that's actually really I mean that's how they have a pita water machine we just

540
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,300
drink ocean water why what is it done it what but what about the salt is gonna

541
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,860
fish make it salty because they don't want in that they don't fish shit salt

542
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:59,220
bitch shit and piss all fish shit water and fish salt do fish piss in prehistoric

543
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,420
times before humans fish would would would swim up to the shore and they would

544
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,480
to poop on to out of the water because I didn't want to contaminate their walk

545
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,620
and that's how they were smarter back then they will know so but then humans

546
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,060
came around humans love drinking water. Okay, the fish saw that happen. They go

547
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,540
oh man the humans are going to drink this whole ocean. If we don't do

548
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,420
something about it, we just better start pooping and shitting in here and

549
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,780
salting it that was smart of them. It was fresh back then and then they salted

550
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,620
it. Yeah, because if somebody if some fucking shark started sipping my house,

551
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,740
yeah, I'd probably shit on it. I'd shit in my house. So he didn't want to sip it.

552
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,860
- If somebody tried to eat my bed,

553
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,380
I'd take a shit in it, basically.

554
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,460
- That is a pretty easy way to deter anybody

555
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,380
from taking something.

556
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,140
- If someone tried to touch my pants,

557
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,980
I'll take a shit.

558
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,820
- Yeah.

559
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,640
- Right in my pants.

560
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,060
- I mean, if somebody's trying to mug you,

561
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,780
if you shit on your wallet,

562
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,600
- Yeah.

563
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,440
- They're not gonna take it.

564
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,860
- That's why I keep a piece of crap in my wallet.

565
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,820
- Yeah.

566
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,660
- And I reach into my pants like it's a gun

567
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,940
to pull the crap out whenever somebody's testing me.

568
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,060
- Testing me, yeah.

569
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,020
- I get tested every day on these streets.

570
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,860
- Yeah.

571
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
- I like being tested 'cause I always pass

572
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,500
with flying colors. I hate being tested because I got a learning disability.

573
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,800
That's really bad.

574
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,880
Yesterday I was walking to go get some lunch and this guy started peeing on the

575
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,540
street

576
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,000
uh... into onto a building and it really made me laugh because his friend

577
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,920
started walking away

578
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,540
and he like knocked on people's cars and was going like

579
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,080
"Oh no, oh no,

580
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,900
ladies and gentlemen of Ridgewood,

581
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,980
there is a black man with his penis out right there!"

582
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,420
And he's like trying to get people to look at his friend's penis.

583
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Made me laugh.

584
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
That's funny.

585
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,380
And I caught a little bit of a sneak peek.

586
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,380
Wow.

587
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,220
I walked up with a magnifying glass.

588
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,220
I said, "Hello!"

589
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,220
I said, "Hi, you're giving me a micro wood?"

590
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
My wood is...

591
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,460
But no, do you know what I mean about the micro wood?

592
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,460
So, whoa, you scratch your mustache under the mic.

593
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,660
That's the loudest thing I've ever heard.

594
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,660
Holy shit.

595
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,100
Oh, that's a horrible noise.

596
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Why does it...

597
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,220
I love how many people pee on the street in New York.

598
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
I do.

599
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
It's a free show every day.

600
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,300
I love walking.

601
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,180
It's very funny to me.

602
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,220
People will pee on cars and stuff.

603
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,220
It's sick.

604
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Oh yeah, that's my mood.

605
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,940
If I'm drunk and I need to pee, I'll pee into somebody's wheel well.

606
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,060
Yeah, that's what I see people doing sometimes on the street.

607
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,380
Because nobody's even going to notice.

608
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,260
If I have to, like if I'm walking down the street, like say I'm walking in like, I don't

609
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,700
know, you know that spot?

610
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,660
Pat got mad at me one time for peeing on a Ferrari.

611
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Do you remember that?

612
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
No.

613
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

uh... you know what

624
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,720
usually if one patrick is only looking at his phone

625
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,900
that's the best not i think that

626
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,660

we're talking about water and it made me thirsty yeah you could have got water

631
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,100

633
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,180

634
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,500
real on it you get one or two retakes. That's fucking stupid. And it tells everybody that if you do a retake.

635
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,520
You don't have to be the name of the thing. Yes you do. Uh-uh. Oh wait so I need to be I need.

It's cool everybody should get on be real. Yeah it sounds like a cool app. It's

639
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,960
probably going to be the next Instagram or Snapchat. I think it is. Yeah, it's a

640
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,060
very important for for us as as 23, 24, and 25 year old guys to get on the next

641
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,380
Snapchat. Yeah. That's the big thing that Pat should be focusing on. It's not.

Chocolate is sprinkled in.

695
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,380

00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:56,100
If you're wearing a coat please take the coat off it's going to make the plane too warm.

You did.

748
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,020
Yeah.

749
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,180
You were in a really bad mood and then you had a Hennessy and then you were in a great mood the

750
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,900
rest of the time.

751
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,380
Yep.

752
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,740
It really puts you in the zone.

753
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,060
Yeah.

754
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,340
I wasn't in that bad of a mood.

755
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,140
That was maybe the--

756
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,860
You were cranky.

757
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,420
The best--

758
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,380
Yeah, I was tired.

759
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,980
That was the best airport food.

760
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,180
He was really, really cranky.

761
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,580
He was really cranky.

762
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,300
It was the most--

763
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,140
- No, I was cranky in LA.

764
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,900
- You were cranky twice on that entire trip.

765
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,740
- You were insanely cranky at that airport.

766
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,460
I'm sorry, I have to side with Caleb here.

767
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,900
- You were cranky at Chili's,

768
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,740
and you ordered Hennessey, and it fixed you.

769
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,580
- Yeah, it did.

770
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,400
- It's a magic potion, dude.

771
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,240
Hennessey's amazing.

772
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,380
- Which airport was it when we got those sandwiches?

773
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,140
That was the best airport meal I've ever had.

774
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,980
- What sandwiches?

775
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,280
- Oh, that was LAX.

776
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,220
- Was that LAX?

777
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
- Yeah.

778
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,620
- Was that place called Lemonade?

779
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,460
- Yeah.

780
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,500
- I was like, oh, this place is gonna suck.

781
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,340
- No, it was so good.

782
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,180
- It was so good.

783
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,540
- That miso short rib.

784
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,460
- It was insane.

785
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,300
- Yeah.

786
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,860
- No, that was the airport I was cranky at

787
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,700
because I lost my--

788
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,520
- Oh yeah?

789
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,580
- Yeah, I lost my bag. - That was the cranky one.

790
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,420
- No.

791
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,240
- He was cranky at Chili's?

792
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,080
- I don't remember if he was cranky at Chili's.

793
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,920
- I was not cranky at Chili's.

794
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,100
- He was, I tried to buy him a soda,

795
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,700
he got so mad that the soda machine wouldn't take his card.

796
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,020
And I tried to buy him one.

797
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,860
- Oh.

798
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,920
- And he's like, "No, I don't even want it."

799
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,580
- It's 'cause I didn't have caffeine yet.

800
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,420
- Cranky?

801
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,740
- Yeah, I think I might've been cranky.

802
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,300
I was trying to buy a Rockstar Zero.

803
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
He was cranky.

804
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
I didn't get cranky even one time.

805
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,300
I will fess up to that.

806
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,900
I was completely fine.

807
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
I was cranky.

808
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
I was happy and smiley the whole time.

809
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,900
I have a cranky radar.

810
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,020
In LA I was upset because I lost my camera bag.

811
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Oh yeah.

812
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,220
I had all my camera stuff.

00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
the country.

820
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100

821
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,540

823
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,820
wrap. You guys yeah I had the hand wrap on yeah I did get cranky because they they

824
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,540
have to check if you wrap your hand up like I had a I got a hand injury and if

825
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,100
you have your hand wrapped up TSA has to check it because I could have snuck a

826
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,940
bomb in. It could have been a bomb wrap. You could have had a you could have had a

827
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,980
demon hand. I took the wrap off and then like. No wrap allowed. I took the wrap off.

828
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,740
- You could have had under the,

829
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,380
well yeah, what they're expecting is you take the wrap off

830
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,700
and like, you know. - There's a little bomb.

831
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,740
- Well it's like, no, it's like Hellboy's hand.

832
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,580
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And it's like,

833
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,900
oh you can't take that on the plane.

834
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,060
- Yeah. - You can't be on the plane

835
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
if you're half demon.

836
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,500
- Or they recognize your hand, they say,

837
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,300
"Sir, I've seen those hands before,

838
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,860
"those are registered as deadly weapons."

839
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,940
- Dude, what they do-- - You cannot bring those

840
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,780
on a plane. - What they do when that happens

841
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,300
is like, 'cause you have the hand wrap on,

842
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,540
they take like a little like,

843
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,620
I don't even know what it is,

844
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,860
it's like a little piece of paper

845
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,600
and they touch like different parts of your hand

846
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,580
and look at you and go like, what did you do?

847
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,740
- They just make it all up.

848
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,780
- Yeah, no, it's a fucking performance.

849
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,780
- They're doing chiropractic to everybody.

850
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,180
- It's a victory lap that they got the TSA created

851
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,780
so that we can all become sheep and go into the little--

852
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,100
- Oh my God, political Patrick, I'm loving it.

853
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,500
- I'm being divisive as hell.

854
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,340
- So cool.

855
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,340
- It's for people who are too stupid to work McDonald's.

856
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,140
And they're like, no, we have a job for you.

857
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,460
Like, no, all you have to do,

858
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,740
you just have to touch their in with piece of paper and ask what did you do

859
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,780
it's that was it you don't remember any orders. Okay, you don't remember the

and all that fucking rock nonsense oh my god imagine on May 10th he said the

920
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:04,160
black alien project is only 43% complete damn that's scary as fuck

921
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,280
Imagine that's your dad.

922
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,560
Project Evolution.

923
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
I don't think he can come.

924
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,560
44% as of May 24th.

925
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,560
He can come more than a normal person.

926
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,160
Probably both of his balls are split 8 times.

927
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,960
No, he has 4 balls, yeah.

928
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,960
But they work.

929
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,960
It's more come.

930
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,960
No, it's less come.

931
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,480
Imagine that's your dad and you have a friend over for a freaking play date.

932
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
And he scares them.

933
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
And he scares them, yeah.

934
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,000
Wait, what is he doing here?

935
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,520
What is he going to do with himself?

936
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,320
I want to see what happens when he gets to 100.

937
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,640
I need to see 100%.

938
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,400
I do not want to see 100% on I'm scared. You're scared of this. I

939
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
think 100% might be able to kill you through the screen. I think you might

940
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,760
get telekinesis for the most part until the last maybe three years people with

941
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,720
face tattoos were mostly bad people. Yeah, yeah, I think if you I've known

942
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,040
quite a few people. I think I think it was all not so good. Yeah, I think it's

943
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,640
still I think it's probably people with face tattoos are still bad people, but

944
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,400
now they're bad people and that they're very annoying. Definitely. It's

945
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,760
yeah yeah the caption of this picture of the black alias he's doing like a Rob

I know exactly who it is and he has looked at multiple shirts of mine and

973
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,160
just gone what band is that yeah you know you know you know man

974
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,180
Varg the black metal guy yeah yeah, so you know his his like original like

975
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,640
stage name or whatever was count Grishnak, which is named after an orc

976
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,920
from Lord of the Rings. It really yeah is named after an orc from Lord of the

977
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,520
Rings Grishnak and I was like rereading Lord of the Rings a year or two ago and

978
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,000
like I got to the part with Grishnak and Grishnak. All the only thing that

979
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,920
Grishnak does in the book is he shows up and like kidnap some of the hobbits

980
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,680
and then he gets run over by a horse like two pages later. That's all that

981
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,280
that's the end of yeah and he's like damn that's sick as fuck. I'm gonna be evil

982
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:54,280
like this guy. Dude it's so fucking funny like the like Varg's whole like

983
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,400
trajectory and just believing Lord of the Rings. That's what's funny. Well you

984
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,320
could yeah it's also because he started out being like I want to be the evil

985
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,040
orc and then later he matured and he's like actually I'm a wizard. Yeah, yeah,

986
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,880
I'm not an orc anymore. I'm more like he's jumping around. Yeah, I it's funny

987
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,120
that I feel like I've known I've seen Varg get old because like I thought he

988
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,540
funny when I was 14. Yeah. And now he's just. He's a prime guy to think is really

989
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,620
funny when you're 14. Yeah exactly. Oh yeah dude. Like I mean it's fucking like

990
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,940
hearing like Dunkelheit or whatever and being like. I've literally never heard

991
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:29,700
one of his songs. Oh really? Yeah never. Dunkelheit's a sick song. You're basically

992
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,780
the biggest racist in the entire universe. Yeah he's got good music. He does have

993
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,100
good music. I was listening to fucking MC front a lot okay. Yeah. Yeah MC Chris.

994
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:45,900
to Jake Novak. And Aesop Rock. Okay. Yeah. I mean they have. Aesop Rock and Jon Bernal.

995
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Real rap. That's like the same level as Varg's stuff. Whereas Varg is writing about Lord

996
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,940
of the Rings and they're doing stuff about Star Wars. Yeah. It's the exact same thing.

997
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:58,180
Exactly. Have you guys ever seen the video of Aesop Rock meeting Aesop Rocky? No. And

998
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,380
Aesop Rocky clearly has no idea who Aesop Rock is and he's like with him and he's like

999
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:08,140
I'm with the first ASAP Rocky and he's like okay it's so awesome

1000
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,900
damn that's tight linked up they linked up and never seen that I never that's

1001
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:20,180
like imagine there was a guy named yeah it would be a track Patek do Dan and he's

1002
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,900
a podcaster who's not as successful as you are or actually more successful and

1003
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:29,500
you're saying ASAP ASAP rock is more success is less successful okay then ASAP

1004
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,980
Rocky well he's successful in the underground he's successful and what

1005
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,660
he's actually you know okay he's more successful with getting a message I

1006
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:43,140
agree he's intellectually and message misogycally more successful okay and

1007
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,980
he's got a philosophical tent tent bent it's a tent it's a bent it's a tent a

1008
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,540
bent it's a philosophical neurological miracle who's okay you would actually be

1009
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:57,500
a sub rock yeah mm-hmm yeah that guy's a fucking beast man ace up rock yeah a

1010
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,380
I saw Brock as sick. I only know his music from the Tony Hawk games. There's a toad and a

1011
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:07,580
road with a frog and a boat. I saw a frog. Now you're doing a different guy. That's not

1012
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:13,300
how he sounds. That's Vinny Paz. Yeah. That's my impression of one of my uncles. I saw Brock

1013
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:20,300
kind of sound a deaf, which is like, and also deaf like D E F as well. Yeah. Very successful.

1014
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:25,860
He rhymes successful with successful on that song. Yeah. He's a man. He's great. I straight

1015
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,940
up the only songs I know are no jumper cables and the one he did with the

1016
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:33,540
Mountain Goats guy that the album he did with tobaccos it's pretty no jumper we

1017
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,980
should go on no jumper yeah I think we should I've been thinking of that do you

1018
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:44,940
think we could we could I think if if you got a face tattoo and like I think

1019
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,980
we could probably convince Adam 22 that you're like some up-and-coming like

1020
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,780
rapper you actually think I have skill like that you're getting out of a double

1021
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:59,300
cup right now. That is true. Yeah. Yeah. I think that that would I think that

1022
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:04,380
would work. Yeah. And I think that may be a jumper bro. We can do it. Damn. I

1023
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,420
don't think he wants anyone to talk about that. Okay. The first thing that

1024
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,100
comes up when you Google his name, dude. That's true. You can do. I will do it

00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,760
30 seconds what the fuck?

1051
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,760

00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,760
What the hell dude?

1053
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,760
We need to include the "let me see your butt" thing in the beginning as well.

1054
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
Yeah, that's the producer tag.

1055
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
I think maybe

1056
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,760
we

1057
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,760
I don't know.

1058
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
I think there's a couple songs that we've done on here that I think we should

1059
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,760
turn into real songs.

1060
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,760
Eight Legged Bug.

1061
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,760
There's been a million probably but

1062
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,760
Eight Legged Bug definitely.

1063
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,760
I think we really need to get into the studio with somebody

1064
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,100
- Like, "Eight Legged Bug" or this song.

1065
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,100
- Yeah, if anyone can get us some studio time.

1066
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,940
- Song I've been writing,

1067
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,440
"Don't Text Me While I'm Skeetin'".

1068
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,280
- I love my birthday.

1069
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,100

- Yo, motherfucker, yo.

1073
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,440
- Yo, motherfucker, yo.

00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,980
- And like, that's it.

1125
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,700
- Well, he gets 40 hours in, but it's only within three days.

1126
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,180
- Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

1127
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,220
I'm a good kudos to him.

1128
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,060
I couldn't do that.

1129
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:54,100
- He works at Home Depot and the airport.

1130
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,620
- He's working 14 hour shifts and getting--

1131
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,620
Home Depot in the airport.

1132
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,620
And the airport.

1133
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,060
But it's the Home Depot that's in the airport.

1134
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,740
It's for people who want to buy like tools or 2x4s.

1135
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,980
He's working 14 hour shifts at Home Depot?

1136
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
In the airport.

1137
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:07,980
In the airport.

1138
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,500
He's a pilot and Home Depot in the airport.

1139
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,500
Okay.

1140
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,620
He's got no time to ski.

1141
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,540
Well, because they have timed bathroom breaks.

1142
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,540
Yeah.

1143
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,540
So he can't go ski in the bathroom.

1144
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,540
No.

1145
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,540
Because he takes them, honestly, he takes them.

1146
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,540
They have seat detectors.

1147
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:25,020
The saddest part of the song is he's single.

1148
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:28,460
Really well, so why doesn't he answer when people are texting him then cuz like

1149
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,340
maybe one of these friends well, it's like a sad. It's one of those songs

1150
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,340
where it's one of those songs where it's like

1151
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:38,400
Where it's like this the music shows a rainbow the lyrics a depressed skull yep

1152
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,480
And it could be maybe a two-part song like the art of storytelling one and two

1153
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,160
And the second part could be about how he starts doing nofap

1154
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,260
It's my weekend the second one could be like a whole nofap song don't

1155
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:59,460
We've been needing a nofap anthem for quite some yeah, yeah, well, I think of R&B single about jacking off

1156
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:04,380

Yeah, yeah, and then I put that body on me I love my son on me

1158
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,100
I love myself too much to jack off. It could be like one of the parts of it. It's about self-love

1159
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:21,400
Put your I think that's something that the no jumper guys would really like
