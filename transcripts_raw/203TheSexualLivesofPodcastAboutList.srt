1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,240
- Is that a glass of whiskey you got there, Caleb?

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,560
- Where we started?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,540
A glass of, which one?

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,760
You think this is whiskey?

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,600
- I thought it was.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,320
Maybe it's just the color of the glass.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,360
- 'Cause I have a beautiful cup that my wife buys

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,120
that doesn't hold any amount of liquid.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,960
This is our larger cup, guys.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,200
- This glass has a belly on it.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,360
- That looks like it gives you,

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,840
it looks like one of those things

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,840
that later she's gonna throw out

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
because she saw that there's a lead poisoning recall

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,040
on that specific cup.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,880
- It looks like this happened with me

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,080
and my girlfriend multiple times.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,720
She buys some shit and then is like,

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,920
"Oh yeah, it has lead in this."

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
- Dude, look, I have a couple of cups here on my desk.

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,640
Look at the coffee cups that I have in my house.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,480
- Yeah.

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,200
Oh, no way that doesn't have lead paint in it, dude.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
No fucking shot that that doesn't have lead paint.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
- What is this, bro?

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,040
feel like some kind of emperor drinking out of this cup.

28
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Oh yeah, this cup gets skinny at the bottom.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
You look...

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Well, except for this one, buddy, this is my cup that I brought from home.

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,040
Check this out. This is the one I'm drinking in right now.

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Porsche.

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Dang.

34
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
That one also is skinny at the bottom.

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Porsche cup.

36
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
Damn.

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
Well, it goes fat and then it gets skinny.

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yeah, but it's...

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,040
This is a mug. This is a cup that... a travel mug that my grandpa...

40
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Looks like a mug.

41
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
My grandpa walked in, didn't buy a Porsche, and got a mug.

42
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
That's cool. That's a cool thing to do.

43
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Yeah.

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
That's cooler than getting the Porsche, I think.

45
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,780
I think way cooler, dude. Yeah. He's like a social engineer.

46
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,440
Did I ever tell you about the time he went into a like an electronic store

47
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,120
on Christmas Eve and they were having like a Christmas Eve party

48
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,880
and he was trying to buy a radio for his car and they were having like

49
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,920
like an employee's only Christmas Eve party.

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,140
They had like a full food spread in like the office.

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,040
And he was he just walked in and started eating like all of the food in this

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,320
at this office party.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,160
And then the guy was like, hey, can I help you?

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,040
And he was like, yeah, I was looking for a radio,

55
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
but I don't think I want to buy one here.

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,440
And they just left.

57
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
He didn't even buy anything.

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
He just stole their food.

59
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Well, that's beast.

60
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,400
He is a beast.

61
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,840
Guys, as you can tell, we're not on the set today.

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
We are in a biblical situation.

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,600
We're in a biblical in two ways.

64
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,320
We've been sinned against by Pierce Campion for stealing our cameras.

65
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,080
And then also every single one.

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,960
And then God tried to smite him with a flash flood

67
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,860
and ended up doing collateral damage to the rest of New York City.

68
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,920
See, I'm here in our you can see our beautiful, beautiful studio

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,060
here in Ridgewood, Queens.

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,960
I have a I have a little coffee story I'd like to like to tell you guys.

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,420
I've never wanted to hear something more.

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah. Are you excited for my new?

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,020
I'm really sorry.

74
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
Yeah, it's going for Patrick.

75
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,220
It's about coffee.

76
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,160
Oh, my God.

77
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
Wait, let me cut you guys.

78
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
I'm kind of cozy.

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, can I get a blanket? Yeah.

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,720
With this rainy ass day?

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,960
You see me with my new little coffee?

82
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,160
Yep. I see you.

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,440
OK. Doesn't look so new.

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
It looks like you've been drinking it for a

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,640
minute.

86
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,240
I had to get a new one at the store

87
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,940
because I we were texting each

88
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,180
other about not having the cameras

89
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
still.

90
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,280
And when I was going

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,000
to put the lid on,

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
I think there was a little bit of pent

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,880
up rage in me.

94
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,420
I squeezed the cup so hard

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,960
that the side of the thing cracked and it squirted all over the coffee store.

96
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,560
And I had to get, the guy gave me a new coffee.

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Thankfully.

98
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
That's not right.

99
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,560
He shouldn't be giving you, that's your fault.

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
That was my fault.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,600
That was my fault.

102
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,640
That was not a brand new coffee shop.

103
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,560
How do you squeeze a coffee enough that it breaks?

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,520
I was, I was, I was furious.

105
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,720
I was furious with impotent rage.

106
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Once you start hitting the chocolate.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah.

108
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,720
Impotent rage for sure.

109
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah.

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Plus I have been getting it.

111
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You'll feel that.

112
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Kind of pent up.

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That'll do it to you.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Bro, I have it.

115
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That'll do it to you, bro.

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I haven't been getting it at home.

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The wife is not even giving up

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
the thang, the stang.

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If I don't get it twice a day, I grab a

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
beer can and I put like five holes

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
in it for every finger.

122
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You got the sharp fingers going on?

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,660
- How do you put the holes in it?

125
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,940
- Let's talk about our sex lives this episode.

126
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,620
- Well you don't, doesn't squish the can

127
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,020
and just puts holes in?

128
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,580
- No, because that's how fast it's going.

129
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,420
- Is it a--

130
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,240
- It's like a--

131
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,080
- It's puncturing them instantly

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,500
and then I can play it like a, like a, some kind of flute.

133
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,820
- We're gonna get down and dirty with it this episode.

134
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,860
We're getting, now we're gonna talk completely about,

135
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,900
in graphic detail about our sex lives.

136
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,260
- You guys wanna hear a funny story

137
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,780
that I don't think I ever told before that,

138
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,740
about, that's actually, I was thinking about this morning

139
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
since we said we were gonna do a remote,

140
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,740
I was thinking about how we used to do remote all the time.

141
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:55,740
I was thinking about how we used to do remote all the time back during COVID.

142
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:05,740
And I remembered, that was so back then, that was when I was living with my mom and I was living in my mom's basement and basically an actual dungeon.

143
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:12,380
And there's no insulation at all whatsoever between it was literally like I looked up

144
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,020
and I saw the floorboards.

145
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,260
I remember that place.

146
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,420
So everybody could hear everything everywhere.

147
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,900
And I remember we were and my mom's a teacher for those people who don't know.

148
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,940
And this is during COVID.

149
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,220
So she's doing she's a fifth grade teacher and she does doing remote teaching over zoom.

150
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,800
I remember really vividly that the reason I started having to go sit in her car to record

151
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
some of the episodes.

152
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I forgot about that.

153
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,160
I saw that too because she came up to me one night after we recorded and I remember it

154
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,640
was the episode where Caleb told the story, maybe it was the second time he told the story,

155
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,520
but the story about how his like family friend or something was a little kid and they came

156
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
home and the kid had his arm up the dog's ass up to the elbow.

157
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
Oh yeah, the great name.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,160
my mom after King Lobster's, I'm obviously

159
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,640
you can't record in here anymore if you're going to be yelling about kids,

160
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,600
or some dogs.

161
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,920
Because my fifth graders can hear you.

162
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,080
That was such a funny fucking time of our, that was so crazy.

163
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
COVID was crazy.

164
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,280
I was just reminiscing about that this morning when I was thinking, wow, back to,

165
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,920
back to Roma.

166
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Now my girlfriend's in the other room, I can, yeah, I can yell about this stuff.

167
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,040
she'll hear her boss. She likes it. Yeah. I had similar because I like went through that

168
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,400
breakup then I had to move back in. I had to move in with my sister and her ex one day,

169
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,520
I think we were recording late at night one time and he had to work like five in the morning,

170
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,920
something like that. And he woke up to me doing Gilbert Gottfried voice and was so mad he wanted

171
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
to kick me out of there.

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
- Yeah, he wanted to get you out of there.

173
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,040
- That's a pretty bad one to wake up to.

174
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,320
- You're hearing, like the other room,

175
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,520
you're hearing like, "Sucking and fucking

176
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,080
"and eating poop and."

177
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,820
- Yeah, that would drive me crazy, I think.

178
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,200
But do you think it'd be worse

179
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,120
if it was actually Gilbert Gottfried?

180
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
If he was like your Craigslist roommate?

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
- Are you kidding me?

182
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,680
- That would be--

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
- He's your Craigslist roommate 'cause he's frugal.

184
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,800
And he's doing voiceover for the new Affleck show.

185
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,780
- Have you ever met somebody from,

186
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,220
like that you've never met before,

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,020
maybe somebody from online or somebody,

188
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,980
and then you meet them

189
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,140
and they do have an insanely grating voice.

190
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
- Yeah.

191
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,620
- Everybody online has a grating voice.

192
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,460
That's the reason they go online.

193
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,660
- Listen to me, listen to how I talk.

194
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,340
- That's how you, that's the reason you type

195
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,180
instead of talk to the people around you.

196
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,620
- Fishing for compliments much?

197
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,660
Look at him.

198
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,460
Yeah, your mustache looks good too.

199
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,360
I wanna have fucking sex with you today.

200
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,500
I am feeling very, very cozy.

201
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,740
- Me too.

202
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,180
I just wanna sit around and I wanna watch a bigger guy,

203
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
a guy who's four inches taller than me

204
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,700
play LA Noire for a couple hours.

205
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,100
That's what I wanna do.

206
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,220
- I definitely have, after this,

207
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
I'm gonna get in the blanket.

208
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,180
- Yeah, I texted Caleb and said the same.

209
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,340
I said, "This weather make me wanna eat some good soup

210
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
"and watch a spoopy movie."

211
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,820
- And then I said, 'cause you text me something like this

212
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,620
pretty much every day, and I responded, 'cause I--

213
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,660
- Can you read the text I sent you before that?

214
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah, hold on.

215
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,060
But I responded and I said, "/SRS?"

216
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,440
And I was SRS.

217
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,620
But why didn't you tell me that?

218
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,260
'Cause I wanted to have a conversation about

219
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,980
what soup we would eat.

220
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,820
I was trying to set up back here

221
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,100
so that it wouldn't be on my computer all episode.

222
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,780
Too busy to send one text?

223
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,140
It was really hectic over here.

224
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,740
Okay, so here's what he said before,

225
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,780
"This weather literally makes me want to eat good soup

226
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,580
and watch a scary movie popcorn emoji."

227
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,180
Before this, he said, "Bruh, what did I eat last night?

228
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,140
My diarara smells so bad, skull laughing,

229
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,360
crying laughing emoji.

230
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,820
- Diarara.

231
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,980
- Diarara.

232
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,660
And then before that, I said, "Bubes or badonkadonks?"

233
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,260
And he said, "Bro her hair."

234
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,500
(laughing)

235
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,740
- That's the best one.

236
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,060
(laughing)

237
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,900
- Bro her hair.

238
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
- That's the best one I've ever picked up.

239
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,560
- Easily.

240
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,400
(laughing)

241
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,980
- Bro I don't think about boobs or butts, dude.

242
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,400
I think about a woman's hair.

243
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,140
Oh my God, her makeup is so amazing right now.

244
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,980
And then before that...

245
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,740
You know why I text you guys that stuff?

246
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,780
Because we are co-workers.

247
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,540
Spoopy season is a month away.

248
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,700
I hate you.

249
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,620
We, OK, so the funniest thing about

250
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,420
that, my mindset when I text

251
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,580
this stuff is that we are co-workers.

252
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,860
And imagine getting like, imagine you work at a restaurant, right?

253
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,660
And you're like, you give...

254
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,780
We basically work at a restaurant.

255
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Yeah, pretty much. This is a restaurant that I hear...

256
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,900
Sorry, here's another one.

257
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,340
The Room is like the best worst movie of all time.

258
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,500
So we're co-workers and imagine you're at a restaurant and you give your co-worker like

259
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,780
your phone number because you like hung it, you smoked in his car or something.

260
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah.

261
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,460
And then he just texts you this shit.

262
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,780
Text me the room is good.

263
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,180
Trying to become better friends with you.

264
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,340
Yeah, the talking period.

265
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,580
The talking period with your coworker.

266
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,420
The talking period of coworker friendship.

267
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,180
I have been in a talking phase with every manager I've ever had.

268
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,220
Never gone past that.

269
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,500
But they are brutal.

270
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,620
Yeah.

271
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,740
They are brutal.

272
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:32,900
Hey!

273
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,260
Did you ever get a nickname from your manager?

274
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,100
Well, they're doing the talking phase and they're like,

275
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,380
"Hey, Kathleen called out sick. I need you to come at 8am to cover her shift."

276
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,020
It's like...

277
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,580
Yeah.

278
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,860
Leave me alone, bro.

279
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,700
Back off. We're not in that phase yet.

280
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,900
I'm not I don't want to be you're just a situation ship for me.

281
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,500
Yeah, for me, honestly, like you're my work.

282
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,800
I mean, just to go like personal for a minute for me.

283
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
The talking phase is like 10 seconds long and then you go to the

284
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
well, and then I go into it.

285
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,100
I knew we were going to get wet and wild on this episode.

286
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,500
I knew you were going to talk about our amazing sex lives.

287
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Do you think our unbeatable sex life?

288
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,700
Fucking amazing right now.

289
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh my God.

290
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,900
I literally am shaking thinking about it.

291
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,280
moment of time for men who talk about that kind of stuff.

292
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,600
But imagine if one day we made the turn.

293
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
Would you say that you kill pussy?

294
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,640
Would you say that you blow out people?

295
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm the murderer.

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,560
You're the murderer.

297
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,400
Do you do you blow out backs, Cameron?

298
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,960
I never understood what that means.

299
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
Maybe because I've never done it.

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
Yeah, I snap spines.

301
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,320
Getting in there, snapping necks, breaking fucking breaking toes.

302
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, they call me sub zero.

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm in there pulling her whole spine.

304
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,320
...dugesting Mortal Kombat fatality stuff

305
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
to my wife, my one and only, destroying her.

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
[LAUGHTER]

307
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,000
And then I say, "Finisher!"

308
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,680
And then I go, [IMITATING GUNFIRE]

309
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,280
She turns around and is like, "Huh?"

310
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,780
What?

311
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,360
Did you say "Finisher?"

312
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,280
No, I didn't say that.

313
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,240
That was the announcer.

314
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,080
[LAUGHTER]

315
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
(laughing)

316
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,240
Man, that is the type of guy though,

317
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,080
that is like guys who are--

318
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
Who talks about sex?

319
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,120
There's like podcasts where it's like men

320
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,200
like talking about their sexual escapades.

321
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,080
Do you ever, you ever have--

322
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,520
I think that's what gets views on YouTube shorts and reels.

323
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,320
So I think if we wanna step our game up.

324
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,360
All right, here's what, here it is.

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Have you guys ever been having sex

326
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,880
and you realize that you're gonna jizz too fast

327
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
And so you start thinking about trash.

328
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,240
Big bags of trash with green stick lines going off it.

329
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,880
It works really well, because trash is not sexy.

330
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,680
No.

331
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,760
I thought of the Vietnam War.

332
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,280
That's the first thing that pops up.

333
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Like explosions, battlefield, bad company, too.

334
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,120
That shit's basically--

335
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,600
--cool, man.

336
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,080
Yeah.

337
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
I just have like a--

338
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,480
That shit's going to harden me up.

339
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah.

340
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,840
You think that's going to brick you up, bro?

341
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Yeah, for real.

342
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,360
Thinking about R.A. the Rugged Man.

343
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
It's literally so masculine.

344
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah.

345
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,280
Imagining me in the war.

346
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Well, you have to imagine.

347
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,320
So you're nutting too quick because you're thinking about how

348
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,920
masculine it would be to imagine how masculine I would be in the war.

349
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,240
Yeah.

350
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm imagining myself in the Vietnam War, like running into the foxholes

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,040
with a machine gun and just like, you know, perforating every single

352
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
Viet Cong, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, boom, boom, boom, boom.

353
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,120
Throwing grenades into just ant hills.

354
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
Just blowing up everything.

355
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,500
Basically, I'm doing the thing that they do where they pour liquid metal into an anthill.

356
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Yeah.

357
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,880
I'm pulling it out with a crane.

358
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,840
Just a bunch of Viet Cong kind of stuck like this, frozen, carbonite style.

359
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,840
A bunch of Vietnamese villagers who I guess live underground.

360
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,920
And you catch that one dude in the hostel who was jacking off.

361
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Oh my God.

362
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
No, I'm finishing him.

363
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Completely encased in metal.

364
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
No, I'm finishing it for him.

365
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Isn't there a guy in Pompeii who was jacking his penis off and he got frozen at the time?

366
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah, don't even don't knock that till you try it.

367
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,720
But thank God they invented nuclear bomb.

368
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
I think as you just get destroyed.

369
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,320
Well, you get on the wall man.

370
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,420
Oh, that's why I will never if I'm ever jacking off in a nuclear explosion happens.

371
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm going to face towards it while I'm jacking off.

372
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,420
So I don't get stuck in that side profile.

373
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Everybody can see how small my penis was smart.

374
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,620
Yeah, you got to have you got it.

375
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:39,620
That's why I've stolen so many tactical plans from the government to figure out where the spots the danger spots are for nuclear explosions.

376
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,460
- That's so hard. - Yeah, you're trying

377
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
to find your-- - Always face towards them.

378
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,580
- Trying to find your J-O zones

379
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,060
in case of a nuclear explosion.

380
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,460
- Yeah, 'cause when-- - Yeah, imagine if you,

381
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,620
imagine if you, so you got,

382
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,180
your silhouette got painted on the wall

383
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,820
by a nuclear bomb and you just happened

384
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,780
at that time to be fat.

385
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,220
- Yeah. - Yeah, you're fat.

386
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,540
They're like, what is he doing with,

387
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,100
oh, is he eating a piece of sushi?

388
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,540
You're jacking off with chopsticks

389
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,220
'cause your penis is so small.

390
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,580
That'd be like, that is--

391
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,700
- My penis is a roll. - There's not even

392
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,020
any number-- - My penis is a roll

393
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,460
like a piece of sushi.

394
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,320
- Yeah, exactly, my penis has that kind of thing

395
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,460
where it's like there's a base like onigiri.

396
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
- Mine's still got the skin on it.

397
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,580
- And then there's something on top.

398
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,900
Yours does still have the skin, like a rotisserie chicken.

399
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,780
- Mine got the skin on it.

400
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,300
- Yeah, that's the best part.

401
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,740
- See, I'm trying to get, I'm trying to get,

402
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,620
I'm trying to have like real fodder, you know?

403
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,420
I'm trying to have like shorts fodder.

404
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,660
'Cause that's what we have been missing,

405
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,060
is reels, TikToks, and shorts.

406
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,420
We gotta start getting sexual as hell.

407
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,220
- Why do you want it to be so sex?

408
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,060
- You've been, yeah, you kind of are really going in.

409
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,900
- I'm going in on this. - I mean, there's stuff

410
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,940
that gets clicks, you guys.

411
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,740
I was watching the YouTube reels earlier,

412
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,340
and it's podcast guys, and they just say like,

413
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,660
"Yo, like, have you ever been smashing with a girl,

414
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,320
"and like, she got a little turd hanging out of her butt?"

415
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,500
- That people aren't saying that.

416
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,820
- This is what you watch on YouTube?

417
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,660
- People are talking about dingleberry sex.

418
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,180
- I watch this on YouTube shorts.

419
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,340
- In the fucking, on YouTube shorts,

420
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,660
they're talking about dingleberries

421
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,740
popping out of a woman's ass

422
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,580
while you're having sex with her?

423
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,580
Have you ever been smashing with your situation ship

424
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,620
and she got a little bit of turd poking out

425
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,000
of both her butt and her mouth?

426
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,860
Name, what podcast is doing this?

427
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,700
- What podcast are you listening to?

428
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,800
- The Sexual Boys.

429
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,180
- This is not, is that a barstool?

430
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,020
What is this?

431
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,300
- It's a Nelk Boys spin-off.

432
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,220
- Oh, I actually fuck with the Nelk Boys heavy.

433
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,460
- Yeah, you like Happy Dad Seltzer?

434
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,760
- I love Happy, I wanna get a Happy Dad wrapped.

435
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,500
- Smart car?

436
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
- Yeah.

437
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,460
(laughing)

438
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,260
Happy Dad's Seltzer wrapped smart car.

439
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,860
What the hell? My watch going off and I can't find it.

440
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,260
Oh my, it's not even 101.

441
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,380
Your watch is fast.

442
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,380
My watch is fast. It's always two minutes fast.

443
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,460
I have to subtract two minutes.

444
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,700
It's three minutes fast today.

445
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,260
That's crazy.

446
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,940
Well, it's two and a half minutes fast, basically.

447
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,460
All right.

448
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,900
So 101 has never been 101?

449
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,220
It's never been 101.

450
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:04,780
But maybe it's a common thing to say, but every time I see a smart car driving on the road, I do have such a vivid imagination of me just running into the street and pushing it over.

451
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,820
because two hands under the side and just

452
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,120
foom, just flipping it.

453
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,760
They get destroyed whenever there's like a protest.

454
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,720
They get destroyed whenever I throw bombs and rocks at them.

455
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,960
Also, whenever I let my acid tongue let loose on these owners,

456
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,360
they get fucking destroyed. I'll tell you what.

457
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
I say nice car for an aunt.

458
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,060
If it breaks down, you can just kind of carry it behind you like a rickshaw.

459
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,860
Yeah, that's true.

460
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,020
Anyway, or just put it on your head like a guy

461
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,380
holding a big pot in a different country and just move that thing home.

462
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,140
What is their addiction to that in other countries?

463
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Get that off your head!

464
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,020
You know what their addiction is?

465
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Hold that thing in your hands!

466
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
What?

467
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
You...

468
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,020
God gave you hands for a reason.

469
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Your head is not a hand.

470
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
You're not one big hand in your head's hand.

471
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

472
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,060
Which by the way, it'd be weird to carry around stuff on your thumb too.

473
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
You're acting like a clown.

474
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Exactly.

475
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,060
All those videos...

476
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,060
Yeah, literally acting like a clown.

477
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
It's cocoonery!

478
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,580
Where somebody's walking around, they have a TV or a refrigerator on their head, they're

479
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
riding a bicycle.

480
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,360
Oh, yeah, I know that guy. I know that guy's

481
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,940
Guys, there's a bunch. There's one guy. There's one guy in New York that does that

482
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,740
No, I'm talking about videos in other countries where somebody is trying to move

483
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,660
It's a task rabbit type job where you move a TV from one place to the other and they're like a profile on him on

484
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,700
Jankum, I don't need a car. I think I need a head. I'll put this on my head

485
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,580
He rides a bike and he put a fridge on his head. Why are you so we all know this guy?

486
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,940
We don't care about this guy.

487
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,780
- You're talking about one or two of the opposite guy.

488
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,700
- You're viral videoifying our conversation.

489
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,460
You're taking us into meme territory.

490
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,140
- You're trying to put us in a reel.

491
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,300
Have you seen this guy who drives around?

492
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
- Have you seen this guy?

493
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,740
- No.

494
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,900
- Well meanwhile, me and Caleb are trying to figure out

495
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,540
what the hell is going on in other countries

496
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,460
that makes them act different from us.

497
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
- It has to be some,

498
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,100
because they don't have fluoridated water.

499
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,660
So they are actually acting in the way

500
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,500
that you're supposed to.

501
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,380
You're supposed to use your head like a Christmas tree

502
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,460
and put a star on top of it.

503
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,420
- Did you say fluoridate, like Florida water?

504
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,280
- No, like fluoride.

505
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
- Oh, well if they, I mean, to us,

506
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,880
what they do is some Florida man type behavior.

507
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,460
And we have fluoridated water.

508
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,460
- You're saying that people in other countries

509
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,920
are Florida men. - If they had a Florida,

510
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,100
if they had a Florida, they would know

511
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,060
that all that stuff is bullshit.

512
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,020
- That's gotta be one of the most viciously racist things

513
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,660
I've ever heard in my entire life.

514
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
- What?

515
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,980
in other countries are Florida men. That's what you said. Florida men, which is almost

516
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,420
always used as a derogatory term for a crazy person on drugs. What are Florida men known for? Drugs,

517
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:47,020
domestic abuse, crashing their car, stealing. What countries are we talking about?

518
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,620
What countries do they carry things on their head? You said every country.

519
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,940
Every single country doesn't have their own Florida though, unless they do.

520
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,620
- You think that there's like a Florida type of thing for--

521
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,180
- I don't think there's a Florida anywhere

522
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,260
except for the United States.

523
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,140
- That's interesting.

524
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,500
You don't think there's like Canada's Florida or like UK's?

525
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,200
- No, I think there's one Florida.

526
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,620
- The world-- - There's two Georges.

527
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,460
- There is two Georges.

528
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,120
- Oh, okay, that pokes a hole in your fucking logic.

529
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,020
There could be two Floridas now.

530
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,040
- Okay, let's go look at the map then.

531
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,420
- Okay, let's consult it.

532
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,700
(laughing)

533
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,540
- It pokes a hole in the logic.

534
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,820
- Is there an Atlanta in the other Georgia too?

535
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,120
Yeah, it's exactly the same.

536
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,660
It's literally like...

537
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah, they have all the same people in places.

538
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Do they have Magic City at Georgia?

539
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
The Balkan Georgia?

540
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,400
Yeah.

541
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,220
I would love to go to Balkan Magic City.

542
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,820
I bet the chicken wings are even better.

543
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,520
Well, there's a Florida, Massachusetts.

544
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,620
Yeah, that's true.

545
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,220
I've been there.

546
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,420
That place is fire.

547
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,520
There's an abandoned motel there.

548
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,420
I don't think two places should be able to have the same name, personally.

549
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,720
No, it's a non.

550
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,220
There's a Boston, New York.

551
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Lebanon, New Hampshire?

552
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,020
Yeah.

553
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,520
Come on now.

554
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
Wait, Lebanon, New Hampshire?

555
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,020
That's real?

556
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,020
Lebanon, New Hampshire, they pronounce it different.

557
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,520
It's like Berlin.

558
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,020
Yeah, but...

559
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,520
It's different.

560
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
It's Liebannin.

561
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
No, they don't.

562
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,020
You're lying to my...

563
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,020
As a native New Hampshireite, it's pronounced Liebannin.

564
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,520
Is it New Hampshireite?

565
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,020
Yeah.

566
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,520
Oh, it's not like Hampshireian?

567
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
No, no, no.

568
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
It's New Hampshireite.

569
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,020
Well, that'd be cooler.

570
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,020
You have to admit this on recording.

571
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,660
You know, I just now for the first time ever realized New Hampshire completely won.

572
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,860
I've never once heard of original Hampshire.

573
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah, true.

574
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,920
Hampton, I have no clue where it could even be.

575
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,720
I would assume probably in the UK, but I don't care, but yeah, I've never heard once of it.

576
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,800
No, it must be not that cool.

577
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,880
New London.

578
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,040
That's a place that lost.

579
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,480
They lost.

580
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:42,760
Yeah.

581
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,920
Hard.

582
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,600
New York.

583
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,240
So hard.

584
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,440
New York though.

585
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,720
New York kind of bodied it.

586
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,280
Yeah.

587
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,080
York kind of completely.

588
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,560
But they went from losers to winners.

589
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,680
It used to be New Amsterdam.

590
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,200
They would have lost that one.

591
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,320
♪ It's a New Amsterdam ♪

592
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,360
Wait, but they would have won New Amsterdam too.

593
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,680
Maybe. New Amsterdam is now--

594
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,600
New York City's way bigger.

595
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
What?

596
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,360
New Amsterdam is now for complete Alkies.

597
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,460
What are you talking about?

598
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,440
New Amsterdam vodka, New Amsterdam gin.

599
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh, you're so right.

600
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,720
This is for the, oh, speaking of,

601
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
Days like this, right?

602
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,220
Six months ago, seven months ago,

603
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,800
what would I be doing on a day like this?

604
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,700
I don't know. Sitting back,

605
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,940
rolling a fat joint, taking two puffs,

606
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,600
losing my mind, going crazy,

607
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,920
trying to find stuff under my couch pillows.

608
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,360
But I can't do that anymore, 'til I can't smoke weed.

609
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,480
So today I have, so far, it's one o'clock,

610
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,360
I have been getting high on food.

611
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,940
I've been eating so much food.

612
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,000
I am on food in a major way.

613
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Days like this, stuck in my house,

614
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,240
I'm eating tortillas, just plain tortillas,

615
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,940
putting them on the stovetop,

616
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,200
making them hot and eating them.

617
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,040
Isn't that crazy?

618
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,380
- Dude, the corn tortillas on the burner?

619
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,620
- Yeah, what am I doing though?

620
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,380
- Make a little tortilla sandwich?

621
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,220
- I'm just eating, yeah.

622
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,520
- It's a snack, man.

623
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,220
- But why am I snacking?

624
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,860
I should be eating probably bison meat and creatine.

625
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
- You know what it is.

626
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,940
- I'm not the kind of person who eats tortillas like this.

627
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,700
- You said that you used to be, on a day like this,

628
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,460
you used to be smoking weed.

629
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,820
So right now you have kind of like phantom munchies

630
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,660
or whatever, or what's the word?

631
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,480
- I never got munchies.

632
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,860
Whenever I smoked weed, I hated food.

633
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,860
- That's crazy.

634
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,820
- Isn't that weird?

635
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,020
- You loved food.

636
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,340
- No, I never was somebody who liked eating

637
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,580
when I smoked weed.

638
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,820
- Yeah, you were.

639
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,940
- I literally was not.

640
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,700
- That's strange behavior and weirdness to boot.

641
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,060
- No wonder your therapist said it's making you psychotic.

642
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,700
- It's so psycho that I would not eat food.

643
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
- Yes.

644
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,060
- I would sit there and somebody would be like,

645
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,620
"Dude," you know, the people I hang out with,

646
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,300
they'd be like, "Dude, let's order chips."

647
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,420
- "Let's get chips."

648
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,340
- I'd say, "I fucking hate chips, man.

649
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,820
Get that chip shit out of my face.

650
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
I don't want chips.

651
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,800
I want water.

652
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,700
I want electrolytes."

653
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,820
- I did like to drink so much water when I was high.

654
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,860
Back when I smoked weed, I drank so much water,

655
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,100
I would throw up.

656
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,940
- When I-- - What?

657
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,780
- You can get water poisoning. - That's weirder

658
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,260
than not wanting food.

659
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,100
- No, no, no, it's called water poisoning.

660
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,300
- Drinking so much water that you--

661
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,660
- You can get water poisoning.

662
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
It's a real thing.

663
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,300
- Yeah, but I wasn't getting water poisoning.

664
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
I was just drinking too much water.

665
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Drinking too much and it would kind of back up into his throat.

666
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

667
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,100
Speaking of water poisoning, this water is poisoning the damn city right now with all this rain.

668
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,200
That is true as fuck, man.

669
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,700
Thank you for saying that shit.

670
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,000
It's being, our streets are flooded and our subways are decimated.

671
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,300
Do you think that they're going, that it will destroy the Statue of Liberty?

672
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,100
Yes.

673
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
That's fucking sad.

674
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,740
That's a piece of copper that they put in the middle of the city.

675
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
The Statue of Liberty.

676
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,440
Did you know that it was originally

677
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,820
that thing?

678
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
If lightning struck it?

679
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,260
It was originally bronze or copper.

680
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,140
It was originally bronze in color, and now it's completely green due to rain and erosion.

681
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,820
It's actually due to the air.

682
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,300
It's oxidation, man.

683
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,020
Yeah, it's called verdigris.

684
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,900
Nice try.

685
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,660
It has nothing to do with.

686
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,380
It's called rain or erosion.

687
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:10,100
Well, why doesn't somebody get some salt and vinegar and scrub down the whole statue?

688
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,600
That's a good point. Why don't they buff all that green shit off it?

689
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,100
I want to see the beautiful, the beautiful bronze...

690
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,900
She probably was just... She was probably a dime piece before all this green shit stuff.

691
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,600
She must have been fine as fuck, man.

692
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,700
She was probably the most beautiful woman in the world, then she turned fucking green.

693
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Oh, bronze-skinned lady sitting right there in the Hudson Bay.

694
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,900
One day it's going to rain salt and vinegar and she will be...

695
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
Acid rain.

696
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,100
She will become so, so, so beautiful again.

697
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,940
With her giant big ass boobs and her hair.

698
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
She has a scrub.

699
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,700
They scrub away all the green shit off of her and she's a completely different shape.

700
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,220
She has a complete hourglass figure.

701
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
There's just so much built up.

702
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
Oh my god.

703
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Oh my god.

704
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,220
She looked like she got a BBL but it's natural.

705
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,620
They scrub the green shit off and it just takes all the clothes off.

706
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,120
(laughing)

707
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,500
- It was French, originally she was definitely nude.

708
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,740
- It turns out she was never holding a book at all,

709
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,660
this was just a big lump on that forefinger.

710
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,140
- I don't wanna know what the torch was y'all!

711
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,800
Nah, I'm not gonna go there.

712
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,380
- Y'all, it was a third boob.

713
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,140
- That's what's wrong with today's society,

714
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,820
no countries are giving each other statues anymore.

715
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,020
Listen, we're all tearing these statues down.

716
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:30,020
- I thought, didn't they erect like a statue of a fuckin'

717
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,320
They put a statue of some celebrity in one of these Balkan countries.

718
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,240
No, okay, let me rephrase. No countries are giving us

719
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,760
statues anymore. Okay. Yeah. We're giving out statues left and

720
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,840
right. Willy nilly. What about that statue with the, that's in somewhere in New

721
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,080
York now with like the girl with no legs and she's got crazy Medusa hair.

722
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,440
Did a country give us that? That is the Statue of Liberty.

723
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,800
No, that's not it. You're thinking of that. No, it's the

724
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,280
- Is there a Liberty Spice? - Yeah, like a monocloss?

725
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,680
- Spiky thing around her head? - Yeah.

726
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,280
- No, she's got a bunch of tentacles - Is it Liberty Spice?

727
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,560
- and just green? - that are basically

728
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,200
like an early sign of the apocalypse,

729
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,600
kind of Mark of the Beast type shit.

730
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,960
But I think another country gave us that,

731
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,640
and if I had to guess, it would probably be Germany.

732
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,920
- Yeah.

733
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,480
Who gave us the Wall Street Bowl?

734
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Was that Spain?

735
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,800
- I think actually just a guy did that.

736
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,880
- Oh, what was his name, Michael Spain?

737
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,180
Michael, no, I don't think it was Michael Spinn

738
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,540
or Michael Pena.

739
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,900
I think that it was probably just some rich guy

740
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,020
who was really good at making balls.

741
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,480
And I think he started with the balls

742
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,320
and tried to put them in Wall Street.

743
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,160
- Worked his way back. - They were like,

744
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,420
"You're gonna have to put something around these balls."

745
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,860
(laughing)

746
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,820
I was like, "Okay, fuck, a bull, I don't know."

747
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,100
- All right, all right, all right.

748
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,180
- Whatever.

749
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,740
- Oh, you know what would be a good prank I just thought?

750
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,460
To take that new girl sculpture.

751
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,300
I don't know if that's still there.

752
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
- Wait, let me guess.

753
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,900
Shaving cream on the hand

754
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,900
And you tickle somebody's face while they're asleep.

755
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,120
Is that it?

756
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
That would actually be a really good prank to do on a statue

757
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,620
because their little hand would hurt really bad.

758
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,120
Exactly.

759
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
And they'd slap their own face.

760
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
That would hurt way worse than a human hand.

761
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,920
Okay, what's the idea?

762
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,620
You just put the girl at the back so she's looking at the balls.

763
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,120
She's doing this.

764
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
She's doing the...

765
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Yeah, she's doing her fearless pose.

766
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,520
Top story tonight, somebody has moved the brave little girl to the back of the bull and now

767
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,880
she is staring at the bull's balls.

768
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,720
Looking pretty upset.

769
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,320
Looking pretty upset at the bull's balls.

770
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,800
New Yorker, we go to the street to talk to New Yorkers about it.

771
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,440
Oh, what the fuck?

772
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
That little bitch looking at those balls.

773
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,600
Who the fuck did this?

774
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
What the hell?

775
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
What was that character you just tagged in?

776
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,560
You thought your character is we go to New Yorkers in the street to talk about this?

777
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
What the fuck?

778
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
That's a classic New Yorker.

779
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
What was that?

780
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
That's Mr. New York himself.

781
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
It almost didn't need the second part of the guy.

782
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Yeah, it did not need it.

783
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
You already did the news announcement thing.

784
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
What the fuck?

785
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
What the fuck?

786
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Our second story tonight,

787
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
a man swore on TV

788
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
and we couldn't believe it out

789
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
because it was lied.

790
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
We go back to the same guy.

791
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:30,800
Well they wouldn't want to cover that on the there's a lot of holes in this kind of story is a lot of holes in this story I'm sorry that I even brought up going to the streets of New York this is why you're not gonna get on the office reboot man.

792
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:41,500
Damn I can't wait really bummed that I was like bald on Pam I was black bald completely and diet or no not Diane Phyllis.

793
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,880
Diane of the reboot Phyllis maker boobs what about a new to be hired a woman a

794
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,080
new woman on the office reboot named Diane who has humongous she is humongous

795
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,040
is huge users huge ease

796
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,160
ok see that's what I'm saying her name is Diane Hughes and she earns the

797
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,040
nickname

798
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:12,720
huge huge ease oh shit okay huge so they're doing is a little bit big what's

799
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,200
up huge hey huge and then it tackles sexism in the workplace it actually all

800
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,120
works out perfect from the reverse angle where they're like the guys calling them

801
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,840
huge or cool that's the moral this is the yeah yeah it's the the the poptimism

802
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,720
that Michael Schur loves. Do you think, guys, what kind of stories will they tackle

803
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,680
with this office reboot? What are they gonna do? Work from home.

804
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,360
Work from home. Run out of paper. Work from home. Oh shit, COVID-19 shuts down the office. Yeah, we have run out of

805
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,080
complete paper. Paper is getting replaced by iPads. Encroaching influence of China on the

806
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,560
business sphere. China, they got to make the papers have some kind of, it's a

807
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,880
different dimension now. It's red paper, it's communism paper. They

808
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,060
They accidentally have a four-hole punched paper.

809
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,940
Maybe Stanley has an OnlyFans?

810
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,480
Wow.

811
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Look at my butt.

812
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,360
Yep, and it's all just the same photo of him basically doing the same pose as the Wall

813
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,180
Street girl, but it's from the back, we see his ass crack.

814
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,640
It's from the front and from the back, and it's the same photo every day.

815
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,480
It's a photo of him leaning over on his bathroom sink.

816
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,880
I subscribe to Stanley's Only Fans and he did the same photo every day.

817
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
Bro, let me guess.

818
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,920
Kevin is going to start doing Binging with Babish videos, Toby is going to start streaming

819
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,840
with Kai Sinat, what else is going to happen?

820
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,680
I almost feel that with the next up-reboot of The Office, which will most likely be woke,

821
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,160
I almost feel as if they're likely to change the name of the original Office to The Offense.

822
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,320
That's an actually amazing point!

823
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,160
God damn. They probably will do that. I feel it's likely. God damn Cameron. Exactly. And

824
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:05,280
they'll probably change parks and recreation to parts of violations. Yes. Where they are

825
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,160
gonna violate, because they're violating some kind of work office relationship policies.

826
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,360
Or parts of race. Because actually at the end of the show it was a pretty big melting pot

827
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,960
of different cultures. But the first two seasons. That's a good point. But the first two seasons

828
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,120
though. And community, they're probably going to reboot that and change it to

829
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,640
"white community." "Canceled community." "A community of canceled people."

830
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,040
"People." "Come." We're going to change it to "white community is bad."

831
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,000
Probably do it to "con." Or maybe they'll just say,

832
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,560
"Continuity." "Constituency." "We found it." Yeah.

833
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,720
And it'll probably end up being some kind of political thing about AOC.

834
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Yeah, probably be political in some way.

835
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,220
It'll probably be AOC instead of Jeff Winger showing up

836
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,660
to the first day of bartending school.

837
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,000
And she has all these different groups of people

838
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,260
that she's having to represent.

839
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,060
She gets elected to school government, but she's also in the bikini

840
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,900
wet t-shirt concert.

841
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,100
Concert.

842
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,480
The wet t-shirt concert at the end of the show.

843
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Very, very funny.

844
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,140
That happens at the end of every episode.

845
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,940
which is including all female pop stars. Yes, do a leap. Oh, we'll be making a

846
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,340
girl's

847
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,040
the

848
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,340
how's the

849
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,040
Judy Garland

850
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,440
Judy Garland is passed away. Man. She's dead. Speaking of a I will change that

851
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,740
though. Sentence sent it her Diane Feinstein has officially passed away

852
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,940
after this world and she's on to greener pastures. Y'all

853
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,040
don't hit the sound. What was that?

854
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,800
- That wasn't right. - Come on, bro.

855
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,880
- Nobody did a-- - She's moldering in a hole.

856
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,640
- Don't you-- - Who did that soundboard?

857
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,000
- Jupio did, man, he's got the soundboard all cued up.

858
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
That's fucked up, man.

859
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,720
Nobody home run baseball bat Super Mario Baseball.

860
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
- How would you feel if your great-great-grandma

861
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,840
was being eaten by mildew and someone played that sound

862
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,980
right in your face?

863
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,680
(laughing)

864
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,680
- Yeah, if your great-great-grandma turned to bug stuff.

865
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,560
- Nobody would like that.

866
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,000
- This lady who bravely survived since the 1800s

867
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,960
and you're making light of her being thrown into a box

868
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
over here on a lace flower.

869
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,360
- Yeah, just because she was born the same year,

870
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,000
or she got elected to Congress the same year

871
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,280
that baseball was invented,

872
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,920
you thought that it was appropriate

873
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,640
to play this fucking baseball sound, man?

874
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,480
She's a dead woman.

875
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,120
- Nah, but if I get invited to the funeral,

876
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm sneaking a peek.

877
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,240
- You gotta sneak a peek.

878
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,360
Getting under there.

879
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,560
- Did you play that sound because she used to have a,

880
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,840
was in a situation ship with Abner Doubleday,

881
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,140
inventor of baseball.

882
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,680
(laughing)

883
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,540
I honestly feel so invigorated just imagining

884
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,300
her being in college and experimenting as a lesbian.

885
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,220
I feel like she definitely was doing some of that shit

886
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,160
back in the day and it makes me so happy.

887
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,040
Bro, when she flew that confederate flag

888
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,240
on the, in San Francisco.

889
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,500
- In the Civil War.

890
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,040
- In the Civil War.

891
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,880
Which is why she flew it in the 60s or whatever.

892
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,400
I learned about that this morning,

893
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,280
didn't know she did that.

894
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
- Who gives a fuck, dude?

895
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,560
That was 100 years ago.

896
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,400
- I don't know a single thing about her.

897
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,440
- Yeah, that's true.

898
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,200
- All I know is the videos where she doesn't know

899
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,780
what she's doing.

900
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,400
- Yeah, where her brain is completely milk.

901
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,820
- How are we getting so many people in Congress

902
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,920
and Senators who are like,

903
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,120
we have like three now that just can't even talk.

904
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,080
- It's because Congress is the opposite of progress.

905
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Oh, shit.

906
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
Oh, damn.

907
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Oh, shit.

908
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,640
If you look at that, it had words involved in the name of Congress.

909
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,040
Well, it's almost pretty close, yeah.

910
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Congress.

911
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Hello?

912
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,680
I'm having a gress time.

913
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,000
God damn it.

914
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,600
Which is a combination of great and best.

915
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Mm-hmm.

916
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Yeah, so I guess that does make some...

917
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Con, pro, con.

918
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Do I refresh?

919
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,520
Oh, Puppy's audio has all disappeared.

920
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,360
And he's completely disappeared.

921
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
Patrick's name is Puppy, by the way.

922
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Hello.

923
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,200
I didn't realize nobody could see that.

924
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Yeah, you're completely back. Good job.

925
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh my god, dude.

926
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Did the flood destroy?

927
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
The rain is affecting.

928
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Okay, here's my question for you guys.

929
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
If the rain continues at this pace, there's no doubt

930
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
that this entire globe will be flooded with water.

931
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Right?

932
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,200
You and us, me and you,

933
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
need to build an ark, and we need to

934
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
pair off into twos, and I call Patrick.

935
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Alright, that's fine.

936
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Okay, then I call Cameron.

937
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I know y'all's babies are gonna be

938
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:42,360
to be weird AF. No they won't. Yep. How would our babies be weird? They're going to be born

939
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,120
with externalized internalities. I mean our babies are going to be born bald, I can tell

940
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,040
you that. And they're going to stay bald. Most babies are born bald, man. They're going

941
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,040
to be born bald and stay bald. My baby's going to have hair all over his body. You're going

942
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,640
to have a monkey baby. I'm going to have a werewolf baby. I'm going to have an all hair

943
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,320
- No, you don't want that. - My baby covered in hair.

944
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,280
- I actually would love if my baby was covered in white hair,

945
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
like a dog.

946
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,560
- That would be cool, 'cause, well,

947
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,600
white hair. - Like those videos,

948
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,240
you want your baby to come out,

949
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,060
and it looks like those videos of the--

950
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,600
- I want my baby to look like a spirit animal

951
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,080
from Chinese mythology.

952
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,360
- Have like bright pink skin,

953
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,200
flowing white hair, really long white hair.

954
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,280
- Translucent, translucent white hair,

955
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
and very pink skin. - Hair designed by God

956
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,700
to be viewed by moonlight.

957
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,120
That's gotta be the most beautiful poem you've said.

958
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,960
I know, what that is amazing.

959
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,760
Can you imagine antlers?

960
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,240
Oh, antlers.

961
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,680
You want your baby to look like, if you're a parent--

962
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,120
Drifting in the wind.

963
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,680
You want your baby to look like one of those

964
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,560
homeless guys that gets a haircut?

965
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,360
No, I want my baby to look like a mystical dragon.

966
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,160
You want it to have scales and also white hair

967
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,120
and also antlers.

968
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Yeah, and it flies around. Antlers.

969
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,560
- And we don't-- - I don't think you even want a ba--

970
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,060
I think you don't want a baby.

971
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,000
- You're right, I want a pet. - I think I want a spirit guardian.

972
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
- You want a-- - This has always been my thing.

973
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,300
I've always been talking about this.

974
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,560
You have.

975
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,840
With my relationship counselor.

976
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,440
You want some kind of crazy Sun Wukong god

977
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,000
that follows you around and sits in line for you

978
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,340
when you don't want to.

979
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,180
- That's-- - Yeah.

980
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,540
If I had a spirit animal like that,

981
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,940
that's pretty much what I would make it do.

982
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,380
- I'd make it do chores. - I'm gonna--

983
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,720
I'm not battling many people.

984
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,320
- I'm gonna train my baby to sit on my shoulder.

985
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,560
(laughing)

986
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,640
- He's at graduation, you're just like,

987
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,600
"All right, one last time."

988
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,240
And you're just like a photo of him,

989
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,560
just completely, like perfectly perched.

990
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,400
- That's right.

991
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,080
- I've been playing these Persona games

992
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,760
and I feel like mine would pretty much

993
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,240
just do the dishes for me.

994
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm not running around hunting bad guys much.

995
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,520
I'll just need him to--

996
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,720
- Oh, your Persona, I see.

997
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,560
- Maybe have him sit on my--

998
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm sick on my--

999
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,620
- Thought you were still talking about your baby.

1000
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,340
- No, well, my baby would also do the dishes,

1001
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,380
no doubt, when he turns five.

1002
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,580
But I would also, oh, a baby would be good for this too.

1003
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,900
You wake up and you know that you got a football game

1004
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,340
to watch at 1 p.m., but god damn if that couch isn't cold

1005
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,820
by the time you sit down at 1 p.m.,

1006
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,100
and I'm trying to sit in my office chair

1007
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,540
and play video games for a couple hours.

1008
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,940
Put your baby on it, heat it up.

1009
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,700
- I'm thinking now about--

1010
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,340
- That's basically what most kids do for their dads.

1011
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,060
- Heat up chairs with their ass.

1012
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,180
- Yeah. - Personas right now.

1013
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,180
And can you imagine a situation where your soul is on fire

1014
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,460
or whatever and you're letting loose

1015
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,100
and your persona's about to manifest

1016
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,460
and you're like, "Ah!"

1017
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,620
And your spirit guardian appears

1018
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,300
and it's completely, you can tell

1019
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,840
that the character designer,

1020
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,020
that it's completely pink and frilly

1021
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,580
and it's wearing a dress and it's really cool.

1022
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,660
It's flowers all over it and it's like,

1023
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,780
abilities like pink's-- - I'd be fine with that.

1024
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,820
- But what if-- - Pink aroma.

1025
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,100
- What if you do that whole,

1026
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,300
you go through all the animations

1027
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,520
and then just like a single fly comes out

1028
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,360
of your ass crack.

1029
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,380
(laughing)

1030
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,220
Lots of fuck your head.

1031
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,020
- Or just like a little fucked up,

1032
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,920
like a human head with just legs.

1033
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1034
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,900
- It's like, ah!

1035
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,340
It's like screaming in pain.

1036
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,020
- His strength is biting. - It was so badly.

1037
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,140
- This is a reflection of my most deepest being.

1038
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
- This is who I really am. - This is who I am.

1039
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,840
- This is my shadow.

1040
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,400
- All he can do is bite.

1041
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,060
- Just some guy whose head is duct taped to his feet

1042
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,060
and his ass is completely like fully dilated,

1043
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,380
goatsy, walking around.

1044
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,700
- Yeah, what if you get one of the ones

1045
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,660
from the Persona games where it's just a demon

1046
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,300
with a gigantic cock that he's just stroking?

1047
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,860
You know those lurks? - Or he has two skills.

1048
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,420
He has biting and he can play the harmonica

1049
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,960
with his foot to his mouth.

1050
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,420
(laughing)

1051
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,020
- It's so sick how many different Persona monsters

1052
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,980
there are that are different variations

1053
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,860
of guys sitting on the toilet with a big dick.

1054
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,500
- Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

1055
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,940
It's pretty awesome. - I gotta try those games out.

1056
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,500
I need to try everything Japanese at this point, guys.

1057
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,220
I'm gonna go, you guys will,

1058
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm gonna do some fucking, whoa!

1059
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,960
(laughing)

1060
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,360
What the hell are you doing, man?

1061
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,540
Something happened, oh my God.

1062
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,020
PT Productions.

1063
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,120
Don't worry about it.

1064
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,620
Okay.

1065
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,500
Just keep talking.

1066
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,460
Okay, I'm sorry.

1067
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,180
Would you guys think I was wack if I dressed up

1068
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,940
as something from Persona for Halloween?

1069
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
You want to be a Persona character for Halloween?

1070
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
You want to be a Persona character for Halloween?

1071
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Yeah, dude, I'll spend like $500 on a full cosplay outfit.

1072
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,940
You are probably the most anime-looking person in America.

1073
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,940
That would be pretty funny.

1074
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,940
I think if you were like Sora from Kingdom Hearts or something.

1075
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I don't know about any of that shit.

1076
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,940
Just put on that orange wig, you look completely Final Fantasy vibe.

1077
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,940
No, I'm going to be the main character from Persona 4,

1078
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,900
and I'm gonna get a completely white wig

1079
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,300
and a whole schoolboy outfit. - You should be

1080
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,100
a clown strife.

1081
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,020
- I didn't play Final,

1082
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,340
I have no interest in Final Fantasy,

1083
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,180
I don't know why. - Final Fantasy is--

1084
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,100
- You're crazy for that. - Blame, blame.

1085
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,620
- Final Fantasy is basically honky version

1086
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,020
of an actual Japanese video game.

1087
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,380
- Yeah, well that's-- - Yeah, it's for honkies.

1088
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,820
- I mean, yeah, they made it for,

1089
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,500
that's why the name's in English.

1090
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,820
- Yeah, exactly. - Yeah.

1091
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,660
I haven't played any of these like personas or anything.

1092
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,780
I've played Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts

1093
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,900
all the way or yeah played all of the Kingdom Hearts games.

1094
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
I want to get into something really fucked up.

1095
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,820
I want to get into like Dragon Quest or some shit like that.

1096
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,260
Yeah, Dragon Quest is cool.

1097
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
Something insane with a thousand games.

1098
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,060
It's the same art director from Chrono Trigger, right?

1099
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,100
Yeah.

1100
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,260
Dragon Ball.

1101
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,500
Did he also do Chrono Trigger?

1102
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,540
I don't know.

1103
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,580
I don't go in for all that type of crap.

1104
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,460
I tried to play Final Fantasy 1 when I was in middle school

1105
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,220
and I was like, fuck this shit, man.

1106
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,860
Yeah, it's an NES game, right?

1107
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,900
I don't I liked it, but that's the thing I liked any I liked any stuff.

1108
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,840
But I liked it.

1109
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,180
Yeah, it's retro, man.

1110
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,820
I realized like it's as far

1111
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:03,260
that shit had like I tried to get into it when I was like 13,

1112
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,820
something like that.

1113
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:07,760
I tried to get into like retro gaming and I was just like, this is

1114
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,900
I'd rather play games that look like this T-Rex on Cameron's screen right now.

1115
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh, my goodness.

1116
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,540
I'm into retro games, but really retro games.

1117
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,680
Yeah, like Pong.

1118
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,640
I'm talking, no, even more retro.

1119
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,340
Atari 2600.

1120
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,240
I'm talking about, you know, hunting down.

1121
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,040
Hunting.

1122
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,980
That was the original game. Big game hunting.

1123
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,660
Yeah, that was the original game.

1124
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Hunting down people.

1125
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,760
Yeah, that's what they had before retro 8-bit games.

1126
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,860
Fighting people, moving a rock around, kicking rocks.

1127
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,100
That's an old game. Before 8-bit gaming.

1128
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,940
How old is 8-bit gaming? That's all they had.

1129
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,540
Wouldn't it be awesome if rock, paper, scissors was the oldest game in human history?

1130
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,980
I think it is.

1131
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,860
I think somebody would have to believe that it is.

1132
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,300
And scissors.

1133
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,420
Scissors more than paper.

1134
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,260
Is it the oldest game or is that lacrosse?

1135
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,300
Lacrosse ain't that old, dawg.

1136
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,780
I thought lacrosse was the oldest game.

1137
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,540
No, it's paintball.

1138
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,380
Is lacrosse a Native American game?

1139
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,140
Yeah.

1140
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:03,980
Yeah.

1141
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,300
It's an ancient Native American game.

1142
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,060
I thought it actually was.

1143
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,420
It's what all the kids who played lacrosse in my high school said.

1144
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,980
I think it is a Native American game.

1145
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,860
That is worse than the Trail of Tears,

1146
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,900
what we've done to that fucking game.

1147
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,340
That's crazy that that used to be Native American

1148
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,740
and now it's like the most annoying white race sport.

1149
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,780
Maybe I'm off here.

1150
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,180
I hope I'm not.

1151
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,060
Yeah, it's so insane that they probably played that

1152
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,540
for hundreds of years

1153
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,980
and then all these fucking honkeys came in and did that.

1154
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,940
Lacrosse is credited to Native Americans.

1155
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,780
Yeah.

1156
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
That's a big credit.

1157
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,060
Huge crowd. The name derives from the French word for the stick.

1158
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,940
Why is there boy lacrosse and girl lacrosse in there?

1159
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,020
It's like two different sports.

1160
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,060
Isn't that every sport though?

1161
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,900
Yeah. Not really.

1162
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,980
WNBA is different, right?

1163
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,820
The difference is...

1164
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,980
Don't they have the...

1165
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,140
Do they have a four point shot in the WNBA?

1166
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,260
I heard they have a 100 point shot.

1167
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,300
They don't have a four point shot in the WNBA?

1168
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,900
I do think that dunking should be a golden snitch

1169
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,700
in the WNBA where if somebody dunks,

1170
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,180
it should end the game, you win instantly.

1171
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,020
Yeah.

1172
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,060
In lacrosse, women's lacrosse, they don't have like a,

1173
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,300
you can't, it's not contact, and you can't,

1174
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,180
like the fucking holder, whatever that shit's called,

1175
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,220
the lacrosse stick doesn't have like a pocket in it.

1176
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,340
It's just like a flat piece of like very tightly.

1177
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,180
- Do they have ringless football?

1178
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,480
- I genuinely got the WNBA and the Globetrotters mixed up.

1179
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,140
- Yeah, I would say that those are the two most

1180
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,580
different things in the world if you've watched.

1181
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,120
I went and saw the Globetrotters when I was a kid.

1182
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,960
Yeah.

1183
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,260
They played some sorry team, the Washington something.

1184
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,100
And let me tell you what, man.

1185
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,020
These commanders are a bunch of fucking jabronis.

1186
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,300
They weren't commanders, they were generals.

1187
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,120
Generals.

1188
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,860
Oh, the commanders is the football team.

1189
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,200
Yeah, commanders are a real team.

1190
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,900
But yeah, dude, these generals.

1191
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,400
Listen, if the Globetrotters ever come to your town,

1192
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,520
definitely go see 'em.

1193
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,440
If the generals ever come to your town,

1194
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,200
don't go see these guys, they're bums.

1195
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,620
And they cheat, too, they're dirty.

1196
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,420
We live close to their stadium.

1197
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,780
I mean, not close, but you know,

1198
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,220
where it's a train ride, a couple trains away.

1199
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,060
We could go there.

1200
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,460
To the Harlem Globetrotters?

1201
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,300
Yeah.

1202
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,120
Where do they stay?

1203
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,960
Where do they stay?

1204
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,020
I thought they go all around the world

1205
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,860
based on their name.

1206
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,680
Yeah, they globetrot.

1207
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,580
They're from Harlem, but they trot.

1208
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,660
When's the next game in Harlem?

1209
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,380
The home game?

1210
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,860
Yeah, when's the next home game?

1211
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,700
I don't wanna see,

1212
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,540
they already have such an advantage on the road.

1213
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,580
I would hate to see a hometown advantage, home stadium.

1214
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,620
they would be destroying whoever they're--

1215
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,620
- It would be so funny to be like a fuckin'

1216
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,540
sports ball kinda guy about the Globetrotters,

1217
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,340
like going there and just being like.

1218
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,600
(laughing)

1219
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,860
Go team!

1220
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,120
(laughing)

1221
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,500
- Oh yeah, it's so cool when you balance

1222
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,700
the balls on your head.

1223
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,780
Yeah, that's seriously gonna get you a job after this.

1224
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,740
Oh, oh, did he get a field goal?

1225
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,580
Did he get a four point field goal from half court?

1226
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,860
Is that type of guy still running around?

1227
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,300
No, I think that's been...

1228
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,300
We squashed him out, we exterminated him.

1229
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Did we get him?

1230
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,860
I feel like everybody who used to be like that is so, so into basketball now.

1231
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,020
Yeah.

1232
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,740
I feel like every one of that type of guy completely got absorbed into basketball and

1233
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,060
they go crazy for it.

1234
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,260
You're pointing at me?

1235
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,860
Yep.

1236
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,760
I was never a sports ball guy, man,

1237
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,180
'cause I always liked bad sports.

1238
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,580
I always, like I liked paintball and shit,

1239
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,020
and I liked football when I was a kid.

1240
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,800
I liked baseball when I was a kid,

1241
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,500
and then I tried to be a sports ball guy

1242
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,800
and my heart wasn't in it.

1243
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,060
Yeah.

1244
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,980
You can't look like you and not like sports a little bit.

1245
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,780
No, I gotta like something.

1246
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,200
Yeah, and also you wear so much sports,

1247
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,980
like vintage sports hats.

1248
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,820
Oh, yeah.

1249
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:07,260
is awesome, by the way, but you wear so many of them that it would be embarrassing.

1250
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,020
Why'd you say which is awesome, by the way?

1251
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:14,940
I was just saying it's awesome to wear hats from different teams that you've never seen.

1252
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,980
Teams, yeah, and not show allegiance to any one of them.

1253
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,460
You don't care about at all.

1254
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:18,820
That's cool.

1255
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,580
I'm putting on for different cities.

1256
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,060
I would literally never in a million years wear a piece of merchandise for a sports team

1257
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,420
that I didn't like or support or know about.

1258
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,220
I would rather kill myself as a matter of honor.

1259
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:37,220
But it's cool for Patrick to have just absolutely zero courage or backbone where he's just flipped

1260
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:41,300
courage depending on what what oh what a little too much courage a little misplaced.

1261
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,300
I like me.

1262
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,380
Have you ever seen me wear a Yankees hat I would never touch a Yankees hat.

1263
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,380
Here's my senior.

1264
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,220
I support every other support.

1265
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,460
I support every team but the Yankees.

1266
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,300
You like any team that covers your bald spot man.

1267
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,860
You don't care about these teams at all.

1268
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,200
I would never wear a Yankees hat bro.

1269
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,200
You would.

1270
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Uh uh.

1271
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
No I wouldn't.

1272
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,560
had if it was old enough. No. That's just because you were born in the wrong place. You were

1273
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,480
born in a bad place. I was not born in a bad place. Yeah you were. That's actually, that's

1274
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:15,520
allegiance, that's courage, that's having a backbone. And you're saying, oh well. You

1275
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,960
know what team, I hate this other team so much because they hate the team from the state

1276
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,000
next door. How embarrassing is that dude? That's not embarrassing at all. That's embarrassing.

1277
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,480
At least move to the fucking states. You are a Toronto Raptors fan. That's because they

1278
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,280
They were the coolest one when I you are a Toronto Raptors fan.

1279
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,180
Yeah, you are you she wrote you are exactly like Drake.

1280
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,380
I'm not in a good way.

1281
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,580
Thank you in the corny way.

1282
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,780
Thank you so much like Drake in the corny way.

1283
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,280
Drake is actually growing everywhere.

1284
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,480
I think he broke think he from the six.

1285
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,680
I'm not from the six.

1286
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,380
I don't want to even go to Toronto.

1287
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,880
I liked Kyle Lowry because he was you had a similar build.

1288
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh, so bad.

1289
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,880
I'm scared of it.

1290
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,480
Right now.

1291
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,880
Caleb is he's close.

1292
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,680
he's closing every time he closes his eyes he imagines a new type of poutine.

1293
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
That actually sounds pretty good.

1294
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,680
Y'all having a Reddit off?

1295
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Do you guys?

1296
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,200
Damn, that's actually savage as fuck.

1297
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,760
You are the weakest link.

1298
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,920
Yeah, you are the weakest link in terms of Reddit.

1299
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,920
In Reddit.

1300
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,920
You're like Godzilla.

1301
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,360
You're being Reddit right now with your damn MCU overlay.

1302
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,640
What you talking about?

1303
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,840
Speaking of Toronto, okay, wait.

1304
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,960
You're supposed to put your face in that.

1305
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,760
Your suit looks amazing, actually, now that I'm looking at this.

1306
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,320
It doesn't really fit you, though, I'm going to be honest.

1307
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,360
Speaking of the Raptors, buddy, I'm tired of you talking about the Raptors.

1308
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,800
Speaking of Toronto...

1309
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,920
You're sitting there in your Raptors flat bill.

1310
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,960
No, I don't.

1311
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
This is a...

1312
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
I don't have a...

1313
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
I wish I did.

1314
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,960
Would you get one?

1315
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:47,960
I have a 2019 championship t-shirt.

1316
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,320
It was $40, man.

1317
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,800
Listen, I have...

1318
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
That's vintage.

1319
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
I have started listening...

1320
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:54,800
2019 championship, that's vintage.

1321
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,640
I'm hearing this kind of music, speaking of Toronto, because there's a lot of like

1322
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,760
patois speakers there. What is this type of music that I've been hearing every single

1323
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,400
time I walk down the street where it's a Jamaican guy and he's always saying something like,

1324
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,760
"Your pussy so, I need your pussy, it smells, your pussy is so smellily stinkily, pussy,

1325
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,640
pussy, pussy." What is this pussy music? Is this reggaeton?

1326
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,720
I like, you know, I do like, have you, you hear this like the, like you're in Bushwick or

1327
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,720
whatever you hear it, dude, like going down the...

1328
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:26,720
It might be grunge based on the...

1329
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,580
What, why is it so, they say pussy, they're throwing pussy here and there, I smell their

1330
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,580
pussy, I put, I lick her pussy...

1331
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:33,920
Here and there?

1332
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,480
Here and everywhere, here, there, everywhere I'm hearing pussy, pussy, pussy, I'm trying

1333
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
to walk...

1334
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,480
Here, there, and everywhere, that's the Beatles.

1335
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,080
I'm trying to walk down the street with my children and I'm hearing pussy, pussy, pussy,

1336
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,080
pussy, pussy...

1337
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,240
I think it's based on the details you just given, I do think it is the Beatles you're

1338
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,240
hearing.

1339
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
not have Jamaican accents and you're thinking of...

1340
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,240
No, you're thinking of... You have been hearing

1341
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240
"Pussy, Pussy, Pussy

1342
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,240
Marijuana" by Andy Milonakis.

1343
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Could have been that. That's what you've been hearing.

1344
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
But have you been hearing these

1345
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
like... When I lived in Bushwick

1346
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
I would hear this every

1347
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,240
like day because somebody

1348
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,240
would drive down the street. These like

1349
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,240
reggaeton songs that sound like they're being

1350
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
sung by a little alien.

1351
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
Can you sing one? You know these ones?

1352
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,240
They're like...

1353
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,680
♪ Da da da da da da da da ♪

1354
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,400
- Yes, yeah.

1355
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,740
Well, there's that one that's like,

1356
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,880
♪ D-S-O, digga digga dig ♪

1357
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,080
♪ D-S-O ♪

1358
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,320
I hear that one so much.

1359
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,240
- No, that is so crazy.

1360
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,040
- It's really good. - That is the craziest kind of,

1361
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,520
it's so sick.

1362
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,440
- It's for dancing. - To just play that.

1363
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,840
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

1364
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,200
- I love all that stuff.

1365
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,800
- Listening to that in the car is crazy though.

1366
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,880
You can't be dancing in the damn car.

1367
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,720
You can't be dancing behind the wheel.

1368
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,680
- Oh, has someone ever danced in the car before?

1369
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,340
I've done carpool karaoke.

1370
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,580
You have not done carpool karaoke.

1371
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,420
No, you haven't, man.

1372
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,360
Not officially.

1373
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,800
Not officially on the show.

1374
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,520
Not sanctioned carpool karaoke.

1375
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,360
No, no, no, not with JC.

1376
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,080
Amateur carpool karaoke.

1377
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,680
But I've done it very amateurly.

1378
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,000
I've done it, I almost did it in an Uber one time.

1379
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,040
You almost did it in an Uber?

1380
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,040
It was, I was coming back from some shoot

1381
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,460
we were doing at Emerson,

1382
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,380
and the Uber driver turned on all these lights

1383
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,500
and was telling me about how he used to be Peter Dinklage's neighbor.

1384
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,780
And he was supposed to be like a he was like, yeah, I was in this movie

1385
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,260
called Smithereens.

1386
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,980
I played a young boy and I was going to be a famous guy.

1387
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,340
But now I do carpool karaoke sometimes.

1388
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,660
Check this out.

1389
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,780
Turn off the fucking flashing lights on.

1390
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,500
But he didn't let you sing a song.

1391
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,420
I told him that I didn't want to sing because I had to poop and pee so bad.

1392
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,020
Oh my God, I would have done Ring Me The Life.

1393
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,020
He stopped at a Dunkin' Donuts for me,

1394
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,020
and he was actually a five-star driver.

1395
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,020
If I did something like that...

1396
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,020
He stopped at a Dunkin' Donuts for you?

1397
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,020
Yes.

1398
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,020
For you to walk in or at a drive-thru?

1399
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,020
To walk in and piss and shit.

1400
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,020
Whoa.

1401
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,020
You shit? He let you shit?

1402
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,020
Yeah.

1403
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
What the fuck?

1404
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,020
That was five-star, five-star, 30% tip.

1405
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,020
That's six-star.

1406
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,020
That's insane. He let you take a shit while he's on the clock?

1407
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,020
Yeah, well, he was like, "I'm hungry anyway.

1408
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,020
I'm gonna go to the Dunkin' Donuts."

1409
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,700
beautiful would it be? This is when I lived on the Revere Mulden line. If you get into

1410
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,540
that Uber and you pick a song that has like a very famous duet or something and you're

1411
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:26,100
like I really want to sing this song. I got you babe. Yeah. You know what? Buddy punch

1412
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,620
out. I'm going to tip you $100. You come, you sit in my fucking apartment with me. We're

1413
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:36,860
going to do karaoke on my TV. Yeah, I don't like, I love. I have a karaoke machine in

1414
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,660
my house. A karaoke machine is just a computer, man, and a TV.

1415
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,960
You too, it's a Roku. You just need a fucking

1416
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,960
microphone that's got a lot of reverb. That's all you need.

1417
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,460
You can just sing. That's what makes a good karaoke.

1418
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,320
Yeah, you don't even need a mic. You don't need a microphone in your house.

1419
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,220
No, you need that microphone with the reverb, dude.

1420
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,260
You just gotta yell.

1421
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,320
Just yell loud enough and have a high ceiling.

1422
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,760
Yeah, I guess that works too.

1423
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,660
But I like the digital reverb.

1424
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
What's up with you and reverb today?

1425
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,160
I'm thinking about it.

1426
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
Why?

1427
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,360
Why do they put movies in reverb?

1428
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,660
They should.

1429
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,360
They should get an option.

1430
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,160
They do that.

1431
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,660
What movies in fucking... I want to watch movies in reverb.

1432
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:32,560
The new... I heard the Barbie movie they released it in reverb.

1433
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,860
That should be an option when you go...

1434
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,460
When you go into the movie theaters, there should be two theaters like they have for captions.

1435
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,960
You should be able to go see one with maximum reverb, everything echoing.

1436
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,460
And also there should be bats in the movie theater when that happens.

1437
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,100
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1438
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,900
So you feel like you're in a cave and little water droplet sounds.

1439
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,800
OK, they should do a movie theater like they do with those

1440
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,340
where you can go into the the like.

1441
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,140
What's it called?

1442
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:00,900
It's like not really a sauna, but it's like a storm simulator, like a pool.

1443
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,600
And there's lightning flashes and thunder sounds and rain coming from the ceiling.

1444
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Do you know what I'm talking about? Have you seen those?

1445
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
That should be a movie theater.

1446
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,600
Rainforest Cafe style movie theater.

1447
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,600
I went to the Alamo Draft House

1448
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,600
and I was walking in there saying

1449
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
"Oh, which side am I going to pick? Cowboys or Indians?"

1450
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
They don't have anything like this at the Alamo

1451
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,600
Draft House, dude. It's literally just...

1452
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Especially at Alamo Draft House

1453
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,600
they would not say "Indians" when referring

1454
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
to the natives.

1455
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Make it themed a little bit.

1456
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
Does that have to do with Native Americans?

1457
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,600
Make it themed. That's what I'm saying.

1458
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,800
understanding my point at all. I'm not understanding your point at all. Make it themed.

1459
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,600
Yeah, make it themed like the Alamo. Yeah. Probably was back in the day, but then all the hipsters came in.

1460
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:46,760
It's more, it seemed a little bit more like the Draft House. I agree. It's honestly themed like a movie

1461
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,240
theater, you guys. Yeah. This is barely themed like anything. Put a couple, let me, give me a

1462
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,840
sheriff star when I walk in. Make me feel like it's the old west or something. They should have each

1463
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:01,800
screen in a movie theater. Each theater in there should have a different theme, and you pick,

1464
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,160
they rotate the movies through them throughout the week.

1465
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,960
So you pick what theme you want to see the movie in. I agree.

1466
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,960
I should be able to go watch hereditary in like a race car bed.

1467
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,840
Yeah. Oh dude. Imagine.

1468
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,960
Oh, 80% of the way to race car beds.

1469
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,400
You put your head outside the window on the race car bed, right?

1470
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,080
And the fucking chair, the car reverberates.

1471
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,840
Oh, that'd be cool.

1472
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,440
The head stacks on the tree.

1473
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,480
But you make a very good point, Cameron, which is we are having comfortflation

1474
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,160
at every single movie theater in America.

1475
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,520
Every movie theater seat goes all the way

1476
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,960
to a straight line backwards.

1477
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,960
And I, there's a direct correlation

1478
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,620
between how much, how comfortable these seats have gotten

1479
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,680
and how many times a year I'm falling asleep

1480
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,300
in a movie that I paid for.

1481
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,160
Yeah. Yep.

1482
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,400
I'm not even getting the movie that I paid for.

1483
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,500
When I was at a,

1484
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,680
I can't even remember what movie I was seeing.

1485
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,040
Oh, it might've been the,

1486
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,240
no, it was fucking the Meg 2.

1487
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,640
I went to see the Meg 2.

1488
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,480
Well, first of all, like six people walked out in the first hour.

1489
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,140
Awesome.

1490
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,940
But one guy who didn't walk out was reclined his seat all the way.

1491
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,240
He was sitting in front of me and then he rolled over onto his side.

1492
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,420
It's like, you know, you lie in bed on your side,

1493
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,920
like on his hands, and then he took out his phone and was just scrolling.

1494
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,120
Well, he just goes to sleep.

1495
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,400
That's awesome.

1496
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,960
Bringing a white noise machine into the theater.

1497
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,300
Just doing the pose of like having your knees bent and your legs.

1498
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,400
That's so funny.

1499
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,460
Looking up at the person next to you to.

1500
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:33,400
And he was with someone.

1501
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,000
He was like he was clearly like he's somebody wanted to see the movie

1502
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,440
and he was like, OK, I'll go with you.

1503
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,000
And then the part where there's like, fuck it, I'm going to pretend I'm going to sleep.

1504
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,600
That is so fucking awesome.

1505
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,360
I'm going to do my bedtime routine real quick

1506
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,960
so I can muster up the tiredness to fall asleep during this movie.

1507
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,440
He was winding down, dude.

1508
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,700
Yeah. Getting up and going to get some warm milk from the from the lobby.

1509
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,860
Drinking, drinking, rubbing your eyes.

1510
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,620
- Do you guys have any warm--

1511
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,260
- God, this movie is so fucking boring,

1512
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,580
but I need to read for 30 minutes with my nightlight

1513
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,820
before I'll be able to fall asleep.

1514
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,900
- I have to read a bunch of Wikipedia pages

1515
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,220
for other movies that I know about.

1516
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,380
- Guys, I can't sleep.

1517
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,460
Can I come stay with you behind the concession stand?

1518
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,700
(laughing)

1519
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,060
- I flew up in a Fido.

1520
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,740
(laughing)

1521
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,100
- I think that's a good idea, man.

1522
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,460
More people should be at least trying to fall asleep

1523
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,300
in a movie theater.

1524
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,300
I fell asleep.

1525
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,320
I went to I saw scanners

1526
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,100
at like a like a midnight

1527
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,060
thirty five millimeter print thing

1528
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,580
at the corner.

1529
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,020
That's that's a boring movie.

1530
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,060
Well, yeah, dude, I want to see

1531
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:38,960
part in it.

1532
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,260
Yeah, I feel like maybe

1533
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:42,380
that's a cool music.

1534
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,600
I think I was up for twenty four

1535
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,380
hours and I just fell asleep there

1536
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:48,220
and the tickets were like twelve

1537
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,940
bucks. And I was like, yeah, I

1538
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,500
guess it's worth it.

1539
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,420
When you me and Joe

1540
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,180
and Alex went to see the

1541
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:01,020
birds at the film forum and you fell asleep during it and you started snoring really loud.

1542
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:01,740
Oh did I?

1543
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:08,300
Everyone was quiet and you just started going *snoring*.

1544
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,660
I forgot I did that.

1545
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,700
I was shaking you.

1546
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:19,580
That's so, oh my god. That, okay, that movie is a fucking, it's pretty fucking boring.

1547
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,100
Yeah, it was just so funny. We were all laughing so hard.

1548
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,140
Perfect storm for me to fall asleep

1549
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,820
Please full actually. Oh, yeah. Yeah

1550
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,620
Snores my snores are fucking crazy. I mean you guys both know

1551
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:42,100
You literally need to get a CPAP machine or else you will die before you turn 30

1552
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,500
I'm gonna die from something else before I turn 30, but why not leave?

1553
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,740
my coke

1554
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,740
my coca-cola not

1555
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:58,300
I said fentanyl in my coke and then did actually mean Coca-Cola like I was trying to joke.

1556
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,300
Dude, you're a drug addict.

1557
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,300
You're making this public now that you're addicted to cocaine, you do it every single second of every day.

1558
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,300
It's not, I'm not addicted to cocaine.

1559
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,300
Fully addicted, completely habitual, can't even breathe.

1560
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,300
I don't do that every single morning.

1561
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,300
You can't wake up without it.

1562
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,300
And then drink a coffee and then drink a bang energy and then drink a...

1563
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,860
- When you say, "Oh, it's just a key bump,"

1564
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,800
little do you know, it's one of these giant keys

1565
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,140
that goes into a dungeon door.

1566
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:25,100
He's doing a humongous pile.

1567
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:25,940
- The key to the city?

1568
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,740
- A key bump with, yeah, the key to the city?

1569
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,040
I was just gonna say that.

1570
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,620
(laughing)

1571
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,900
- A giant-ass key.

1572
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,260
- I'm just gonna do a quick key bump.

1573
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,100
- There's a key bump.

1574
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,140
- The Dungeon Tailor's key ring of like,

1575
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,700
- The bag is the same size.

1576
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,540
The bag is the same size as the key to the city, too,

1577
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:44,620
so you have to hold it with your whole arm.

1578
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,320
You're pouring it on like you're making bread at Panera,

1579
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,220
like laid in a giant bag of flour directly onto a huge key.

1580
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,220
Yeah.

1581
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:53,720
Yeah.

1582
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,220
Oh, I found that I went through my Shazams while we were talking

1583
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,120
about the...

1584
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,220
What kind of weird behavior is that?

1585
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,220
I went through my Shazams because...

1586
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,820
You shouldn't have Shazams.

1587
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,920
You're trying to remember songs that you couldn't remember?

1588
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,520
I was telling you about the time that the reggaeton was playing

1589
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,920
from some guy's car so loud that I heard it so clear in my apartment that I was able to

1590
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,680
shazam it and figure out what the song was.

1591
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,680
Wow.

1592
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:30,080
And it's called Manhattan Pa El Bronx by El Cherry Scum and Do Bwa Mantana.

1593
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,080
That sounds pretty good.

1594
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,080
It sounds like this.

1595
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:37,040
It seems pretty normal.

1596
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,040
This just sounds like a normal.

1597
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,040
Yeah, that was normal.

1598
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,040
What the hell?

1599
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,040
What the hell?

1600
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
*Music*

1601
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
*Music*

1602
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
*Music*

1603
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,040
That guy sounds cool.

1604
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,040
He does sound cool.

1605
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Yeah I don't think he's... Stop.

1606
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,040
Stop flashbanging us.

1607
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,040
We have to end the episode because they're finding

1608
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,040
toys on the other side of my screen guys.

1609
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,040
I found this.

1610
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,040
Who played Bang?

1611
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Office Space Vibes with this one.

1612
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,040
That is Office Space Vibes.

1613
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,380
take that shit, dog.

1614
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:10,480
Yo, stapler.

1615
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,860
Guys, go check out the world's--

1616
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,400
Underworld's biggest mummy.

1617
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,800
We've never remembered the name one time.

1618
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,080
Well, it's just--

1619
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,320
It's maybe confusing.

1620
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:26,000
Underworld's biggest mummy at swagpoop.com/shows.

1621
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,160
It's a sketch show in Brooklyn on October 20

1622
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,920
at Littlefield with us, Piers Campion, and Home Planet.

1623
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,040
And we were coming up with some funny ass ideas

1624
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,520
that will be quite hilariously to see

1625
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,360
performed live in front of you on stage

1626
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,200
alongside videos and screenings.

1627
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,720
- If you liked our idea of the new office,

1628
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,000
wait until you see the four or five sketches

1629
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,680
we're gonna be doing about it at this fucking show, dude.

1630
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,940
And if you thought that Dianne Feinstein dying was funny,

1631
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,080
we will have some very timely sketches coming out

1632
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,760
in October about this. - About baseball.

1633
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,400
- About baseball. - And to clarify here,

1634
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,080
the show is called World's Biggest Army Presents

1635
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,920
underworld's biggest mummy,

1636
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,480
Port of Skull, Halloween City.

1637
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,640
Yeah, that is a lot.

1638
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,940
If you can remember all of that,

1639
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,760
you can remember to buy tickets at

1640
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:16,760
swagpoop.com/shows.

1641
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,800
All you got to remember is,

1642
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,460
think about this. Start, you think, I

1643
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,460
got to remember something.

1644
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:23,540
Oh, I have to remember something

1645
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,840
about poop. Now, what's poop?

1646
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,080
Poop is kind of swag.

1647
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,080
OK, so swagpoop.com.

1648
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,380
And then you can think, what do I do

1649
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,380
after I poop? Shower.

1650
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:40,440
show is shower showers showers shows swag poop dot com slash shows.

1651
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,320
And then click on the link to event bright dot com.

1652
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,240
And then you're thinking, huh, what does an event make me feel inside scared?

1653
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:54,120
So, Oh, Halloween city, bright rhymes with fright.

1654
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,960
Oh, right.

1655
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,120
Is the name of an emotion, an emotion and the emotion of your

1656
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,360
Your mouse should be over the buy tickets button.

1657
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,280
Oh my god.

1658
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,640
Well you guys figured that out.

1659
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,240
So we're gonna go.

1660
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,240
Alright.

1661
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,240
Woah!

1662
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:19,240
I'm gonna stay completely neutral on the two.

1663
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,760
I'm gonna say my first memory with, I think the first memory I remember is the shadow

1664
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:31,360
of a hot dog poking out in my bedroom when I was a kid.

1665
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,640
I saw the shadow of a hot dog on the wall.

1666
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:38,040
And it was kind of like a come to G like a Batman type moment.

1667
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,280
Come moment. Nope.

1668
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,000
Come to Jesus shadow.

1669
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,840
I got molested. I'm saying I saw the shadow of a hot dog.

1670
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,920
Are you trying to say seeing a shadow of a bat?

1671
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,080
Are you saying shadow?

1672
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,280
Oh, did he see the full bet?

1673
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,960
I don't know. I thought he saw the shadow of the moon.

1674
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,120
My bad. So you got attacked by a hot dog.

1675
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,080
No, I was attacked by burgers,

1676
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,720
but I saw the shadow of a hot dog that saved me.

1677
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,580
And there's nothing about molestation in this.

1678
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,900
Why are you bringing up molesting on the high hamburger versus hot dog debate?

1679
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,380
Well, you brought up the shadow of a hot dog on your bedroom wall.

1680
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,300
Which kind of makes it, it feels like that's what you're getting at.

1681
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,020
It feels like you were trying the way you were kind of laughing when you were saying it.

1682
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,700
I was imagining a hot dog style Batman.

1683
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,540
But what is the shadow?

1684
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:23,980
Why would you be a shadow?

1685
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
Is because Batman is of the night hero.

1686
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,380
That's a shadow.

1687
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,700
Is Batman of the night?

1688
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:35,600
What are you saying? Like you bats are a bat man, like a shadow of the night.

1689
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,440
Is that what you just said? Just move on.

1690
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,540
We're not even going to get anywhere.

1691
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,900
This actually makes the most sense to me is what I was trying to say.

1692
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,260
What makes the most sense to you?

1693
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,420
This is what you're trying to say. Is that a hot, a hot dog as Batman on a plate?

1694
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,900
You're making no sense.

1695
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,180
You're something is wrong. I feel like I just went crazy trying to puzzle out.

1696
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,500
Can you answer, did you actually say a hot dog is, or a shadow is the Batman of the night?

1697
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,500
Or did I?

1698
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,540
Was I like falling asleep?

1699
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,540
I heard that too.

1700
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:08,580
