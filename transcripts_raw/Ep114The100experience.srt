00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,560
Caleb's trying to make himself cry.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,920
You'll never make yourself cry.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,360

Cameron already came. I was going to say I'm Money Weinstein and then I realized that that

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040

"How's it going, everybody?

My name is Wesley."

75
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Wow.

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
That's not how it sounded in the early versions.

77
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Yeah, when we were practicing before we started recording.

78
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,840
It sounded kind of like sick Dracula.

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Dracula with a stuffy nose.

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Yeah, well that's what happens when Dracula eats garlic.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
He gets...

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
He's allergic.

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
He's allergic to it.

84
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah.

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Do you think he has normal allergies too?

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Do you think Dracula has chronic fatigue?

87
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah, that's why he's up at night.

88
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
And that's why he's asleep all the time.

89
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Yeah.

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,840

00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,540
- That's right.

99
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,360

100
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,200
- Who's his doctor?

101
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040

- Dr. Jekyll.

108
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,860

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,200
there yeah it's a water bed have you guys ever been on a water bed no my mom's

142
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
mom's boss had a waterbed and I would go over to her house.

143
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
You were sleeping on your mom's boss's bed?

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Yeah, when I would fuck her in the face.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
No, my mom's boss had a boss that the office was just like a room in her house.

146
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Yeah. And so we would go over there and my mom would be like,

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
"To keep you entertained, you can go jump on the waterbed."

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh yeah, baby.

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
And I would just feel, I would mold the water, because you can move the water around.

150
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
And I would sculpt a beautiful water.

151
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
The shape of water.

152
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
The shape of water.

153
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Nice.

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
See, if I had a waterbed, I would get a clear one and I would put a fish in it.

155
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,340
What movie is it? Hellraiser or is it Nightmare on Elm Street where there's a dead woman in the water bed?

156
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,980
It's your life. That's my life. You're right. I got mixed up.

157
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,980
There's a dead girl in my water bed!

158
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,540
I'm gonna sleep on it anyway.

159
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,620
I feel like I'd be more comfortable on like a chowder bed. Yeah.

160
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah, a peanut butter bed.

161
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,660
A peanut butter bed would feel great. That'd be awesome to mold your body. The water bed, you feel like you're sinking.

162
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,340
This is kind of like a peanut butter bed.

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,140
This is a good peanut butter bed that we're all laying on together.

164
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,940
Like all the grandparents in Willy Wonka.

165
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Yeah.

166
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
One of them.

167
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,260
The grandparents in Willy Wonka were definitely 69ing.

168
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,860
Second the camera turned off, they were not actors.

169
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Oh yeah.

170
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,260
They weren't actors, they were grandpas.

171
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,940
They found them there and then they wrote the movie around that scene.

172
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,660
Yeah, they found them living in the studio in one of the prop beds.

173
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
They're like, "Damn."

174
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Just all fucking stuck to each other.

175
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
"Y'all look like some grandparents to me."

176
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,340
Y'all look like a chain link fence and I'm gonna turn you into movie stars.

177
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,380
Pause the orgy for like two minutes, we'll get the take we need, you guys can go back

178
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,380
to it.

179
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
Yeah, that's actually just the lemon party guys.

180
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,540
Yeah, it's true, Grandpa Joe did a lemon party.

181
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,620
Uh oh, Grandpa Joe did a lemon party.

182
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,620
Oh my god.

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,260
Yep, talking about Joe Biden.

184
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,700
Joe Biden was in lemon party.

185
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,820
Look closely, he's the one, you can see him.

186
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
He's the one.

187
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
He's the one getting sucked.

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Wow.

189
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,140
It's funny, I was thinking about like shock sites that were just, just like a guy's penis.

190
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,340
Yeah, it's just gay porn.

191
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Yeah, like how is meat spin like...

192
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,540
Whatever, dude.

193
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,040
Yeah.

194
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,840
I've done meat spin in the mirror before.

195
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,340
Yeah.

196
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,840
[laughter]

197
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
I have!

198
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,340
But the point of meat spin is you show it to a girl and they don't know what a penis is.

199
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,540
They think it's an alien.

200
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,840
Oh, it freaks them out.

201
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah, they think it's a...

202
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,340
It's to find out if a girl's straight or gay.

203
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,840
Yeah.

204
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,340
So then you can see if you want to be married to her.

205
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,040
Man, I gotta go pee right at the top of the episode this time.

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,740
That's alright.

207
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,340
I'll be right back.

208
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,840
Oh my god.

209
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Dude.

210
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,540
Oh my god.

211
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,580
This mean- the Matt and Pat project.

212
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,080
Uh huh.

213
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm Matt.

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,580
Matt Caleb.

215
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,080
Matt Caleb and Pat- Matt- Matt Rick.

216
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,580
Mm-hmm.

217
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,080
Finally the Patrick and Caleb project starts.

218
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
The Patrick and Caleb project will commence.

219
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
This is what I'm gonna call our house when we get married.

220
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
It's not gonna happen.

221
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
It's happening.

222
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,580
It can't happen.

223
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Why do you think I drove all the way up here?

224
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
It can't happen.

225
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,080
Why?

226
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
Because it's not legal.

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
It is legal. They made it legal in all 50 states.

228
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
No they didn't.

229
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,580
Legalize it!

230
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Gay marriage!

231
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,820
Legalize gay marriage. Oh, oh

232
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,380
Damn legalize a body boy

233
00:10:46,380 --> 00:11:03,660
Man that's the best I think body boys the best homophobic slur it's the best one. It's so funny

234
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,580
It's not even close cuz yeah, you know why I do I ever does cuz I don't know what it means exactly

235
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,260
I have no idea what I'm saying.

236
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,860
It's probably so bad.

237
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,980
Yeah, do you ever feel like, you know when you're in your room at night and you're making

238
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,020
up Chinese and you're...

239
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,420
Do you ever feel like you say just like the worst thing ever?

240
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,420
No.

241
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,420
You say the worst word.

242
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,460
You're making up Chinese, it's probably pretty bad.

243
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,460
Nah, come on.

244
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,460
Nah.

245
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,580
But at some point you say like the version of bitch in Chinese, you know?

246
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580

247
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,900

252
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,380

253
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,340
travel to or this will decide whether you're allowed to travel. Sorry I was trying to out some Chinese.

254
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:04,420

255
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,980

The way you can speak Chinese you just describe what the different symbols look like.

270
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah, it's kind of like a tic-tac-toe board if you were losing real bad.

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,440
That's Chinese for boy and girl in the bathrooms.

283
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,160
Tree.

284
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah.

285
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,480
Yeah.

286
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,640
Bingo.

287
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,280
You have an evil bag in your room.

288
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,780
Yeah.

289
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,560
It's moving around.

290
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,800
Evil bag spinning.

291
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,720
Evil bag--

292
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
I got to get my boards fixed on the wall.

293
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,000
I got to fix that.

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,440
You gotta get treatment for your disease, man.

295
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,280
- Yep. - Yeah.

296
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,760
- It's burning you up.

297
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
- It's burning me up inside and out.

298
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,960
- Do you guys think we'll get COVID after this?

299
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
- Probably. - Probably, right?

300
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,140
- Most likely.

301
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,840
- What do you think we're gonna, like, we'll get COVID?

302
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,600
- I think we'll get back, I think me and Caleb

303
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,760
will get back home and then in four or five days

304
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,600
we'll have COVID.

305
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
- That'd be pretty sick. - That'd be my prediction.

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
- And then I won't have it.

307
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
- Well, luckily we stashed these episodes away

308
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,360
so we won't have to do anything.

309
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,440
- Exactly. - Right.

310
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
- That's true. - We thought ahead.

311
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,880
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

312
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,720
- Yeah, we got negative tests, which is good.

313
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,560
- Yeah.

314
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,840
- We'll still get it though.

315
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,880
- Yeah, we could still get it.

316
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,040
- We definitely will.

317
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,920
These cats are Patient Zero.

318
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,320
- No, absolutely.

319
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,160
- Yeah.

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,980
- No, they're not.

321
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,820
- Yeah, they are.

322
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,920
- They look like bats to me. - Patient Zero is me.

323
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,760
- Oh, really?

324
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,720
You're the one who--

325
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,560
- It's my fault.

326
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,880
- So you came up with it?

327
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,960
- Why'd you do it?

328
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,020
- Boredom.

329
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,000
- I was just bored.

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
- I was just bored.

331
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,520
- I wanted to get history moving again.

332
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,680
- Yeah, they canceled a baseball game.

333
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,680
I just I didn't like I wanted to see and want the election to happen

Oh, I can hate the post office. I hate sitting in line. Yeah, he waiting in line the fucking party

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,540
Yeah, man, I just like fucking you know when you go to the beach

359

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,540
Yeah, baby me. I never lit a candle

Maybe the red arrow. Yeah, you're a yeah, they gave me a burritos all french fries. Yeah. Yeah hell. It's pretty good though

363
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,060
It was pretty good but it destroyed my body.

364
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,060
It was just too many french fries. There was like no chicken in it.

365
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,060
There was too many french fries in there.

366
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
Then they gave us a box of french fries. There's too many in there too.

367
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
French fries were good though.

368
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Yeah, but there's too many of them.

369
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,060
You gotta make it more expensive, less french fries.

370
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,060
Also, I need some cheese on them fries.

371
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm gonna need a gold bar.

372
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,060
I'm gonna need you to put a gold bar into my bank account.

373
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,260
- Yeah, I'm gonna need you to give me my money back.

374
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
- Here's a get rich quick scheme.

375
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,740
Go to McDonald's, yeah, can I have a hamburger

376
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,220
double cheeseburger with $100 in the middle of it?

377
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,820
- Yeah, instead of a slice of cheese on my filet of fish.

378
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,380
- Can't you put $200 bills?

379
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,580
- $200 bills?

380
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,420
- Yeah, that'd be funny.

381
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,900
- No, wait, the filet of fish you can't do it with

382
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,060
'cause there's a half slice.

383
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,460
- There was like that McDonald's hack

384
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,220
where if you go to the ordering kiosk,

385
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,020
you could order 10 hamburgers with no patties, only buns,

386
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,740
and it would cost negative 10 cents or something.

387
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,580
- What?

388
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,980
like patched after like a day or two but for a little you can actually McDonald's

389
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,940

00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,460
and the poor cashier is just like trying to keep up.

397

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,260
didn't even have to buy the Big Mac.

400
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,100
- Didn't even have to pay.

401
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,940
- Like you, you made more money.

402
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,900
- You know how much a Big Mac costs?

403
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,540
- 60 bucks, that's a fucked up.

404
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,980
- Yeah, dude, triple A Big Macs nowadays.

405
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,900
- Yeah, I think I might eat a Big Mac after this.

406
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,740
- Yeah?

407
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,580
- I would not.

408
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,940
- I've been, I would say every six months

409
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,160
I get a, I have a strong consideration

410
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
for like seven days. - I don't think about it.

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm like, "Man, I should get a Big Mac."

412
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Now I'm thinking about it.

413
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I've eaten McDonald's once since this whole pandemic.

414
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
I've eaten McChicken.

415
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
I made a vegan Big Mac.

416
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Yeah, me too, actually.

417
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Yeah, I've got my chicken.

418
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
I used to be a McDonald's twice a week guy.

419
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Yeah.

420
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm the same.

421
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I was McDonald's once a week for a while in LA.

422
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I just don't do it anymore.

423
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Now I'm Arby's.

424
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,600
I would have been twice a week, but I was just like drew that line in the sand.

425
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,160
I was like, "If I'm at McDonald's twice a week, I might as well just be dead."

426
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,800
I got switched over to Arby's while we lived in LA.

427
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I eat Arby's.

428
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,160
I had Arby's a few times.

429
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,900
It's pretty good dude Arby's is my life. My dad's Jeep used to be full of Arby's rappers

430
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:41,280
Yeah, yeah, you mean R&B singers R&B rappers singer R&B Jason Derulo, Tay Zonday

431
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,360
Yeah, these guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he'd said my dad would sing sexy love with a neo

432
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,440
My dad was in sexy love with neo

433
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,320
Matrix, yep, he'd sit down

434
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,320
It's a sexy neo

435
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:08,720
Today the list. Top 10 rare things more likely to happen than winning the lottery from Dark

436
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,900
Shadow. Read the intro. Everyone's heard of the lottery. Everyone hopes to someday be

437
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,720
lucky enough to have the winning ticket but it's really rare the Mega Millions is one

438
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,720
in 302.6 million odds and the Powerball is one in 292.2 million.

439
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,360
Either way, it's extremely rare. There are some

440
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,200
strange or interesting things that are surprisingly more likely.

441
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,440
Okay. Wow. Okay. Okay.

442
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,800
Number one has become president of the US, one in 100 million.

443
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,200
I feel like that's not true. I don't know if you can put numbers on it like that.

444
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,000
That's not true. Here's the thing, if you...

445
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, they kind of fuck it up because you only are counting towards the odds of winning the

446
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
lottery if you buy a lottery ticket.

447
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Right.

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,520
If you are born, you are-

449
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,960
You don't just become the president.

450
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, no.

451
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,000
You don't enter into the competition to become the president just by being born.

452
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
Yeah, the odds of becoming the president are pretty high.

453
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,600
Patrick, stop leaning back in that fucking chair, you idiot.

454
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
If you're a Kennedy, pretty damn high.

455
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,520
No, odds of becoming a president is always one in two because you're either the Republican

456
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
or the Democrat.

457
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
One of them is going to get there.

458
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
True.

459
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
It depends which one wins.

460
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Yeah.

461
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,680

Terry Shivo got stuck- that was the whole thing.

He was like, "Do we let her out?"

477

No, we're not gonna let out- we're not letting Terry Shivo out.

478
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,840

I'm eating shit. I'm ill sick.

502
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,040
I think I told you guys this before, just one of the best jokes I ever heard was like

503
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,840
why do Pringles come in a tube so you have something to shit in after you're done eating

504
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
them. That's good.

505
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,920
My friend told me that in middle school and it's just a perfect joke.

506
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,960
No, it's good. Yeah, it's out of nowhere. I mean, I don't even wait. I eat one Pringle. I'm sitting in there. That's

507
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,880
Yeah

508
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,780
Dude I need to stop eating coffee Pringles you eat one Pringle. There's a rattle in the can, you know

509
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,820
You get there to leave empty space. You got to fill it up

510
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,840
What if you ate one Pringle then you got a squirt brown water in there to muffle the sound of the cans?

511
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,880
It's rattling around so that so that this so that the so that the people in the TSA don't hear the Pringles can stuff

512
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,280
up your pant leg. Yeah, that Pringles tube, it has Terry Shivo on it. She didn't pay for

513
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,980
a ticket. Man, fuck this, I don't want microwaved airplane chicken, I'm bringing my poop Pringles

514
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,180
on the plane in my cargo pants pockets. Man, that Terry Shivo story was like the first news

515

520
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,440

Yeah.

565
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Boston is so stupid.

566
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
It was just some, like, fat Irish cop.

567
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,340
Just like...

568
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,340
He was like, "Oh, whoa! Hey, there's a little triangle guy!"

569
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,340
"There's an alien bomb!"

570
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,840
"The aliens are here! What the fuck?!"

571
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,340
"What the fuck? Let me at 'em!"

572
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,840
[Laughter]

573
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
"Oh my God!"

574
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,340
"What color's the skin? Let me at 'em!"

575
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
"I'm gonna arrest this bomb!"

576
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
[Laughter]

577
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,840
He's putting handcuffs on the bomb.

578
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
"I'm gonna cuff this bomb!"

579
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,400
I'm gonna cuff it up right now. I'm gonna cuff the red wire to the green wire

580
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Number two, yeah, he's trying to take get rid of the moon tonight thing and he actually blows it up

581
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:32,700
Number two is get struck by lightning one in 12,000. Oh, I don't like that's not the Boston be true

582
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,420
Yeah, the Boston police officer sees the the bomb and he's like we got to get this thing out of here and he gets on

583
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,240
a plane

584
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,220
One in 12,000 getting struck by like that's more likely than the fucking president. No, you can't tell me that what would that be like?

585
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,760
300 people a year gets getting struck by lightning. I'm sure yeah, how many people actually that sounds right Google it

586
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:01,400
Getting struck by lightning would be awesome because it would be like drinking an energy drink and it would have no adverse effects

587
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,480
That's a really much like an energy drink

588
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,940
What's the recommended daily doses of getting struck by lightning?

589
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,560
440,000 incidents.

590
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,720
How many people get struck though?

591
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Incidents is different.

592
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,800
You just thought four zeros was two zeros.

593
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
I couldn't see it.

594
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I could see it from here.

595
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,960
240,000 global incidents with lightning.

596
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
That's pretty fucking crazy.

597
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
A year?

598
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Every year.

599
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Yeah.

600
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
That's a lot.

601
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
That is a lot.

602
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,520
Lightning strikes per year.

603
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Yeah.

604
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,320
2,000 people are killed worldwide by lightning.

605
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Yeah.

606
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Annually.

607
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
That's insane.

608
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,300
And most of them happen in those, in countries where people still wear armor.

609
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,300
Yeah, true.

610
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Extrudes of armor and stuff.

611
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,680
Most of them are trying to make, are trying to bring a monster to life.

612
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Mostly happens in Scotland.

613
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah, mostly, it mostly happens to those freaking Instagram influencers who wear the big hoop

614
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
earrings.

615
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,360
Basically 90% of the incidents are with Benjamin Franklin.

616
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
Yeah.

617
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
Yeah.

618
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,000
You tell me, you're telling me he got, his little key got struck?

619
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah.

620
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,560
You're telling me lightning struck another man's key?

621
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay, I think I'm understanding this.

622
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
God is kinda gay.

623
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Okay, God is a little bit of sus right now.

624
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Yeah, I don't believe

625
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Benjamin Franklin got

626
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
struck by lightning.

627
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
He would've died.

628
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
He gave him sexual powers and sent him to France, dude.

629
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Actually, what happened is,

630
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
the lightning shot him so far

631
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
that he landed in France

632
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
in a whorehouse filled with 14 year olds.

633
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
And he was like, "Let me thinky

634
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm gonna likey this."

635
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:48,640
inspired me to invent the $100 bill it's that picture of my face yeah it's

636
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,240
fucking it's scrambled his eyeballs and he had to wear glasses with seven lenses

637
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,640
I would like to use yeah I think I'm gonna invent the Illuminati that's what

638
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,760
he said I'm going to create the Freemasons guys they just had the

639
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,080
craziest idea. He got struck by lightning and he's like I just had a vision what if there's

640
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,480
a pyramid with an eyeball? And yeah it just created a... You gotta stop smoking that lightning

641
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,080
Ben. You always smoking that lightning. Yeah that's how they used to get high. It's from

642
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:29,080
the sky. Lightning is from the earth. Number three win an Olympic gold medal one in 662

643
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
deaths. Yeah these are not chances this is not something where you just roll the dice.

644
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,000
you have to work towards that. You just make stuff up dude. Yeah. Yeah. Chance of stubbing your toe?

645
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,280
One in trillion. Probably one in two. One in two. Every, every, because you have two feet. One in ten.

646
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,800
One in ten because you have ten toes. Yep. Yeah. Wait what's ten times two? It's twenty. So one in twenty.

647
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,120
So it's twenty, one in twenty. I like that you bought yourself time to do the math by asking us.

648
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,600
What's ten by... He was trying to dazzle us. He was trying to, he was trying to show that he could do it.

649
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,280
do it. How fast, yeah. You ladies want to see a magic trick? 2 times 10 is 20. Yeah, you

650
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:12,280
guys want to see a magic trick? 2 plus 2 is 4. Fuckin'. Fuckin'. Hold on, can I start over?

651
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,800
Let me hold that. I could have been- Don't look at my hands when I'm doing the trick!

652
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,880
1, 2, skip a few, 3, 4. He's typing into a calculator. Yeah, 1, 2, skip a few, 4. What's

653
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,880
the highest you guys have ever counted? I counted to 100 when I was in elementary school.

654
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
I counted to a thousand. I counted to a hundred...

655
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,480
It was like a hundred or two hundred so it wasn't very high.

656
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,880
It was actually two hundred.

657
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,680
I definitely, there were days when I was like, "Today I'm gonna count to one million."

658
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,480
And I started counting. I counted to a hundred. I was like, "What am I doing?"

659
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,280
It's super exciting because you hit numbers you forgot existed.

660
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,080
Yeah, and you'll be like, "Whoa, six hundred and eighty."

661
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,580
And you can be like, "Shut the fuck up, mom. I'm counting."

662
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,880
And she'll be like, "Oh, he's learning."

663
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,480
I'm counting! Please get out of my room!

664
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,780
Hello!

668
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,820

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,760
- That's like, that was the first video game.

674
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,600

680
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,000

730
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,580
number five data supermodel data supermodel one in eighty eight

731
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,060
hundred thousand. For me it's- You need to learn to read numbers Patrick. For me it's

732
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,120
eight hundred and eighty thousand. He said eighty eight hundred thousand.

733
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,180
Eighty eight hundred thousand. I've dated eight hundred eighty eight thousand supermodels.

734
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,420
It's a one in eight eighty eight thousand chance. Also if you have-

735
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,500
Interesting choice of numbers at the beginning of that one. If you have like five

736
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,540
thousand dollars and like you started an app this goes way up.

737
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,780
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can date any supermodel for a night if you know

738
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,460
the right person. Yeah. Don't make the cat do mischief. Please don't throw stuff at the

739
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,200
cat. Number six, hit a hole in one in golf. That's probably... One in 12,000? None of these

740
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,020
are chance. I thought... That's the first one though that like... I also think it's higher

741
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,220
than that. Yeah. Like hitting a hole in one is insane in golf. Like maybe for a pro it's

742
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,620
one in 12,000. That's true, yeah. But like normal people will play golf for 50 years

743
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:16,540
never get a hole in one. Yeah. I could get one. I mean I got one my first ever try. You

744
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,500
know? Yeah most of the time I'm not trying to get a hole in one because I don't want

745
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,340
people to like hate me for my skill. I just got a lock in. What I do is I do transcendental

746
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:29,220
meditation. I have a hud flip. I visualize a hole. I get a hud over my eyes like a boner.

747
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,740
And then. And then I use my pee pee to hit the ball. Oh wait using my pee pee to hit

748
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,620
- I need to bowl.

749
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,220

750
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,440

what was it, Henry Ford made a bunch of people square dance

806
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,240

Of why it took us so long to get him right in World War two

813
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,020
Yeah, because he was just like publishing all this propaganda like the protocols of the elders of Zion

Which was like yeah, the Jews are they're all in this big room, right?

824
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,040

And I was like, yes. And then for 10 years I was like, no, he didn't have AIDS.

844
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,040
He was a racist. And now I'm like, Hitler definitely has AIDS.

845
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,160
Oh, that's back.

846
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh, Hitler had AIDS for sure. He still has AIDS. He's in Argentina because they've cured AIDS.

847
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,760
Yeah. Except for Hitler.

848
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,080
100,000 years old.

849
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,880
But there's no cure in that attitude of his. No.

850
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,960
No, he's such a grump. Hitler was one of the biggest grumpsters on planet dumpster.

851
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,500
- Who's the original game grump?

852
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,740
- That's right.

853
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,520
- Number seven, bowl a perfect game in bowling.

855
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,040
- What's a turkey in bowling?

856
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,400
- That's like a little bird.

857
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,560
- That's when you use a turkey like a ball.

858
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,920
- That's what they call, that's your bowling nickname

859
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,760
in the league.

860
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,320
- Call that a butter ball.

861
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,720
- They call you turkey.

862
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,760
They go, "Hey turkey."

863
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,200
- I think it's above 200, right?

864
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,540
That's a turkey.

865
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
It's probably because they give you a turkey.

866
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,760
You get a free turkey leg at the Ren Faire.

867
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
You get a frozen turkey.

868
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760

869
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760

870
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760

919
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,340

925
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,820

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,900
- No, he's a good guy though.

930
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,740
- He's not.

931
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,940

941
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,460

942
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,020
basketball all the time and just like it was right when I got into basketball is when Steph Curry

00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:21,020
Curry became a guy in the NBA so I was like, I'm just Steph Curry man.

944
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,020
I'll just shoot from half court.

945
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,020
I was leaning on your wall and it clicked.

946
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Oh, okay. I thought one of those was about to fall on your head.

947
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,020
That'd be cool. Probably.

948
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,020
Remember the fucking, the Sketch Troop basketball game?

949
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:39,020
Oh yeah, dude. So I would just like go and play pick up, like, downtown or whatever.

00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,020
Dude, I'm so good at basketball.

952
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:50,200
I remember one time just like bricking 10 like horrible long threes like just over and over again and then this like

953
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,640
Seven foot black dude who was playing pick up with me was like listen man. I'm never giving you the ball again

954
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,280
As long as I play with you you're not getting this ball. Yeah, alright. I guess I'll leave man

955
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,900
The cat just stood up like a hydraulic car. Yeah, that's the only thing you know that stands

956
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,960
What else stands can we one example a guy not like that? I see that cat

At one point...

00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,980
They need to shut this shit down.

980
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,980
Oh my God.

981
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,980

984
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:45,980
In the middle of a game in the stadium, he catches a bat out of the air with his hand.

985
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,980

A bat was flying around the stadium.

00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,980
He just goes, "Ah," throws it away.

993
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,980
Oh my God, dude.

994
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,980
Damn, that's sick.

995
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:56,980
He caused...

996
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,320
- He caused baloney.

997
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,160
- He caused baloney.

998
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,980
- The baloney virus.

999
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,820
- He caused a bat in the trash can.

1000
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,080
(laughing)

1001
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,660
- Number 10, win an Oscar award.

1002
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,740
- They should just give me that damn Oscar.

1003
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:11,840
They give me that Oscar.

1004
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,680
- It definitely goes.

1005
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,500
- They should just give me that damn Oscar.

1006
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,080
- Yeah, I'm in my Grinch shit tonight,

1007
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,140
you give me that Oscar.

1008
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,860
- I'll say this much, your chances of winning an Oscar

1009
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,180
go way up, shoot through the roof if you make a great movie.

1010
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,020
- That's true.

1011
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,540
(laughing)

1012
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,540
If you give a career-defining performance...

1013
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:30,540
If you make the best movie ever, it's pretty high, actually.

1014
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah.

1015
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,540
Yeah.

1016
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,040
Right?

1017
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
If you make, like...

1018
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
Pretty goddamn high.

1019
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,040
Stickbug the movie...

1020
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
If you make A Bug's Life 4...

1021
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,540
You make Stickbug the movie...

1022
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,040
Yeah.

1023
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
You're getting an Oscar.

1024
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,040
I think you're gonna get an Oscar.

1025
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
I'm gonna make Parasite 2.

1026
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,540
Yeah.

1027
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,040
Parasite 2, the coronavirus.

1028
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,540
The corona-site.

1029
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,040
Whoa.

1030
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,540
'Cause the parasite right now is corona.

1031
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,540
Dude, now I have to pee.

1032
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,040
Dude, you infected me. Hold on.

1033
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,240
Now you guys get your own special podcast like we got.

1034
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,240
Alright.

1035
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
Alright.

1036
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,480
Patrick, Caleb's going in the litter box.

1037
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,000
Caleb's using the- what the f- get out of the fucking litter box!

1038
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,320
What are you doing?

1039
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,320
Stop peeing in it!

1040
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,320
What the fuck?

1041
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,320
He's- oh my god.

1042
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Oh!

1043
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,160
Dude, he put his tongue on it!

1044
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,640
God damn it!

1045
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,000
He's- now he's like squir- he's like scratching it like a cat.

1046
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,320
He's scratching his own face with his foot.

1047
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,320
Oh my god.

1048
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Why are you- oh!

1049
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
Stop!

1050
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Stop! Caleb, stop! That's disgusting!

1051
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,320
What the hell?

1052
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
That's sa- oh my god.

1053
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
Oh my god. AHHHHH!

1054
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,320
Dude. Now he's pooping it and-

1055
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
STOP! Now he's banging his head

1056
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
against the wall over and over. STOP IT!

1057
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,320
Stop, Caleb! STOP!

1058
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Stop!

1059
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Fucking hell, dude! Oh, he fainted.

1060
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
He's on the ground. He's on the ground.

1061
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,320
He fell into the litter box.

1062
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,320
We're gonna have to scoop him out with the scoop lid.

1063
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
His bald head is touching the-

1064
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,160
- His balls are out.

1065
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,740
- You know, thank God he doesn't have hair right now.

1066
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,580
- That's true.

1067
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,200
- Yeah, if he did, we'd have to get peanut butter

1068
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,040
to get it out. - I would pick him up

1069
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,860
by his hair.

1070
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,180
- Mm-hmm, I wouldn't touch it.

1071
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,520
What are you gonna, touch the poop in his hair?

1072
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,260
- I would comb it out.

1073
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,060
I would comb the poop out with a lice comb.

1074
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,060
- Ugh.

1075
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,700
- That's normal to do to somebody.

1076
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,540
- I don't think so.

1077
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,440
- If your homie just falls asleep in the litter box,

1078
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,660
it's normal to comb-- - With a lice comb.

1079
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,020
- To comb the poop out with a lice comb.

1080
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,260
- No, you get peanut butter and you wear rubber gloves

1081
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,700
and you get that shit out like it's bubble gum.

1082
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,860
You put you wash your friends hair with peanut butter and the dog will lick all the poop out of their head

1083
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,700
Yeah, then but I mean you put peanut butter in it. You can't tell what's where the poop begins where the peanut butter starts

1084
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:32,220
That's that's some true shit. That's some shit. They don't tell you about in restaurants

1085
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:32,620
No

1086
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:37,660
They don't know where the poop is gonna get peanut butter starts in your hair at a restaurant from the way

1087
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,220
You're getting a peanut butter sandwich at a restaurant nine times out of ten. There's gonna be some poop in there

1088
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,980
Yeah, because they don't they can't tell the difference. They got a jar Skippy makes a

1089
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,860
poop also and the same skippy poop chunky.

1090
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,780
What the hell did I walk into?

1091
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,780
Oh he woke up.

1092
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,780
I wasn't asleep.

1093
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,460
Yeah that's right you were unconscious.

1094
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
Yeah he fainted.

1095
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,700
I was in the other bedroom.

1096
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,700
No you fainted.

1097
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,700
No.

1098
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
You were not in the other bedroom.

1099
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,700
Yeah I was.

1100
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,700
You were in the bathroom.

1101
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,140
That's what I call my bathroom, my other bedroom.

1102
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,500
Yeah you sleep in the bathroom.

1103
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,260
My secret public bathroom.

1104
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,260
Yeah.

1105
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,260
My secret little place.

1106
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,620
Mike Birbiglia comes out on stage.

1107
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,620
My secret public bathroom.

1108
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,140
Just fucking with the upper deckers on stage dude.

1109
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,540
What I should have done was poop in the bowl.

1110
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,540
Was flushing.

1111
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,540
What I should have said was flushing.

1112
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,540
Yeah.

1113
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,540
Oh my god, I'm on fire.

1114
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,540
Yeah.

1115
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,540
Winning an Oscar.

1116
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,540
I'm on fire!

1117
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,660
Do you think you could get an Oscar?

1118
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,660
I could get an Oscar.

1119
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:28,660
I could.

1120
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,660
Three 6 Mafia has an Oscar.

1121
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
They should just give me that damn Oscar.

1122
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
Juicy J has one.

1123
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,260
I'd just give the coolest speech of all time in a movie.

1124
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,740
They'd give me, I'd be like one of those characters that's in it for one minute who says something

1125
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,740
crazy.

1126
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,740
You would sit there.

1127
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,340
It's like that fucking, that epic Charlie Kaufman speech where he goes up and he's like, "Thank

1128
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:48,620
to the Academy, 30, 29, and he like cheekily says the countdown as they count him down.

1129
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:54,020
Yeah. You have to be weird all the time. Yeah, come on man. Just be normal for a

1130
00:51:54,020 --> 00:52:00,420
minute man. Yeah, just make like a cool Will Ferrell movie. I would Eternal Spongebob of the spotless mind.

1131
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,860
Eternal Spongebob of the Squidward mind. There we go. Let's get that one going.

1132
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,020
I would point at people and just say pedophile.

1133
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,340
(laughing)

1134
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,500
- Yeah, pedophile, pedophile, cool, cool, pedophile.

1135
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,760
(laughing)

1136
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,340
- Yeah, if they let me in the theater for the Oscars,

1137
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,860
I would shine a laser pointer on everyone

1138
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,460
who won an award, I would shine it in their eyes

1139
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,620
while they were trying to talk.

1140
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,400
- I feel like one day we'll be at the Oscars, right?

1141
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,240
- Yeah, we'll make it, dude.

1142
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,060
- We're on the path.

1143
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,260
- They should just give me that damn Oscar.

1144
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,100
- They should give me that damn Oscar.

1145
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,840
- We will make a movie one day, yeah?

1146
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,540
- Yeah, absolutely, we're already making one.

1147
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,140
- Yeah, we're making an epic movie too.

1148
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,620
- Epic movie too, man.

1149
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,900
Epic movie too, man.

1150
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,100
- Epic movie too.

1151
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,940
- Yeah, it's gonna be good.

1152
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,500
- Borat is gonna be back.

1153
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,380
Napoleon Dynamite will,

1154
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,740
Napoleon Dynamite was a date movie,

1155
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,060
but we can have some crossover.

1156
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,900
- Yeah.

1157
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,600
- I feel like, okay, the new movie movie.

1158
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,460
What's the new movie movie?

1159
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,380
Date movie, epic movie, girl movie.

1160
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,220
- Superhero movie.

1161
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,180
- Superhero movie.

1162
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,020
- That's probably what's gonna--

1163
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,100
- Scary movie.

1164
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,100
- No, but with like a genre.

1165
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,620
- What about funny movie?

1166
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,460
- Funny movie.

1167
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,860
- Funny movie, and it's actually very serious.

1168
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,220
- What about movie movie and it's a parody

1169
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,380
of all the movie movies?

1170
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,860
- Yeah. - Whoa.

1171
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,220
- That's actually not a bad idea.

1172
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,060
- That's actually kind of the best idea ever.

1173
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,340
- We should write that and then do it.

1174
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,540
- Yeah, we should write movie movie.

1175
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,380
- We should write that and do it.

1176
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,200
- It's kind of what Nerd in the Hood

1177
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,040
is supposed to be a little bit.

1178
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1179
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,300
- Oh, we can have the Nerd in the Hood.

1180
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,380
- It'd be one of them.

1181
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,180
- Nerd in the Hood would be a movie movie.

1182
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,340
- Yeah.

1183
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,940
- Movie 43.

1184
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,380
- That's kind of what that was, yeah.

1185
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,220
Do you like that movie?

1186
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,660
- No. - No.

1187
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:32,500
The thing is about that movie,

1188
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,900
like the ball chin thing is funny for like

1189
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,940
- 15 seconds and then you're like,

1190
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,780
it's just gross.

1191
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,620
- Yeah.

1192
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,440
- Ugh.

1193
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,280
- Yeah.

1194
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,280
- But then it's funny again when you just think about

1195
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,080
whose ball, whose face it is.

1196
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,020
- Meet the Spartans.

1197
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,860
- Meet the Spartans.

1198
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,680
- Meet the Spartans.

1199
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,760
- We could do a parody called,

1200
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,300
called Feet the Fartans.

1201
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,140
Right?

1202
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,980
- Well if we just take elements from it.

1203
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,360
- It's about feet that fart.

1204
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,400
- Feet the fart.

00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,840
- Feet that are farting.

1207
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,240
- Feed my farting.

1208
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,880
- Feed my fart hole.

1209
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,040
- There we go.

1224
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,560
Damn. I think actually I was kind of similar. That was one of the only shock videos I didn't see.

00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,820
It's more porn than shocking. Yeah.

1226
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,000
It's definitely bad.

1227
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,900
It's gross.

1228
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:55,440
I didn't, it was the first time I ever saw what a butthole looked like when it farted.

1229
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,200
You know?

1230
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,640
Um...

1231
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,960
I saw I went to lol shock calm when I was 11 Wow

Why would you do that?

1238
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
Bored.

1239
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,200
You're bored.

1240
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,200

1241
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,200

1242
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,200
There was like...

1243
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,200
One of them where like someone puts an octopus

1244
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,200
in their pussy.

1245
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,200
Cool. That one was weird.

1246
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
There's one of them on there

1247
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,200
that was pretty funny.

1248
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
It was called "Two guys, one hammer".

1249
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Yeah, no. That one I saw too early.

1250
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,200
I saw that before the other one.

1251
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
I never saw any of the like murder ones.

1252
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Two guys one hammer.

1253
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,200
I saw in fourth grade.

1254
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Oh Christ.

1255
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
Yeah.

1256
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Jeez man.

1257
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,200
You fucking.

1258
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,200
What else am I gonna do?

1259
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Watch TV?

1260
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Yeah.

1261
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,200
What else?

1262
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,200
What did my neighbors show to me?

1263
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,200
Well like yeah, what do you think everyone here, nobody here has seen that video.

1264
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,200
Everyone's walking around the happiest they've ever been in their life.

1265
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Exactly.

1266
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Getting tattoos and wearing an American flag.

1267
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,200
Well I didn't grow up here.

1268
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,200
I didn't grow up in this town.

1269
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,200
You grew up like 20 minutes from here.

1270
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,200
It's the same thing.

1271
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,200
For 10 minutes from here it's different.

1272
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,200
It's the same thing.

1273
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,500
- I'll say, if I had seen that video when I was a kid,

1274
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,160
I would be a libertarian now.

1275
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,000
- Yeah.

1276
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,820
- Yeah.

1277
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,660
- That turns you into a libertarian.

1278
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:28,620
- That should be allowed to happen.

1279
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,180
- Yeah, it turns you into a libertarian or a singer.

1280
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,220
- I think--

1281
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,040
- Singer?

1282
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,740
- No, I live like 40--

1283
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,580
- Put poetry in your soul.

1284
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,420
- I grew up 45 minutes away from here.

1285
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,940
- I don't care, that's not true.

1286
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,900
- It's also not true.

1287
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,160
- You did not, you better take that back.

1288
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,000
- Yeah, man.

1289
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,540
- Also, it's an hour drive to Boston.

1290
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,440
- No, I grew up probably like 35 minutes away from here.

1291
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,440
- It's not true, we went to--

1292
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,460
- We just went to your place.

1293
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:56,300
20 minutes. It was. I drove. It was 35 minutes. It was 20 minutes exactly. Oh yeah, Patrick

1294
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,820
forgot he adds the 15 minutes for the lunch break. Yeah. True. You gotta take,

1295
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,700
every 10 minutes. You gotta pull over. Yeah, but it's all woods there, what am I gonna do there?

1296
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:11,740
Not watch someone get murdered. Watch LRShock.com. Why, who showed you the two guys with a hammer?

1297
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,460
My friend's older brother. Your 50 year old neighbor. Come in my house, I gotta show you

1298
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:21,460
something I saw the craziest shit. They just kill some guy with a hammer? Yeah they kill a guy with a hammer.

1299
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,500
Oh come on. My friend's older brother. I would never do that man. He was only, he was my

1300
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:32,420
sister's age so he's like. I would use the hammer to build him a house. Yep. Yeah.

1301
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:39,260
I'm a hero. If you watch it in reverse. It's actually the story of a man being brought to life with a

1302
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:44,020
hammer. The story of Jesus. There is one video on there, what I've been trying to

1303
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,540
There's one that's called Walk the Dinosaur, you can just watch it on YouTube.

1304
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:53,660
It's a 3D, it's 3D T-Rex's 69ing. It's pretty good. And that was on the shock

1305
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,860
site so it's like under Goatse it's like Walk the Dinosaur and it's like Goatse's.

1306
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,620
Far worse. What about One Man One Jar? Did you see Bottle Guy? Do you remember Bottle Guy?

1307
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:08,460
Yeah. No. It's a guy and he has a whole 40 ounce bottle in his asshole.

1308
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:12,460
is it one man one jar where he puts a jar in his ass and then it breaks?

1309
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:19,260
yeah yeah oh my butt. It probably sounded like that. yeah crap I put glass in my ass.

1310
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:24,600
oh man my butt is broken on the glass. but it will become stronger for this. epic fail.

1311
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,460
that's what he said. there were other ones on there. I mean two girls one cup.

1312
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:36,100
merry holidays. two girls one cup. merry holidays is just it was just an old man

1313
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:41,100
who would make a weird sex video of himself for every holiday.

1314
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,100
That's cool.

1315
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,100
That's sweet, yeah.

1316
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:51,100
He puts like a big fake penis on a jack-o-lantern and he sucks it.

1317
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,100
Wow.

1318
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,100
And he says thank you, and he sucks it and says thank you Mr. Pumpkin.

1319
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,100
That's incredible.

1320
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,100
That's really sick.

1321
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,100
And then he dresses up like Santa and spanks himself and puts a banana in his ass on his birthday.

1322
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,100
I would do that.

1323
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,100
Why a banana for Christmas?

1324
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:10,660

00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,700
No, his birthday, he wears his birthday suit.

1330
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,700
Then what was the Santa thing? You said he dressed up as Santa.

1331
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,700
That's for Christmas!

1332
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,700
You said he dressed up as Santa on his birthday.

1333
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,700
And he, on Easter, he dresses up like a turkey and then says gobble gobble.

1334
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,700
And it's a video of him walking around his house going gobble gobble, gobble gobble.

You're not making any god damn sense and it's breaking my heart, buddy.

I don't even want to look at you anymore.

You're disgusting to me.

01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,940
to just shit.
