1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Uh, well, finally happened.

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,960
I am all alone.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,720
Wait a second.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
I'm in a dream!

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:47,640
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:01:03,240
What's up? I just had the most amazing dream of my life. What was it about? Food, lunch,

7
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,240
lunch and dinner.

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,680
Welt.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,640
(laughter)

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Welt.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,060
Everyone just steals that now.

12
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,980
Yeah.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,960
Yeah, Jack stole it first. I stole it from Jack.

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,680
he's amazing this guy

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,840
this guy and jordan alvarez you gotta look him up on instagram he's doing stuff with

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,920
instagram filters that nobody thought was possible

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,560
and now it is completely uh... he's forging a new path for himself

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,120
his stuff has infected my brain so much i love him so much he's so good

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,280
well it's nice 'cause it's something that uh...

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,680
i can watch on my phone that my girlfriend doesn't get mad at

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,840
what does she what do you usually watch on your phone that she gets mad about? she doesn't get mad about

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,540
about, but it's a lot of very annoying stuff. And this is something that we can

23
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,680
watch together. Like, I'm watching, like, these videos of, like,

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,140
what am I... I'm watching, like, old men doing, like, food reviews.

25
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,040
You're watching Guga. I'm watching Guga. You're watching people try durian for

26
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,460
the first time. Skate videos. And she doesn't like any of this shit. She's

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,700
not, like, you know, that comes up on my phone.

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,760
But one of his things pops up and...

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,260
Girls like that shit.

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,200
Oh my god.

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
They love it so much.

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Big fucking shoe.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,360
They love when a guy is being crazy with a filter.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
And he's so good at it.

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
And even guys can like it too.

36
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,920
Yeah, he's so good.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
Well I'm seeing double today.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
Why?

39
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,840
Why don't you introduce us to your little friend here.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,040
Who's this?

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,540
This is, I don't know where this came from.

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,200
You don't know where that came from?

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
No.

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,360
The blow up doll that looks exactly like you.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,760
And you put your own hat on it.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
No, no, no.

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
A matching hat.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
I don't know where this came from actually.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
And it doesn't look that much like me.

50
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,320
It literally looks like one to one exactly like you.

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,560
It doesn't look like me at all.

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,240
And you don't know where this came from?

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
No.

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,520
This is interesting. Do you want me to explain the story? Because it's not that good.

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,920
I want to explain. Yeah, I think that people need to know why he bought this.

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,420
Okay. So I was asked to host a thing from my friend Serge,

57
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,320
and I was already on tour. Serge! Super villain.

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,320
And I said, "Don't worry. I have the solution to be two places at once."

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,020
This was my solution. I was going to send this in my place.

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,620
and ended up not being able to deliver it to them because of some logistical

61
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,320
things that I did not think of. And now I'm trying to get my money's worth out

62
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,820
of it. I spent $14 on this.

63
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,220
Yeah, and at first when you told me it was $14, I was like, "That's pretty cheap

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,620
for a blow-up sex doll." Okay, he's mad there's no butthole or penis. There is

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,340
No butthole or penis on this sex doll, guys.

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
This is a Nolo doll.

67
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,340
This is a Nolo doll.

68
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,940
That can't even take a shit.

69
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,220
It has nothing going on.

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,220
It doesn't have a butthole.

71
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,420
There is no reason for this doll to exist.

72
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,420
What do you mean there's no reason?

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,420
Show the butthole.

74
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,740
We have a reason for it to exist now.

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,280
But like, why would you even make it naked if it has nothing?

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,860
It has absolutely fucking nothing, man.

77
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,860
It's for bachelorette parties so they can bring these, like...

78
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
They're supposed to have a big cock they can sit on.

79
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,740
If it had a big cock that they could sit on, you wouldn't be allowed to bring it in public.

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
That's not true.

81
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
It would be an indecency law thing.

82
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,540
At a bachelorette party, you're going to be at a strip club and you're not...

83
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,540
No, no, on the way there.

84
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,780
You can get a microphone.

85
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
This is like a cuddling...

86
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,700
You can get a microphone, little Patrick.

87
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
This is like...

88
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,420
Okay, he has a name now.

89
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,900
This is like a cuddles only doll.

90
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,260
Yeah, and he does not fit in a lot of clothes.

91
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,260
You've tried dressing him up?

92
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,220
Yeah, I did try dressing him up earlier and I decided that it was funnier to keep him nude.

93
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,740
He wears like kids clothes probably.

94
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,180
Yeah, it's kids clothes. I don't own any kids clothes.

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,740
So we need to go out, we need to go to Oshkosh to get him something.

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Maybe that's what we do after this.

97
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Okay, I'm down.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,820
(laughs)

99
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,100
- Ring up to the store.

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,540
- And we get him some children's clothes

101
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
that we can put him in.

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,540
- We can put him on our hip like a baby.

103
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,380
- Yeah.

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,500
- Say he's starting school.

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,940
- So Noah was gonna go and bring this thing for me,

106
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,940
but he was at work, and I had it blown up,

107
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,020
and Noah was gonna walk around the city, downtown,

108
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,900
he was gonna walk around with this under his arm

109
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
like he was a father carrying his child.

110
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
Yeah, not a lot of shame.

111
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,100
No, Noah is not a shameful person.

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
It's very, very crazy.

113
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,180
I mean, you know, because he's Irish Protestant.

114
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,780
He'll do whatever, he'll do anything.

115
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,460
No Catholic bone in his body.

116
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,660
No, not at all.

117
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,580
I mean, see, I had it deflated and I carried it here and I was worried that somebody would

118
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,780
walk by that door and see me blowing up a blow-up doll.

119
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,460
Well, you have public, you are, the people who you care the most about, like their opinion

120
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,460
of you are strangers. Not anymore. No, you still do that. I still do in some way. You're

121
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,260
still scared of doing public pranks, which is interesting as a skateboarder. I had to

122
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,740
shut that off. I've been working on shutting that off. Really? Yeah. You're finally brave

123
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,700
enough to bring a piece of paper into a business? Yes, actually. Prove it. Well, I've done. We

124
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,800
need to make a Prank Gas 2 that is just one single clip of you walking in with a piece

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,400
of paper. Well, no, I had the realization one day that everything is actually fucking

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,620
Bullshit and nothing matters you became an absurdist nihilist. I became an absurdist nihilist exactly like TJ Miller

127
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,680
I've been calling in bomb threats on the Amtrak train. And did this change your perspective at all?

128
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,960
It changed my whole complete perspective. And you decided that what's more absurdly odd than having a blow-up twin?

129
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,780
Mm-hmm me and my twin in them, but I walk around with I do

130
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,380
I do okay there the shame that I did feel when I was blowing this up and thought

131
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,620
that maybe like somebody in the neighborhood like an old woman would

132
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,780
look in and see me.

133
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,980
What it would look like me eating the ass of a blow up doll.

134
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,680
But you'd have I think that there's a reasonable amount of things on the

135
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,380
back. There's a reasonable amount of shame. It looks like you're eating the

136
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,900
back of it. There is no asshole. You could walk out, if a woman walked by and went, "Ah!"

137
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
You could walk outside.

138
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,980
Oh, I could walk up to the window and show that there's no butthole.

139
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Hey, Granny, great news. There's no asshole on this doll.

140
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
There's no butthole.

141
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,220
I wish there was. I would have paid extra, but there's nothing.

142
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,940
There's no butt, penis, butt, or butthole, or ass in asshole.

143
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,020
There's nothing.

144
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,920
Nothing there. It's completely Nolo.

145
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,460
It doesn't even have fingers.

146
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,900
And I was going to get rid of this hat, too. It's actually, I got, I told you about this.

147
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I bought a lot of vintage Red Sox hats for $5 on eBay.

148
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Really?

149
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,340
They were all dirty and smelled like an ashtray.

150
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,540
And this surprised you?

151
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,080
Well the lady said she cleaned them.

152
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,580
She promised that they were cleaned.

153
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,740
And I ended up doing it.

154
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I cleaned this one.

155
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,500
Look at how clean this one is.

156
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,300
Oh, that's not a new one?

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
No.

158
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
This is one of those vintage ones?

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Uh huh.

160
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
It used to be covered in grime.

161
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Nice, man.

162
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
This one you didn't clean, the one that went on Little Patrick.

163
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
No, I cleaned them all.

164
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
That one looks really dirty though.

165
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
This one looks dirty?

166
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Yep.

167
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
It just looks old because it's all wrinkly.

168
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Actually, it was Brian Madison's.

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Oh shit! It's a signature.

170
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Yeah.

171
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Well, Patrick, tell me about how amazing it was to be a touring stand-up comedian.

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Oh my goodness.

173
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
What was this like?

174
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:23,060
this like? It's pretty much the same as when we did the podcast. You're in a car for long

175
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:30,360
periods of time. Farting. Yeah, farting up a storm. I mean it's not like I haven't gone

176
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,980
on tour before with some people. It's not like I haven't opened for people before. Dude,

177
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,380
tell me man. Tell me bro. After these shows, were you getting so fucked up you couldn't

178
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,940
fucking see straight. I was. You were fucking hurting people. I was getting so fucked up

179
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,340
that I was. You were so fucked up you just hurt people. I didn't hurt people. You know

180
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,500
you're doing. You just start hurting, just touching everybody. What are you talking about?

181
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,260
Come here. Come here! That's what you do when you open for Adam? No, I was saying that's

182
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,500
what you did when we went on tour. I didn't. I was saying, did you do this again? No, I

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,880
did not do that. Oh, Grace and April stopped you? What? I did not do this when we were on

184
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,820
tour unless it was maybe to Cameron or you or Pierce. So you did it then? Come here!

185
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,480
I would run up to Pierce and I would say come here and I would try to lift him. Come here!

186
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,400
I have a hundred thousand followers on Twitter. Come here! I would lift Pierce up Hava Nagila

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,440
style. Is that what Hava Nagila means? No. It's just the song that plays when people

188
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:40,440
I have a guy in my hands. I'm lifting him. He is above my head.

189
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Dude, we need to convert to Judaism. This is the most fun religion there is, let me tell you.

190
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Yeah, you go on tour with Adam, now you're saying that?

191
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,440
No, if anything, he convinced me of the opposite, hanging out with his bum ass.

192
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,500
I'm asking, but

193
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,040
everybody else has convinced me that this is the most fun

194
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:08,880
religion in the entire nation. You can have a horn at church. Yeah, I used to

195
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,940
try to bring I used to try to bring a horn to church and they would put me

196
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,540
into the

197
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,840
the nursery.

198
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,360
They would lock me in the nursery. Yeah, a quiet breastfeeding, a bunch of

199
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,480
breastfeeding moms. That's where I would go. Did you guys have a breastfeeding

200
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,600
room at your church? I barely went to church because I was too disruptive. I had a breastfeeding

201
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,240
room and I had to clean it. You had to clean the breastfeeding room? Yeah, it was fucking

202
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,160
disgusting stuff all over the floor. It was sticky. Yeah? Yeah. What were these girls

203
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,080
doing in there? They were squirting? I guess. All these breastfeeding moms were squirting

204
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,440
everywhere? Yeah, they wouldn't even have the babies. They'd just go in there and pull

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
their tits out and squirt. Yeah. That's what they thought the room was. They thought there

206
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,680
was going to be some old priests in there and they had to feed them. Did you ever do

207
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,160
confession? No, I mean I was barely, I was not allowed to do CCD. I wasn't allowed to

208
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,320
do Sunday school. Oh, because you got banned. No, because my aunt was the teacher. Oh, yes.

209
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,960
She hated you. She thought I was annoying, yeah. But did you wish that you had confession

210
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,560
when you were a kid? I did for a little bit. I feel like you have a lot to confess. I did

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,160
for a little bit. I don't have a lot to confess. Come here! That's what you probably would

212
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,160
you would have done in the confession booth.

213
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
I wouldn't have done that.

214
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
You would have punched a hole through that screen.

215
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
You would have said...

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
What are you talking about?

217
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Hello, it's father.

218
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
And you'd go, "Come here!"

219
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,160
You'd grab his neck, start tickling his ears like you do to people.

220
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
I don't tickle people's ears.

221
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Come here, ears.

222
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
You pull him apart.

223
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Where is this coming from?

224
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,160
You're really upset that I went on the news, huh?

225
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,160
And you're trying to convince everyone that I'm a serial grouper.

226
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Dude, you went on the news and you bombed.

227
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
- You bombed. - I didn't bomb on the news.

228
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
- You bombed on the news, man. - What was I supposed to do there?

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
- Fart. - Grace had a bunch of coins in her mouth.

230
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,160
- You gotta one-up that. - I was not supposed to one-up it.

231
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
- You go. - I was the opener.

232
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
- Bro, you're not opening for them on the news, man.

233
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
- I wasn't supposed to be there in the first place.

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
They kicked me off during the interview.

235
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
- You are not opening for them on the news.

236
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
They weren't like, "Come be on the news and be our opener."

237
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
- They said... - "And do nothing. Just sit there."

238
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
I thought you were a host. I didn't even recognize you.

239
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,160
I thought you were one of the anchors.

240
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,080
I thought you were one of the anchors.

241
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,380
You thought that I was one of the anchors.

242
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
I did for a moment.

243
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,720
You thought that I looked like Mark Clark in Lady T?

244
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

245
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,120
Lady's an interesting first name.

246
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,420
Her name is Lady T and she spills the tea and she has a cup that has her initial on

247
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,360
it and it's got rhinestones.

248
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
What's her initial?

249
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
T.

250
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Oh, snap.

251
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,840
Lady T. She's on Be More Lifestyle.

252
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,840
See, but I just think that you could have gone on there, you could have worn --

253
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,760
They were not asking me any questions at all.

254
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,160
could have taken one of these prison jumpsuits, gotten on there and say, "I have escaped."

255
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I just escaped from prison.

256
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,200
But instead you went on there and you said, "I'm allergic to carrots. Come here, Lady

257
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,440
T! Come here, Mark Clark!"

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,920
I did not try to grope Mark Clark and Lady T.

259
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,560
I didn't say grope. I said grab.

260
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,120
You're upset. You're upset and I get it. You wanted to go on the news, but...

261
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,600
It just makes me sad that that is our television... because listen, Rising Tide raises all boats,

262
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,360
correct. So I'm thinking this is the first time any of my dogs been on TV.

263
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
That's not true.

264
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,320
Who's the one I'm on?

265
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
Jack and Eric and Nate have all been on TV. Sarah is on TV all the time.

266
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,200
But this is all, Sarah's the only one that counts because that's a network, but the other

267
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,960
ones, I mean this is cable. I don't care.

268
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeah, you're talking shit about their appearance on the bear?

269
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,560
Dude, fuck the bear. I'm talking about real TV, okay? Local news. This is the first time

270
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm one of my dogs. I mean it's apparently very easy to get on local

271
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,400
news. Then let's do it probably not new. Yeah, we could get we could

272
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,900
I know the guy at be more lifestyle. Now, if we do a show there,

273
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,760
we could get our be more. We could get on be more lifestyle.

274
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,600
You think they'd have you back after you bombed? They would have they'd get

275
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,600
the email. They say, oh, what's he gonna do? Fucking talk about carrots again.

276
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,760
They were they were fun. They cut a lot of that interview because of stuff

277
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
that Grace was saying.

278
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Oh, really?

279
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
So you're going to go on...

280
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Grace tried to get people to bring her ketamine.

281
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
On the live news. That ain't going to work.

282
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,800
She's already in a shirt that said ketamine.

283
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
They really didn't want us there after that.

284
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Yeah, I can imagine.

285
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah.

286
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
So you're going to send the email.

287
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
You're going to say, "Hey, can I come on?"

288
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The brief appearance that I had was like when

289
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Klaus Nomi was the background singer for David Bowie.

290
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,900
Bowie. I don't know who either of those people are,

291
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,140
but if you know, you know. Okay. So that's when people see me on the be

292
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,480
more lifestyle thing, they're gonna say, "Oh my God, that's Patrick, he's

293
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,920
allergic to carrots." I'm thinking that in... And then in my documentary,

294
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,340
and when I die in two years, is like... You know what you did,

295
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,080
man? That's just a little footnote. I'm realizing right, you did,

296
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,300
"I like turtles." I did lie like turtles. You did, "I like turtles."

297
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,420
And you're thinking I bombed, and you're thinking I bombed. No, you did

298
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,340
bomb. I like turtles bomb. That's the most famous bomb ever. I like turtles, not a bomb.

299
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,020
He bombed. He did not bomb. They asked him about his costume. Are you going to say that

300
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,220
that corn kid bombed? No, corn kid was different because they were asking about that corn.

301
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,820
They were asking me about carrots. You bombed. They were asking me about veggies. No. And

302
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,580
tanning. You basically said, I can't eat carrots. You did that. That was you. You're carrot

303
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,820
boy. I'm carrot boy. That's fine. You are carrot boy. You are not, you're supposed to

304
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:31,060
be on there. They didn't ask me shit. Then just say something. They didn't want me there.

305
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,340
Then just talk some shit. Talk with Lady T. What's up Lady T? I'm going to spill the tea

306
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,460
right now. I did. I talked to Lady T before. I said I love your mug. When the cameras weren't

307
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,980
on. And then a lot of my stuff got cut. Well okay, tell me what these bangers were that

308
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,060
got cut. I think I said that, I think he made a joke about Luther Vandross and I think I

309
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,060
I said I heard that.

310
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,780
You said heard that?

311
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,200
You think that was?

312
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't think I said heard that.

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,780
I don't remember exactly what I said.

314
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,780
It's kind of all a blur.

315
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,900
I was only there for five minutes.

316
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,140
I was on the news for five minutes.

317
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,020
They asked me one question.

318
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,980
What was I supposed to say?

319
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,340
Say fuck.

320
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,860
You say shit.

321
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,260
I said fuck or shit. It's not going in that segment would have been way

322
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,460
shorter. Oh, it wasn't live. No. Yeah, that's an issue because anything that

323
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,160
you do that's so crazy. Exactly. Do something funny. Fall off the chair.

324
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,860
Default jump on the chair. Start jumping around. Have a pillow fight.

325
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,060
There any of this shit would work. There you if you were in the situation

326
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,060
that I was in you would have completely

327
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,860
stood your ground like I did. See that's a better idea. Stay your ground.

328
00:17:48,860 --> 00:18:12,860
I'm

329
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
Pulling out your phone.

330
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,860
No, I'm sorry.

331
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
I gotta...

332
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,860
It's Cameron.

333
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
He's so needy.

334
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
He keeps texting us.

335
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
About what?

336
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,220
When can we have our next meeting?

337
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,380
Oh, shut up.

338
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Maybe when you're in town, man.

339
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Yeah, maybe.

340
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,940
Hey, maybe come the fuck home and stop traveling so much.

341
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,260
These two pieces of shit have been just tricking around the world.

342
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
Me, I'm a homebody.

343
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,920
What are you talking about?

344
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,260
You were in D.C. like last weekend.

345
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,660
Yeah, and did I miss an episode?

346
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
Yeah.

347
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Nope.

348
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
I thought you did.

349
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Did not.

350
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
You were going to.

351
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,660
Did not miss one, man.

352
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,840
because I'm a dedicated and I know what my job is. And if they'd put me on local TV,

353
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,540
on local news, well, why don't you get out of the way to walk over to the West? I would

354
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,300
have walked over to the way they cut to the weather, right? Push the weather guy out of

355
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,620
the way. And then I start pointing thing. Well, there's no Dixon balls. There is no

356
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,260
big pieces around shit more lifestyle. Oh yeah. It looks like there's gonna be a giant

357
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,340
fucking huge purple cock coming right out of the northern system when you're when you're

358
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,900
on the news that's coming from the south and they're trying to get you out of there as

359
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,180
quick as possible, you're not going to say a lot of stuff. When your friend is dropping

360
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,840
coins out of her mouth, they are trying to get you out of there as quick as possible.

361
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,000
If I'm ever on the news, man, I'm going to be the star of the show. The news will make

362
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the news. I promise you now, if I'm ever on the news, I will not say, "I'm allergic to

363
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,520
carrots." By the end of the year, we will try to get on the news. Yumi and Cam all go

364
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,440
on and they just ask us different questions. By the end of the year. So the funny thing

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
is all three of us are allergic to carrots. Can't eat them, especially raw. By the end

366
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:58,000
of the year starting today. So by the end of 2023. 2024 September. When does this come

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,400
out? September. Within one year. Within one year we will be on the local news. Okay, somewhere.

368
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,440
Somewhere in the country. Alright, we could go do, um, man what's the Wilmington one? Look

369
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,000
I was just happy to be along for the ride. I'm very grateful for Grace and April letting

370
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,760
me come on the news with them. I got to tell the world about my... I got to raise awareness

371
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,120
for oral allergy syndrome. But next time I'm on the news, I'm not going to be so quiet.

372
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,560
So next time you promise you'll body it? Next time I'm on the news, I'm going to be... we're

373
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,800
all going to be dressed up like sunflowers. And we're going to be saying that we're a musical

374
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,600
group called the Sunflowers. We're starting a musical group and we're all in big green

375
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:57,060
costumes with yellow heads. Our faces are painted brown. The center of our faces will

376
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:04,420
be painted brown. The outside of it will be painted yellow.

377
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,720
yellow and it will be yellow face and a brown face at the same time. Okay,

378
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,380
then I think will be the roses.

379
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:17,240
That might be the worst possible costume. There's no way to make a sunflower

380
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:17,780
work.

381
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,680
There is actually no way to make a... I can't believe you picked sunflower.

382
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,740
This is the one flower. I was just thinking of the most beautiful flower

383
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,280
I could think of. Sunflower's not the most beautiful flower. The most

384
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,340
beautiful flowers have brown faces. Maybe we dress up like a cactus. Maybe

385
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,840
that could work too. Maybe where they call the prickly pears.

386
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,540
Yeah, that's not a cactus.

387
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,640
Yeah, well, it's, you know, it's the same vein.

388
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,340
It's a fruit.

389
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
What, because it's got pricklies?

390
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:42,840
Yeah.

391
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm obsessed with durian and I want to eat a durian so badly and I've watched maybe 15 videos.

392
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,340
We've talked about durians a lot.

393
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I know, but I'm back at...

394
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
They smell like poopy.

395
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,840
No, but I've heard...

396
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,340
Just go to Chinatown, man. Go to Chinatown and buy a durian.

397
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
They're like $150 for a fucking...

398
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
They're not $150.

399
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
They're insanely expensive.

400
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,840
You can get some durian ice cream around there.

401
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
but I don't want the ice cream blood.

402
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
I want the real fruit.

403
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,940
You could find the whole hog.

404
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,340
You could find like a half a durian or like a quarter.

405
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,640
You can buy it frozen, but they said there was this video where a lady was

406
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,140
like if it's your first time eating durian, I recommend to buy it frozen and

407
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,440
you eat it, but you have to close every door, every window, and you can't leave

408
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,540
your house for two days because even if you brush your teeth, the smell won't go

409
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,440
away from your face.

410
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,540
And I was like, okay, I'll eat that.

411
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,140
Yeah.

412
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,660
It sounds good to me. People said it's like garlic ice cream. Doesn't that sound kind

413
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
of good?

414
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,340
They could make that anywhere though. Garlic ice cream?

415
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,500
Yeah, I don't really like fancy ice creams. Like a miso ice cream?

416
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,100
I do like a fancy ice cream.

417
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
What kind of ice cream?

418
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,100
You know what I had? There's an ice cream place around the corner. And they had a...

419
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,900
What are you squirming around for?

420
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,180
I don't know man. This shirt is too small. Do I look like James Dean in this shirt?

421
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,180
You don't look like James Dean, not the one you're thinking of.

422
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,880
Which James Dean are you thinking of?

423
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
The rapist.

424
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,840
I think he dressed like the real James Dean.

425
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,880
So they kind of look the same.

426
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,260
Anyway, I had a black sesame ice cream.

427
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,720
It was really good.

428
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
That's not what I meant to, man.

429
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,300
Yeah, you don't like black sesame ice cream?

430
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,220
Vanilla, chocolate, maybe some strawberry action going in there.

431
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:32,060
I don't like a fancy ice cream. I like a black sesame. I like a... what's the other thing

432
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,420
that I tried that one time?

433
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,700
Don't tell me you just about to say matcha or a green tea.

434
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,000
No, not a green tea. I had... well, I mean, any kind of like a nutty flavor, a nutty creamy

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
flavor.

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,700
Peanut. You don't need a... sesame is a seedy flavor.

437
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,740
When an ice cream is nutty and very... when ice cream is nut and very creamy...

438
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,340
Are you trying to be doing a gay thing?

439
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Isn't it? It's very creamy.

440
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,340
Don't do that voice.

441
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
It's cause of doing a gay thing.

442
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Talking about creamy, nutty.

443
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,740
Pause, bro!

444
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,940
You can't pause yourself.

445
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,540
I'm getting into pause, dude.

446
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,340
Getting into pause?

447
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,840
Uh-huh.

448
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,340
On tour?

449
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,140
Yeah.

450
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,740
Is it pause or shit?

451
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,340
Yeah, I'm starting to say pause.

452
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,140
See, even that would have worked on the news.

453
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,640
Yeah.

454
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,140
Yeah.

455
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,540
Well, cause when the weatherman's doing his thing.

456
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,840
But he say when the, they said, you know, do you eat carrots?

457
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
I say pause.

458
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,460
Yeah, paws ain't never going in my mouth, dog.

459
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,340
Carrots not touching my lips.

460
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,940
And they would definitely cut that from the news.

461
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,780
That would definitely never see the light of day.

462
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,500
No shot.

463
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,940
Yeah.

464
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,380
But you could have gone to the sports desk.

465
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,340
You can't just get up and walk around.

466
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,260
You literally can't.

467
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,660
You have legs and arms.

468
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,860
You know what I learned about the news?

469
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,700
What's that?

470
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,060
Well, this station, at least, this Fox affiliate

471
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,700
in Baltimore, completely--

472
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,780
Wow, big surprise.

473
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,180
Patrick went on Fox News.

474
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,860
Completely robotically automated cameras.

475
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
No cameramen that you know?

476
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,700
No, because they know, well maybe they swapped it all out because they knew a comedian/prankster

477
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
was walking in.

478
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Well, yeah.

479
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,260
By God, a podcaster/comedian/internet personality is coming in.

480
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,580
They did not call me that.

481
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,220
They said podcast host Patrick Doren.

482
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
Wow.

483
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,220
And then later in the segment they used my senior photo as my head shot.

484
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
That was funny.

485
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,580
That was a non-bomb.

486
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
That was a medium.

487
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,860
They can't all be zingers, man.

488
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,380
You can't get all the, you know.

489
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,300
You can't zing every single time.

490
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,420
Yeah, you're not going to crush every single time you go up.

491
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,860
But if you had done the...

492
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,660
Next time we do it, we'll do it, it'll be live.

493
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,160
You are so obsessed with this now.

494
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Get over it.

495
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,940
Because you were on TV, man.

496
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm already over it. I'm already over it. It's just a footnote in my long and lustrous

497
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,620
career of going on the news.

498
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,980
It's not. It's just, no. See, the first cut is the deepest.

499
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Not true.

500
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Yep.

501
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Not in my case.

502
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,700
Maybe the second or third cut is probably the deepest.

503
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,220
This news thing is going to haunt you for the rest of your life. Every single time they

504
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,260
ask you to be on the news, you'll go, "Fuck, I'm going to fucking black out and start talking

505
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
about carrots again."

506
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,540
I mean that could be a good, funny, pretty funny thing to do.

507
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,260
You just talk about, see that's the only option you have now is every time you do anything

508
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,140
you have to be like, "I'm allergic to carrots."

509
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,100
By the way, I can't eat carrots.

510
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,340
Yeah, just apropos of nothing.

511
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,820
What do you think, Elon Musk announces a new ban on personal videos.

512
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,380
Well I hope he bans carrots.

513
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,300
I hope he bans videos of people eating carrots because I'm going to get jealous because I

514
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
can't eat the damn things.

515
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Yeah, and they'll go, "Oh, really?

516
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
You can't eat carrots?

517
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Cooked and raw carrots you can't eat?"

518
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
What's that?

519
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
It's actually, it's a...

520
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,300
No, I can eat raw, but if I eat a...

521
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,220
Or I can't eat raw, but if I eat a cooked carrot, it's completely fine.

522
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,260
Yeah, they go, "Oh my God, he did the carrot thing."

523
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Let's fucking go!

524
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,660
Carrot boy back at it again.

525
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,540
Paul Rudd with the Mac and Me type vibe.

526
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,180
That shit was funny.

527
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,180
That shit was funny.

528
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,660
I wish I had a clip prepared.

529
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
I could have.

530
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Did I tell you my...

531
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
You just show the clip of you eating.

532
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,660
Going on the news and then I say like, "Yeah, we actually, we have a clip of me not being

533
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,660
able to eat carrots."

534
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,780
And then it's a clip of Paul Rudd announcing the clip of Mac and me.

535
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,700
I was thinking you say like, "Actually, we have a clip for my show tonight.

536
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Cut to you, be more lifestyle."

537
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,760
Yeah, I actually can't eat carrots, raw carrots.

538
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
What the hell?

539
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Your phone's talking back.

540
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,540
You're supposed to talk into that.

541
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,860
You said, "I can't eat carrots."

542
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,260
And they said, "I thought so."

543
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,660
That's messed up. That's crazy. They're always listening in to us. They are. You're just going

544
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,860
to start getting ads for carrots now. I'm going to get ads for fucking carrots. Ads for beef

545
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,880
stews dude. That's not that bad. That's pretty good actually. I would love to do, if I went

546
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,860
on Conan man I would have an amazingly funny bit like Paul Rudd's awesome Mac and Me thing.

547
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:09,960
Yeah. But he doesn't do the talk show anymore. Shit, you're so right. Yeah he does Conan

548
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,960
O'Brien needs a friend. What a fall. Yeah, this guy's lost. The greatest late night talk show

549
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,280
host of all time. No, that ain't true. Letterman is better. Letterman better. No, Letterman

550
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,460
is better. No, they're both below the real king of late night, Jay Leno. I used to like

551
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,320
Jay Leno. Yeah? Yeah. I used to watch every late night show when I was a kid. Really?

552
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,320
yeah i only watched Conan, Craig Ferguson, Letterman. I read the late night wars when it came out

553
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,200
oh the movie? no the fifteen hundred page fucking book. Is that about the 08?

554
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,800
It's about Conan vs Jay. I thought you were talking about Dave vs Jay and they had that HBO original movie.

555
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,040
Well it touches on that

556
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,480
but uh...

557
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,120
who they have? They have John Michael Higgins from Best in Show playing Dave

558
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,800
David LeBrunnen. I haven't seen that. It's on HBO Max. It's an HBO original movie and

559
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,240
it came out like a year or two after the whole late night wars thing. I don't think that

560
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
they. So it was like immediately after that shit happened. This is not important enough

561
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,620
to get a movie man. No. Straight up. No not at all. But it is a very funny portrayal of

562
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:27,480
Jay Leno as a skeevy son of a bitch. Does he wear prosthetics? Does he do like the chin

563
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,040
They make the guy, if you can pull this up, Jubio, you should see how they make these guys

564
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
look.

565
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Kathy Bates is in it.

566
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,320
Kathy Bates plays Dave.

567
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,800
Look up the Late Night Wars HBO movie or Dave Letterman HBO movie and Kathy Bates is in it

568
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,040
and Kathy Bates plays Dave's manager and I mean she's...

569
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
The Late Shift.

570
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,080
Yeah, look at how they make this guy look.

571
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:05,000
They, that's, no, go up, go back up, it's right there.

572
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's right there.

573
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
This is in 1996?

574
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This is '96.

575
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh man.

576
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,840
Look at what they did to this fucker's chin.

577
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,320
Wait, they kind of lampooned Letterman's look as well.

578
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,680
Yeah, I mean, you know, they're not very, I mean, Letterman's a little bit distinctive.

579
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,840
He does have the gap in his teeth, but really nothing going on.

580
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Yeah.

581
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,840
were like we have to put 110% into the costumes here and nothing else.

582
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:40,600
Would you do if Freeform came back and they came to you and they said we want to do Patrick

583
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,160
Knight Live?

584
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,600
Would you do it?

585
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,560
You probably, I mean I need a lot of money.

586
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
But you got to talk about the news.

587
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,320
I have a team of writers and I have a little co-host like Guillermo.

588
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:16,320
you

589
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,920
always does job. Yeah,

590
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,120
shut up.

591
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,020
That would be so fucking good. Yeah, that's a little bit. There's a pretty

592
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,720
good impression. There we go. You have to admit. Okay, you say shut up now.

593
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,820
No,

594
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,720
see, he would say now

595
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,720
I would ask him. What do you think like? Okay, let me just make up like a

596
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,320
new story from like the future is a Rhonda Rousey bites off man's penis after

597
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:49,300
much steroid injections from being in the UFC again. She's back in the UFC.

598
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,540
She's 50 years old.

599
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,500
50 years old, back in the UFC taking a billion, she actually is the first woman to ever inject

600
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:01,140
50 billion cc's of anabolic steroids into her butt which made her go feral like a damn wolf.

601
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,580
What is this news story about?

602
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:12,580
Ronda Rousey injected 50,000 cc's of anabolic, IUs of anabolic steroids into her butt.

603
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,320
her body, causing her to become kind of like a werewolf, and she ran over and

604
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,680
just bit off her personal trainer's penis. You said personal trainer, a penis?

605
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,220
It's a penis, and

606
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,860
no, this didn't happen.

607
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:36,700
Wait. I started saying it and then I was like... You could have said anything.

608
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,620
You could have said... No, I think it's similar to another, it's similar to

609
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,460
another thing. I was going off the dome and I think it was just saying something too similar

610
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:52,900
to something else. So I have to restart it. Okay, restart it. Okay. Uh, bad news for Louisiana.

611
00:32:52,900 --> 00:33:03,020
Hurricane Katrina two has just struck and in the ensuing chaos, looters started stealing

612
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:09,980
a cyber trucks from Tesla. And uh, Julio, what do you have to think about? What do you have

613
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:21,260
to say about this? That's crazy. Wait, hold on. Wait. Fuck. How do you use this? Where's

614
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,020
the... Maybe you can play the... I'll find it. I'll find it. Okay. Let me think of another

615
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,980
news story that I can lampoon. Okay. Let me imagine another news story from the future.

616
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,820
A news story from the future that I will... And I'll be... I'll have a deeper voice, so

617
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:42,300
I'll be older and I have salt and pepper hair. I look real. Oh my god. You have your own tequila

618
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:50,060
line? Uh huh. I've gotten, I've become like a silver Patrick. Silver like you know, you

619
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,820
know like when Jimmy Kimmel lost the weight. Yeah. And everyone was like oh my god. This

620
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:01,260
will be you. Oh my god look at how good he looks now. Yeah. But here's me and I'm thinking

621
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,060
there's a new story in the future and

622
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,160
X CEO

623
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Elon Musk

624
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,660
has tragically passed away

625
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,860
after

626
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,260
exploding

627
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,660
in a

628
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,260
maybe it's a jet ski accident or something and

629
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,960
kids say maybe if you're the

630
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,460
telling the news. Yeah, I'm just trying to think of

631
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,840
just say it doesn't have to be a funny news story. It could be a

632
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,320
is it a tragic one? Yeah, it can be the biggest track yeah. Okay, a child has

633
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,500
died today. So in the middle of the Midwest in

634
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:44,880
the in the middle of the Midwest in the country, a new type of tornado has

635
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,180
evolved

636
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,180
and

637
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:56,980
a million residents have died because of this new type of tornado that has

638
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,040
Jubio, what are you? No, you're supposed to cheer after Jubio chimes in. Oh, okay.

639
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,980
Wait, really? You're supposed to be my co- or sidekick. Wait, did that happen?

640
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,320
Yeah, there is a new type of tornado that has arms and legs and it picks up people

641
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,240
and puts it in its- And it killed, okay, and it killed 1 million people.

642
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,360
Jubio's reaction.

643
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,140
OOP. Okay, now do a monologue joke. Okay,

644
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:41,940
scientists report that the COVID-19 pandemic was all made up after lab

645
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,440
reports show that

646
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,540
that in

647
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:53,640
the lab report show that it was just a way to get. It was just a way to for

648
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,640
to get less work done.

649
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:04,640
The audience didn't like that so much.

650
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Okay, okay, hold on.

651
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Save this.

652
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
I gotta think.

653
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Well, I gotta have a team of writers.

654
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,640
Okay, here, here.

655
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Okay, okay.

656
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm actually allergic to carrots.

657
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

658
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
I can't eat raw carrots.

659
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
Um.

660
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
[air horn]

661
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Whoops.

662
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
I got it, I got it.

663
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I have my monologue joke.

664
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Okay.

665
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:31,760
A new study shows that the consumption of raw carrots is actually shown to increase the

666
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,400
size of male penises.

667
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,800
That's too bad for me because I can't eat raw carrots.

668
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,720
I'm actually allergic to them.

669
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,200
Yep, they love that.

670
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,000
That's kind of your catchphrase at this point.

671
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You're a couple years into the show.

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,900
show science studies show that

673
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:59,600
rock carrots actually have been proven to increase eyesight,

674
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,500
but an unexpected.

675
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,700
I could be carrots.

676
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,800
I'm allergic to carrots.

677
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,300
They like to be a more I'm going to be.

678
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,800
Yeah, Juvia is kind of the way to okay.

679
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,500
Turn my voice up.

680
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,000
Juvia.

681
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Why don't you how about you do the monologue then and then we'll

682
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,200
see the dynamic with me being the sidekick and then it's free

683
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,340
form presents Jubio live. No, Jubio TV, Jubio night live, JBL live.

684
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,960
Just say, just say what he said about liking raw carrots or not

685
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,680
being able to eat him.

686
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:35,480
Um, scientists actually find out that, uh, raw carrots increase

687
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,280
your penis size.

688
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,840
Let's stay, uh, and Jubio, you know, that's too bad for me

689
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,240
because I'm actually allergic to raw carrots.

690
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Can't eat the things.

691
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,560
It's not doing well for me.

692
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,460
That's too bad Patrick.

693
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:55,960
I'm sorry.

694
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,460
Yeah.

695
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,960
I'm sorry.

696
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,460
I mean that's because it's kind of a bummer.

697
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,260
I think maybe, yeah.

698
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,060
You know, like he's saying it and people think, "Oh that's funny, he's not actually allergic."

699
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,160
That's a funny thing to say.

700
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,960
Well that's like when Howie Mandel talks about being like a germaphobe.

701
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,860
You think people like that?

702
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,160
I hate that shit.

703
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,060
I think it's interesting.

704
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,360
When he goes like, "Oh yeah, I can't shake people's hands, I do a fist bump."

705
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,860
Yeah.

706
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,300
Buddy, if I'm ever on America's Got Talent or whichever one he's on, X Factor,

707
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,660
and I do my comedy routine, you are going to shake my hand.

708
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,200
Yeah.

709
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,900
I'm going to grab your hand. I'm going to--

710
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,100
Oh, here? Okay. Put the monologue voice back on.

711
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,140
Tragedy strikes.

712
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,460
The set of America's Got Talent is a walking tornado,

713
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,300
picks up Howie Mandel,

714
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,900
throws Howie Mandel into the top of the tornado spout,

715
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,940
and he's now covered in tornado germs. Say it put him in the germ factory. It

716
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,080
brought him and dumped him in the germ. The

717
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,780
he actually

718
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,080
now the show is going to be called how he's got germs,

719
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:02,980
how he's got germs,

720
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:10,260
because he was picked up by a human tornado and what is this human tornado

721
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,500
this is not the okay. You think that in a couple of years, you think that I say

722
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,400
it now. I say I say this now, right? We wait like 10 years and 10 years.

723
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,100
Scientists create a walking human tornado. Why would scientists be

724
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,400
creating tornado scientists?

725
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,400
All right, you convince me. Yeah, let's do the list. Yeah, actually, the I'm

726
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,800
saying that because of a dream that I had. Oh, that's actually good because of

727
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
of a dream that I had last night.

728
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Guys, we're getting into dream interpretation, okay?

729
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,100
Uh-huh.

730
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Real quick, Patrick, are you a dreamer?

731
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,700
I'm a dreamer. I'm somebody that actually I log a lot of my dreams.

732
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,200
Really?

733
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,500
I wake up and I do log my dreams.

734
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you have any interest in sharing one?

735
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
Whose slide is first? It's going to be mine?

736
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,300
Yeah.

737
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:02,200
Okay, so yeah, actually, here are some of my dreams that I've had.

738
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,040
The first one, I think we all know, I've talked about it every which way. I've talked about

739
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:20,720
this dream. It's not clicking. Son of a bitch. I love the production value of this show.

740
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:29,600
What am I waiting? I'm not getting a carrot, bud. Don't you dare try to make me eat a carrot.

741
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,680
Do I do more monologue stuff till we get this text? Yeah, do one more monologue.

742
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,080
A walking, talking human tornado. This is okay. Wait, hold on.

743
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,720
This is not. This is not a premise for a fucking monologue joke. What do you

744
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,720
mean? There's never going killer. The covid killer bees. Remember that

745
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,960
talking human tornado? Monologue joke should ever start with a walking,

746
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,840
talking human, a walking, talking human tornado has arrived in the small town of

747
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,800
uh, Poughkeepsie, New York.

748
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,360
Uh, residents of Poughkeepsie state.

749
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:14,480
The big tornado is actually a nuisance and we want him out of our fucking

750
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,240
town and we want him dead.

751
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,760
How's that a joke?

752
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,680
There's no, I can't even think right now.

753
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm so confused about if we're doing the list. I can't even tell the production or anything.

754
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,280
You're obsessed with the production. I'm obsessed. I'm just asking. You know what I'm obsessed

755
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,780
with right now is this human tornado. Is this working now or no? No. Are you just going

756
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:44,920
to click through for me? Give me a second. This is good radio. This is really good radio.

757
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,360
It would be good if you could come up with one thing besides the fucking human tornado.

758
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,960
try that again. Okay, all right

759
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:58,360
dozens more and today as actress Selena Gomez was found dead in

760
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,260
her Los Angeles home.

761
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:09,360
Many are speculating that

762
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,360
the cause of death was a walk and talking human tornado

763
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,460
I walked all the way from Poughkeepsie and all the way to L.A.

764
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
Wait, say this story again.

765
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,460
Millions of people mourn today as actress Selena Gomez was

766
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:35,460
This is a boner. It's a boner. Is everybody getting a boner because you said Selena Gomez?

767
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
Okay.

768
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
Found dead in her Los Angeles.

769
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:43,460
No, you can go for it.

770
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
I can go for it now.

771
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Okay. Yeah, the Chris Griffin dream.

772
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,460
A real dream I had where I saw Chris Griffin at the mall.

773
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,460
I talk about it a lot.

774
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,460
It turned into a viral video.

775
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,460
And Joe Chill said it has Adult Swim vibes.

776
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,460
It was a little bit Adult Swim vibes

777
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
because of the absurdity of the premise.

778
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,460
The absurdity of the premise and the property

779
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,460
which is a Turner property.

780
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,460
True.

781
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,460
Adult Swim has the rights for it.

782
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,460
Does the reruns, yeah of course.

783
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,460
So I looked into this dream

784
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:16,420
which I believe what this means is two things.

785
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,100
I had a dream about a famous person, Chris Griffin.

786
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,560
This could mean that he is my role model.

787
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,940
If you dream about a famous person that you admire,

788
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,660
it could indicate that you see them as a role model

789
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,140
or that you are seeking guidance and inspiration from them.

790
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,660
And I was inspired to do this video.

791
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,660
So it actually--

792
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,440
- That doesn't surprise me, I guess,

793
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,740
that Chris Griffin would be like a role model for you.

794
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,340
Yeah, well I have my own evil monkey problems of my own.

795
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,580
You have and you pattern a lot of your life after Chris Griffin I would say.

796
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,580
But here's the other thing.

797
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,580
You pulled into the milk thing.

798
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,580
Here's the other thing.

799
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
That shit was funny man.

800
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
That was funny.

801
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,180
Here's the other part of this.

802
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,180
Celebrity culture.

803
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,860
If you dream about a famous person that you do not know personally, it could indicate

804
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,900
that you were struggling with the pressure of celebrity culture or that you were feeling

805
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,180
overwhelmed with the media's obsession with fame and success.

806
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,020
So this is you coping with your status as one of the biggest celebs in the universe.

807
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I guess.

808
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,740
This is after, you know, I'm going to have my own free form.

809
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,740
If right now is any indication.

810
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,060
If Patrick Night Live goes.

811
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,740
If Patrick Night Live happens, I'm going to be stressed out about celebrity culture.

812
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,460
I'm also going to be stressed out about walking, talking human tornadoes that exist in the

813
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,460
future.

814
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,500
Have you ever dreamed about a walking, talking human tornado?

815
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,620
No, but I have dreamed about...

816
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:39,420
Three nights ago I had a dream that I befriended an old Italian Long Island mechanic guy.

817
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,420
Is this true?

818
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
This is true.

819
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
All of these are true, yes?

820
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,420
These are all true.

821
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
They are all written down in my notes app.

822
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,940
I woke up in the morning and I told my girlfriend, I said I had the most amazing dream.

823
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,260
It was playing that Queen song, "Ooooh, you're making me live."

824
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,140
I was hearing that in my head while we were having marble races in his fort and everything.

825
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,460
And at the end of the dream I tried to hug him and he said, "Don't hug me, that's gay."

826
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,460
Wow.

827
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,940
Wow. You have a very lively dream world life. Yeah. Well, so... Have you ever done lucid

828
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:15,260
dreaming? Maybe that's what it was. Maybe in my brain I was creating all of this. If

829
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:20,540
you woke up in your dream and realized you were dreaming and you could do whatever you

830
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:26,300
want, you would just hang out with a guy in Long Island? Yeah. Wow. That really doesn't

831
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:33,620
surprise me I guess. And he told me hugging another man is gay. I shouldn't hug him. Different

832
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:38,280
dream plots about an old man. Number one, the number one thing, the most common types

833
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:46,780
of old man dreams is about, the most common types of old man dreams is about an old man

834
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:50,900
as an authority figure providing guidance in almost all cases. It's smart to follow

835
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,060
this old man's advice. He told me to try to not hug him because that would be gay. I had

836
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,220
to stop hugging all of my male friends. You're not a big hugger, I don't think. Are you?

837
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,660
I think I am. I don't think that's what was being told to me in my dream. I don't think

838
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,820
you've ever hugged me. I think I have. I don't think so, man. Well, I'm definitely not going

839
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:18,740
to do it right now. Do it right now. No, the dream world told me no. He got denied by the

840
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,140
dream world. I was denied by the dream world. I cannot hug anyone. I cannot hug any male

841
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:35,740
friends. This is another dream that I've talked about a lot on this show. It's a dream that

842
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,040
my older brother had called the poop dream. I've talked every which way about it, but

843
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,780
for the people who don't know, it's a reoccurring nightmare that my older brother has had since

844
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,940
he was five. A doctor comes into a room where my brother is strapped onto an operating table

845
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:56,540
and the doctor cuts his butt off and poop goes everywhere, which is not for all the medical

846
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,260
students who listen to this not going to happen. If you cut off someone's, that's not how it

847
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:06,540
where the butt does not. It's not a it does not hold all of that holds poop all day long.

848
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,780
It's part of it's basically just a cushion. It has almost nothing to do with poop, but

849
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,900
do basically nothing. It's the butthole that you have to worry about. You really need to

850
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,400
worry about this thing. The butthole is more important than the butt. By a mile.

851
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,880
It's basically the butt is the butthole shell. Yeah. And think of a butt like a

852
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,560
peanut. Yeah exactly. Well sure. Or a turtle. Yeah any animal. Any animal with a

853
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,880
shell. Yeah a turtle is actually a really yeah a turtle is not a shell.

854
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,000
Basically the same exact as a butt. The same exact thing as a butt. So I looked

855
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,960
into this dream because I mean he's probably never looked into it. He's just

856
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:51,240
told me about it a lot and good news for him, wealth is about to surprise him. Wealth is

857
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,480
about to, dream experts associate many poop dreams with money and prosperity which is

858
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,320
a good omen. You may not be looking for gains in a business venture or a job promotion but

859
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,880
the universe is about to reward your best efforts with surprising good fortune and that's

860
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,960
good. He does a lot of scratchers and sports betting. So this is amazing news for him.

861
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:16,960
This is amazing. Every single time that he has this poop dream. Money. Money. Money.

862
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,960
Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money. Money.

869
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,960
And so this got me interested in other poop dreams.

870
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,960
This is a dream from Reddit that I'll read for you right now.

871
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,960
"Why do I keep having these gross dreams? I want to start

872
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,960
this off by saying I have no poop obsessions. My relationship

873
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,960
with poop is normal. Face palm emoji." Face palm, girl face palm.

874
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,960
"For girl, face palm emoji. Friday night I had a dream that

875
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,960
I ate poop. In my dream it was gross, but not as gross as eating poop would

876
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,060
would usually be after I ate it. I realized I had to be somewhere to meet

877
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:02,660
people and didn't have a toothbrush and had poop in my teeth. As a result, I was

878
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,680
picking tiny bits of poop out of my teeth and just flicking them everywhere.

879
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,360
In my head, I was thinking, damn, I'm making a mess.

880
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm gonna regret this when I need to clean it up, but I kept doing it. It was

881
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,760
really bizarre. TLDR, I keep having poop dreams and it's bothering me. The answer

882
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,780
that I found for this

883
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,320
which this image is so crazy. This is the image that you found? Okay. This was

884
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,480
from the website that I was consulting to find the answers. For people listening,

885
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,640
this is a picture of kind of a nebula with a plate, clipboard, a fork and a

886
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,820
knife and a spoon, an entire table setting overlaid on top of it. Over a

887
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,760
galaxy and the...

888
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,840
No poop seen anywhere. The title says, "Why do we dream of eating poop?"

889
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,720
Why do we?

890
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,640
Well,

891
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Experts believe that dreaming of poop is a sign of something more spiritual.

892
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,060
They believe that the dream is a signal from our subconscious mind urging us to

893
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,320
pay attention to our innermost feelings.

894
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,440
Dreams can be a way for us to explore our deepest desires and

895
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,080
learn more about ourselves.

896
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,120
Conclusion, if you dream about eating poop, you want to eat poop.

897
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,640
>> Like it's like it's a- >> It's a subconscious desire.

898
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,640
>> It's like dreaming about somebody and then you're like, I want to marry that

899
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,280
person.

900
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,080
or you dream about like a big steak and you want to go eat a big steak.

901
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,280
I have that dream pretty often.

902
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,080
Yeah, me too.

903
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,180
This next thing here.

904
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:28,580
Oh, yeah.

905
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,880
This is another poop eating dream that I found.

906
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,780
All of these are poop.

907
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,480
No, there's a good chunk of them.

908
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,880
I only have one poop thing.

909
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,080
What does a dream of an alligator eating your dog poop mean?

910
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,380
Last night, I dreamed that there were three small alligators under my bed

911
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,380
and all three of them came out facing me.

912
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,880
One of the alligators started eating my dog poop.

913
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,180
My dog and I was on the bed.

914
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,380
Nobody answered this sadly.

915
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,780
No, this question does not have any answers. No, this is on Cura. There is

916
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,540
no answers for this and I was wondering maybe you could shine some light under

917
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:02,060
this. Why this person would dream that three small alligators would come out

918
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:06,620
from under their bed and eat their dog. This feels like a I mean this feels

919
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:06,900
like

920
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,660
what's the what's the last book of the Bible

921
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,940
revelation revelations feels like a revelations dream. The dream given to

922
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,060
Paul or John or whoever about the empire.

923
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,060
Oh my God, and then one day this happens to them.

924
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,060
Yeah, this is like the serpent coming out of the water.

925
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,060
This is like a, I think this is allegorical.

926
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,060
Uh-huh. I think what this person should do is stay away completely from Louisiana.

927
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,060
Yeah, well that's the thing. The thing that sucks so much about dreams is you might have this dream,

928
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:40,060
an alligator ate my dog poop, and you might think this is about the fall of the Roman Empire.

929
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,060
Yeah.

930
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,060
This is what this is going to be. Okay, I know the future.

931
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,100
know the future. But then yeah, one day it just fucking happens.

932
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,500
Yeah. One day, you wake up, the alligators come out of your bed,

933
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,580
they start eating your dog's poop, and you're sitting there,

934
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,700
you're calling animal control, and you're saying, "Guys, I thought that

935
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,220
this was an allegory. It turns out I was seeing the future." It's an

936
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,220
alligator. Yeah, exactly. It's an alligator dream. It's an alligator

937
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:07,420
dream. Yep, and you have allegations that you're alleging that these alligators

938
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,900
ate a dog's shit. Which, by the way... Which is not illegal. It's not

939
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:18,420
illegal but the thing that's like weirding me out a little bit, why you got dog poop

940
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:24,100
on your floor constantly that it's just laying around and you're worried that alligators

941
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,020
are going to get it? Buddy, you should be worried about your dog getting it and your dog eating

942
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,020
its own poop.

943
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:35,580
It means they have a low fiber. The other day Phil ate an entire one of his shits.

944
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,380
before he and he looked your face before you came in. Not true. I looked your face

945
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,820
to wake you up. He drank water. It okay. All right. All right. There's next one.

946
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:49,720
No answers. I was hoping you could answer this one. Have you ever dreamed

947
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,740
about this boy in your back garden with animals pooping on him and he's eating

948
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,540
it in your house? It's in a dry place.

949
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,620
I haven't

950
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:03,660
let me ask. Let me ask you this question again. Okay. Have you ever dreamed about

951
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,860
this boy in your backyard garden with animals pooping on him and he's eating

952
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:13,940
it and your house is in a dry place. So what is in a dry place like a desert

953
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,260
would I mean

954
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,460
all these

955
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,620
yeah, there's a lot going on here. I would say I've really never had any kind

956
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,260
of dreams like this. This is a never had a dream about this boy in your back

957
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:29,260
garden with animals pooping on him and he's eating it and your house is in a

958
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,660
dry place. I mean you'd have to specify the animals man like yeah, this is all

959
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,140
the animals of the forest. This is not, yeah, I mean all the animals of the ark. This is

960
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,540
not ringing a bell for me. No, I've never really had my house in a dry place. No, I

961
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,740
haven't said it. Can't say I've had that dream either. So yeah, I guess there's no answer

962
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:51,100
for this one. I don't think you'll ever get an answer. These are some other dreams. No

963
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:56,660
poop at all. Okay, this is by Steven 14. Back when I was 11 years old, I had a dream about

964
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,140
me being in my mother's room and she told me there was a mentally retarded psychotic

965
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:04,380
man same mentality as leatherface from texas chainsaw with hydrocephalus was going to kill

966
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,120
my stuffed animals and that I needed to save them before it was too late, referring to

967
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,120
them as real life people or creatures. What was so creepy about the whole dream was that

968
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:18,460
over all the suspense of almost going into my room where the hydrocephalus psycho is and

969
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,960
my toys were at, as I almost walked into the room I heard singing sheep. As I almost entered

970
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,360
through the doorway the dream ended right there. There was almost like a weird connection

971
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,100
and the dream as if the psychotic mentally challenged man with hydrocephalus was my brother and

972
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,520
the stuffed animals was my children?

973
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,700
It was very chilling and surreal of a dream of eccentric messages that didn't quite tell

974
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,340
me but I learned on my own in a very low-key and vague way.

975
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:49,040
This is from Steven and this was I think 12 years ago he asked this, which he was 14,

976
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,000
12 years ago.

977
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,680
my research on when I consulted the dreams, all the other dream experts, what they said

978
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,800
is that, "Steven, you are wasting your time. Your emotions are turbulent. You know something

979
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,880
bad is about to happen and you tend to hurt others. Your dream is a reflection of your

980
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,800
own desires and I hope you get the help you so desperately need, Steven." I realize this

981
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:17,080
is 12 years ago. We don't know what happened to Steven 14, the most prolific murderer in

982
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,800
the world. He could be the smiley face killer. Holy shit.

983
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,860
who fucking knows man. He could have hydrocephalus and be deranged. Hydrocephalus, I would say

984
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:31,580
I wouldn't be that scared of anybody with hydrocephalus. My cousins got it. Doesn't it, do you just

985
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,300
have water in your head? You just get your head's a little big. Do they take the water

986
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,060
out? Yeah, you gotta get like a shunt. Yeah, see that's not, I'm not scared of anybody

987
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:47,060
with a shunt. Yeah. There's next one. Does it mean anything that I'm straight and had

988
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:52,740
a gay dream. I think this is the last one I had. I consulted two people. This is a Q-ora

989
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,740
question.

990
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,740
Why do you call it Q-ora?

991
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Quora?

992
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
Quora.

993
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:04,700
Quora. Q-ora is how I say it. There's two things. There's two answers to this possibly.

994
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,380
You need some attention. You have dreams of being gay because you lack attention and affection

995
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,700
from the people around you. You are feeling lonely because of circumstances in your life.

996
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,700
That's one side of the coin.

997
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,820
So they're saying that you're gay for attention.

998
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:22,500
you're gay for attention. That's one side of the coin. The other side of the coin trouble

999
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:28,340
is coming. Oh no. You if you suddenly had a dream of being gay or you had a lesbian dreams

1000
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:33,220
at night, it might mean that a problem is coming your way. So there's two sides. There's

1001
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:40,140
there's you know, I was looking at this. There's two possible answers. But thankfully, this

1002
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,780
woman was answered by Big Jay. Oh,

1003
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,420
yes,

1004
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:51,580
really answered by Big Jay Ocreson from the from the agent of skanks podcast and

1005
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,580
he said it's just a stupid dream. I dream all kind of crazy shit like

1006
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,700
barbecuing with a duck and getting robbed by a cat. It's just a dream. Relax.

1007
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,660
If you're straight, you know you love woman, so it should be clear that the

1008
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,100
dream is just a bunch of bullshit and I just want to look at his profile picture

1009
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,540
him with a gorilla grip on a can of monster energy.

1010
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,740
This has to be actually him.

1011
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,140
It has to be the real Big Jay.

1012
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,940
It says he knows Italian. This is him.

1013
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,140
This is the real Big Jay Oakerson. Yeah. Well, that's all my stuff.

1014
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:25,040
Okay. Go over to Dreams Caleb.

1015
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,740
Dream Caleb. I'd love to see that collab.

1016
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,700
Do you think I'm a dream boat?

1017
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,140
I think you look like Dreams Mask.

1018
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,140
Okay. Moving on.

1019
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,280
slash dream analysis. This comes from her Pacifica. Okay, I need help with this

1020
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,640
sexual dream. So I have a friend who I used to go to boarding school with. I've

1021
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,240
seen him three times since I left and his mom is always over welcoming. She's

1022
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,800
very attractive with the body of a goddess. Last night, I kept having dreams

1023
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,880
that she was coming on to me blatantly. For example, in the dream, she put her

1024
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,660
boobs in my face, sit on lap, etc. What does all this mean? I doubt that it means

1025
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:02,520
that she wants to sleep with me. So what is it? Feedback greatly appreciated. I

1026
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,520
I included this because I think this guy's definitely just asked. He's just

1027
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,520
hoping somebody

1028
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:11,960
responds like this means she wants to. She wants that D. She jumped into your

1029
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:15,680
dream to put her boobs in your face. She's dreaming about you and she's

1030
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,160
dreaming about putting her boobs in your face. That's what this means. Dream

1031
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,200
about someone telling me to buy beer.

1032
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:28,680
This is from Adderall 5150. That's an amazing user name. It's a great name.

1033
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:33,600
That is so fucking good. Had a dream earlier today about my dad telling me to buy a certain

1034
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,760
type of beer this weekend. Can't remember the name of it and he told me that the beer

1035
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,960
can would be worth a lot of money very soon. What does this mean? I think that's pretty

1036
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,560
cut and dry what that means. It means he wants to be your dad. Go bring your dad a beer. Your

1037
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:51,320
dad wants a fucking beer. This is not that complicated Adderall 5150. Yeah. Dream, this

1038
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,760
is just the name. Dreaming of killing snakes, then snakes becoming tiny and developing fish

1039
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,760
I'm pregnant.

1040
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,440
Matt Farris Okay, that, I can tell you this one.

1041
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,640
I've consulted a lot of dream experts recently online.

1042
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,640
This means either, I mean, same as like dreaming about being gay, your baby is going to die

1043
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,640
or your baby is going to grow up and become gay.

1044
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,680
Ryan Seacrest Oh shit.

1045
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
Wait, why?

1046
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Matt Farris Because snakes, phallic.

1047
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Ryan Seacrest Oh true.

1048
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,840
Matt Farris Fish heads are, I think, a little bit gay.

1049
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:31,840
What's gay about a fish head? Eyes on the side of it.

1050
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,840
Gay side eye? Gay side eye, exactly.

1051
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:42,840
World of Warcraft dream. Whoa, from GXViper98.

1052
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,840
This means, sound crazy, but hear me out. I was playing this game, World of Warcraft,

1053
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,840
when I decided to join a group for a raid on a dungeon. The leader was JK Simmons.

1054
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,640
Wow. Yes, the J.K. Simmons. People were telling me about his very strict rules

1055
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,560
about his raids where people were actually dying in real life. I remember

1056
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,360
his game name was Dr. Rain. Think of his character in the movie Whiplash, but a

1057
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,800
hundred times more insane. Anyway, we start the raid and everything goes off

1058
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,880
without a hitch. I mean, we were tearing through this place at record speed. We

1059
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,440
reached one of the bosses that was known to be pretty tough. The Doc, that's what

1060
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,360
calls up the doc, made sure if anyone screw up, they would pay the consequences. We start

1061
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:29,280
the battle and it was going well. Then one of our key players starts to lag behind. He

1062
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,000
was given a warning, but it continues. So doc banishes him from the game, never to play

1063
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,360
again. I don't remember much after that. What could this mean?

1064
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
Then it says, "I think they fell asleep while they were writing."

1065
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,920
What the fuck could this mean?

1066
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:47,080
Well, okay. The first part about this, we already said, I mean, we already touched upon that

1067
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:52,760
with the Chris Griffin dream. Oh, so this could mean as an idol. Yeah, it sees J.K. Simmons

1068
01:00:52,760 --> 01:01:04,300
as an idol or GX Viper is really, really like upset or concerned with celebrity culture and

1069
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:09,860
like there maybe GX Viper is a secret celebrity that we don't know. What could GX be? This

1070
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,800
could be G, G first initial first name that's coming to my head, George Lopez. This could

1071
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:24,080
could be G L because he replaced Latin X G X Latin X George Lopez Viper 98 born in

1072
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,420
98 or he's 98 years old or yeah. One of the two could be 98. He could be born on

1073
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,300
double day. He could he could be born on double sleep. There's leap day and

1074
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,680
there's double day scary. Yeah, high school, a fem boy and non stop coming

1075
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:42,860
Dave for eagles. I had this dream where I was back in high school. I graduated a

1076
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,680
time ago. My father was teaching mechanics to students. I asked to take his class. He

1077
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,480
said no. I was then walking in the school hallway. All my friends and family, along

1078
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,080
with some of my old teachers, were there. But none would let me in class till I got

1079
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:03,420
a GF. I found this cute Asian femboy/twin. We kissed and then he bent down and blew me.

1080
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,440
After he got done blowing me, I couldn't stop coming. No matter how hard I tried, I

1081
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,360
was gushing like mad. I was coming hard. He even put my cock in his ass. He said it would

1082
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,920
be okay till we got to the nurse. He seemed to really like me shooting

1083
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,840
myself into his ass. He even said it was nice. Once I removed my cock,

1084
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,440
it was still shooting. Any idea what this means?

1085
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:30,020
What could this mean, man? What could this possibly mean? I don't know.

1086
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,600
I really don't know what this could mean. You know what I'll say?

1087
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,820
If I had this dream, this is what I would say. That probably means

1088
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,620
nothing. Yeah.

1089
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,860
I would wake up... It doesn't mean anything. If I had this dream,

1090
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,540
I would wake up and then I would just say like, "Oh, Jesus."

1091
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:46,400
I wouldn't even write this one down. I wouldn't even journal this one because it's so unimportant.

1092
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,620
This one means nothing, man.

1093
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,780
It means absolutely nothing.

1094
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,020
Don't ever think about this one again.

1095
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,020
No, no, no.

1096
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,020
It's that fucking simple.

1097
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:55,180
There's nothing going on in your brain.

1098
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:59,820
No. Your brain is completely fine. There's no questions to be answered here. This means

1099
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,820
nothing.

1100
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:05,740
This is basically, it's like you had a dream about going to the store.

1101
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,420
Yeah, this is, it's completely, it's nothing. Sometimes dreams are just dreams, man. Don't

1102
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,660
worry about it too much Dave. The pink pickle milkshake. A 30 something male

1103
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,460
dressed as little Bo Peep with curly brown locks drinks a pink pickle milkshake

1104
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,220
in a pastel pink milkshake parlor. He stands in it alone in the middle of the

1105
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,340
room. A Chinese friend from growing up is two generations younger again. In real

1106
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:31,280
life an older version lived in Hollywood in the milkshake MTV video singer

1107
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,000
boyfriend's house. Again celebrity. She has a small bar apartment with bar tables.

1108
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
She uses the bar tables as a bed for her baby and guests.

1109
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
This is again, again, celebrity MTV superstar.

1110
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
The pink milkshake though. I am wondering what that could mean.

1111
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Yeah, I didn't see much about a pink pickle milkshake when it comes to the drink.

1112
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Pink pickle. Pink pickle.

1113
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
A pink pickle milkshake.

1114
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Let's dissect that. Pink pickle.

1115
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
This is phallic.

1116
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's very phallic.

1117
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
But it's also feminine.

1118
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's pink, the divine feminine. It's phallic, the divine masculine.

1119
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
This is a confluence of man and woman. This means that you need to get married.

1120
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Yes, and the milkshake is the pink pickle milkshake.

1121
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:28,000
The milkshake is the pink pickle. The pink pickle phallus produces milk, sperm.

1122
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And you shake the balls to make it come.

1123
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,300
shake the balls to make it come into the pink, creating a baby, your two generations younger

1124
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:44,900
again Asian friend, Chinese friend, MTV, what does the MTV logo look like? A house. You are

1125
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:50,560
going to have a long prosperous future. Yes. And you will bear a child. You will have a

1126
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,480
Chinese baby. Yep. You will have a completely Chinese baby with your pink milkshake wife.

1127
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,960
welcome Dan Bernard's Mind. We're doing a lot more than this other guy who said a pink

1128
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:07,000
pickle milkshake never heard of it. We never heard of it and we came up with a conclusion.

1129
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,680
And little Bo Peep means that your Chinese friend will become a girl.

1130
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,480
My weirdest dream with a rapper. This is from Sasha 3. In my dream I had sex with a rapper

1131
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,480
named Busta Rhymes. He and I were love making. I had my pajamas on but his entire body was

1132
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,400
silver except his face. Busta would hold me while kissing me on my neck. When he

1133
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,680
morphed into a liquid, Busta would kiss me on my stomach. I really loved him and

1134
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,560
the sex. The dream ended when he told me that he loved me, tickled and hugged me,

1135
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,800
gave me a kiss on the forehead, cheek, neck, and lips. When he was a watery figure

1136
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:45,040
of himself and he morphed into a silver liquid and left. This is what he looked

1137
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:50,360
like but didn't include a photo. But this got a response and analysis. Okay. Sounds

1138
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:55,040
like you met an entity. There are discussions on what they are. An atheist view is that

1139
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:58,840
it is compartments of our brain communicating with itself so that we experience ourself

1140
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:02,720
meeting a different person. The dream state allows this split because it frees the mind

1141
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,680
to play with itself. People who are more spiritual believe it is spirits, souls who exist in

1142
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:12,440
an ethereal plane, hanging out. These entities are quite normal. If you search "vapor vape,"

1143
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,440
"synth wave," and "outrun art," they are quite prevalent. I think they meant "vapor wave."

1144
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,840
they did. It is also a bit like the liquid Terminator. I guess it is some kind of machine

1145
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:27,040
entity. However, it deals with poetry. These do exist. Poetry, raps, rhymes, busta. Busta

1146
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,920
is one of the greatest poets of all time. These do exist. You can encounter them during

1147
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,200
dreams and you will notice it whenever they do appear because they will give you a poem.

1148
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,640
My personal opinion is that you have been visited by a black spore print on tin foil

1149
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,440
who became liquid culture. What's a black spore print on tin foil? I don't know, but

1150
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,440
It's not a good thing to call Busta Rhymes.

1151
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,440
No, it's not a very kind thing to say about Busta.

1152
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,440
It's a very rude thing to call Busta Rhymes, man.

1153
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,440
That's one of the best ever.

1154
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,440
Garrick McFly.

1155
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,440
And then the last one, "Dream Meaning of Poop."

1156
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,440
It might be intriguing to see yourself pooping in your dreams,

1157
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,440
but it does happen. Discover with me the dream

1158
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,440
meaning of pooping in a toilet or pooping on the floor

1159
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,440
within other feces dream

1160
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,440
interpretations. Did you click this YouTube video here?

1161
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,440
I have the link here. We don't

1162
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,440
have to watch it. We can if Jubio can get it to work,

1163
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
but it just has a

1164
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,640
really good title. So I do kind of want to at least show the title.

1165
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,640
I do want to see what this title is.

1166
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:20,840
Let's see. I mean...

1167
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:25,840
It's a lady and her husband who do dream analysis on YouTube.

1168
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,840
That's interesting.

1169
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:29,040
What is it? 30 seconds long, this video?

1170
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,340
No, no, this is an ad.

1171
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:30,940
Oh, okay.

1172
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,840
Goddamn ads.

1173
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,440
Yeah, goddammit.

1174
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,740
It's time to get YouTube premium.

1175
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,240
But this is...

1176
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,920
Poop dreams, dream meaning of pooping in toilet, taking a crap on the floor.

1177
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,920
Okay, wait, because this could actually help the alligator person a lot,

1178
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:51,880
because they're saying a dream about taking a crap on the floor, right?

1179
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,080
Yeah. Their dog is taking a crap on the floor.

1180
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,520
So maybe, okay, now that I'm thinking of that,

1181
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,980
okay,

1182
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:05,220
taking a crap on the floor, your dog is taking a crap on the floor,

1183
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:07,440
that is a different entity other than yourself, right?

1184
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:15,920
So, as stated in the Busta Rhymes thing, your mind is playing with itself.

1185
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,760
So you're playing with the idea.

1186
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,340
Your dog is pooping on the floor.

1187
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
Your dog is you.

1188
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:24,340
That's a separate, your own separate mind entity.

1189
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,220
Your brain is now, you're saying your dog is an extension of yourself.

1190
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,120
You want to poop on your floor and you want those.

1191
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:35,360
The alligators come eat the poop off the floor.

1192
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,040
The alligators are representative, again, of yourself.

1193
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,140
- Look at this emoji.

1194
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,580
They used the poop from the emoji movie.

1195
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,920
Pooping in good toilet seat.

1196
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,960
Wait, play this really quick.

1197
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,880
I just wanna hear a little bit of this.

1198
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,200
I didn't watch the whole thing.

1199
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,560
- If the toilet was in good condition,

1200
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,100
it wasn't broken or dirty,

1201
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,080
and you saw yourself pooping in this particular toilet,

1202
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,160
it means that you are doing your best

1203
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,760
to handle and manage tough circumstances

1204
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,720
that you are currently experiencing

1205
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,720
Wow.

1206
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,920
And that you are certainly progressing in all the areas of your life.

1207
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:13,800
Okay, we can combine this with the definition I just came with.

1208
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,400
This dream means that you need to get yourself situated and make better choices.

1209
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,600
When you're stressing too much about a particular matter, you're not going to think clear and

1210
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,840
straight.

1211
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:30,800
That is why it is best to let go of things that you cannot manage and work with the things

1212
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,800
that you can fix.

1213
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,800
Why does she seem like she just...

1214
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Okay, here we go.

1215
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:41,800
If you try to go potty on the toilet and it landed on the floor, it means that you need

1216
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,800
to have a better attitude towards life.

1217
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,800
Oh.

1218
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Let go of resentment, anger, guilt.

1219
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Okay.

1220
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,800
All of those things block you from achieving your true purpose.

1221
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,800
Taking a dump in the bedroom.

1222
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,800
Bedroom?

1223
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Taking a dump in your own room, this indicates that you are feeling guilt about something

1224
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,440
that you have done and now you find yourself in a situation that it is hard to get out.

1225
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,600
Okay. Very sticky situation. So the dog... You should solve that when the dog is the extension

1226
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,080
of the self. Alternatively to this... Wait, let her finish. Let her finish. Diarrhea.

1227
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,080
This can predict severe bad health for the one that is dreaming about this.

1228
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,080
I'm Eva, a dream consultant and thank you so much for watching. I invite you to please subscribe,

1229
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,720
We have to subscribe and we have to ask her a question. We have to ask her what this alligator

1230
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,740
poop dream means because I am freaking myself out trying to think of it because now it's

1231
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:44,880
like if the dog is the extension of the person's self and the dog is pooping on the floor.

1232
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,480
Jimmy is going to ask him. I have a dream where three small alligators come out from

1233
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:57,140
under the bed and they eat the dog poop. What could this possibly mean?

1234
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:02,100
They start eating the dog poop I have laying on the floor.

1235
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,980
They were also, their house was also in a dry place or was that the boy getting pooped

1236
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:06,980
on by the animals?

1237
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,580
No, that was the boy getting pooped on by the animals.

1238
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:12,900
And then Jubia, really quickly, what is that Spanish comment?

1239
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,540
What does that mean?

1240
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:18,820
Okay, the emoji.

1241
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:25,860
What is the significance of having a bathroom with no poop?

1242
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,760
Is that what that says?

1243
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,760
Yeah, it's asking like you go to the bathroom, but there's no poop.

1244
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:37,760
That's credit. The only time in my life. I've ever been able to say it and say

1245
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,100
you will die in Spanish.

1246
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,960
You are going to die.

1247
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,100
It's the only time in my life that I've ever been able to translate a

1248
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,460
Spanish sentence. All right, that's amazing. So if you guys have any dreams

1249
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,000
and you want us to analyze, I think that we should definitely do this episode

1250
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,200
again with Cameron. Yeah, and with the with the we'd like to hear your dreams.

1251
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,800
So let us know anything that we need to tell people about. Go check out the

1252
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,840
Patreon. I'm gonna weirdly be I'm at some college in Pennsylvania tomorrow

1253
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,960
doing stand up, but I don't remember the name of the college. Oh yeah, you're

1254
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,120
opening for our friend Neil. Are you guys? Yeah, co show together. I think

1255
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,440
I'm gonna just do probably four minutes. Yeah, you're opening for Neil Linsky.

1256
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah, I don't remember what the name of the college is, but if you go to a

1257
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,400
college in Pennsylvania, there's like some percentage chance I'll be there

1258
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:28,080
tomorrow. Maybe just look up Neil Linsky, Pennsylvania College address.

1259
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,040
Yeah, just don't, don't, we'll, here, wait, actually, I'll, no, I don't need,

1260
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,120
who cares? You should plug it. Nobody's gonna be, I mean, nobody from this is

1261
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:38,200
gonna be there. You don't know that. There could be. I know that, I know that.

1262
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,240
I'm just doing it 'cause he needs somebody to drive him, so I'll do it.

1263
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,200
Okay. Alright, bye everybody. Bye bye.

1264
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Welcome back to Fox 54, serving Los Angeles.

1265
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,520
We're here with comedian and podcaster, Cameron Fetter.

1266
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,280
Cameron, how are you doing today?

1267
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,800
- I'm supposed to answer.

1268
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,880
So I would do stuff like that.

1269
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,720
- Yeah.

1270
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,080
- And I would maybe, I'd probably watch a few hundred hours

1271
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,880
of Michael Cera to train myself like an AI

1272
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,720
to learn his mannerisms.

1273
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,600
- You know what I, you just, the thing is about

1274
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,400
if you do the news, if you do one of these news shows,

1275
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,760
I'm not saying yes unless it's one of the episodes where they bring a monkey out.

1276
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,300
Yeah.

1277
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,100
Why is every local news channel gotten?

1278
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,300
Listen, listen, listen.

1279
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:25,800
Okay.

1280
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:26,800
Listen, listen, listen.

1281
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,600
Wow, wow.

1282
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,700
That, first of all, that's why it should be on the news.

1283
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,200
Yeah.

1284
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,800
Because you make your clip go viral.

1285
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,800
I'm going to give you your D.D. Mega Doodoo moment.

1286
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,300
D.D. Mega Doodoo?

1287
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,800
What was the der hap of, what was that other one?

1288
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,800
Where the lady had a stroke on the thing, or she said she had some kind of brain episode.

1289
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,400
I remember the guy throwing up on himself in an Xbox.

1290
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,800
In an Xbox video?

1291
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
