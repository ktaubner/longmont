Hi it's me Patrick from Podcasts About List. I'm sure at this point you're

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:11,080
already aware that every single one of these video episodes is started with a

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,340
little cold open to get you excited for the episode you're about to watch. So

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:26,340
this week I was tasked with creating the cold open and I just wanted to say that

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:34,660
I'm very proud of it and I hope that you like it just as much as I liked making

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:43,500
it. We have a great episode for you today and thank you for watching and then

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,940

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,980
- Okay, and start over.

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,980
Okay, now sing into the microphone and start over.

26
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,420
- Okay, so I have to sing?

27
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,860
- Okay, just do what you did, but start over.

28
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Okay, am I positioned correctly?

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Do I look like I'm in some kind of red racist clan?

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
No, wait.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
No.

32
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,860
Now you do.

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,860
No, you look like an AT.

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:33,860
Okay, so I'm never wearing anything ever again.

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Really?

36
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,860
Asshole.

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,860
Our plan worked.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
Fuck.

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm never wearing anything ever again.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,860
You're not going to get me to be naked all the time just by making fun of my clothes.

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
We're going to do a red hot chili peppers episode.

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Dude, I have to say, we only wear a sock on our penis.

43
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,860
It was huge for guys like me who think aliens are sexy as fuck.

44
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,860
Not only does ET get to be naked at the beginning, then he dresses like a girl.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
That is a serious score.

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,700
Hot as fuck yeah the first movie you get to watch with your family and Jack

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,220
I'll get to see a naked alien you see a naked alien and then a girl dressed in one

48
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,900
Yeah, and it's the same alien, but naked alien. Yeah. Yeah, he does go completely sheet white

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,820
He looks like a there's a scene in ET. I always forget that that scene existed where he like like he turns white et

50
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,900
Turn he say um nice to meet you. I'm et

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,940

Yeah white ass alien uh-huh they fuck you et we write him - at the end he's already queers fuck

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,260
That's right cuz he's under five feet tall

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:59,580
Yeah the but the scene where et turns like sheet white I forgot about and then I kept seeing like

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,940
Like that picture posted of like et

56
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,980
Turning like they just eat dead et on the ground half dead eat in the river half dead. He's half dead

57
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,260
Okay, you have to continue half dead alien have dead white alien

58
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,980
All right, that's how you find it

59
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:24,220
When you want to cool if you want to Google search it you look up half dead white alien and that comes up et

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,300
In a river pops up

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,480
What were you saying though? I just forgot that existed you forgot I forgot that scene existed

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,820
And I thought that it was a nightmare that I had when I was a kid okay that I understand

63
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,260
I've definitely had nightmares before and then like I've had a lot of nightmares where et

64
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:50,100
Had nightmares before but where I'm like man. What a weird nightmare, and then like two years later. It's like some weird holiday

65
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm at home the cables on small soldiers comes on and I'm like oh fucking shit. You wasn't even it was just a memory

66
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,760
I have yeah, I think specifically the et river scene. I think that's one that everybody thinks they just experienced

67
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,220
Yeah, I thought that I was sure

68
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:13,660
I've never heard you guys talk about this before I think might be right. I was convinced that that was filmed in the Charles River

69
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:19,380
As I love doing that when you're a kid is B is just be like oh

70
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,380
It's actually the office building in my town.

71
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,820
Which is a little different growing up in Boston

72
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,020
than growing up in Wilmington, North Carolina.

73
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,740
(laughing)

74
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,580
The only movie--

75
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,060
Not even, there's some movies filmed in Wilmington.

76
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,720
Growing up in Leland, like an hour outside,

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,940
I was like, I'm pretty sure that's actually

78
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,420
the back of the Best Buy.

79
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,700
(laughing)

80
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,940
I remember when, in the office, when Jim and Pam have,

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,740
they like, when they finally have a kiss or whatever,

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,740
get married or some shit like that,

83
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,140
you see like the back of a it's like the back of a warehouse or something oh yeah

84
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,040
and i was like

85
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,860
they had to use it so i think that's the best by in wilmington north carolina

86
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,960
all this by the exact as a

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,300
but it also was a bit you know it could have been filmed at best the police

88
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,700
station in my town was in a movie one time and it was slow that's keep

89
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,780
okay cameron dot redhead

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180
haha

91
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,340
but you're not supposed to see you're not supposed to actually run i don't

92
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,340
remember what it was a little while i remember it was fine time to use it the

93
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,160
fucking Sarnay as they made you shit

94
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,660
famous.

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,100
Oh dude that wasn't that was water

96
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,340
town.

97
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,820
You only have one town over.

98
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,460
It's one over but the only the only

99
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,080
movie I remember the same police

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,460
station.

101
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,260
Yeah you're right.

102
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,020
Growing up like

103
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,460
I never pieced it together that it

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,300
was filmed in New Hampshire was a

105
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,220
Jumanji.

106
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,940
Really.

107
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,220
I thought that's a lot of the

108
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,140
Jumanji.

109
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,860
Wait I thought they filmed it.

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,300
I thought they filmed that inside

111
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,300
of a board game.

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,420
What the fuck are you talking

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,820
about.

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,540
Now a key in New Hampshire.

115
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,060
That's where that's where all of

116
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,460
that was like shot. They filmed Zathura in space. Yeah. For real?

117
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,060
For real. I love Zathura. I mean, technically, you know,

118
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,360
with the Earth spinning. Is there a scene in that movie where the

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,160
guy, the kid is like, "Oh, fuck, there's something at the door,"

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,560
and he goes and he opens the door and it's just space out there?

121
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,260
I think so. Yeah. That's so awesome. And then, who's that? That movie's so sick, dude.

122
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,260
It's Kristen Stewart. Kristen Stewart, yeah. And then it's like the reveal?

123
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,560
And then there's the lizards. What are the lizard aliens called, Jubio?

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
- In Zathura?

125
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
- Search Zathura, Lizard Alien.

126
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,280
- But there's this scene where like,

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,640
it's Dax Shepard in that movie.

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,520
And Kristen Stewart's character's like,

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,320
that's the hottest guy I've ever seen.

130
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,000
And then it's revealed that it's just the little kid

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
at the end.

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,660
- Oh yeah.

133
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,560
- It's been grown up.

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,400
- Oh yeah.

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,220
- Wait, this is the alien from Zathura?

136
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,060
- No, Search Lizard Alien's Zathura.

137
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:35,900
- No, this is definitely him.

138
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,560
- Search Lizard Alien.

139
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
- This is him, show this.

140
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
- Put this up on screen.

141
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,400
- Yeah, you gotta put it up.

142
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
- That's him.

143
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
(laughing)

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,000
- I just wanna know what they're called.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,440
I remember thinking the name of them was really cool.

146
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,040
- They're called character alien lizard with gun 3D rigged.

147
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,160
(laughing)

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
- That looks like a--

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
- Please just look it up, I wanna know.

150
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,140
- Turtle boy from Toy Machine.

151
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,300
- They should make a new one.

152
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,120
- I guess I'll look it up on my phone, you're useless.

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,060
- If they made a third, so they went back to Jumanji.

154
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,840
But if they made a third, if they went,

155
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,240
Jumanji is Africa, which is the past,

156
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,360
and then they do Zathura, which is space,

157
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
which is the future.

158
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,680
- I don't think Jumanji takes place in Africa,

159
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,080
I think it takes place in a fictional world of Jumanji.

160
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,640
No, it's Africa.

161
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,760
I don't remember that movie that well.

162
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
No, maybe it is.

163
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,680
You're not going to believe what the lizard aliens are

164
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
called in Zagora.

165
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,960
They're called Zorgons.

166
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,720
Whoa.

167
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
Holy shit.

168
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,640
Bet you're glad I looked that up.

169
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
I am glad.

170
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
Zorgons.

171
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
Zorgons.

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,680
Did you see that one of the new Jumanji movies,

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,840
one of the plot point--

174
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,200
like the entire movie, I guess.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,160
I didn't see the movie, but I read about this.

176
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,880
I think part of it is like, there's a mix-up

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
when they go into the game, it's like a video game,

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
and it's like Kevin Hart in Jack Black's body,

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,680
and Jack Black is just doing Kevin Hart the entire movie.

180
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,960
- Jack Black does Black Jack,

181
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,880
like we've talked about many times.

182
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,160
He does Black Jack.

183
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,600
He finally gets his opportunity to go Black Jack.

184
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
- How many of those did they make?

185
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
I feel like they made like two or three.

186
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,920
- They made three that Kevin Hart was.

187
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,040
- Heavy, heavy fart.

188
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,160
- Yeah. - That's Jack Black.

189
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,080
- Heavy Bart.

190
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,840
- Mm-hmm, yep.

191
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
Keep going.

192
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,000
- Kevin Hart's heaven fart.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,040
He dies in the movie.

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,600
- Hey, as a heaven fart?

195
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,440
We're just playing heaven cart.

196
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
- Spoiler alert.

197
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,360
- Up there.

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,180
- That'd be pretty good.

199
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
That'd be a good video game

200
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,800
while your grandparents are in the Mario Kart situation.

201
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,640
It's not a bad idea.

202
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,480
- That's pretty good.

203
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,300
- Well, check this out.

204
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,000
- Pull this photo up, Jubio.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
- Your dad's gonna get demonetized.

206
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't do that.

207
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,940
Don't fucking do that.

208
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,640
But yeah, if they make a third Jumanji style Jumanji,

209
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,500
- Okay, I'll admit, Jumanji isn't in Africa.

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,560
- It's in a board game. - For now.

211
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
- Look, I'll, yeah, for now.

212
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,820
(laughing)

213
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,880
You're gonna go to Africa to meet Jumanji.

214
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,160
- I will, I'm charting an expedition

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,000
to see maybe if there's a town called Jumanji in Africa.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
But Zathura, that's in space.

217
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,200
- You don't need to chart an expedition

218
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
just to look at Google Maps.

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,240
- Here's my pitch, I mean, it needs to be a trilogy, right?

220
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,440
They already, they have Jumanji, that's in the jungle.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,800
that's in space. So then I think maybe that they could have like a third one that's just

222
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
called like...

223
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
In the water?

224
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Okay, no.

225
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
No.

226
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Just let him do his thing.

227
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
That's really fucking stupid.

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Yeah, right.

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
That's basically the same as the jungle.

230
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
That's basically...

231
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
You're right. I forgot there's a fish in Jumanji.

232
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,240
And you wouldn't be able to hear the lines.

233
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Yeah.

234
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Yeah.

235
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
Asshole.

236
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,520
And I'm sorry. And Cameron, put her there.

237
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Thank you.

238
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,440
Okay, continue your third Jumanji.

239
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay, Coolsville. And it's a town.

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,800
Holy shit. It's a normal town. Oh, that's where Scooby-Doo lives. That's a good point.

241
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,960
Is it you they could make the third one a Scooby-Doo movie. Yep.

242
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,240
That's a really good point.

243
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Well, you could get it could be like one of those themed like you know

244
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,480
that

245
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,320
they'll have like a Scooby-Doo version of Monopoly. Yeah. What if you get sucked into that?

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,360
Wait, what if the third one is just random stuff? They just go in there and it's just all stuff everywhere.

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Yeah, there's just dice and chess.

248
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
It's just an actual board game.

249
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,720
They get sucked into it, and now they're on a tiny version of life.

250
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Oh my god.

251
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
That's genius.

252
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
That's the thing about Zothro.

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
And there's just shit everywhere.

254
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
There's just tons of bullshit.

255
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah, there's just fucking bullshit.

256
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
There's just fucking shit everywhere.

257
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Yeah, just garbage and all that.

258
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
Just leftover shit everywhere.

259
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,960
Leftover food and all the kinds of stuff.

260
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,480
Diapers and nasty shit like that.

261
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,440
There's shit and junk everywhere.

262
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,840
There's life and payday I played a lot of.

263
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
It's the same thing to me.

264
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,480
They're pretty much the same game.

265
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,440
Life was one of those games I never played, but I always looked at it and I was like, "Whoa."

266
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,800
One day when I get older, I'm gonna play this every day.

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,600
Did you guys, if you could get sucked into one board game, what you going with?

268
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Not Mouse Trap.

269
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Guess who?

270
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
You would be so good at Guess Who.

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You look just like a Guess Who guy.

272
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Wait, do you have a punch in on the hat?

273
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Take your hat off.

274
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
No, a hat can be part.

275
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Imagine this on a...

276
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Guess who got it?

277
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Wait, do you have a punch in on the hat?

278
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Is...

279
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Take your hat off.

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
No, a hat can be part...

281
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
[Laughter]

282
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
He looks just like Guess Who.

283
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Yeah, when I have, when I have like long hair...

284
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Does your guy look surprised?

285
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
[Laughter]

286
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
When I have longer hair, I look just like a Guess Who character.

287
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,820
You already look just like him, dude.

288
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,660
Oh my fucking god, dude.

289
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,660
This isn't showing up.

290
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,500
Oh, there it is.

291
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,320
Yeah, wait.

292
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,260
(laughing)

293
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,820
God damn, guess who?

294
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,380
That is crazy.

295
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,820
If you got sucked into guess who, though,

296
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,660
are you just gonna--

297
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,340
(laughing)

298
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,940
That does look like me.

299
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,380
If you got sucked into guess who,

300
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,980
are you just gonna sit there all day?

301
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,660
Like, I feel like that one's a pretty boring one.

302
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,020
You know, you don't really have to do much in guess who.

303
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,940
You gotta hold that face 'til you get stuck.

304
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,380
You're trapped for eternity.

305
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,580
- I'll try it right now.

306
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,980
- That is good.

307
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,060
- That is a good guess who face.

308
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,500
- That is a good guess who face.

309
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
So what would you say if you were guessing who?

310
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,540
So you and me are playing guess who and we're both on this guy.

311
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,900
- We're both on this guy?

312
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,660
Okay, I'd be like, is your guy a girl?

313
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,700
- Yes.

314
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,540
- Okay, and I'm putting down a bunch of pieces.

315
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,380
- Yeah.

316
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,660
- Oh my God, my guy's moving!

317
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,280
Caleb, my guy's moving!

318
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,140
My guy's talking to me!

319
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,880
- Well, which one of you has me?

320
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,760
We both can't do so you both have one guy. We don't know.

321
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,080
Okay. It's a new version of guess who where there's just one tile

322
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,680
and we both and we don't know that we have the same. Yeah.

323
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,720
We open up the thing. It's one. It's just a picture of him.

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
It's not a cartoon at all. Yeah. I go. It's a gift. It's

325
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,120
just me like yeah. Is your guy? I mean, yeah. Is your guy did

326
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,720
he just put a hat on? No. Oh my god. I know now you look like

327
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,480
guess who looking so sly and coy. Is your guy sly? Is your guy coy? Is your guy kind of...

328
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,720
I'm being really specific. Is your guy clever? Does your guy have a wry smile? What's your

329
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:06,520
guys favorite food? I think pizza. Oh okay. Put down a bunch of them. These guys don't

330
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,000
like pizza. These people couldn't like pizza. Their skin's too good. Pizza's good though.

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
- He just voted as a motherfucking liar.

332
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,840
- No fucking lie.

333
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,680
- True.

334
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,160
- Yeah, I'd probably go into Scattergories though.

335
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,040
- Yeah.

336
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,880
- That's not a good one.

337
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
- That Scattergories guy, the logo.

338
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,520
- Man, I'd probably go into Scattergories or Sudoku.

339
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,860
- The Scattergories logo go hard.

340
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,700
- Yeah.

341
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,920
- No, you need, man, shut up.

342
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
- There's two logos that go hard as fuck

343
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,120
and it's Sherlyn Williams and it's Gattagories.

344
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
- Who's Gattagories?

345
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,720
That's what I, when I play, Gattagories.

346
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
- I actually feel like, I go into Hot Wheels.

347
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,920
Huh hot wheels hot ones hot wheels. Oh my god wait a hot one

348
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Do your game would be we should do hot wheels where we make celebrities eat toy cars

That's the worst part!

373
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,840
- The worst part.

374
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,880
- He was straight, I couldn't even suck his cock, dude.

375
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,440
It was awful.

376
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,480
Yeah, but it scared me. I was like you really do it. It always is all just a fucking create a character randomized sometimes

Blurs yeah, I think I've only played scat again way too easy, but I played with I there's so many words by that point

390
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,680
It's categories is what that's where you come up with things. It's like it's like categories, and then you have yeah

391
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,160
It's like you roll it'll die. I played categories one time and it was but it was I played it

392
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,880
Basically the two teams were essentially one of the teams

393
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,400
Did not speak English very well. Yeah, and they really made the game a lot funnier

394
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,240
Yeah, they're just throwing out Spanish stuff and we were like, oh, I don't even know if that's okay. We don't know if that

395
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,200
Like fucking the scoreboard is just yeah, we didn't you guys are just getting them demolished

396
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,920
They were putting the numbers in Spanish - I had no idea what was going on

397
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,940
Yeah, yeah, there's I don't think there's numbers really

398
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,140
Letters game there is no sleep. It's numbers. We're the numbers under the sea. Oh

399
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,080
Doesn't quite it's a good answer because you get because you get points by the letter when I play it

400
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,080
We should be playing we should have a game night

401
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,820
Yeah, we had one the other night, which was pretty fun when we had a game night at the pub

402
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,880

403
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,020
No, okay

What oh we played connect for no we play was a while ago meme or something oh, right?

405
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,980
Yeah, I do remember that I mean I didn't even remember that as being a game because it was so damn far

406
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,700
No, we played what was it? It's called like crazy. It was too fun for me to remember

407
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,500
We played some some game some it was called. Yeah, it was called. It was if you laugh you drink

Yeah, you drink and it was there was and almost everything

409
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,020
I don't want to spoil too much because I want to play that it was pretty fun on

410
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,380
Today it is funny. It is it is funny that they do have just like

411
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,300
board games at bars

412
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,900
I've never really like like just go there and hang out. Yeah, it's funny. They have drinks at bars. No. What are you doing?

413
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,900
What board games it?

414
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:34,260
Was trying to be Bill Maher with your eyes the board games of bars thing is a newer kind of thing yeah

415
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,900
Yeah, it's like why they have access to our fricking bar BS culture that I've never done the axe throwing thing yet. Yeah

416
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,440
Yeah, I bet first try I do that bullseye

417
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,900
probably

418
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,580
Didn't we try to in Philly and they were all booked up. Yeah. Yeah, we're what an evil city

419
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:57,220
Middle of the day yeah noon completely the axe-throwing bar is completely booked

420
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,420
The guys you want to go to make

421
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:07,300
What a cesspool fucked up dude city of fucking brotherly fuck you

422
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:14,580
Think about that yeah true. That's crazy. That's cuz they took away all the guns in that liberal Democrat cities all these kids

423
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,560
You got to go out there and instead of having Draco's in their pockets. They got axes that they're throwing. Yeah

424
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,200
Yeah, just like London. I got to throw with you what video games are doing nowadays people playing God of War

425
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,940
Yep, stuff like this. They think it's okay to carry an axe around and yeah other people

426
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,480
They go they go it's okay if I if I kill 10,000 people with this axe cuz they respawn

427
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,080
Yeah, no you learn that from people kids nowadays think that people respond when you kill them. Yeah, it's not you think so

428
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,080
But they don't do that. They should have a video game that when you die you die the game shuts off

429
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,400
They have that and there's one I know one guy who responds games, and he's way more important than any video game

430
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,120
Who yep Jesus Christ although he's not so yeah, I was saying about picking religion

431
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,520
I think I'm leaning heavily towards Islam again

432
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,180
Yeah, I think I'm getting back into Islam because of all the World Cup stuff seems pretty cool to me

433
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,320
Where you have a entire country called guitar and you can not you can't have any beers there

434
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,720
Yeah, they call it guitar right and you think hard rock. Yeah, you're thinking. Oh shit. Yeah

435
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,880
You got that you got your beer can sitting on either side of your head you're like I'm ready to play I'm ready to rock

436
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,880
I'm ready to

437
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,560
They're saying football football you're going oh my god

438
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,200
Guitar with a hundred thousand people watching football you get there your beers get confiscated

439
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,760
They cut your head off and they start using it to play soccer

440
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,040
And then you get there thinking it's gonna be all hard rock and then look who's there maroon

441
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,520
Yep, god damn it

442
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,480
What's going on guitar

443
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,560
Country

444
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,240
Music what the hell is this? Hell? No, where's

445
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
Boy music maroon 5 is not boy music

446
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:12,800
Sentiment you've changed my mind that's not a boy line having your body say yes to something your brain saying no

447
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,120
That's seriously some look for the guy with the fastest car

448
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah, they change all their lyrics up when they go yeah, they have to yeah, yeah, that's like when you go to horror is

449
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:37,460
In awesome called guitar it actually guitar. It's called guitar pretty much. Yeah, okay pretty much pretty much

450
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,100
There's a country called the rhythm

451
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:47,240
There's a big debate. It's like Sunni and Kufi or what's-her-name Sunni and Shiite. Yeah, it's like

452
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,780
Sunni and Shiites

453
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,420
Shit

454
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,140
Sunni Sunni, I will sue I will

455
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,740
sue me I

456
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,460
Will go to guitar Sunni and take

457
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:19,580
Yeah football yeah, I'll put my foot in my own balls are what's next a country called the bass

458
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,140
Yeah, and then drums and vocals and vocals and keyboards and keyboards and not so much

459
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:32,060
In saying more cowbells, right, where's the cowbell country

460
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:42,780
You know, they should

461
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,900
The original version of that sketch he comes in and he says more guitar

462
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
He says, "I want there to be more guitar."

463
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,900
And they were like, "This is already really funny.

464
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
You know what would make it even funnier?"

465
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,900
If it's an instrument that everybody likes.

466
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Well, he improvised it. He did it live.

467
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,900
That's why they broke Jimmy Fallon.

468
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Yeah.

469
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Yeah, they buck broke him.

470
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Look at that poor bastard on TV.

471
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Broke him over their knee.

472
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
I think he's being held hostage. I really do.

473
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I think Jimmy Fallon did something.

474
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,900
Nobody has ever had more fun than he has had.

475
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Yeah, dude, every day he gets to wake up and fall down fucking 50 flights of stairs. He's so drunk.

476
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
So awesome, dude.

477
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
I think he's living in like...

478
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
He's actually my best friend and he's being held hostage.

479
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I think he has some kind of like vision thing. I think he just sees Candyland around him.

480
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah.

481
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I think he has like pyro vision from TF2.

482
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,900
They inject him with something every morning that makes him see everybody as a puppet.

483
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,340
That's why he laughs so much during his own questions and stuff,

484
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,700
because he'll be talking and he'll see like a unicorn fly by or something.

485
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,580
A gumdrop man.

486
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,080
Yeah.

487
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,900
He's talking to like fucking like Drake who's just made entirely out of gumdrops.

488
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,340
So people say you're so sweet.

489
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,080
What?

490
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,060
What are you talking about?

491
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,580
So what flavor are you?

492
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,340
He's just so fucking crazy.

493
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,280
So your mom was a wax bottle and your dad was wax lips.

494
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,180
And you grew up in Candyland.

495
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,340
Jimmy, the cameras are off.

496
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,860
His life took me like Joker.

497
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,620
They filmed all his parts separately.

498
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,420
Yeah, he's green screened in.

499
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,960
Yeah.

500
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,140
Yeah. But in his case, he has to be rainbow screened in because his world is

501
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:37,640
so...

502
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,300
Because he's LGBT.

503
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,060
Yep, that too.

504
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,640
Yeah.

505
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,940
Yeah, we should maybe have a triple host of the next tonight show. Maybe us three could do it. Yeah, I think if you're listening buddy

506
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,700
We can I would I would consider you a mentor. I'm kind of I've been consider us Minto's cuz you're so

507
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,260
No, I'm kidding I I have been kind of tired lately

508
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,900
So I would prefer if we could maybe have it changed to the this evening show

509
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,880
Yeah, oh, that's a good point cuz I just a little earlier not not so much. I've never stayed up so late

510
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,880
I'm a very early riser in the reverse sense.

511
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Have you, uh...

512
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
[laughter]

513
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I've got a better...

514
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Yeah.

515
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,880
Have you... no, you guys, you guys have... well, you went to Universal, right?

516
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Oh, yeah.

517
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
Did you go on the...

518
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
And I did it big.

519
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
Did you go on the Jimmy Fallon ride?

520
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,880
I didn't go to Univ... I've never been to Universal. I was busy at the Universal team.

521
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Wow.

522
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Studying.

523
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
Actually, everyone's in the Universal.

524
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Yeah.

525
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Damn.

526
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Drop that mic.

527
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Holy fuck shit.

528
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,880
Drop that mic.

529
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
That's why.

530
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,880
I rode the VelociCoaster, though.

531
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,920
Really? I did too. Yeah, no you didn't. He's lying. Did it blow your shit back? Yeah. I read the

532
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,200
VelociCoaster. You're lying. He's lying. He hasn't been there when the VelociCoaster

533
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,960
was built. A kid got killed on it. I read that. That's not true. Three kids got killed at the same

534
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,800
time because it was so scary. That makes it cooler first of all. I read the VelociRaptor. Oh, the meme?

535
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:04,920
Yeah. So that actually changed my perspective on quite a few subjects. Yeah. Including math and science. Yeah. Yeah, when I

536
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,320
I rode the VelociCoaster, Shaquille O'Neal was on it.

537
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
He's a liar.

538
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
They wouldn't let him on it.

539
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
He's too tall.

540
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
His head would get chopped off.

541
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
His head wouldn't get chopped off.

542
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,880
Wait, did his head get chopped off?

543
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,480
Wait, that's actually the most awesome story I've ever heard.

544
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,320
Wait, you've never been on that?

545
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,960
I've been on it three times.

546
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,320
And I almost bought a hat on it.

547
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,200
Oh, and Shaquille O'Neal's wife was on the ride with him.

548
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,640
And I hear she's only one inch tall.

549
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,400
And it's like, how did that work?

550
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
His wife is Tinkerbell.

551
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,200
It is a little bit weird that like every woman that Shaquille O'Neal has publicly dated has

552
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,280
been not just normal size but like really small.

553
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,320
Yeah, I mean it's almost women are 5'2".

554
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,880
Normal size is gonna be really small.

555
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,320
Nobody, but he's only dated women who are like...

556
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,160
I know, but what I'm saying is I don't think there's much difference.

557
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,640
There's a difference probably with his penis.

558
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,120
You think he's ever picked his girlfriend up by her head?

559
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Like this?

560
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,320
Like, just palmed her like that.

561
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Oh, definitely.

562
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,520
Like, "Hey, I need to grab something on top of the fridge."

563
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Like a claw in a factory?

564
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Just like, moving her along?

565
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,920
He's picking his girlfriend up by her head so she can get like,

566
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,420
or like, "Oh yeah, we put the paper towels up high this week."

567
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,220
"Alright, go grab 'em."

568
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Yeah.

569
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,020
Like, did you ever see the video of like that like spine training thing for a baby

570
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,720
where it like holds the top of the baby's head and it like swings?

571
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,220
Yeah.

572
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,820
Yeah, he just does that.

573
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
That's how...

574
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,320
I forgot about that one.

575
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
That's how he entertains his girlfriend.

576
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Yeah.

577
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
She's like, dude, let's get him questions.

578
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
She's like, who are you texting?

579
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
And he's just like...

580
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,320
If I was that tall...

581
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I forget what I was talking about.

582
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
If I was that tall and I had a hand that big,

583
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,320
I'd be holding a...

584
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Shit, I'd play basketball.

585
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
I'd be the greatest baller of all time.

586
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Dude, I'd be so good at rock, paper, scissors

587
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,320
I would use my powers to just get every cat out of a tree.

588
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
No you wouldn't.

589
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
No you wouldn't.

590
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Leave that to the firefighters.

591
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
I've never seen a cat in a tree.

592
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,320
I have.

593
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Okay, I don't care.

594
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
I've seen a bird in a tree.

595
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Me too.

596
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
And I called the fire department because I got confused.

597
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
I saw a partridge in a pear tree.

598
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Really?

599
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
At Christmas.

600
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Anything else?

601
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Yeah.

602
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Two turtle doves.

603
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Anything else?

604
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
A French hen.

605
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
One?

606
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah.

607
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
It was just at the store.

608
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
What store has all that?

609
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Birds-R-Us.

610
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
That song should be like, and 100 ornaments in a tree.

611
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Yeah.

612
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
In a pine tree.

613
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,320
We'll probably get into it closer to Christmas, but let me tell you what,

614
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,320
there would be some serious, if I was in charge of writing that song for the next year,

615
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
there would be some serious revisions.

616
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,320
I'm talking Nintendo Switch,

617
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm talking fucking a couple of cans of soda pop.

618
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Spirit of Christmas.

619
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Eggs.

620
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Most of my groceries.

621
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
They do need to add the Spirit of Christmas to that song.

622
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,920
On the first day of Christmas, I got my groceries.

623
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,960
Yeah, all of them.

624
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,760
On the second day of Christmas--

625
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,400
You still have to get groceries during Christmas time.

626
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Twice as many groceries.

627
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,320
I got more groceries, because guess what?

628
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm having people over.

629
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,480
Yep, who you having over?

630
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,520
Third day of Christmas, I'm having people over.

631
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah.

632
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,800
Fourth day of Christmas, the people are going home.

633
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,640
They slept over.

634
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,400
Oh, all of them?

635
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,280
We all had too much to drink.

636
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,800
Wait, did you guys have like a sex--

637
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,040
We all had too much to drink.

638
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,920
--group sex thing?

639
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,040
Fifth day of Christmas, I'm getting tested.

640
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,720
You have groups-- you had group sex.

641
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,320
For what?

642
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,440
It group sex on Christmas.

643
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,780
doing a whole screening.

644
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,960
- Well it's not on Christmas yet,

645
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,800
this is during the days of Christmas.

646
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,680
- Wait, you did a screening of your orgasm?

647
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,760
- We're doing screenings after

648
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,680
to make sure that none of us got--

649
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,520
- Screenings, like you're all sitting there doing--

650
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,360
- Screenings, watching the video.

651
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,240
- Doing like film review, like a high school football team.

652
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,920
- Nope, you're all sitting in like,

653
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,400
you're all sitting like this,

654
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,960
with a notebook, you're sitting back in the theater chairs.

655
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,800
- Sitting on--

656
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
- There's a flicker of the projector.

657
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,800
- Benches of the locker room,

658
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,960
with you with a projector here.

659
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
- And you see that, what's that?

660
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,640
That's a wart.

661
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,080
- Yeah, fifth day of Christmas.

662
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,160
Like Al Pacino in and get that work burned off in

663
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,280
Once upon a time in Hollywood. Yeah, that just that he's in there with you and he's just talking about the movie

664
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,600
What a picture Wow

665
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,200
It's a picture of my penis

666
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:14,960
What a picture oh my what a picture and so if you can zoom in right there wow, that's just beautiful

667
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,080
Look at that scroat fold

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,460
That's nasty that's nasty crap that's from some nasty crap. Yeah, I'm burping so you know it is that ghost energy

669
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,880
You know what it is. It's Black Friday. Yeah, yeah, so everybody knows

670
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,760
What happens the first?

671
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,940
Friday or I guess the first what happens the first Wednesday that is a

672
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,240
Wednesday is when you get prepared for Black Friday, right so that's not what I'm saying

673
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,080
So maybe you let me finish my little segue introduction here, or maybe you want to do it. Okay. I'll do it. You know what?

674
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,880
Okay, so Black Friday was invented by and I can't say it

675
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,360
It was invented by and I'm gonna say it. It was invented invented by turkeys

676
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,120
Why did they invent turkeys?

677
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,920
Who and you know what turkey in a minute black bread? You're you know what your job is so hard

678
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Doing segues into the list is so hard.

679
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Everybody knows what happens.

680
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,800
The Wednesday that's four days after Stinksgiving,

681
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
it's Black Friday. It's Black Friday today, guys.

682
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Wait, we actually know who invented Black Friday.

683
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Oh.

684
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
It's Jay Gould.

685
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
And that was a famous turkey.

686
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,800
So we're going to talk Black Friday today.

687
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Alright.

688
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,800
So let's pull up this list here.

689
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Now I just want to give you a little background on this website

690
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,560
website before we get into what so this is this is ranker we've been on ranker

691
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,600
I know we've been on ranker but I'm just I'm just showing off the website a

692
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,880
little bit first okay show off okay so we have ranker I mean we can see the

693
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,040
type of stuff that they're showing on ranker yeah we do have ranker for the

694
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,520
Republicans we do yeah say nay more why nay more has so much beef with Black

695
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,120
Panther and Wakanda say nay more oh I get that yeah and he has beef with Black

696
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,880
Is he the bad guy from the new movie?

697
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Yeah.

698
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
Oh shit.

699
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Did you see it?

700
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
No, I did not see it.

701
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,240
I was going to ask you for spoilers.

702
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,320
That's one.

703
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,120
You could look at this article maybe to find some spoilers because it says he's YA's beef.

704
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,800
He's pretty timid about spoiling the bloody pictures.

705
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Okay, wait, you have to click on the thing.

706
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Okay, yeah.

707
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,440
So here's some other stuff that we have on Ranker.

708
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,200
Actors who played roles written for someone completely different and nailed it.

709
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,480
The most epic moments in World Cup history.

710
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,780
underrated movies based on real life crimes, all the known rings from the Lord

711
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,680
of the Rings and what they do. So you're getting the general idea of what kind of

712
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,880
thing we'll see on this website.

713
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,280
Yeah, and for the first one there, actors who played roles written for someone

714
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,180
else and nailed it. I heard that Optimus Prime was not supposed to be in

715
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,280
Transformers. I heard that that was supposed to be...

716
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,980
It was supposed to be Kevin Costner.

717
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,780
Yeah, Kevin Costner.

718
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,480
Yeah, yeah.

719
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,780
Yeah, Kevin Costner was supposed to play that, but he got sick. He got really,

720
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,820
really sick. He got sick. It's called the Cybertron curse. Yeah. It was supposed to just be

721
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,900
Kevin Costner walking around and doing all that. And he's supposed to be doing the same exact voice from JFK.

722
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,140
Yeah, yeah. He's supposed to be going, "Optimus, we gotta..." There's another character.

723
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,700
Well, he's talking to the mirror. "Optimus, you gotta get your damn self together. We gotta stop the..."

724
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:28,260
"Optimus, you're so beautiful." He was very sweet. "Optimus, you're the most beautiful..." Yeah, and he was going like, "Back and to

725
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,860
the all spark back and to the all spark. So yeah, you get the

726
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,360
general idea of what's going on on this on this website. They

727
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,460
have a science section that I was looking at here. Probably where I would probably

728
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,460
spend most of my time on. Right. Wait, hold on. So you're looking, we're

729
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,960
looking at the science section here. We got science, Ross Geller is

730
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,460
the number two best fictional paleontologist. Ah. Number,

731
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,560
chicken is number one best kind of bird to eat. That's true. Penguin,

732
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,660
number two coolest animal that lives in the in the tundra. I mean,

733
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
So that's the science section.

734
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
What's a pangicula?

735
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,660
I don't know, that's why I didn't read that one.

736
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Oh shit, okay.

737
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
It's a meat-eating plant.

738
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,220
So we're on the science section today, and you're thinking, "What science?

739
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,780
Why are we here?"

740
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,740
And I found this list on Ranker, on the science section.

741
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,700
What happens to your body when you die in a human stampede?

742
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,860
By Laura Allen.

743
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,140
And you can see this is categorized under the "weirdly interesting" section of the science.

744
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Weirdly interesting.

745
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,340
I'm finding myself weirdly interested by this.

746
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,380
- That is, I mean I guess this is clear

747
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,940
the tide of Black Friday.

748
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,780
- Yeah.

749
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,380
- Right, which is in Black Friday you get--

750
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,220
- There's somebody that died in this game.

751
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,980
- In the service of trying to get something very cool,

752
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,300
you know, maybe a TV, maybe they re-released

753
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,540
another version of the PlayStation

754
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,700
that's thin or something, right?

755
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,920
And you're running and you're fucking jumping

756
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,900
on people's heads like Goombas trying to get that Nintendo.

757
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,800
- It could be worth it to you to die for this.

758
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,920
I would give my fucking life for a Sony Ericsson.

759
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,400
Dude, for a new salad spinner?

760
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,240
Ugh!

761
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,080
Oh my god.

762
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,900
A sous vide?

763
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,740
Oh shit.

764
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,580
Oh my god.

765
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,040
I wanna die right now!

766
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,760
You wanna cook all your food in a water bag?

767
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,600
Yes.

768
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,640
I would rather fucking die

769
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,560
than not have a sous vide in my house.

770
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,600
So either way I'm winning.

771
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,840
I bought my dad a sous vide for Christmas two years ago

772
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,240
and I haven't seen him use it.

773
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,080
Really?

774
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,900
Yeah.

775
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,740
How expensive were they?

776
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,040
It was like 150 bucks.

777
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,320
Oh, I thought they were like $1,000.

778
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,140
No.

779
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,280
Oh man, I might have to get one.

780
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,520
I had my siblings chip in.

781
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,120
What the hell do you use it for?

782
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,520
You cook a steak really good.

783
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,920
But you can cook a steak really good with a damn cast iron pan.

784
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,560
Yeah, but you boil it first.

785
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,480
In a water bag.

786
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,320
Oh, a boiled steak?

787
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
That sounds damn good.

788
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,160
Sounds so good.

789
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,200
Yeah, so I kind of just took selections from this list.

790
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,840
It was kind of long, but we can just start off here.

791
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,680
Every year we hear about some poor soul

792
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,000
dying in the massive shoppers on Black Friday.

793
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,560
Death by human stampede isn't the most common way to go,

794
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
but it definitely is one of the most horrifying.

795
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
But what causes human stampedes,

796
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
and why do you die in a stampede

797
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,040
rather than being helped or picked up by others?

798
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,480
The answers will rock your faith

799
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,720
in human goodness to the core.

800
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,640
- That's okay.

801
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,880
Yeah, I'm ready to be rocked.

802
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
It's the perfect time of the year

803
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
to have your faith in humanity completely rocked to the core.

804
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,640
- I love that this list is on Ranker.

805
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,080
It was making me laugh so much

806
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,160
that Ranker put this out for Black Friday.

807
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,400
(both laughing)

808
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,040
- And it's weirdly interesting.

809
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,160
- It is weirdly interesting.

810
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,280
So first of all, you won't be able to move.

811
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,240
When trying to avoid being killed by a crowd, you should be sure you're able to move.

812
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,120
I will say, I've definitely been at things before where I was like,

813
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,240
"There's too many people up in this bitch, I'm out of here."

814
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,400
Yeah, I do think about that sometimes.

815
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,520
If you can't move in a room,

816
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,080
just don't be in it. But I also have been at shows before where

817
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,800
you're on the floor level thing and there's a million people around you,

818
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,200
And I do convince myself that I have superhuman strength and that I can hold back everybody

819
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,100
doing this.

820
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,600
But then somebody crushes you to death.

821
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah, you die and there's a bigger guy.

822
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,000
So the mistake you're making here is you should make sure that you're able to move.

823
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I have definitely.

824
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,520
I remember, I think next time I go to a big crowded concert, maybe a stadium show or something,

825
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm on the floor, there's a crush, I'm scared, I'll just kind of pull out my exosuit.

826
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
That's smart.

827
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,320
I think the button on your chest yeah

828
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,000
the worst crowd crush I've been in was was a

829
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,140
One of the what the hell boy

830
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:32,080
I just clicked a button on this by accident nice damn the worst one I ever was in I think was when the

831
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,560
Patriots won the Super Bowl

832
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,800
Living in Boston I lived on the corner on or I didn't live I worked on the corner on Boylston

833
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,320
and I had to go like a quarter of a block to get out of that.

834
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,160
- I had the exact same situation.

835
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,800
- And it took me an hour to get like 40 feet.

836
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
- Yeah, yeah.

837
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,460
- It took me a fucking hour.

838
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,720
And I was literally, and I was like,

839
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
an hour being the biggest piece of shit of my life.

840
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,040
Like I'm fucking throwing elbows in granny's faces

841
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,520
and like pushing people over.

842
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,360
- Well that's, yeah, you're--

843
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,200
- Get out of my fucking way!

844
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,840
- You're doing that in Boston anyway,

845
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,560
so it's like everyone there is used to it.

846
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,860
- Exactly, nobody gave, really cared.

847
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,440
I also had like a giant backpack on.

848
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,940
- Yeah, I had, you had like,

849
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,300
you had kind of like arm blades.

850
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,980
- Yeah, yeah, so I'm doing this and stuff.

851
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,580
- Confusing. - Slicing and dicing.

852
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

853
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,660
- And your legs are replaced with blades.

854
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,260
- I'll admit it, I'm the guy who threw the beer at Gronk.

855
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,340
- For real? - Yep.

856
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,180
I hit him right in the head.

857
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,940
I was drinking beer at work and I got so fucking mad.

858
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,980
- You gave him more CTE than he already had.

859
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,180
- Yes, sir.

860
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,820
I mean, he keeps, his name's Gronk.

861
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,420
- Yeah, you knocked him back to normal

862
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,540
for like half a second.

863
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,740
- Yeah, he had a British accent.

864
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
- Ew, what in the world was that?

865
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,620
- Another beer can comes up and hits him.

866
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,300
I've been playing American football for so long.

867
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,260
Did somebody thought pie twice in my face?

868
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,500
Yeah, he's talking to British accent and he gets hit again and that's immediately when he had the idea to make his energy drink.

869
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,940
Yeah. Dude, the Gronk monster was actually really good.

870
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,540
Yeah, I'd like to see Gronk's monster.

871
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,660
His penis. I'd like to see his penis suck on it.

872
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,820
I'm gonna slurp that shit up like spaghettis.

873
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,660
Alright, next up here we have...

874
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,540
You're going to get very, very hot.

875
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,480
Initially, the only warning you might have

876
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,080
that something is wrong will be the fact

877
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,540
that you're getting hot, like really, really hot.

878
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,280
This is going to be problematic for you

879
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,120
from the very beginning.

880
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,580
- Well, thank you for saying that.

881
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,880
- Hey, I think you accidentally switched

882
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,420
into what happens when your body falls into a volcano.

883
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,540
- No, so that's actually what's surprising is no.

884
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,980
- Yeah, this is weirdly interesting.

885
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,860
- It's weirdly interesting,

886
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,700
that's why it's so weirdly interesting.

887
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,200
- But you have to admit,

888
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,100
it would work for that list as well.

889
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,460
You're going to get very, very hot in a volcano.

890
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,860
I think that you might have a different warning that something is wrong.

891
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,360
Yeah.

892
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,860
No.

893
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,820
Because you're going to fall in, and you're going to be like, hmm.

894
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,320
I feel like the first thing is that--

895
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,340
Something is off.

896
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,660
You're going to be in a volcano.

897
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,740
I feel like that's the first warning.

898
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,500
You can be convinced of that's anything.

899
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,740
Yeah, or maybe that you're falling.

900
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,860
I'm in a black and red room.

901
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,500
Off the rim of a volcano into the lava.

902
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,220
I'm jumping on a red trampoline.

903
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,860
You know what?

904
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,900
You know what you could have said?

905
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,380
What?

906
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,500
That this is supposed to be on the list of if the floor actually was lava.

907
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,000
Yo!

908
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,500
Oh, shit.

909
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,860
We should write that list.

910
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,060
That's a good idea.

911
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,100
That's a very good point.

912
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,380
can choose from this list. You're going to get very, very hot. And then I think it'll

913
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,340
work out. I love the language in this list. This is going to be problematic for you from

914
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:15,980
the very beginning. It kind of makes you imagine somebody who thinks they're about to die in

915
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,100
a human stampede because they're getting crushed and they're searching desperately for how

916
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,380
to survive and they get this. This is exactly, yeah. They're reading this on their phone.

917
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,820
- The lens I want you to look at this through

918
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,580
is somebody who currently is dying in a human stampede

919
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,680
and they look up what is happening to me.

920
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,060
(laughing)

921
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,980
- On their phone?

922
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,020
- They're on their phone and they're like,

923
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,780
what happens when I die in a human stampede?

924
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,620
- You're gonna get very, very hot.

925
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,620
- This isn't how to survive a human stampede,

926
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,820
this is how to get out of one.

927
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,020
This is what happens when you die in one.

928
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,860
- I think there probably is no way to survive

929
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,900
if you're already in a human stampede.

930
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,660
- Well, there is some advice they put at the end,

931
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,220
I don't remember if I put it in the slideshow or not,

932
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,140
but it literally is just like, try and walk away.

933
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Try and go out of there.

934
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,500
- Okay, as tempted as I am to jump into that human stampede,

935
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,880
I'm going to resist.

936
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,860
- Okay, next up we have,

937
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,700
the group will basically become a liquid.

938
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,540
So this works for the volcano one too, actually.

939
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,580
- See, I'm telling you, this would work perfectly.

940
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,420
- Think of it this way.

941
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,580
If you took an hourglass and poured sand through it,

942
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,180
you'd see that all the grains flow through

943
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,560
with the ones on top moving to follow the ones on the bottom.

944
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,560
Now imagine you're just a single grain of sand

945
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,500
somewhere in the middle.

946
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,860
and now imagine that the greatest and has a lot of those are repeat a heart and

947
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,980
needs to breathe

948
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,180
it's easy to see what's the problem they should make uh... they should make our

949
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,380
glasses all that

950
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,280
yes screening mission except with parts of the world yet

951
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,860
j_l_ living standard hurts

952
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,220
it feels painless

953
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,820
yeah i think i was so he stepped on the beach the other shipment of sand man so

954
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,100
you know i'm i'm in i'm in the human sympathy to be crushed i can't breathe

955
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,860
i'm scrolling on my phone three d but i'm like all

956
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,740
it's problematic i've figured out that

957
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,580
- This group is almost becoming a liquid.

958
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,340
I'm almost a piece of sand in this group.

959
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,140
- What do they mean by the group will basically become a--

960
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,540
- It's like when you see a physics simulation

961
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,940
of water or something, and there's all those little beads,

962
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,100
and they're just being thrown to and fro.

963
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,940
- Yeah, that makes sense.

964
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,740
- I would say you end up becoming one of those beads.

965
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,180
- It's also if you're at a demonstration

966
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
of the liquefier ray.

967
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,020
- Yes.

968
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,100
- That's also, I think that might be specifically--

969
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,580
- It says the group will become a liquid,

970
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,420
and then their example is sand.

971
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,460
- Sand is a liquid.

972
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,620
- The goop, maybe they meant to say the goop

973
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,980
will basically become a liquid.

974
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,820
- Yeah.

975
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,660
- Yeah.

976
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,500
- That's kind of as close as it gets.

977
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,340
- That makes way more sense.

978
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,740
- I'd be so scared in there, my pee would become a liquid.

979
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,060
- My poop would become a liquid

980
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,740
'cause I'd be shooting poopy diarrhea everywhere.

981
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,580
- Maybe that's how you survive.

982
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,980
- The asshole next to you.

983
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,860
- That's how you survive.

984
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,900
Nobody wants, even in a human stampede,

985
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,240
I mean if people are stampeding,

986
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,860
it's gonna be a full stop if they smell shit.

987
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,700
- Yeah.

988
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,860
- Oh, oh, who did that?

989
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,980
- Oh my God, my.

990
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,460
Who did that?

991
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,260
Yeah, their legs were going like, "Wadawadawada."

992
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
And then they completely stopped because they're like,

993
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,300
it actually smells like fucking baby shit.

994
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,540
Everyone's gonna go home.

995
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,860
Yeah, someone's shining a flashlight in the air

996
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,420
and the poop cleanup squad comes through.

997
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,340
It's pushing everyone aside.

998
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,420
Dressed up like Monsters, Inc.

999
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,140
Carrying the guy who put his pants out on a stretcher.

1000
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,300
Code 2319.

1001
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,900
Oh yeah, that shit's scary.

1002
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,700
Blowing up all those hats and shit.

1003
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,820
Just donate them to a fucking shelter, man.

1004
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:14,780
I'd wear 'em.

1005
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,080
Yeah, fuck, I'll wear those fucking little boy socks.

1006
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
Whatever, I don't give a fuck.

1007
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,080
Not a problem to me.

1008
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Send them to me.

1009
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,080
Send them to me.

1010
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
I want them.

1011
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
Why are you blowing them up?

1012
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
It's not even that I would wear them, I want to wear them.

1013
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
They look dope. Send them to me.

1014
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
Those look comfy.

1015
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
And my feet, give them to me.

1016
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Now.

1017
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
You damn monk.

1018
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Next up is, someone in front of you will probably fall.

1019
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,240
probably fall and I don't believe that they put this picture look at this

1020
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,000
picture someone falling stampede is definitely going on there well that's

1021
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
the first that's the the first that's the first victim of the it looks like a

1022
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,480

1024
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,600
fuck see I do I want to be that guy I want to be the guy at the yeah yeah the

1025
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,280
I'm not going in there.

1026
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
No thank you.

1027
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,080
I'm going to be the guy in the top right corner there.

1028
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,600
I would like to live.

1029
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,200
I would just like to live in every situation.

1030
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
I would like the outcome to be me living.

1031
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,880
I've been thinking a lot about dying, just getting hit by stray bullets all the time.

1032
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm always like, yeah, I see too many videos of people, you know those videos where it's

1033
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,120
like, "Just another day in wherever," and then it's just like, you hear like 5,000 gunshots.

1034
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,320
I'm like, one of those bullets is going to fly all the way from Detroit into my apartment

1035
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:49,540
Building hit me right here in the middle of my head. Yeah, that's why I would never go to war. Yeah

1036
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,640
War would suck due to that the possibility of getting shot. Yeah, it's not that for me

1037
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,280
I think it's just like I just like my stuff here. Yeah, that's true. I like mine, too

1038
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,760
I also camo looks like fucking shit honestly on me. Yeah

1039
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,800
Goofy makes me look I also Billy all those utility belts and shit. Oh you have to carry

1040
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,780
I do look kind of chubby and that's yeah, I don't want helmet makes my head look so round my I had a teacher in

1041
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,060
And I hate that it says born to kill on it.

1042
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,060
Yeah.

1043
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:23,220
I had a teacher in middle school who told me that if I was like, I was asking him about

1044
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,740
the draft and I was like, he was saying like, "Yo, yeah, if you're on medication, they won't

1045
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,740
draft you."

1046
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,380
And I was like, "Wait, so I take Adderall, will I not go to war?"

1047
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,180
He's like, "Yeah, you probably won't."

1048
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,180
No, dude, you'll be sought after.

1049
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:41,060
Adults who take Adderall, you're going to be like the fucking, you're going to be like

1050
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,220
the precogs from Minority Report.

1051
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,020
they're gonna have you in a fucking tank and you're lying,

1052
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,540
they drop like 10 Adderall pills down your throat

1053
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,580
and you're just with your mind

1054
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,180
controlling like 100 drones at once.

1055
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,020
And they're all flying around,

1056
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,500
they're all flying over like a wedding,

1057
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,340
they're supposed to drop bombs,

1058
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,620
they're like going down and touching all the curtains

1059
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:04,500
and like eating, taking little bites of all the food

1060
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,020
and flying around and getting distracted and leaving.

1061
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,340
- They played a good song at the wedding.

1062
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,380
I wanted it. It's like 10 drones. They just make a human shape.

1063
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,700
It's just like they played the electric slide.

1064
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,420
Yeah. **** Yeah. Um next up. Oh, this is so here. This is

1065
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,420
actually part of of other people are going to fall on

1066
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,220
you. Uh so you've fallen down in a crowd. No big deal. Just

1067
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,860
get up again quickly and you'll be fine right. Nope.

1068
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,020
Eventually, people are caught in a crushing effect from which

1069
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,260
there is no escape. Oh **** Yeah. There's no escape. I can't

1070
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:44,860
imagine what it's like to be crushed live and pose the question. Yeah, I met a

1071
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,760
guy who liked it. That's so that's so rude. If I was if I was dying in a human

1072
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,160
step and I'm looking at this, I'm like, oh, there's you'll be fine, right? Yeah,

1073
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,960
I'll be fine. Nope. No, people are caught in a crushing effect. I tell you guys

1074
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,760
about that guy. I met what guy Kevin carpet. What's this dude who wraps

1075
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,660
himself up in a carpet in New York and then just like lays down places. Did you

1076
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,660
crush him? I stood on him. Yeah. Did you try to like really get him? It's a

1077
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,660
It's a sexual fetish, right?

1078
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,660
I would try to hurt him.

1079
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,660
It's gotta be.

1080
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,660
I think I enabled a sex guy.

1081
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,380
Well, it's not that you enabled it, it's that you had sex with him, basically.

1082
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,380
Yeah, in his way.

1083
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,620
In his alien world.

1084
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,260
Well, he puts himself, I saw a video where he wrapped himself up in a carpet and just

1085
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,580
put himself on a crosswalk.

1086
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:31,220
What an easy way to satisfy your sexual fetish is by being like, "Oh no, I'm like a funny

1087
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,540
thing that happens at bars," or whatever.

1088
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,540
Yeah.

1089
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,300
And Pat sees him and is like, "I'll have sex with that guy.

1090
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,300
I'll do it right now."

1091
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:47,740
you know what? Was he fine? I didn't see him. I only saw a carpet. You didn't see him at all? You only knew him as a

1092
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,260
carpet? Yeah. So he could have been empty. Yeah. It could have just been a carpet. You just

1093
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,220
stood on a carpet and said, "That's Kevin." Somebody said, "Oh, do you see like he's

1094
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,860
in front of the bar?" And someone's like, "Yeah, that's Kevin. He's in a... there's a man

1095
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,980
in that carpet right now." You wouldn't say... I mean, nobody would be like... the

1096
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,780
The bartender wasn't like, "Hey, get this fucking carpet out of here."

1097
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,580
No, the bartender was like, "Yeah, that's Kevin."

1098
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,060
The hell is going on in this damn city?

1099
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,580
We live in Sodom and Gomorrah.

1100
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,580
I know.

1101
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:16,580
I know.

1102
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,580
That is a current...

1103
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,580
Cleansing.

1104
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,580
Yeah.

1105
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,580
This place needs to be fucking nuclear annihilated.

1106
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,060
I guess he's been doing it since the '80s.

1107
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,060
Since the '80s.

1108
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,500
Then it's been that bad that long.

1109
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,020
The carpet probably smells bad.

1110
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,020
Yeah.

1111
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
That long.

1112
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
He probably got a new carpet.

1113
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,140
What, are you washing in a giant washing machine?

1114
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
Yeah.

1115
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
That thing's huge.

1116
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,140
How do you wash that?

1117
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
How does he wash himself in there?

1118
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,980
- How does he, he's a guy, he sits on the floor,

1119
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,820
he's a carpet!

1120
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,220
- He's a man, not a carpet.

1121
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,500
- It just doesn't make sense.

1122
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
- It makes no sense!

1123
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,040
- Oh yeah, I mean it makes no sense!

1124
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,020
(laughing)

1125
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,220
- You will not be able to escape

1126
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,820
even though your brain will tell you to.

1127
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,660
- Yeah.

1128
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,340
- I think that's true of most ways that you die.

1129
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,180
- Yeah.

1130
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,020
- 'Cause your brain's like, don't do it bud!

1131
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,460
- Yeah, just get out of here!

1132
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,300
- Come on!

1133
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,120
- Try escaping!

1134
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,620
- Knock it off! - Get the hell outta here!

1135
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,140
- You need to not do this.

1136
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,020
- Yeah, just don't do that.

1137
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,060
You're going to experience some horrifying things.

1138
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,340
This could be, I mean, okay, but riddle me this, you fucker.

1139
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,180
- Sure.

1140
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,100
- Playboy Mansion, Human Stampede,

1141
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,540
you're dying by-- - Oh my God.

1142
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,900
- There's breasts and fucking stinky wet pussy

1143
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,180
getting all over you. - Dude, with my luck,

1144
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,380
I'd be between the guys that were there.

1145
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,500
- Exactly, be realistic. - I'd be there.

1146
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,820
- A little wall of guys, there's like a thousand women

1147
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,500
who are all getting crushed to death over here,

1148
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,820
and I'm in this, I'm pinned in a corner

1149
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,060
by five sweaty fat guys. - Yeah, of the waiters.

1150
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,620
- You're dying with Andy Dick on top of you.

1151
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,020
(laughing)

1152
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,220
- And all the girls are over there dying, going, "Ahh!"

1153
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,540
- And Andy Dick is in your face, like, "Hey!"

1154
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,380
- "Hey!"

1155
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,900
(laughing)

1156
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,900
- Just biting you.

1157
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,820
- Yeah.

1158
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,820
- Let's die together.

1159
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,420
- I actually like this stuff.

1160
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,260
- Yeah, you're right, with your luck, that would happen.

1161
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,100
- I hate my fucking luck.

1162
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,140
- With my luck, all the fucking animals

1163
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,980
that live in the playbook.

1164
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,820
- Oh, I just dropped the clicker.

1165
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,640
That's my fucking luck.

1166
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,480
- Your luck sucks, dude.

1167
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,320
- Dude, I can't believe that.

1168
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,500
- And even worse, I took it away from you.

1169
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,340
- Oh my god.

1170
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,180
- That's how bad your luck is.

1171
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,300
- Let me get a good look at Cameron.

1172
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,960
Oh, well no, you have my arm just fucking broke. I think you're having a stroke normal luck though. I aren't just broke

1173
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,200
No, you sound luck thing you're having a stroke

1174
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,960
You're pretty good stroked out face. Yeah, yeah

1175
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:23,200
You imagine if one of us had a massive stroke on it's gonna be incredible can we promise to release it?

1176
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,020
Yeah, oh if you have us like dying during an episode or have a stroke or yeah

1177
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,560
I want to make a pact right now.

1178
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah, let's do it.

1179
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,340
Anything that happens.

1180
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:32,980
I didn't.

1181
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
Any meta, anywhere.

1182
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,580
So, this would work.

1183
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,860
This is actually more of an

1184
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,420
achievement than anything we've

1185
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:38,920
ever done.

1186
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:39,800
Terrifying.

1187
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,180
Meta, like, if we get a close up

1188
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,860
of this, if we if we explode

1189
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,660
into blood suddenly on air,

1190
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,420
then it's getting it's live.

1191
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1192
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:49,900
That's important.

1193
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,940
That would be like that'll be

1194
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,300
called the Red Mists episode.

1195
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,540
That is the that's like what I

1196
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,240
think everything is kind of maybe

1197
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:55,940
working towards.

1198
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,540
One or all of us dying on air.

1199
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Yeah, I'm gonna start working towards that.

1200
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
We're gonna do some GGL and hang out with you and stuff.

1201
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,660
I'm gonna start eating really unhealthy food to try and die.

1202
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Yeah, cause I wanna die.

1203
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,660
That'd be so funny if you just end up looking like me.

1204
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,660
(laughter)

1205
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,660
We all just start eating like shit and turn into bad.

1206
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,660
(laughter)

1207
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,660
We wanna eventually die on air, so we're all eating junk food.

1208
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,660
(laughter)

1209
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,660
You guys die?

1210
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
I'm trying to bloodwire myself by just eating chips everyday.

1211
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,660
(laughter)

1212
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,660
I don't know, this guy's a death wish.

1213
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,500
- Fuck.

1214
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,360
Like what horrifying things are you gonna experience

1215
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,200
in a human stampede?

1216
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,540
- Oops, you gotta click back on that.

1217
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,140
- Oh my god, Jubio.

1218
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,060
- Okay, if you're in front of the crowd,

1219
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,860
you could be the first to die.

1220
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,700
Makes sense to me.

1221
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,380
- In front of the crowd, but is there anyone in front of you?

1222
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,500
'Cause I'd just run my white ass away.

1223
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,720
- I'd run backwards.

1224
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,900
- I would just say, I would go like this.

1225
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,420
- Stampede is about to start, right?

1226
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,780
Everyone's coming towards me.

1227
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,020
I turn around, see there's a stampede.

1228
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:57,460
I start doing this so that everyone thinks that something weird is happening.

1229
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,900
Okay. That's smart.

1230
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,980
And then you cause a stampede the other direction and the P the P other people on

1231
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,700
the other side, they're in the front there first to die. Not me.

1232
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,380
I'm down like bowling pins, right? It's easier.

1233
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,300
Like we're all going down backwards. You can breathe up. Yeah.

1234
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,100
You can breathe up. You can breathe up.

1235
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,220
You know what I would bring silly straw, like killer clowns from outer space.

1236
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,900
Big long one. So it doesn't matter how many fucking 50 fucking, uh,

1237
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,520
lifeless children's bodies deep I am. I'm underneath that whole thing. I got a

1238
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,020
giant thing like a reed in a pond. Yeah, like a snorkel. Yeah, and I'm just...

1239
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:37,140
You're like a ninja. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You're gonna go deep in a 50 dead children's maze, is that what you said?

1240
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,140
No.

1241
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:46,940
No, I'm at the bottom of a pile of kids. If you're in front of the crowd, that means you're safe.

1242
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,940
adults

1243
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,900
Here at the Wiggles concert, I'm not

1244
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,500
That's funny to you

1245
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:02,420
Wait, that's fun. That's way more tragic. Oh, yo the fucking pit during fruit salad was insane

1246
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:07,020
She went stupid if you're in front of the crowd that means you're safe right they're all going to crush you

1247
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:11,300
That's bloody mental. They keep they keep asking you there keep going like you're fine, right?

1248
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,940
No, you're actually gonna have the biggest disaster of all

1249
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,100
fucking die

1250
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,880
Asshole no one will be able to help you God

1251
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:25,100
God might be hopefully maybe a pregnant mom who gets that strength they get yeah, that could be here

1252
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,460
Oh my god. I'm yo if I'm at a concert, and I'm in the pit throwing elbows

1253
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:30,460
That's why I stay next to a pregnant mom yep

1254
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:35,980
And you know yeah, if I want to jump into the pit I turn to that mom and I say I'm your baby

1255
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,940
You need to always convince if you need a pregnant mom to do something really well

1256
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,820
You got to convince it she that her baby's about to die. Yeah, yeah, yeah

1257
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,660
- Yeah.

1258
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,920
- Oh my god, these dishes are so dirty.

1259
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,780
They're gonna make your baby die.

1260
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,860
(laughing)

1261
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,480
- They're done instantly, dude.

1262
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,460
Superpowers.

1263
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,300
- Uh huh.

1264
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,380
- It's true that security personnel,

1265
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,800
and maybe a few helpful bystanders,

1266
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,880
could try to help you,

1267
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,560
but they're not going to do much good.

1268
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,760
You may crawl over bodies,

1269
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,600
you may push people,

1270
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,840
you may claw at them, fight them,

1271
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,840
even bite people in rare instances.

1272
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,940
Expect to be pushed, bruised, scraped, hit,

1273
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,080
and screamed at while you struggle to live.

1274
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,820
- Okay.

1275
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,140
I expect that's how I will die anyway.

1276
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,640
Yeah.

1277
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,140
Yeah.

1278
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,180
Is getting screamed at.

1279
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:17,680
Pushed.

1280
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,180
Screamed at.

1281
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,060
Pushed, screamed at, and screamed at.

1282
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:20,940
Yeah.

1283
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,700
Well, I die slowly on my deathbed.

1284
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,200
Yeah.

1285
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,700
Old age.

1286
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,200
I'm dying--

1287
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,700
Don't die!

1288
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
--of getting screamed at.

1289
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,180
Yeah.

1290
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,060
Dying by getting screamed at because--

1291
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,380
That is how you're going to die.

1292
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,340
Yeah, that is how you're going to die.

1293
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,300
Don't eat that!

1294
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,460
[LAUGHTER]

1295
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,960
Don't!

1296
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,860
Don't you dare!

1297
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,500
And you're not-- you don't even eat it.

1298
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,860
You just die from being-- you get startled by the scream

1299
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,360
and die.

1300
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,780
You're eating like a radioactive rod of uranium.

1301
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,860
Don't you dare!

1302
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,120
Don't you dare eat that!

1303
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,520
Then we got-- you won't be able-- here's a three,

1304
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,720
lightning round.

1305
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,960
You won't be able to breathe.

1306
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,120
Your ribs may crack.

1307
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,320
You may die of a heart attack.

1308
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,080
That's like Dr. Seuss.

1309
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,240
You won't be able to breathe.

1310
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,160
Your ribs may crack.

1311
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,800
You may die of a heart attack.

1312
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,880
Oh, The Ways You'll Die.

1313
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,880
That's what the freaking book this is from.

1314
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,280
I wouldn't want to read that book.

1315
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm not sure anybody would.

1316
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,600
You have to make that parody book.

1317
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,100
I know.

1318
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,600
I would read that as like an adult who's into twisted parodies.

1319
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,400
Like, I don't know, one of my favorite types of shirts,

1320
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,500
I don't know if you guys have seen these shirts,

1321
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,540
and it's like a picture of kids playing with a board game,

1322
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,380
and it says, "Let's summon Satan."

1323
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,540
- That shit is fucking awesome.

1324
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,140
- That's the type of shit I think is funny.

1325
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,500
- Cameron's favorite shirt is a picture of kids.

1326
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,280
- Other people, well, they're summoning Satan.

1327
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,900
It's not really, it's kind of a stretch.

1328
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,740
- You know what I like?

1329
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,560
I like ones where maybe it's like--

1330
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,220
- He likes to stretch the kids over his body.

1331
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,340
- It's like an old milk ad, right?

1332
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,660
And it's like the milk has been poured in a cereal bowl,

1333
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,260
but then it says at the top, it says, "That's jizz."

1334
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,100
Or something.

1335
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,140
- Yeah, that's good. - Got jizz.

1336
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,220
- No, not got jizz.

1337
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,140
Well, that's too much of,

1338
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,980
yeah, I guess that's a better priority.

1339
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,420
- That's a gut milk shirt, but it says got jizz.

1340
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,740
- See, he actually thinks that's funny.

1341
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,420
- He likes shirts that go hard.

1342
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,260
- Yeah, I do.

1343
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,100
- Yeah, he really does.

1344
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,920
- I do.

1345
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,500
- Yeah, I like shirts that go hard like this.

1346
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,100
- Yeah. - Yeah, and I, my shirt--

1347
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,340
- It's sweatshirt day, y'all.

1348
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,460
- Sweatshirt day.

1349
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,860
- Sweatshirt day.

1350
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,300
- Every day's pretty much been a sweatshirt day.

1351
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,300
You didn't even get excited for sweatshirt day.

1352
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,300
Sweatshirt day, fuck yeah, motherfucker.

1353
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
Oh yeah, motherfucker, sweatshirt day, motherfucker, let's fucking go!

1354
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
Then we have,

1355
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,300
"You will not be trampled to death, probably."

1356
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
These guys are getting crushed by some kind of

1357
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,300
communist block. Yeah, look at this

1358
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,300
picture. This makes sense

1359
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300
why people die in human stampedes, and I'm looking at this.

1360
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
Yeah.

1361
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,300
Why is that thing at the concert?

1362
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,300
That's the stage, dude.

1363
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,300
Yeah, it's a new guard prop.

1364
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
For this next song, "I want you to go

1365
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,620
go fucking crazy. They just they just start dropping his giant hydraulic.

1366
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,060
Oh, yeah, it's not really a stampede at that point. Yeah, but it says you won't

1367
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,380
be trampled. There's a hydraulic press. Well, yeah, you'll be crushed to death by

1368
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,220
a giant press. Yeah, it's something like death.

1369
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:52,820
That's awesome, dude. So if you're in a crowd and you feel like it's getting too

1370
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,180
dense, don't panic. Go with the flow of the crowd and try to move in a diagonal

1371
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,180
direction towards the side. Don't try to stop. Keep your hands to your chest to

1372
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,180
defend your breathing space and don't fall because the next moments after that

1373
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,700
could be your last.

1374
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,980
So that's how you avoid a human stampede.

1375
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,340
That's the instructions they give you.

1376
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,140
- You go diagonally. - So you scroll through

1377
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,780
15 list items that, I cut those down a ton.

1378
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,060
Those are all really long.

1379
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,620
You read, it's probably a 10 minute read.

1380
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,100
You get to the bottom and they say,

1381
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,620
"Just go with the flow."

1382
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,700
- I feel like you should lead with how to survive.

1383
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,100
- Yeah, well that's a different list.

1384
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,580
This is what happens when you die.

1385
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,180
- I'm calling 911.

1386
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,460
- Yeah, that's a good call.

1387
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,900
- I'm stuck inside at the Brockhampton concert.

1388
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:41,460
I'm getting completely crushed to death. I'm calling 911. I'm being crushed by 4,000 4-foot-11

1389
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:52,380
guys. Dude, that's actually genius. I'm getting stomped out by a golf lift fluorosneaker. That's

1390
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:57,880
why I carry around a strobe light with me, okay? Because I'm getting crushed from all sides at the

1391
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,520
snail mail show and I'm holding up my strobe light, okay, it's flashing out

1392
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,120
people who are saying, "Oh my god, that guy's excited."

1393
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,120
Yes sir.

1394
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Yeah.

1395
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:12,080
They're like, "Oh, Levi, that guy's having fun."

1396
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,680
What's another concert that you would be crushed at, you think?

1397
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,680
Obviously.

1398
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Girl pool.

1399
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Girl pool.

1400
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
Hame.

1401
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Yeah.

1402
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
Yeah.

1403
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,680
Oh my god.

1404
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,680
You'd be crushed at the Hame concert?

1405
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,600
Dude, I got fucking, I got like basically flattened to two dimensions at the Iron and

1410
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,500
with two eyeballs sitting there by the end yeah it's actually cruelly kind of a

1411
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,880
cruel irony but my friend actually got turned to dust at a duster show no yeah

We try to fit like 150 people in it.

1419
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,400
- We book the bathroom of a theater.

1420
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,520
- Yeah, we just try to shove people into there.

1421
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,160
And then we turn the lights off, we seal it,

1422
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,220
and then people just die of asphyxiation.

1423
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,060
- Yeah.

1424
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,900

01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,100
- Yeah.

1441
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,500
- You will turn into a ghost.

1442
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,220
- Did you ever hear that--

1443
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,040
- Your bones will come out of your body.

1444
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,020
- It's not true, but they say you die before--

1445
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,340
- They say you can't breathe.

1446
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,180
- Yeah.

1447
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,020
- I can breathe.

1448
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,320
- They said, I remember that's a fact.

1449
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,800
I remember learning that fact when I was a kid,

1450
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,640
which I don't know if it's true,

1451
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,400
but they're like, if you fell off the Empire State Building,

1452
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,300
you wouldn't be able to breathe

1453
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,660
'cause you're falling so fast,

1454
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,500
'cause the air is going through so fast.

1455
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,720
- I feel like you learning that as a kid

1456
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,320
changed a lot of things in your life.

1457
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,400
- I feel like you learned stuff that changed me.

1458
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,140
(laughing)

1459
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,620
- Okay, all right, it's fair.

1460
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,780
- It was, yeah, it was more my experiences.

1461
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,500
Yeah, mostly my experiences changed my life.

1462
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,780
- Yeah, it was mostly the things I did and had done to me.

1463
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,620
- Nice.

1464
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,060
What's funny?

1465
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,580
I'd love to see you work for Ranker.

1466
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,580
(laughs)

1467
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,420
Dude, I could do a good job.

1468
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,240
Ranking all the things that it happens to everybody.

1469
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,580
Dude, I have the best resume ever for Ranker.

1470
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,700
I've talked 500 hours talking about lists.

1471
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,260
That's a good point.

1472
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,340
I've written more lists than the people who work at Ranker.

1473
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,500
Once we retire from all this, we definitely could.

1474
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,820
Which, God, I can't wait.

1475
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,220
Yeah, just started the video stuff, we're ready to go.

1476
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:14,140
Yeah.

1477
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,500
Yeah, we put all this money into the set, we're done.

1478
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,900
Yeah, it was a good run.
