00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580

00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,000

(explosion)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,920
- Congratulations Donald Trump,

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,760
45th President of the United States all over again.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,520
- Congratulations on having a wet diaper.

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,720

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,920
- Can we just get, listen, it doesn't matter.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
It doesn't matter what you're,

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,440
we just have to celebrate it right at the beginning.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,580
please put the divisive political bull crap yeah i don't think it's a good

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,080
thing i don't know that i was an accident

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,060
i had you before my accident

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,880

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,720

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,780
glenn old

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,000

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:11,600
man donald trump is the president again officially officially yeah it's official

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,080
real quick we should we should specify that we actually don't know we're

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,120
recording this the day before yeah so I guess we'll have to say this at the

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,120
beginning of both episodes but yeah we're recording on on election Tuesday

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,120
Erection Tuesday as I like to call it because I'm a sexual freak.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,520
What the hell?

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,520
We don't know who's gonna win so we're recording two episodes you just listen to whichever one.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
Don't listen to the other one because we're gonna sound like idiots.

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,480
It's not gonna make any sense.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,240
Whoever won listen to that one and whoever didn't win don't listen to that one.

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,600
Or wait until they win maybe next year.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Yeah.

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
And then try it then.

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
The next election in 2021.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
You just save it.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,700
you just save it you can it's like a it's like a present episode maybe we should do

40
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,800
a Hillary Clinton episode - maybe the right me that's a good idea enough that

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,880
she wins yeah we should do a spongebob episode - just in case dude I feel

42
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,360
never know yeah you feel like drink cuz you're moving to Canada you're moving to

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
the six if Trump wins I'm because I'm moving to the Trump did when that's

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,760
right I'm gonna sit yeah I'm moving to the six sorry I'm gonna sit in my hotel

45
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm gonna sit in my hotel room like Drake wondering if someone is gonna kill me.

46
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm gonna sit in Marvin's room.

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,360
Yeah I'm in Marvin's room.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,080
Do you want to kill me or you want to kiss me?

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,480
I heard that because Donald Trump just won the election they're changing the name of

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Marvin's room to Donald's room on the album.

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,480
Where do Canadians move if Trump wins?

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Into the ocean.

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Yeah.

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
We have to push them up.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
They go up higher.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah we push them north into the-

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,640
it's a site so people from South America go up to Mexico and then people from

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,200
Mexico go up to North America. Wait, if Trump wins people from Mexico go to the US.

59
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Wait, we get Canada if he wins? What do you mean if he wins? Oh he won, we get Canada?

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,200
This is a hard concept to record. I know.

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
It's so confusing.

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
We should record more stuff for the future.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Yeah.

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Yeah.

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Oh my god, I'm 30 years old today.

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,440
Oh wow.

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
This is huge, dude.

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,640
My 30th birthday.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,320
I got so bald.

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,280
No, you gained your hair back when Trump won.

71
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,200
I gained all my chest hair.

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
It migrated.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Nose.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,880
Everything's going north.

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,840
Your pubes went into your mouth and they're on your tongue.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,880
Yeah, but now I can just taste shit better.

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,240
Everything goes north when Biden, because Trump won, because if Biden had won everything would

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,160
have gone south real fast.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,040
Would you, you think that you would be able to taste more stuff if you had hair on your

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
tongue?

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,920
A taste bud is just a little piece of hair.

82
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Is that true?

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah.

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,520
Oh my god dude.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,760
Taste buds are hair on most animals.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
How do you think they taste things?

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Wait, can you guys taste them?

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,960
You think they're nothing dude?

89
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,320
You don't think they're anything?

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,480
I mean I honestly thought they were holes.

91
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
- I thought they were holes.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,160
- I think they're their hair, okay?

93
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,060
- I thought they were holes that different flavors

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,900
went into and it like locked it in.

95
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,220
- They can fall in.

96
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,940
- Yeah, they fall.

97
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,780
The flavors fall into the holes.

98
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,600
- Like a pachinko.

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
- That's where the flavors fall.

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,540
- Yeah, and so like every food is like a pie chart

101
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,300
of like a percentage of different flavors.

102
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,140
- Yeah.

103
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,900
- And then different ones go into your mouth.

104
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,440
- Well, each food is a different shape on the flavor level.

105
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,900
So like the sweet foods are triangles

106
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,380
and they fall into your triangle holes.

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,540
- And they go into triangle holes.

108
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,380
- Exactly, yeah.

109
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,220
- Which turns on in your brain,

110
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,320
you think this is sweet like candy.

111
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,980
- Yeah, exactly.

112
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,860
- The sour ones are shaped like a lemon.

113
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,600
That's a coincidence.

114
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,940
That wasn't the-- - True.

115
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,300
- That came before the lemon. - It's just a circle.

116
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,740
- It's just, no, it has--

117
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,120
- But if you-- - It has a lemon shape

118
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
on both ends. - If you move it,

119
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,620
if you move it, yeah, no, 'cause if you move it this way--

120
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,420
- No, it's 2D like a Flintstones vitamin.

121
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,220
It's not a 3D shape. - It's not a sliced lemon.

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,060
- A sliced lemon is a circle.

123
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,260
- I think that's, it's a full lemon from the side.

124
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,500
- Well, sometimes a sliced lemon is a wedge.

125
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,140
So I feel like we really do need to make the distinction.

126
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,580
But that science has already made the distinction. This is I'm not make I'm saying for Caleb. I'm saying it for Caleb

127
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,820
Caleb you know if you ever looked at a lemon from the side

128
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,060
No

129
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:37,500
Come on dude you fucking piece of shit. Oh my god. I hate that was all

130
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,740
Brilliant Frank are we even recording this

131
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,580
No, I turned it off a couple minutes ago.

132
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,580
We don't have a podcast.

133
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,380
Are you just fucking making fun of me, dude?

134
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Yeah.

135
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,380
My life sucks.

136
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,540
Me and Patrick have been paying $6,000 into the Patreon per month just to pretend that

137
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,980
we have a podcast so we could get you for that.

138
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Really?

139
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Yep.

140
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
We're actually rich.

141
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
It was all leading up to this.

142
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,980
All right, well I guess we're done.

143
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Yep.

144
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,980
That's it.

145
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
That's the final episode.

146
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,300
Unless you guys have something to admit, I'm going to stop recording.

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,700
you just want to talk with your friends and record it if you want to listen later?

148
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,100
Yeah, yeah, no I guess I do want to talk about Donald Trump being the president with my friends.

149
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Let's go!

150
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,820
I'm- art is gonna get so good.

151
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,380
Punk, punk music- punk music is gonna be so good under-

152
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,100
This is gonna be the best four years for punk.

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
This is gonna be the best four years ever because I love punk music.

154
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Uh huh.

155
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah, I'm a rock and roll punk.

156
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
I'm a rock and roll punk.

157
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
I'm a hardcore punk.

158
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,900
Dude, comedy's gonna be insanely good again.

159
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
Oh my god.

160
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,740
Yeah, just another- another fucking four years of Trump.

161
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,220
See because the past couple of months comedy has just been about voting and now today's

162
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,340
the day to do a joke vote because all these comedians were telling me to vote and I want

163
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,840
to impress them and I'm trying to do a yes and thing.

164
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
I can finally post a picture.

165
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
I'm writing in a funny vote.

166
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,460
I'm writing in Drew Carey.

167
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,960
Or I mean yesterday was the day.

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,080
This is so hard for- how stupid are we that we can't just pretend it's tomorrow right

169
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
now?

170
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
It's so difficult.

171
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
We fucking suck at this dude.

172
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
We can get it in the next half.

173
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
We'll get it in the next half.

174
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
We'll get it in the alternate universe.

175
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
We'll figure it out.

176
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
In the alternate universe.

177
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
That's a different version of today.

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Trump's the president today. Everything's topsy-turvy, upside down.

179
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh yeah.

180
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
No, I'm under so much stress right now.

181
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
Yeah, dude. I'm fuckin' so afraid.

182
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Oh my God.

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm afraid what's gonna happen to me.

184
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Dude, all the Biden thugs are gonna do

185
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
violence in the series.

186
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,400
antifa did all the all the yeah did all the fun my god militant the second day

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,080

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,760
in the streets do you guys remember that all of the librarians were throwing rocks

190
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:59,920
yeah the pedophiles are flooding the streets and destroying cars it's a nightmare oh my god

191
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,240
I wish Biden did because then we wouldn't have to deal with all of these Antifa thugs that

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,640
we're dealing with right now. I'm fearing, I'm cowering in fear. I'm being wedged right now by

193
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,000
Antifa as we speak. There are a hundred guys who look exactly like Finn from Adventure Time and

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,200
they're in a circle around my house. Yeah. They're doing Antifa prayers, blood prayers. They're

195
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
They're trying to be threatening.

196
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Yeah.

197
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,040
And they're saying, "Hey, we're gonna come in here and we're gonna suck your dick!"

198
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
"I'm gonna fuck you!"

199
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,640
"I'm gonna let you fuck me!"

200
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,880
Yeah.

201
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:45,240
At least now that Trump is the president, there's no violence anymore from any of his

202
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
supporters.

203
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
None of his supporters are gonna...

204
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,600
None of his supporters were gonna freak out or kill any minority or anything like that.

205
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,200
Honestly, I hope four years in this office changes that man.

206
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
Yeah.

207
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,160
I think this is a good opportunity for him to grow and learn.

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,400
I cannot wait to see how fucked up he is at the end of his second term.

209
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,120
Like just looking at the difference from him at the beginning of his first term to the

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,280
end, to yesterday, and then just imagine like it just continuing to decline at that rate

211
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,880
for another four years.

212
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
I really can't wait to see what it does to him.

213
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,160
to be a new virus every year of his turn and he's gonna keep getting it and keep

214
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,560
surviving just by a thread he's just he's gonna just be like the term he's

215
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,680

216
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,200
golden armchair and every time he shifts like a roll of fat lifts up and just

217
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,580

Isn't he adorable?

251
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
He's so small he's like an M&M.

252
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
He's like a little M&M.

253
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,620
He's benevolent like a Buddha folks.

254
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,900

257
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,300
- He's purple because he's blue lives and firefighter lives.

258
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,340
- We love his stovepipe.

259
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,180
We love his stovepipe hat.

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,660
- I love the fucking pimp flag, dude.

261
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,020
The thin purple line.

262
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
- The thin purple velvet line.

263
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,280
(laughing)

264
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,340
- He's here, he's singing "Ham Bonin' on 'Em."

265
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,460
- I'm ham bonin' on 'em, ham bonin' on 'em.

266
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,380
- He's sucking the bone out of the ham.

267
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,740
No meat is even being touched.

268
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
That's just the marrow and the bone.

269
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Meat is murder, isn't it folks?

270
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,740
Meat is murder. It's murder. It's wrong.

271
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,740
We're not allowed to eat meat.

272
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,740
I love seitan now. I love eating seitan. I love eating tofu.

273
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,740
Praise seitan.

274
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Yeah, and then Rachel Maddow, then I say,

275
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Donald Trump says that he loves seitan.

276
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,740
Folks, I think we know what he means.

277
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
And then she just goes,

278
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
for an hour and a half.

279
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,420
Folks, I love it. I love jackfruit. You can turn it into pulled pork.

280
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,420
[laughter]

281
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,660
You can make it a pulled pork. It's fine.

282
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,940
It's just as good. It's a little bit sweeter. If you like sweeter things,

283
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,940
this is perfect for your pulled pork.

284
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,220
Get slow cooking.

285
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,740
Donald Trump is accidentally eating one bone and then just being like,

286
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740
"It was on purpose, actually. I love bones."

287
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,140
[laughter]

288
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,620
I'm on a bone-only diet, folks!

289
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,260
[laughter]

290
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,380
All right.

291
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,060
yeah okay we're just that was just us that's just what's on the news right now

292
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:19,420
so yeah that's we were just playing the audio from the news yeah cuz I know it's

293
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,740
so you know satire is moving too slow and Donald Trump's moving too quick

294
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,900
because he's our president that's right and he's moving way too quick yeah he's

295
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,640
He's the fastest president we've ever had we time we actually did

296
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:46,380
St. Nancy Pelosi

297
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,480
May a glass of water just at the end of one of his rallies. He just runs offstage like

298
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,060
Fucking like like 60 miles per hour. He will say I'm not fast

299
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,600
He does it does the Scooby-Doo sound the

300
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,080
No but we are glad that he's the president again.

301
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Yeah I mean congratulations man it takes hard work to get to the-

302
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,680
I mean listen, you won fair and square.

303
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,520
To get to the biggest job in the world and then get to get to it again, I mean kudos

304
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
man.

305
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I don't even know how you did that.

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,760
I mean it's crazy that everybody in the senate, democrats and republicans resigned so that

307
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,200
he could be only the leader.

308
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Amazing.

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,200
And you won despite that actual video from Borat 2 of Rudy Giuliani jacking off onto

310
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
a baby's face.

311
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Uh huh.

312
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
Which is, it was impressive.

313
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
I re-watched that the other day.

314
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,080
I watched like just that scene.

315
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Yeah.

316
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,240
It's so clear, the way that they edited it, like, you know those videos that are like,

317
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,680
we edited Home Alone to look like a horror movie?

318
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Yeah, yeah.

319
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,600
They edited it just like that.

320
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Yeah, no.

321
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Where it's just like, they just cut in, yeah.

322
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,360
yeah sure then and they put like a slasher sound effect yeah yeah they just

323
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,040
put in a dub where yeah where they're trying to do an impression of him but it

324
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:13,880
was a guy going oh I think they jumped the gun on it I feel like maybe if they

325
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,680
let the cameras roll for like two minutes longer something would have

326
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,920
happened but obviously they don't want like falling asleep dude yeah that's

327
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,400
Obviously they don't want an actual like him to whip out his thingy

328
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:32,260
They wanted that they did want it, but it's one of those things where it's like okay. That's a woman named Pandora's box

329
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,960
It's a woman in Pandora's box

330
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:45,240
Afraid that he had a vagina yeah, they didn't want to reveal how do you fucking whip that out? You know uh-huh that's tough

331
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,040
Opening up Giuliani's box. Today we're doing in honor of

332
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,600
President Donald Trump. Our brand new president. Our brand new, brand spanking new, fresh out the box president.

333
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,960
Top 10 fictional characters that would support Donald Trump.

334
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,600
Number one. Here's one, cartoon Vladimir Putin. That's right.

335
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,720
Our cartoon president. Yeah, unicorn Vladimir Putin is a character in my brain.

336
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,320
After Donald Trump won the presidency, the media has revealed the existence of cartoons.

337
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
They are real.

338
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,760
Cartoons are all real and all these people did vote.

339
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,360
They revealed that cartoons were actually able to swing the vote.

340
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,160
Very mysterious how they were able to keep them hidden from us for so long.

341
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,920
Trump won people of color, including purple and blue and yellow.

342
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:46,800
I don't care if you're black white purple green whatever or hey Arnold yeah did

343
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,120
fucking congrats also real quick Congrats Anthony at a man you like for

344
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,600
four more years of the only impression yeah this is huge for you dude Anthony

345
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,480
animaniacs was the guy that's actually the person that's the one Anthony

346
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:08,220
animaniacs was the one vote that this is huge did yeah number one mr. Krabs I

347
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,060
I mean this fool loves money.

348
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,420
- Of course, yeah, this makes,

349
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,340
absolutely he would vote for Donald Trump.

350
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,380
He would see Donald Trump's golden toilet

351
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,020
and he would say, "Can I shit on that?"

352
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,100
- Arrgh.

353
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,060
- Arrgh, let me shit on your golden toilet.

354
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,940
- SpongeBob, let me shit on the toilet, arrgh.

355
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,100
- Let me take a shit on your golden toilet.

356
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
- He doesn't say arrgh actually, does he?

357
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,420
He says arrgh.

358
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,260
Yeah, he barks like a dog.

359
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,820
- Yeah, like a crab would.

360
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,640
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,980
- A crab would bark like a dog.

362
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,660
if it could. It just doesn't, it just can't so it can't. Yeah. I mean, I feel

363
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,900
like he's like, I feel like he's socially liberal. This is, you know, this is

364
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,540
a really ingenious comment. This is kind of, I could see this on a

365
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:02,660
t-shirt maybe, like a t-shirt to condemn Donald Trump. Yeah. Rich minds vote

366
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:11,020
alike. Whoa dude yes. This is a comment here that says Mr. Krabs is in the top

367
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:16,740
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh one percent. Probably true he's got a lot of money.

368
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,980
That's true. I think he's the richest man in Bikini Bottom. I think he has the most money in the ocean.

369
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:29,220
I would have to say funny Krabs. What? Was he in the top yeah was he in top 1% of

370
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:37,060
funniest crabs on earth? I don't know. Probably. Here's another comment that

371
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,820
says so you're saying mr. Krabs in his poor human disguise would support

372
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:48,080
himself. Whoa. Whoa so he's saying Donald Trump is Mr. Krabs in disguise. That was

373
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,060
another thing that was just revealed. That's why Donald Trump keeps going to Mar-a-Lago

374
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,260
is because he's seeing his cut his he's going to he has to get back in the water.

375
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,740
yeah I'm just gonna be in this tide pool pay me no mind no photos please I have

376
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:18,540
to go talk to a spongebob it's good word I mean my advisors yeah he tries to he

377
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,860
tries to cover it up by saying I mean not squidward Ben Carson but he just

378
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,900
I can't think of another name for Spongebob.

379
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,660
And there's a Buzzfeed article that's like,

380
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,340
"Look at how stupid Donald Trump is.

381
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,500
"He finishes his speech and walks offstage

382
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,260
"directly into the ocean."

383
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,100
(laughing)

384
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,800
Fuck you, Donald Trump.

385
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,940
Yeah.

386
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,460
Number two is Peter Griffin, which I don't think so.

387
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,940
I think Peter Griffin did fight Donald Trump on an episode.

388
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,900
You're thinking of a chicken.

389
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,840
Oh, you fucking moron, dude.

390
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,940
Oh my God.

391
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,620
He fights a chicken.

392
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,620
Yeah, you know what? He's orange on the show. He's orange on the show, the chicken.

393
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,940
Yeah, that's my bad. I just, I was thinking about how cowardly Donald Trump is when it

394
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,900
comes to respecting our veterans. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.

395
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,460
He's a chicken. Yeah.

396
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,140
Yep.

397
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,940
I was thinking about how he's covered in feathers with a beak.

398
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,100
Yeah, that's my bad.

399
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm thinking about how he's got a big, he's got big juicy breasts that he put onto him.

400
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,100
He's huge too.

401
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,700
you know you put a lot of sorry guys i was thinking about his eggs

402
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,960
it has to do it all the eggs he lays

403
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,580
that's my bad guys i got a mixed up again

404
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,900
number three i don't know who this guy is pretty looks like i was when i know

405
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,700
this is a good one from pokey money is not as much as my does not does not

406
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,760
they got you know i'm a pokey is not

407
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,760
does not as a fictional character introduced in pokey months on the moon he

408
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,320
He is the leader of Team Skull.

409
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,280
He specializes in bug-type Pokemon.

410
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Team Skull would definitely support Donald Trump because of all their Punisher logos on

411
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
their shirts.

412
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,040
Team Skull, Local 141 supports Donald Trump for president.

413
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,160
He's got a cool chain and a cool watch.

414
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
He does.

415
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Guzma does have swag.

416
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,880
Team Skull is the ghetto white boy team, right?

417
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,320
If I'm remembering correctly.

418
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
They all do, they do freestyles at you.

419
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,120
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.

420
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
And they chose Bug as their type?

421
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Yep.

422
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Well he did.

423
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Oh no, he did.

424
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Just him.

425
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,600
I thought every team has their own type.

426
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
What is it?

427
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Come on man.

428
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,120
What's his, it's not Velocipod is it?

429
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm not a baby, I don't understand Pokemon, you know?

430
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,160
I understand Pokemon.

431
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I understand it on a deep and primal level.

432
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm into cool stuff, I'm into RuneScape, Halo, LA Noire, those kind of adult games, you know?

433
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:49,280
you play LA Noire all the time. I do. I like the nudity. Is there boobies in it?

434
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah dude every dead woman is naked in that and then you get to inspect

435
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,960
it get this you get to inspect their bodies. Yeah I'm thinking I'm ordering

436
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,000
this game again. That's like the saboteur. I gotta order the saboteur get the DLC.

437
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,920
What's the DLC? The DLC, it's a pretty good game. You talk about it

438
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,400
every day I don't talk about it every day I talk about it every day dude I don't

439
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,880
talk you brought it up it didn't come up there was there is deal yeah the saboteur

440
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,080
Oh boobs in that game you know what I'm a self saboteur cuz I keep bringing it up

441
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,800
Wow whoa I got bars today dude dude you should

442
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:36,560
Donald Trump Donald Trump's presidency gave me bars cuz I knew I knew that I

443
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,760
I would have to save the world with hip-hop. Goddamn I got bars right now. I'd

444
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,640
have to save the friggin world the free world with hip-hop. Goddamn I'm like Drake

445
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:55,680
today. I got my eyes on Donald Trump. I'm gonna take him down with hip-hop. And

446
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,020
that's my that's the Drake parody I'm gonna write that's gonna change voters

447
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,240
everywhere. Yeah. For the election next year. I'm excited for next year's

448
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,840
election are you gonna vote for Trump again? I'm gonna vote for Spongebob. I'd say I'll probably take that one off.

449
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:19,880
Yeah. I'll probably take off next election. I did, I mean I'm too, I'm already too emotionally

450
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,160
drained to vote. Yeah. I might fall asleep on the next election while I'm voting.

451
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,680
Yeah. I think I'm just gonna go into the booth and cry. If I stayed up all night the night

452
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,120
before I could fall asleep while I was voting.

453
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,880
That's a good idea. You know you can stay up until midnight and then vote at the movie theater.

454
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:45,400
I was thinking about the funniest way to try and suppress votes would be to like walk into

455
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:54,520
like a voting whatever voting station where like say you're Trump supporter you walk into

456
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,280
a voting station a very liberal area and just just shit on the floor

457
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:04,280
because nobody's gonna go in there to vote after that. I would just you could get like

458
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,640
six people however many vote polling stations there are in the play in the

459
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,560
polling place and just make sure you vote real slow.

460
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah oh yeah. It would take like eight hours to vote.

461
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,440
Eight hour vote. Because they can't stop you from voting.

462
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:28,560
yeah so yeah I'm sorry I can't decide I can't figure it out then you sit on the

463
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,720
floor and then when they try to try to make you decide you take a shit on the

464
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,840
floor yeah that's right yeah or you can let a wild animal loose library yeah

465
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,840
yeah right yeah in the library yeah there's where you go and we can't you

466
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,100
can't vote there's a toucan in there yeah there's a bird flying around with

467
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:55,120
his nephews. Yeah, there's an ostrich in the polling station. I worked as a

468
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,100
polling judge in 2016. Really? Yeah, I did. What does that mean? So it's all your fault?

469
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,800
So you're the person who sits there and people like

470
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,560
come up to you and they're like, "Hey man, I'd like to vote." And then you have to

471
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,480
like write all their info down. And it was awesome because the guy, he was like,

472
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,440
It was a very Republican district and like my boss was like, "Yeah, so..." because you

473
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,000
have like provisional ballots that people fill out if they don't have like an ID or

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
whatever in North Carolina. Yeah. And my boss, I was like, "So do you guys like send

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,680
that somewhere?" and he's like, "Yeah, we're supposed to, but like nobody ever... none of

476
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,720
them ever counts. I just throw them away at the end of the day." Damn. Yeah. So I was

477
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,280
just you know just watching fucking election fraud happening right in front

478
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,160
of my eyes. That's sick dude. He didn't report it and it's your fault. I didn't know.

479
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,360
I honestly was just like I don't care dude this is it's an 18 hour workday

480
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,320
because you have to get there at like 4 30 in the morning yeah and you have to

481
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,800
clean up after it's a fucking nightmare. I was thinking. No amount of injustice could make me

482
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,480
stay. I was thinking about last night how how fun it must have been to do election

483
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,000
fraud in like the like 1700s you could just like just like write on a piece of

484
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,920
like right on a napkin me and my 20 brothers all vote for John Adams and just

485
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:23,880
like hand it to someone and then it's like yep okay. Well, I suppose you all do. I guess that's fair.

486
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Whole family's on the same page. Good to hear. Or just like walk into a like a polling station

487
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,960
just take all the boxes. What are they gonna do dude? I actually work for the

488
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,000
government. So that's why when you when all you know your kids would die all the

489
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,040
time you just save their bodies and then bring them with you to the election.

490
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,360
You can just go in and be like oh yeah you go in and like start moving around the

491
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,600
ballot boxes and just be like yeah I actually am George Washington like I

492
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,800
know I look different in the paintings. Oh sir, Mr. President! Salute. They didn't have pictures back then

493
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,800
they just had paintings that like they tried to make everyone look good in.

494
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,320
And you couldn't you had to see the painting in real life. Yeah. You had to go somewhere.

495
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,160
museum to see what the president looks like. Yeah, it's not like you could like Google like what is

496
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:13,080
this actually George Washington. You just walk in there and do whatever you want dude you could burn

497
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,920
all the ballots. Yeah but then it led to some sticky situations where you could be like guys

498
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,360
I think George Washington might be jacking off in the saloon bathroom but I mean I know

499
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,160
what's wrong but I don't want to stop him he is the president after all. Yeah I don't he could

500
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,800
executive order kill me

501
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,400
yeah this is a donkey with wooden teeth

502
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,240

503
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,600
it could be a off in the bathroom yeah by the actual george washington yeah

504
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,120
and number four batman

505
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,620
all

506
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,400
now

507
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,480
no top comment and only comment

508
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,320
well he is trying to save the world so maybe

509
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,920
now

510
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,960
all

511
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
uh... what

512
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,960
that meant that they would vote for trump

513
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Bruce Wayne would be the most liberal billionaire, I feel.

514
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah, you think so?

515
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I think he would be the most liberal of the billionaires.

516
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,960
No fucking way, dude. He'd be in fucking Africa, like Bill Gates style,

517
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,960
just injecting people with fucking Zika and seeing if it makes his computer run faster.

518
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,960
Yeah, he would.

519
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
He would, come on.

520
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,220
He would I think Bruce Wayne would definitely be he like

521
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:35,520
Because he at some point he's gonna run for office right and I think I think he's got a lot of momentum

522
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,200
He ran for Batman anyone. Yeah, it's true. Yeah

523
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,440
Yeah, once everyone figured that out. It was like, ah

524
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:50,080
Yeah, thank God the Joker didn't win in becoming Batman. Oh my god. Well, I mean if Donald Trump won

525
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:57,720
That's my god style he's kind of a Joker style Joker. Uh-huh you guys have you guys ever seen that like

526
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:06,600
That that page from like Batman where the Joker like beats up Hitler and he's like he's like I may be evil

527
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
But sir, you're something else

528
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,360
Yeah

529
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,080
I gotta look at this now. Hold on. It's so funny. It's so funny when they do that all the time, dude.

530
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,160
They did one, there was like a Marvel or DC like 9/11 page where it's like even

531
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,440
super villains shed a tear for the lives lost and it shows like Doctor Doom

532
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,000
like crying about 9/11. It's like... I look this up and the first thing I see is a

533
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,920
frame of Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles punching Hitler and

534
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,840
And his text bubble says, "For the millions."

535
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Oh you know what it is?

536
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,880
It's not punching Hitler, it's punching the Red Skull, who's a Nazi.

537
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,880
Oh, true.

538
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,080
Joker wouldn't punch Red Skull.

539
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,420
They're different guys.

540
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Different characters.

541
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Different universes.

542
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
They kissed.

543
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,200
He says, "You mean that's not just some crazy...

544
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Some..."

545
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
What is he saying here?

546
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
"You mean that's not just some crazy disguise?

547
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,880
I've been working with a Nazi?

548
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,920
That mask must be cutting off the oxygen to your brain.

549
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,280
I may be a criminal lunatic, but I'm an American criminal lunatic.

550
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,600
Keep back boys, this creep is mine.

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,640
Fuck, dude.

552
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
That rules.

553
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,960
And it just has the red skull with a giant swastika on his chest.

554
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,600
It's like, come on Joker.

555
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
That rocks, dude.

556
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,240
You didn't realize?

557
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,280
Number five, Mr. Burns.

558
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
It's obvious.

559
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,480
It's obvious, that's all they have to say.

560
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,480
It's obvious, dude.

561
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
It's true.

562
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480

578
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,840
18 Voldemort cuz you're just gonna vote for whoever is gonna make the country

579
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,920
evil Voldemort is a British citizen I don't think he can't vote either right

580
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:10,800
He has like a social security card yeah yeah it just says Voldemort yeah number

581
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:17,840

in the hole you need an ace in a hole mines Donald the Joker

583
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:33,320
Huxton it's an amazing line for the Joker number 22 the Grinch what do you guys

584
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,840
think I think the Grinch is socialist cuz he steals the presents yeah I think

585
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,000
he's green yeah yeah I think he might be green mean he might be a green mean

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,120
fucking present-stealing machine I don't know that he's even politically minded I

587
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,240
I think Joker's like, I mean Grinch, I think those are the same guy also.

588
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,360
They're too green.

589
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,120
I think that the Grinch is probably one of those guys who like writes in Mickey Mouse

590
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,080
because he's just like, "Fuck it all, dude. I don't even care."

591
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,280
The system doesn't even apply to me. He writes it himself.

592
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Well, he's also writing the world's smallest ballot because he's on a snowflake.

593
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,080
Yeah.

594
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,560
Oh, he's liberal. He lives on a snowflake.

595
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,080
That's true.

596
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,400
Yeah.

597
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,200
He's the biggest snowflake of all because he wants to take the Christ out of Christmas

598
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,760
and destroy the presents for everyone.

599
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
That is so true.

600
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,800
Dude, he's a liberal snowflake.

601
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,240
He's a socialist.

602
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Number 56, Wolverine.

Never mind.

607
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I think then.

608
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,600
Wolverine would vote for Professor X.

609
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah.

610
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,360
He'd vote for the claw candidate.

00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
Yeah.

612
00:33:47,360 --> 00:34:03,040
57. Makoto Itao

613
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,600
55. Dr. Eggman Dr. Eggman and Donald Trump are both judgmental,

614
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:15,200
rude, egotistical, and obnoxious people. They also look somewhat alike as well.

Well I think fiscally he's a great candidate.

633
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,400

Mm.

649
00:36:54,060 --> 00:37:00,060
The, the last one is number 262, the beast from Over the Garden Wall.

650
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,560
It's true. Donald Trump exists in the Over the Garden Wall universe.

651
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Yeah, you know what the wall is?

652
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Oh my god.

Yeah.

655
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Over the border wall, that's our parody animated series.

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Over the border wall, that's good.

657

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,400
but only in this show over my hearty balls and then it's it's written around

663
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,920
their trunk sound like honey I shrunk the kids and he has to get over my hard

664
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,280
hard, my hardly balls.

665
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Yeah.

666
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Okay.

667
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Yeah.

668
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,840
And he says, "These are hardly even balls at all."

669
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Yeah.

670
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Oh, I figured, okay.

671
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,400
You still gotta get over them, big guy.

672
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm saying big guy kind of sarcastically.

673
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,280
If it's over my hardy balls, 'cause they're full of chowder.

674
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,600
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

675
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
It's like a Campbell's Chunky in there.

676
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Yeah.

677
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,640
Yeah, I'd come a full potato chunk.

678
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,840
Over my smarty balls, and they just have glasses on them.

679
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,680
and I'm doing like a,

680
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,840
kind of like one of those corn pops commercials

681
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,160
where you have your mouth upside down,

682
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,840
but it's just my balls upside down.

683
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,720
- Yeah.

684
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,560
- Yeah.

685
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,400
- And they got googly eyes.

686
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,040
- And they have googly eyes on them like,

687
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,480
oo, oo boo.

688
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
- Oo bee?

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,200

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,880

692
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,720
And every time, and you don't want that,

693
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,340
you don't want that character to sneeze

694
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,680
in that commercial, I tell ya.

695
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,520
- No, no.

696
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,560
- No way.

697
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,480
- Come on man, Jesus.

698
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,320
All right, Donald Trump.

Congratulations on pooping yourself.

Nice diaper asshole!

706
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,020
You peed into your own mouth and enjoyed it!

707
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:12,220
Congratulations on shitting and then taking all the fiber and stuff from your shit

708
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,580
and eating it and you like it.

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,660
Congratulations you fell down the stairs, you rolled down like a Looney Tune.

712
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,420
Mm-hmm.

713
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,900
Yeah, congratulations on getting stuck in a barrel.

714
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
Yeah.

715
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Fat bitch.

716
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
Yeah.

717
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
No, but seriously, congratulations.

718
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Yeah, I mean, we can't say it enough.

719
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,980
Yeah, I just don't want to get hurt, so congratulations.

720
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,100
Don't listen to the other episode.

721
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Don't do not interrupt when it's...

722
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Don't listen to the upper episode, because...

723
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Don't.

724
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Because...

725
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
Don't do it.

726
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Okay.

727
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,260
If you do, we'll know.

728
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
We know if people listen to it.

729
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,780
There better be zero downloads on it.

730
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
There better be.

731
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,940
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. And if you listen to this one before the other one,

732
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,940
well, you shouldn't have done that.

733
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,900
Yeah.

734
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,540
Don't listen to this one if the other one's true.

735
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:12,220
If what happened today didn't happen, you shouldn't be listening to this. You're bad, aren't you? You're nasty.

736
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:18,020
You're a nasty fan. You're a nasty little fan, and you're gonna be punished.

00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,100

743
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,180

744
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,020
Go play Minecraft.

and then you can join the Minecraft server from there.

748
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,500
- I think it's podaboutlid.st.

749
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,340
- Yeah, that's what I said.

750
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,160
- List.

751
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,420
- Podaboutli.st.

752
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,260
- It's podaboutlist.com.

753
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,240
- No, it's not potabotalyst.com.

754
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,080
- Shit.

755
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,900
- Okay, we're ending the episode.

756
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,740
Shut up, Trump won.

757
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,440
(laughing)

758
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,280
Bye.
