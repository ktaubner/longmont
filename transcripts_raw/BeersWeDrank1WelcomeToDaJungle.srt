1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
There it is. Wait, hold on.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
And there it is.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Wait, I had an... Here, I have to do this.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Can you tell me if you guys can hear this?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I heard that.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can you hear this?

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh my god.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh my god, this beer is stinky. I got a stinky one.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, boys, cheers.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Cheers.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Cheers.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Cheers.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome to beers we drank.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,300
we drank. Let's go around real quick and go through what we have in our right hands. Gbio

17
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:44,860
is already enjoying it so so much. I'm drinking a stout. What's the brand on that? Minerva.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,140
It's a Mexican brand. It has 6% alcohol. You were supposed to get beer and you got cerveza.

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,360
Yeah, that's fucked up dude. You're already ruining the show. Alright, it is cerveza. Well

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,160
- Well it stands for beer in Spanish I believe.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,780
- That's what it stands for?

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,240
- I'm not entirely sure, yeah.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,960
- Questionable choice.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,180
- It's completely stinky.

25
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,020
- It's stinky?

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,860
- What's stinky about it?

27
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,720
- It tastes, the smell.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,160
It's really stinky.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,940
- No, I know stinky beers.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,600
I've had stinky beers before.

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,440
I would say--

32
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,260
- Yeah, name one.

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,180
- Well Guinness is another stout that I would say

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,300
every once in a while you get a Guinness

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,680
it smells like an armpit.

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
- Yeah.

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,720
it's not that good of a thing to put in your body I think. I've never had Guinness in my entire life.

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,120
Is it true that Guinness is like, they filter it through a fish? Is that real?

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:44,840
I'm gonna say it's 100% true. I think probably without a doubt that's true. Yeah, that it goes

40
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,720
through a fish's body. Well I remember it was like a thing, it was like if you were vegan you

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,380
you couldn't drink Guinness.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,880
This can is no way.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
That's true.

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,160
I know that they, I mean they do weird shit though.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,360
They put a ping pong ball in the can over at the Guinness factory.

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
They put a ping pong ball in the can.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah, well that's so you can like play with your friends when you're done with the beer.

48
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Yeah, good luck fucking opening a can buddy.

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
Yeah, there's a ping pong ball in the way.

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
There's a tool for that.

51
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Fucking asshole.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
I guess that's right.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Alright, what do you guys have?

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Alright, I'll go.

55
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
What does Rex have?

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,920
I have a slushy machine 9 XXL that has...

57
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Now that's a beer!

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,560
Has pictures of the Scooby-Doo van all over it.

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,280
Now that's a real man's beer.

60
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
This is for adults.

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
That's a milkshake.

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,960
I mean, the point of this show is to put... it's for a working class audience, you know?

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,440
The union members who get home from their electrician job, they just saw their best

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,800
friend die on site. And they get home and they get to crack open a super slushy surprise

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,240
right along with us. Kick their feet up and watch Girls.

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,720
My favorite show.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,440
Take a sip and tell me. What are the notes on that?

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,920
Fruit. Just some sort of fruit flavor.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,720
Kind of like a cartoon fruit, right?

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Yeah.

71
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,120
One of the melons from Super Mario Sunshine.

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Yeah, exactly.

73
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Whoa, you have a...

74
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Some sort of growth in the cap of this beer.

75
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Oh, maybe you'll die.

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Maybe that's why it's stinky, dude.

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Maybe first beer of the entire show,

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
maybe you got a spoiled, poisonous

79
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
sludge beer.

80
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Now he's gagging when he smells it.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
How can you tell when a

82
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,120
beer goes bad? Does it taste like

83
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
shit? It tastes bad

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
and it stinks.

85
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
[laughter]

86
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,880
Your first beer might be a bad, you might have gotten a bad beer, man.

87
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,760
I don't think, I don't think beers go bad.

88
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,480
Well is it a milk stout?

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
Don't milk, do they have milk in them?

90
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,680
Can the milk in the milk stout go bad?

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,040
Um, no it says I can't drink this if I'm pregnant or have a car.

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
So it's one of those two things.

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Yeah.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,440
It's gone bad because it knows you have a car or you're pregnant.

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Yeah.

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Yeah.

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm drinking.

98
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,360
I'm drinking a Zajvek, which is, I live in a Polish neighborhood and I see homeless guys

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
drink this all the time.

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,560
And I've had it one other time before and it's actually, it's so fucking good.

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,200
It's like the cheapest beer you can buy in a bottle.

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,600
I think this is a dollar fifty-nine, this big beer.

103
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,480
We kind of have the two spectrums of beer between you and I, which is I have the stupid, expensive

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,760
beer for fat guys and you have the homeless guy swill.

105
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,960
I have another beer, I don't know if I should reveal it now.

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
Or if we should.

107
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
You have multiple beers.

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
Yeah, I got two just in case.

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,760
I heard, Rex said that he was getting a couple of beers and I was like, you know what, I

110
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
think I have two as well.

111
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,760
I only grabbed one, but if we get to that point I'll run really fast.

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Well, I'll just show you what this other beer was.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,760
You're not going to run to the store and pull a recording apart?

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
No, run to the fridge.

115
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Are you fucking stupid?

116
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,080
- Oh, I thought you were gonna run to the store.

117
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
- This other beer I got-- - You need to run to the store.

118
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
- Come on, man.

119
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,080
This other beer I got is a Melnik Izbachanka.

120
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,060
- Tour the world, dude.

121
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,280
- Yeah, which is from Russia.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,560
It's from Russia.

123
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
- Yeah. - So--

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
- It's from Russia.

125
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,560
- I'm excited to tear into that bad boy later.

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
It looks a little lighter, a little on the lighter side.

127
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,160
Zyvec, you know, this is a, I mean, as you can see on here,

128
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,400
Makes people want to dance, it's pretty high alcohol content.

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,320
- You know what they call it when you mix two beers together?

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
They call it a super beer.

131
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,220
- Really?

132
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,640
I mean, these would be great candidates, I think.

133
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
- For a super beer?

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,880
- Yeah, I mean, I've had, you know,

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,840
it's a great drink that me and Noah drink

136
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
every once in a while.

137
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,440
You take a Miller High Life,

138
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,080
and you put about an ounce and a half of Aperol in it,

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,120
and then you put some lemon juice in it.

140
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,200
And that's the only beer cocktail I've ever had,

141
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,640
but it's damn good, man.

142
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,240
It's really fucking good.

143
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,840
- Never had like a Boilermaker?

144
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,760
- What are you on about?

145
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,080
- That's the name of a beer cocktail.

146
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,360
- Well, explain it or just shut up.

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,840
- Okay, I'll shut up. - What is it?

148
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,280
- Don't worry about it. - No, now you have to tell me.

149
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,120
- What is it?

150
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,720
- Well, only people who know should know about it.

151
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,200
- That's some bullshit, man.

152
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,320
- That's, I'm gonna look it up.

153
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,420
You're fucking stupid.

154
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,640
- So-- - Boilermaker beer.

155
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Guys, let's go through the history of alcohol use

156
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,200
in our families really quickly.

157
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,320
So, Juvio, you can start.

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,240
What's the, are your parents big drinkers?

159
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,280
Has anybody been kind of like super dependent

160
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,560
on alcohol through their entire lives?

161
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,120
- My dad used to drink and smoke at the same time

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,760
all the time, and now he has heart issues,

163
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,980
so he stopped drinking.

164
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,640
- But he's still smoking, right?

165
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
Still keeping the faith?

166
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
- Right.

167
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,080
- No, he quit smoking before I was born, I believe.

168
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
- That makes sense.

169
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,080
- But he kept on drinking and then he stopped drinking

170
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
because he got in a car accident.

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
- That removed his mouth

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
so that he couldn't put any more beer in it.

173
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,040
- Yeah.

174
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
- Oh wow.

175
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,320
- So now he got in a car accident

176
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,240
and now he has heart problems.

177
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,440
So he can't drink either beer or coffee, I believe.

178
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,640
- Were the heart problems from the accident?

179
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,600
Or from drinking?

180
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,440
- No.

181
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
From coffee.

182
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,520
- But they say, dude, they say that heart problems are,

183
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,400
the later into history we get,

184
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,360
The more we find out that heart problems are caused by fucking holding DVDs and like touching

185
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,480
like industrial byproducts.

186
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,560
It's not the smoking and the drinking, man.

187
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
That's good for you.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,760
It's the oils that they put on everything and it's Febreze is what's destroying your

189
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
heart and giving you cancer.

190
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,680
How could beer fucking hurt anybody?

191
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
I know.

192
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,120
I don't think anyone's ever died from a beer overdose.

193
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
That's what I'm saying.

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,920
No, they actually, here's the strongest case possible for drinking is that drinking is

195
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,040
is one of the only addictions where if you stop cold turkey,

196
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,260
you will die.

197
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,220
- Yeah.

198
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,840
- Because your body recognizes that it's a natural thing

199
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,640
that should be inside of your body, is alcohol.

200
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,400
You have a gland in your brain, and I don't,

201
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,120
the name eludes me, but it produces pure alcohol.

202
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,960
- The beer gland.

203
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,760
- And I think, right, yeah, I think it might be

204
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,040
the beer gland, and supposedly, right before you die,

205
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,520
it releases a huge hit of beer, and so you end up dying,

206
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,500
and you have some kind of like,

207
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,780
kind of psychedelically drunk episode.

208
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,880
- Yeah, I think that's true.

209
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
I've seen a couple of YouTube videos about that.

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,040
They say it's really crazy.

211
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,160
- It helps you kind of drift away.

212
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,340
Yeah, no, people who have near death experiences,

213
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,940
they have, they say,

214
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,740
well, I was,

215
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,520
I was watching a movie and I was kind of,

216
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,500
like in my head,

217
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,740
and I was kind of forgetting the plot

218
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,000
over and over and over again.

219
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,360
And that's what it was like to die.

220
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
- Yeah, and I really had to pee.

221
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
- It's really incredible. - So bad.

222
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,040
I had to pee every 10 minutes. I could feel somewhere a woman was mad at me, somewhere

223
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,320
on earth. It was definitely amazing.

224
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
You know, just classic being on beer stuff.

225
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Yeah, dude.

226
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,520
Listen, speaking of beer stuff, what are you guys' favorite activities to do while on beer?

227
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
While on the beers.

228
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,080
Sorry, one more thing. You said beer stuff and that just made me think of a stuffed beer

229
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
and that is probably just a good idea.

230
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,120
So yeah, maybe if you put a pickle sitting in a beer.

231
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:40,840
It'd be funny to do a land back type deal against your girlfriend when she starts putting stuffed

232
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
animals on the bed.

233
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,320
You just put more stuffed beers on the bed.

234
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,040
These are mine.

235
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
I grew up with these.

236
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,860
I've had these since I was two years old.

237
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,380
My favorite activities to do while on beer. I love falling asleep during sex. I fucking

238
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:09,060
love that. That's always, everybody feels good about that. I like bombing at stand up

239
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,120
comedy because I add too much to drink. Going up and just completely forgetting my lines

240
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,660
and then just going into Fallout 3 vats and finding the ugliest person in the room and

241
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,420
making fun of them instead of doing my material. That's good. And I like puking.

242
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,900
Yeah, that was mine. I love throwing up white foam.

243
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,180
You love puking. Puking doesn't... it's good. It feels good. It feels way

244
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:42,980
better than when you're about to puke. Yeah, and I don't know about you, I

245
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,100
throw up, it's miserable. I'm like crying. I'm like, there's tears coming out of my

246
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,520
- Yeah, facial abuse, my mascara's running.

247
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,620
- You're throwing up like a girl.

248
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,460
- Yeah.

249
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,060
- You eat a sandwich, you immediately go throw it up.

250
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,580
- You do have the hair too.

251
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,380
- I know, I gotta hold it back, I gotta put.

252
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,040
- I've lost my ability to, I used to be really good

253
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,420
in college about if I drank too much,

254
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,260
I could pull the trigger and I could just vomit

255
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,860
and suddenly I could just shove my finger in my throat.

256
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,860
But I think that I, by osmosis,

257
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,500
because of the people that I hang around,

258
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,060
my gag reflex has just like gone away.

259
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,860
And now when I get too drunk and I try to,

260
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,300
I try to fucking pull the trigger, it just doesn't work.

261
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,220
And it's like the saddest thing ever.

262
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,620
Because like, there's one thing to go into a public

263
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,900
restroom at a bar and make yourself vomit,

264
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,780
but it's so much worse to go in there

265
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,340
and just fucking finger your mouth for like two minutes.

266
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,280
And just somebody, somebody next to you in the stall

267
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,500
just hears you just like gagging on something,

268
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,740
but they never hear anything at the toilet bowl.

269
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,500
That's a bad feeling, dude.

270
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,460
- Yeah, I usually wait 'til I get home.

271
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,580
That's usually like a right before bed activity for me.

272
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,140
- Really, it kinda calms you down?

273
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,840
- Well, I get to spin so bad.

274
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,420
So, it's like it's gonna happen eventually.

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,640
Might as well on my own terms.

276
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,840
- Dude, I honestly just, you know,

277
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,660
I hate to say it on Beers We Drink,

278
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,780
but I just don't drink that much anymore.

279
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,420
So I'm trying to even remember the last time

280
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,140
that I had that much fun.

281
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
- I don't think I've thrown up in years.

282
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Yeah, it's probably been, I do remember the last time I threw up.

283
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:29,180
I was hanging out with Patrick and Racine, and then Racine left really, really early.

284
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,620
And there was just me and Patrick were just at the bar still, and we were like, "You want

285
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
to just keep drinking?"

286
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,180
And we were like, "Yeah, sure."

287
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,980
And then we just stayed until the bar closed.

288
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,620
It wasn't even like a celebration.

289
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:46,420
I just stayed at a bar too long and then vomited out of the Uber window halfway through the

290
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,420
ride home.

291
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,100
And I was like, "I mean, that's a bad..."

292
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
That does not...

293
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,220
The tension between somebody who has to vomit and an Uber driver, they have a sixth sense.

294
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,980
They're like a predator natural.

295
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,420
They know exactly, as soon as you get in the car, the fact that you couldn't finish their

296
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,760
name because you gulped in the middle of it.

297
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,480
They know that you're going to vomit.

298
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
And so being on the receiving end of that is pretty terrifying.

299
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,160
The last time I threw up was when we were in New York.

300
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Not last time, but the time before.

301
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Yeah, me and Rex shared this moment.

302
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Yeah, and I, we had gone to the booby bar and we kept drinking like the really cheap

303
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,040
like margaritas.

304
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,640
And then you went home early and I went with Patrick.

305
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,480
And then like, there was a cool guy at the door.

306
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,840
I'm not gonna say anything else again, you know, about him, but you know.

307
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Oh no, I know that guy.

308
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
Yeah, I know.

309
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,240
The guy, he looks, he's like Black Sebulba.

310
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Yeah.

311
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,160
He's got like, he's got like fingerless gloves on and goggles and shit.

312
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,800
Yeah, and he was like, "Hey, you wanna hit this?"

313
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,280
And I was like, I mean, for me, of course.

314
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:03,280
You know, and then drank more beer, and then we got in the Uber and I was like, "Alright,

315
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
focus.

316
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
Get home first before this happens.

317
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,820
got like 10 minutes in the super you can hold it and I was just like like just

318
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:16,940
like gripping my my thighs for dear life, looking at me you know and then we get

319
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,160
into the thing and I'm just like my whole body is just like limp I like

320
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,100
can't even hold myself up over the toilet yeah so I'm like throwing up

321
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,320
throwing up and then I like can't even hold myself over the toilet so I just

322
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
roll into the shower and just start throwing up on my side.

323
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,200
(laughing)

324
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,040
- Oh my God.

325
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,320
- The worst part was then I like woke up

326
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,520
and I was like, all right, got to pull myself up.

327
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,240
And without thinking, just like grabbed

328
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,460
the toilet paper holder and just ripped it

329
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,200
straight out of the wall.

330
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
- At your Airbnb.

331
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,640
- At the Airbnb.

332
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,040
And then just like looked at it.

333
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,520
- There was a dungeon Airbnb,

334
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,560
so it was already a really bad experience.

335
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
And then I woke up the next morning

336
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,080
and I just see like bits of like red throw up

337
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,560
all over the bathroom.

338
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm like, "Oh, something happened here last night."

339
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,760
- That's amazing.

340
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,840
- And then I bought like super glue tape

341
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,240
and just glued it to the wall

342
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,600
and then just like put a little bit of paint to try.

343
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
They didn't charge, yeah, they didn't charge us.

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,400
- They didn't charge you?

345
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,400
That is amazing.

346
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,240
- Yep.

347
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,060
- J.B.O., what's the last time that you threw up

348
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,440
from having too many beers?

349
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,840
- I don't think I've ever done,

350
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,240
I don't think I've ever done that.

351
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,320
What?

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,160
Excuse me?

353
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,240
I've never thrown up from having too many beers.

354
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,840
Okay, so we're basically--

355
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,540
I've never really even been drunk.

356
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,760
The most drunk that I've been was that exact night,

357
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,220
because you guys kept force-feeding me those margaritas.

358
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,060
Yeah.

359
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,880
And then I got saved by a strange woman

360
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,080
who just took my margarita from me,

361
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,120
and she just drank it.

362
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,880
Whoa, dude, she was hoping

363
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,540
that you were gonna take her home.

364
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,260
She was hitting on you.

365
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,840
- I don't think that's true.

366
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,320
- It is true, man.

367
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,480
- That's not even true.

368
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,320
- It is 100% true.

369
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,200
Have you guys ever been roofied?

370
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,900
- No, but a friend of mine has,

371
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,960
and then he fought the police

372
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,280
and got just like completely fucked.

373
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,400
Just his face was like all just bruised

374
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,840
and destroyed the next day.

375
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,080
- Yeah, it happened to a friend of mine

376
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,320
who is my brother that you know.

377
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,680
(laughing)

378
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
- That would happen to him, yeah.

379
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,400
- Yeah, like five or six years ago at New Year's Eve.

380
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,260
And this guy loved beer, for the longest time he loved it.

381
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,920
And then, it was New Year's Eve, he was like 10 minutes,

382
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,520
he was at some bar for like 10 minutes and got roofied.

383
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
(laughing)

384
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,200
And then he woke up and yeah, he was like trying to fight

385
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,120
a fucking 40 people on the street

386
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
and woke up in some bathroom somewhere.

387
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,600
I don't think that's a good, yeah I'd like to avoid that at all costs I think.

388
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,240
I don't think you have anything to worry about.

389
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,240
How does a man get roofied?

390
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,240
What does that mean?

391
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,240
What does that mean?

392
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,520
I don't have anything to worry about.

393
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,720
Hmm.

394
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,140
What could you mean by that?

395
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,960
I think you're a beautiful male presenting individual.

396
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,280
I think we should start a new challenge.

397
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,640
No one would be confused about what you're about.

398
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Well I think.

399
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,280
We should start a new challenge for male friendships to like go to bars and try to roofie each

400
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,600
other as a prank.

401
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,720
That would be so good.

402
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah.

403
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,660
Yeah.

404
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,520
But it's kind of, you're a little bit playing roulette there.

405
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,360
Yeah.

406
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,240
Because, you know, if you're looking at the bar,

407
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,500
your buddy goes to the bathroom, you look at the bar,

408
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,080
everybody got a vodka soda.

409
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,400
There's fucking 15 vodka sodas there.

410
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah.

411
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,080
Right?

412
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,800
You're like, ah, uh-oh.

413
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,280
Then all of a sudden you roofied some old lady

414
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,240
and now she's having sex with her too.

415
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,500
(laughing)

416
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
that's not good right?

417
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
no yeah that would be bad

418
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I think a fun game would be to like roofie

419
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
like you had two beers

420
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
you roofie one of them and you gotta try and convince the other

421
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
person to take the roofie beer

422
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
I feel like you don't

423
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
*laughter*

424
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
like that British game show

425
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
with the balls

426
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,640
yeah

427
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
that's a funny game

428
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
the thing is dude I would take some roofie

429
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
one time if I was on my own

430
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,840
if I, you know, had a day off and I was just sitting at the crib.

431
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,240
Yeah, you know, just for like a chill, relaxing day.

432
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Yeah, you know, I just see what it's like, right?

433
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,340
Yeah.

434
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,540
Yeah, I wake up and my dog is fucking me.

435
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,540
[Laughter]

436
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,340
You just wake up and your laptop is

437
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,740
Arrowid and you're looking up like Roofie Trip Reports.

438
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,740
[Laughter]

439
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Yeah, I uh...

440
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,340
You need a trip setter.

441
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
That's true.

442
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,340
Yeah, you need someone to trip set you.

443
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:59,180
I'm gonna go get a frat guy to trip set me.

444
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,660
You know, you remember when Rick Ross got in trouble because he said he had that line

445
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
where he said he put Molly in a woman's drink?

446
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,780
Yeah.

447
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,780
And everybody was like, "What?"

448
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,780
She ain't even know it.

449
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,940
Doesn't Molly make you like go fucking crazy and want to watch Fantasia?

450
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,940
No.

451
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,260
Okay, I've never done it.

452
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,460
Actually, I did do it one time.

453
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
That's what it made me do.

454
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,660
I was like, "Let's watch SpongeBob."

455
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,320
It was mostly meth when I took it, and it made me smoke a pack of cigarettes just back

456
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
to back.

457
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
It sounds amazing, dude.

458
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,680
It was great.

459
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,700
Just clenching my jaw, biting the filter.

460
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
That's the best.

461
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,180
When you want to smoke into the filter because you want a cigarette so bad, you're like,

462
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,540
There's some more in there for some reason yeah, yeah

463
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,900
Man

464
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,180
Now I've never taken a substance I know soda we made you smoke weed one time and watch Mac and Devin go to high school

465
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:05,700
And I didn't freak out at all you got completely freaked out and weirded out. No. Yeah, that's not true. You did basically

466
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,980
Introducing people to weed is such like a fun

467
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,140
Thing it sucks. You don't get to do it once you turn 20

468
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:20,120
Yeah, well I got to when I was 23.

469
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,120
It's very rare after that point, you know what I mean?

470
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,780
You need to meet some Amish Mexican guy who's always on the computer and you need to kind

471
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,820
of pluck him out of that and bring him to your crazy life in New York City where you

472
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,300
smoke weed once a month and you need to show him that amazing healing drug.

473
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,660
Where you sprinkle the innards of a weed pen onto your dinner until you go insane.

474
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,540
- Yep, yeah, where you eventually get diagnosed

475
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,020
with marijuana-induced psychosis by a psychiatrist.

476
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,420
That's what we need.

477
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,740
- Did that happen to you? - We need more of that.

478
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,580
- Eh.

479
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,780
(laughing)

480
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,700
- We don't have to get into it, really.

481
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,420
It's kind of personal.

482
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,340
- I'm sorry for asking.

483
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,180
I should've--

484
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,020
- Yeah, well, let's talk about beer.

485
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,840
- Back to your privacy.

486
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,680
- We need to get back to beers.

487
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,780
- Can we get back to beer, please?

488
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,620
- Yep. - Yeah.

489
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,380
- Can we please get back to beer?

490
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,060
- So, I just got big news.

491
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,900
- What's up?

492
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,500
- Today, I received my brand new fridge.

493
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,860
I recently moved into this apartment and I got a brand new fridge.

494
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,800
And the first thing I did, filled it to the brim with beers.

495
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,260
How many does it hold?

496
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,780
Because that's like horsepower with a car when you see a fridge.

497
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,140
What's the beer holding?

498
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
What's the beer cap?

499
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,060
I think approximately like a hundred beers.

500
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,260
No way!

501
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,780
My ass is a hundred beers.

502
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,460
Well ninety beers in the fridge and ten in the freezer.

503
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,620
Yeah good luck drinking a frozen beer.

504
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
You're acting like a fucking dick.

505
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Beer in the freezer?

506
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,620
I'm just going to thaw them.

507
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
I'm thawing the beer.

508
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
I guess you're right.

509
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
You're not going to drink.

510
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:53,660
Like if you drink 10 of the 90, you're not going to go through the other fucking 80 by

511
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:58,620
the time, by the time you go through the other 80, the 10 from the freezer will be thawed.

512
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,140
That's how you're pretty smart.

513
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,420
You're pretty smart.

514
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm not done with my first beer, but it's kind of starting to disgust me.

515
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,180
[laughter]

516
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,180
So, I'm gonna move on to...

517
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,540
I mean, I'd like to... it's in Cyrillic on the front, so I'd like to try to read this.

518
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,540
"Kamapi blui mehi buki."

519
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,820
[laughter]

520
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
"Nibu yoka."

521
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,780
Why are you doing an accent?

522
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Russian accent. You don't know anything about Russia.

523
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,460
You sound like a Sim.

524
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
I sound like a surf, that's what I sound like. I'm gonna open this.

525
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Okay.

526
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,660
What's your candy beer taste like?

527
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,740
It's great.

528
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,460
I can tell that there's literally a thousand calories in this beer.

529
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, that is so incredible.

530
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,660
They do taste so good though, but they might as well just be canned smoothies.

531
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,620
Like the ones that have like fucking marshmallow and shit in them.

532
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,660
This has like a list of like seven different fruit it's supposed to taste like.

533
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,940
When I'm drinking beer, the only marshmallow I want involved is going to be on the radio

534
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,740
and I'm dancing in my car, right?

535
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,580
- Yeah, that's right.

536
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
- While I drink the beer.

537
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,260
- That's what's up.

538
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,820
- You're dancing in your car?

539
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,740
- While I drink.

540
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,800
I'm gonna take one sip of this Russia beer.

541
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,460
- Yeah, just take a five second sip.

542
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,660
- Oh!

543
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,540
(laughing)

544
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,500
- That's a ghost.

545
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,900
- Oh God, man.

546
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,100
- It looks entirely like piss.

547
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,260
- It's been 24 minutes and you are now

548
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:37,460
disgusted by two beers. You know what, I'm gonna go back to the first one. That one is

549
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,420
just not... you know I like this... the thing has been beer is really so bad after it's

550
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,500
been sitting for 20 minutes. That's why beer is so fun to drink a hundred of very fast.

551
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,940
Yeah, you gotta just keep it going. You're gonna have to speed up on drinking spoiled

552
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:59,140
beer. Look at me man, I got... I've been working my way through this bad boy. I'm like here,

553
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:05,780
halfway through. Yeah, we should be about halfway through at this point. 25 minutes in. I think

554
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:12,280
this beer is completely poisoned. And now it's incredibly dark. You could go get another beer.

555
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,200
Tell me about this mango cart, or melon cart that you just got. And also, well I guess

556
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,800
you won't want to pop it open yet, but I'm going to want to hear your thoughts on it.

557
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,300
I'll get there, I'll have to really power through this sour. The thing is, dude, those

558
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,880
Sours and the thing those are the only beers that if you put them in the fridge. They're exactly the same tomorrow

559
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,180
Yeah, you know so you don't feel pressure to finish the

560
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,300
15,000 calorie sour beer at any given point I

561
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,560
Kind of like it. I kind of like the feeling that I'm like pregnant at the moment with a beautiful. Yeah

562
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:51,440
What uh what's the first beer that you ever motherfucking had Bud Light

563
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,500
What was yours I

564
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,380
I think mine was probably a PBR.

565
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,140
How old were you?

566
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,820
Man, I was probably 14.

567
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,060
Yeah.

568
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,820
I was 14 or 15, something like that.

569
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,660
I was definitely like 11, 12, drinking my dad's Bud Light.

570
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,060
Yeah, my dad didn't, my dad was a gin drinker.

571
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,340
So he never had beer in the house and gin was too scary to me.

572
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,540
But I, but my first time, you know, I would have beer every once in a while

573
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,900
when I was like 14 or whatever. But my first time really drinking probably I was probably 16

574
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:38,780
and I poured I like raided my mom's liquor cabinet one night with my buddy and my mom

575
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:49,420
real classy lady she had uh Hennessy and uh Svedka vodka and I poured a so I'd never had

576
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:56,700
hard liquor before and I poured a solo cup with half Hennessy, half vodka with no mixer

577
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,300
and I held my nose and I chugged the entire thing. I was like, "That's what you're

578
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,620
supposed to do?" Yup. Yup. I mean, I probably had fucking my first time ever really drinking.

579
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:13,500
It was the equivalent of like 12 shots of fucking everything in 90 seconds. Yeah. And

580
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,740
I just completely it tasted so I remember it it put me off a liquor for a long time

581
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:28,220
it tasted so so bad and I was completely I blacked out almost instantly yeah I'm

582
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,620
ever blacked out and I woke up when I woke up I when I like came to I was

583
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:41,020
running down the road and it was like pouring rain on me and that and then it

584
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,180
just kind of back and forth. And then I just remember like that being the first

585
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,100
time I was ever hungover. And having to like, when you're 16, having to

586
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,340
explain to your mom why you feel like the the hangover of a grown man who just

587
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,220
had like the craziest night of his entire life. Yeah. Like I would never, I've

588
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:08,580
never had 12 shots of anything since then. Yeah. It was pretty hard. I, so my dad,

589
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,940
classy man that he is only had two types of liquor in his house crown royal

590
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:21,900
fuck yes and Jägermeister. I thought you were going to say crown royal and crown apple.

591
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:29,380
He's a crown maple man now. Damn. Crown royal is good. And I remember one time

592
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,340
there's some maybe was like a funeral or something we came home and it's for one

593
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:40,940
of his friends and he gave us all these shots of Jägermeister and he poured like a ghost

594
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:48,060
shot right and I shit you not the shot like just started to move on its own.

595
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,300
It's like a very vivid memory of a shot glass moving to the edge of the counter and then

596
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,180
just like stopping.

597
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,380
So your dad did a magic trick to you and freaked you out for life.

598
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
Yeah.

599
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Do you guys believe in ghosts?

600
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Yes.

601
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,780
Jimmy is Mexican so he definitely believes in ghosts.

602
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Oh 100%.

603
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,180
- He puts the egg to his forehead before he goes to bed.

604
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,020
- I put the egg to my forehead and sometimes when-

605
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,700
- All Mexicans believe in ghosts, right?

606
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,020
- Sometimes when it gets, yes,

607
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,980
sometimes when it gets cold, I hear like a, like a,

608
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,820
ooh. - Ooh.

609
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,640
(laughing)

610
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,220
- And some may think that that's just the wind blowing,

611
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,680
but I think it's a ghost.

612
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,860
(laughing)

613
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,060
- Let me in, it's cold outside.

614
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,300
- Running through the air into my apartment.

615
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,260
- Ooh, I need a hoodie.

616
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,100
- Yeah.

617
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,540
- He's whispering that he's cold

618
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,260
- There's a crack in the window.

619
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,100
- Yeah.

620
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,580
- Yeah, Ghost Google doesn't have the weather yet.

621
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,060
- I mean, that happened today to me.

622
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,100
- You had a ghost? - In broad daylight.

623
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,460
I had a ghost sighting in broad daylight.

624
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,900
I was walking around my apartment

625
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,180
and I heard him speak to me.

626
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,420
- What'd he say?

627
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,260
- He said, "Ooh."

628
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,140
'Cause I don't know, that's not the only thing

629
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,580
he says to me.

630
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,420
- Yeah.

631
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,900
- And what did you record? - Kind of food, actually.

632
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,860
I just said, "I'm pretty busy right now, buddy."

633
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,180
- Hey, I have a podcast to record.

634
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Can you wait like an hour?

635
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:08,420
Yeah, take it up to somebody else. I'm filling my new fridge with beers that I can't plug

636
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,460
in yet because it just moves. The beers are getting hot in the hot fridge.

637
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,660
Oh yeah, your beer is in the middle of the living room or your fridge is in the middle

638
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
of the living room.

639
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
We don't have to go into where it is.

640
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,940
It's in the middle of the living room. I was explaining, I tried to explain to him over

641
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,020
text like he was like, "Oh yeah, I have to leave it there until it settles or something,"

642
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
which made no sense to me.

643
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
It doesn't make sense.

644
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,180
It doesn't make sense. What do you mean it settles? Yeah, have you guys never moved a fridge before?

645
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,720
No, I'm not a millionaire

646
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,900
Billionaire who buys for ages willy-nilly. Yeah, I've never bought a fridge in my life

647
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,180
The compressor has like oil in it

648
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,360
So you have to let it sit for a little bit for as long as it's that's in movie. You have to let it sit

649
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:55,600
But it can't sit at the place that it's supposed to go as to sit. Yeah the room. Yeah, I can't be one again

650
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,900
Well, I have to watch it. You have to watch it for what is it gonna?

651
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
leak the ghosts might

652
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,180
Yeah, they might leak or the ghost might take it. The ghost probably tried to drink your beer and that's why it tastes stinky

653
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,300
You have a cursed beer yeah that

654
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:18,880
Reminds me of the the pirates of the Caribbean where he drinks the beer that said he like has to crack open the top

655
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Cuz it's got barnacles all over it. Yeah

656
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,260
Yeah, that reminds me of that. You know, you have the ghost death beer

657
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,700
Yeah, yes, I don't think I want to finish this beer. I think I'm gonna make you one you're one sip in man

658
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,660
Yeah, this podcast is supposed to be we're supposed to be fucked up by the end of this show. I know and you're

659
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,500
truceps

660
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,600
Yes, dude, look at me with my Polish beer, bro. I'm ready to watch soccer. Yeah

661
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,780
Fan of a soccer team

662
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,380
Yeah, I think that you know I'm getting you your shit kicked in if you went to a footy game with your

663
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,300
with your little beard filled with skittles.

664
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,980
Yeah, I would look exactly like that guy that got hit in the head at the hockey game.

665
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,100
I would love to die at a sporting event as a man.

666
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
That would be like, I think...

667
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,660
I could take you guys to a footy match.

668
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,220
We could go to the Lucha Libre in Mexico City.

669
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,220
That's the...

670
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,220
That's wrestling, right?

671
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
That's wrestling.

672
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Yeah.

673
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,060
That's WWE for, you know, you guys.

674
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,300
No, it's called Lucha Libre.

675
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,340
Do they hit each other for real or is it fake?

676
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,840
I mean...

677
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
Uh, yeah, they kill each other in the ring.

678
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,180
Oh, okay, well that's cool.

679
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,140
Do you think that they would have any room for some kind of white hero?

680
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
[laughs]

681
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,820
Uh, I said, like a...

682
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,820
Like a white hero character that just comes into the show?

683
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,000
Maybe like an unplanned...

684
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,980
Do you think that... How would they respond to an unplanned white hero who walked in and just sort of...

685
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,660
Just actually kicking the shit out of every single one of those fucking fuckers?

686
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:56,340
Because what, the biggest wrestler in the Mexican WWE is like fucking 5'5", right?

687
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,460
I walk in and I just start just pounding the shit out of him.

688
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,300
Yeah, for a guy that's your same height.

689
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Yeah.

690
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,260
Sorry, the audio keeps cutting in and out.

691
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,740
I'm not really hearing you very well.

692
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,620
It kind of sucks that, you know, because Mexicans are pretty short, but we're talking to literally

693
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,980
a guy that's like four inches taller than both of us.

694
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,060
Yeah, I would say it's probably one of the worst things in my life.

695
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,160
Is that Jubio is so much taller than me.

696
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,660
Yeah, it like genuinely is a little frustrating.

697
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,360
Yeah, dude, I always wanted him to be so small, you know?

698
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Yeah.

699
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,980
But he's such a giant, he's a gentle giant.

700
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Yeah.

701
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,580
People think I have small guy energy.

702
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,580
I wouldn't say that.

703
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,060
I think that you have, I think that it's the complete opposite.

704
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:48,340
I think that you have a, you're kind of cool, calm, and collected in a way that only a very

705
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,660
tall man can be.

706
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,900
Yeah, I would agree with that.

707
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
That's really nice of you guys.

708
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:00,740
Anyways, I keep digging into this thing and it's releasing a smell that's too bad to bear.

709
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,100
So explain what you're digging into.

710
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,380
I don't think we really, there's a goo coming off of the underside of the beer cap.

711
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,180
Yeah, the beer cap, I'm scratching it and it's releasing a terrible smell that's

712
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,620
That's almost ghastly in nature. Oh my god

713
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,660
You can't drink that you're gonna get sick. Yeah, don't drink that beer

714
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,780
I don't think I'm gonna keep drinking that beer anymore your first thing

715
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:30,100
That is so sad that your first beer for the only time when the beer that you drink really means anything. Yeah

716
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,180
It's your first one. It was a

717
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,500
Catastrophic dud. Yeah, that's really unfortunate

718
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,980
I feel so fucked up.

719
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,300
That's like telling someone to break a leg, you know, for a play.

720
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Drink a bad beer before your podcast.

721
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,900
GBA, you ever do, you ever do, uh...

722
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,700
Hey, drink a bad beer before your beer podcast.

723
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,740
Yeah, I hope your beer sucks.

724
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,100
Yeah, yeah, drink a bad beer.

725
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,100
That's like, that's like Google saying.

726
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I think I've heard it before.

727
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,100
We have to start, we're gonna start seeing each other before we record.

728
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,100
Yeah drink a bad beer.

729
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,700
Yeah I hope your beer sucks and it's been infected by ghosts.

730
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,860
Yeah I hope you have infected fucking ghastly ecto beer.

731
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,660
I think you might be a beer genius Rex.

732
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,060
I need to start believing in ghosts pretty soon.

733
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,060
I think I'm getting to the age where.

734
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,420
You don't believe in ghosts?

735
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,500
It's crazy to me that you don't.

736
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:35,340
your experiences and family. No, I believe that there's people that, every

737
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,060
once in a while I will believe there's people living in my house and I look for them. But

738
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,620
I don't believe in ghosts though. I always think that.

739
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,340
You live in the city that's most likely to have ghosts.

740
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:51,120
But if I hear like a weird creaking or something, my instinct is not there's a ghastly spirit.

741
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,900
My instinct is there is a crackhead maniac living in my closet.

742
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,740
that to me even though it probably makes less sense than a ghost that's what I

743
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:08,180
jumped to mm-hmm do you ever get afraid to like look into a mirror or like look

744
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:18,940
into a like a glass look through some glass like a window perhaps no no here

745
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,780
you're a dog.

746
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:26,460
Yeah. What do you mean? What if there's a ghost behind you? What

747
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,340
if there's a ghost?

748
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:34,700
Okay, you're expecting a fully like the James Wan movie that

749
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,580
there's gonna you're gonna close the vanity and there will be a

750
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
Civil War generals.

751
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:46,580
When it's like 3am and you're like, there's 3am and I and I

752
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,980
called the blue Grinch, you expect him right behind you.

753
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,820
- Absolutely.

754
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,220
- Herobrine is gonna be sitting behind you in a mirror.

755
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,460
- He came out of Minecraft.

756
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,820
- Yeah, well, you know, the secret is to like,

757
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,820
not have any mirrors in your house at all.

758
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
- But then people who come over to your house

759
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,340
will just assume you're ugly.

760
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:11,540
- Yeah, which they already know in your case.

761
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,900
I'm just kidding, I'm sorry, that was.

762
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,740
- Well, or at least they won't,

763
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,380
Maybe they haven't noticed, right?

764
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,980
But then they go over to your house

765
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,300
and then they're like, "That's weird.

766
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,340
"This guy doesn't have any mirrors in his entire home."

767
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,180
- What if you're trying to save them?

768
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,540
- Oh my God, he's as ugly as shit.

769
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,180
- What if, no, I think that would be,

770
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,020
that makes no sense.

771
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,980
They would call it a thing.

772
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,820
- That's actually a better point.

773
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,980
- That I'm a vampire.

774
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,940
- If you went over to somebody's house

775
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:37,580
and you noticed that there was like a dust outline

776
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,260
where a bunch of different mirrors had been

777
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,100
that they clearly took off before you got there.

778
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,980
- You'd be like, "Hey, what's up?"

779
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,160
- I would assume, I'd be like,

780
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,080
Oh, they don't like they can barely handle one of me like they don't I'm so ugly right? Yeah

781
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:58,280
They don't want me to someone says my teeth if I want to work someone's house and they have no mirror

782
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
So what if some they're a vampire?

783
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,680
You also believe in

784
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
This is what we're looking for dude.

785
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Dude, I am so fucked up and I've never felt closer to two people in my entire life.

786
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
I know.

787
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm so fucked up.

788
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
I'm about to fall.

789
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,680
I've had one full Polish beer and I'm about an eighth through my Russian beer and I'm about to fall over.

790
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,680
Yeah.

791
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Uh-huh.

792
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,680
And I can't see straight.

793
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Well, what do you go?

794
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Go take a load off in that bed of yours.

795
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
My microphone won't fit.

796
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah.

797
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
See?

798
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:50,120
It won't reach. My microphone won't fit in my bed. Guys, we're seriously drunk AF, dude.

799
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,840
Oh my God. You realize how excited people have been for this podcast? I've had so many

800
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,320
incredibly high up people in the radio broadcasting world reach out to me and tell me, "When

801
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,280
is 'Beers We Drank' going to come out? When is it going to come out? You've been teasing

802
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,560
it for a year and we're finally doing it." How amazing does that feel to accomplish something

803
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,640
like that. It feels amazing. I never thought I would return to the microphone.

804
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,080
Did you used to pick up the fucking stick? I did, I did back in

805
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,680
five years ago, man. What was your podcast about? I was a

806
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,160
recurring guest on a podcast called Girls Chat, which don't think too much

807
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:38,280
about that. Wait, Girls Chat? Hmm. So this is a podcast with guys on it and it's a

808
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,680
joke I'm guessing. Sure, let's say that. Okay. That's the only way that I'm gonna let you

809
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,160
slide on that one. Exactly. I'm not too convinced, but we can go ahead with the story. Yeah. There's

810
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,040
no story. There's nothing to talk about there. Nothing interesting happened. Your recurring

811
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:01,000
guess, would you say that you occupied sort of a whack pack sort of spot on the... Yeah. I was

812
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,480
kind of like the Kramer. I'd be in there for the sea plots. Ah, but you're also the funniest one.

813
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,520
Well, right only guy on the show. Come on. Exactly. Yeah, it's that simple me and rex were talking about last day and night who

814
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,900
We are in the unlike the time for characters and we I think we decided that he might be seinfeld

815
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:26,840
No, no for that one

816
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,080
Not for that reason

817
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,240
Well, I do I I do like to complain and I think I sound a bit

818
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,920
like him while I'm complaining. That's what you just, that's what I just said. I know, I know.

819
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,520
I know I'm trying to make it so it's not anti-semitic when you say it.

820
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,600
No, you don't have to do that for me. I'm fine with it. Okay. I've made my peace, yeah. I have

821
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,240
my thing which is that every person is like some amalgamation of every Seinfeld character.

822
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:03,960
you know you're like 40 percent George 20 percent Seinfeld in Jubio's case he's 100 percent Elaine

823
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:12,360
Elaine with a with a lane with a uh Lola Bunny t-shirt

824
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:22,200
no that's not true that's cool that's not even really true i like this theory i like that you've

825
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:30,760
just like rediscovered the like Joseph Campbell like myth thing just with like

826
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,000
Seinfeld I don't know the Joseph Campbell myth thing just that like every story

827
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,280
has like fucking five people in it yeah that's true yeah yeah I think that's

828
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,920
good I think every good group of people is every people like like oh you are

829
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:59,980
high on beer. Your beer gland is working overtime. Whoa, I'm so fucking drunk, man. I'm seeing

830
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:04,480
a purple elephant in my room. Fuck, I'm tripping off beer.

831
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,880
Right, let him finish. Let him finish. Go ahead. Finish your thought.

832
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:15,740
Like a truly good story about multiple characters. They make up the fundamental archetypes of

833
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:22,460
every kind of person. Yeah, so like I understand comparing yourself and your

834
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,380
friends to Seinfeld because that's basically an astrology kind of thing.

835
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,540
Sure. But what what is another what's another uh story that has exactly all

836
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,980
the Seinfeld characters in it? Yeah, probably Curb Your Enthusiasm.

837
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:45,420
Yeah, you might be right. It's all just Seinfeld. South Park. You know, I've maybe seen

838
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,420
Okay, South Park, who's Jerry?

839
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,420
Uh, that's uh, Jerry is Stan.

840
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Uh, Kramer is Cartman.

841
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,420
No, I think Cartman is George.

842
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,420
No, Kyle is George.

843
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,420
But Cartman always has the problem going on.

844
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,420
That would be my argument.

845
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Okay, I can see that.

846
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Wouldn't Kenny be Kramer?

847
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Kenny is a lame.

848
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Hmm.

849
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,420
He matters the least.

850
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Yeah, he's a bitch.

851
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,420
No, I guess Kenny maybe is Kramer.

852
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Kenny is Kramer.

853
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
Can we just pause to appreciate how advanced this shit is?

854
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
I know, we're on another level.

855
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,420
This is not something that we could ever talk about on the main podcast, right?

856
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,420
But I come out here and we're getting crazy.

857
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,420
Episode 1.

858
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
Seinfeld and South Park are the same show.

859
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
You know, this is some game-changing shit.

860
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
What's this yellow beer about?

861
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,420
What are you talking about?

862
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Yellow beer?

863
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Are you stupid?

864
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,420
It's green.

865
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Listen for the yellow.

866
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,920
This guy had, this guy was drinking pure penicillin and now he's having a, uh, being attacked

867
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,340
by some kind of biotic.

868
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,580
He's gonna go blind by the time this episode ends.

869
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,780
Yeah, you're done dude.

870
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,340
Like I saw that shit that you drank.

871
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
That was fucked.

872
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,540
I have an announcement to make.

873
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,100
I'm quitting beer.

874
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:10,980
Alright, well, podcast is completely, you, you, you, you whiffed it then.

875
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,940
You know, I've only seen maybe two episodes of Seinfeld though.

876
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,940
I need to go.

877
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,940
It's on Netflix now.

878
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,940
I need to watch it.

879
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,940
It's great.

880
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,340
Yeah, but every time that I think about watching Seinfeld, I'm just like, "Man, Curb is so

881
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,820
funny and I go and watch Curb."

882
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:31,220
Because Seinfeld, there is something we said for a TV show being able to use the F word.

883
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,300
Yeah.

884
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,300
It's going to be a little funnier.

885
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,820
Okay, so I will say, speaking of the F word, and maybe not the same F word you're thinking

886
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,420
of. When's the last time you watched Glenn Gary Glenn Ross? I've only seen it once

887
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,940
and I was maybe 15 and I decided this is exactly how I will live my life.

888
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:52,900
Alec Baldwin calls them all F words in his famous coffee is for closers speech

889
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,700
and it like just a little bit reintroduced it into my vocabulary for

890
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:12,540
like a day. Yeah, probably the past 24 hours means a bit. Just a little bit. Yeah, I would

891
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,500
say that you should never watch Django then, because that would be pretty catastrophic for

892
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:25,740
you. Or the boondocks, my god. My god. It took years to unlearn the damage that the boondocks

893
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,220
Dude, I found out some fucked up shit about Pulp Fiction.

894
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,620
You know that in Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino didn't write the entire thing?

895
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Really?

896
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Who wrote it?

897
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,300
Yeah, the lat- there's some other guy named like Roger Avery or some shit and he wrote

898
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,340
the whole Bruce Willis storyline.

899
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:50,340
And he like, his agent like sued Quentin Tarantino or something because they wrote it together.

900
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,040
They like wrote the movie as like three different like individual stories.

901
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,280
that Quentin Tarantino wanted so badly to have at the beginning of the movie, a film by Quentin

902
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,260
Tarantino written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, that he had to pay this guy a huge

903
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,200
cash settlement basically.

904
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,400
But the guy also got the Oscar for best screenplay.

905
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,080
They shared it.

906
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,080
Interesting.

907
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
Yeah.

908
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
That's crazy.

909
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,440
That's astrid.

910
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,400
Quentin Tarantino, I've been watching all of his movies again.

911
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
They, dude it's kind of crazy how good they are.

912
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
They're so good, man.

913
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
They're so good.

914
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,920
What is the obsession with people like kind of shitting on these great movies?

915
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Because it's...

916
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,920
I feel like it's like they think it's like entry-level like filmography, like getting into like movies, right?

917
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
Yeah, but that's stupid.

918
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
The best music ever made is fucking Halsey, you know?

919
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,920
It's the exact same concept.

920
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Yeah.

921
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,920
You ever listen to the Chainsmokers?

922
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
That's the best shit.

923
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
It's fucking unreal, dude.

924
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Yeah.

925
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,860
What the fuck it's amazing. Yeah. Mm-hmm and Pulp Fiction

926
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,700
I feel like or Quentin Tarantino as a whole gets a bad rap. Yeah, it's like how people shit on Fight Club

927
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,920
It's like cuz when you're 14 you first learn about stuff

928
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,340
That's not just on TV or not on the radio

929
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,960
And then everyone loves it too much and they have to like walk it back because you don't want to be seen as like a perpetual

930
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,220
15 year old

931
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,980
So then you have to pretend to like shit like Skeena Mareink or whatever fucking stupid

932
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,900
You don't like Fight Club. It gives me a stomachache. It's too much violence in it. Yeah

933
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,340
Okay, I'm not kidding. I can't watch movies with that much violence in them because I get a stomachache

934
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:37,820
I've never seen it. You've been watching Quentin Tarantino movies. They're hella violent.

935
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,220
Yeah, but those are, you know, those are like funny violent. Yeah, they're silly

936
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,180
Yeah, fight club is like, you know, I think you know what it is man. It's that pure just a

937
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:55,280
I hate I just hate that that miss misanthropic

938
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:04,120
Nihilistic BS and fight club, right it's lame. Yeah, you know, I watched Tarantino movies and I say

939
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:10,100
Okay, so it's awesome to be fucking to like the coolest thing in the world to me when I was a kid

940
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:16,340
It's like what if a black guy knew karate, you know, and that's purely all Wu-Tang and Quentin Tarantino

941
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,740
Right. Got it. Yeah

942
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,540
Wu-Tang was definitely the coolest guys to probably ever

943
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,800
Exist. They're number one dude. For sure

944
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,720
They're so good. I've been I've been listening to a bunch of like

945
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:38,400
Old rap recently and I can't believe that I ever kind of stopped. It's just the best. It's the funniest stuff ever made

946
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:46,100
Do you remember the first time you heard the RZA's verse on the Kanye West so appalled or is it so appalled?

947
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,380
I forget which one it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and he's just screaming. He's just like

948
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,560
It's like the entire day. It's like he's coughing the entire time

949
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:13,780
And you're like what happened to this guy this guy used to be sit used to sit in a flooded basement and make the greatest songs

950
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,820
At all time and now he's coughing through a chorus on a Kanye track. Yeah, and it's awesome. It's still cool

951
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,820
It's really it's really good

952
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,560
Yeah, and they made to he made to kung fu movies that are pretty good

953
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,840
Yeah, man with the iron fist wanted to pretty cool. What do you guys think about the Kanye's?

954
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,540
reputation with the mainstream media nowadays.

955
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,660
You know what, I'm going to leave this one to Rex.

956
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,900
I think he's still good.

957
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,940
Well, you heard it.

958
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,900
We fully support him.

959
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,300
It would be very hypocritical of me to abandon someone for saying

960
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,940
they love Hitler because I would just have to

961
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,940
unfollow everyone on Twitter.

962
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,980
It is so funny

963
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,900
how many people he

964
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,540
reached out to

965
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:09,220
to like in the last year, like how many comedians that he reached out to saying like, "Hey man,

966
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,220
you should come work for me."

967
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,220
Really?

968
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,220
That is so funny.

969
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,300
Yeah, yeah.

970
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,940
He like, he reached out to Shane.

971
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:22,140
He like texted Shane and was like, "Yo, you should come write for me."

972
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,140
And a couple other people too.

973
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,380
Everybody has to say no, I think for pretty obvious reasons.

974
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,380
Of course.

975
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,700
But I, and I would say no too, but a little bit,

976
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,500
I was like, come on, shoot me a text.

977
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,040
- Right, it hurts not to even be asked.

978
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,880
- Yeah, right?

979
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,940
- Right for what?

980
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,340
- Maybe you're too PC, maybe he doesn't--

981
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,140
- I think I am too PC.

982
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,480
I think I need to buck my,

983
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,100
I need to become a, I need to get into whatever thing

984
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,740
that Steven Crowder does.

985
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,380
'Cause the fact that he was offered $50 million,

986
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,220
I've been thinking about it for like a full month.

987
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,060
- Yeah.

988
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,540
- It's like the craziest thing I've ever heard.

989
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,540
And he sucks.

990
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,540
More than Rogan.

991
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,540
Yeah.

992
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,940
That's so awesome.

993
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,020
Where does that money come from?

994
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,780
Well, I do give a lot of money to Daily Wire.

995
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
And I gotta stuff.

996
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,780
Me too.

997
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,260
I wouldn't say I give 50 million, but I give a 50th of that.

998
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,260
And I need to stuff.

999
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah.

1000
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,260
A millionth of that.

1001
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
A millionth.

1002
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,260
Yeah.

1003
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,780
Rogan makes sense, you know?

1004
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,300
People everywhere, stupid guys everywhere listen to Rogan.

1005
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,300
And smart.

1006
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
And smart guys.

1007
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:36,260
Smart, very smart guys. Sorry, I should have prefaced that. But, you know, at least that

1008
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:43,600
makes sense how much money he gets. He deserves it even, I would say. Yeah, I mean

1009
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,940
he's the hardest working man in Austin. They've been saying that for some time

1010
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:54,380
now. I think it should be our first guest. I would love to talk to him. I would do

1011
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:02,020
anything yeah to have him held hostage in a saw situation I would do fucking

1012
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:09,500
anything did you could do even custom traps just for him yeah right yeah like

1013
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,580
cuz you know he's not flexible so it'd be just simple stuff like touch your

1014
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:18,180
toes you know yeah do a hundred push-ups yeah just like to like fear factor shit

1015
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:36,260
to

1016
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,100
- Yeah.

1017
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,060
- Do you think you and him share a special bond?

1018
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,140
- Because of bald?

1019
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,980
Or his baldness and mine, and my upcoming baldness?

1020
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,820
I'm not bald yet.

1021
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:53,740
- I was thinking more like you're both are.

1022
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,600
- You think of me as a Rogan type?

1023
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,060
- Yeah.

1024
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,740
Like a Red Ranger type of deal, you know?

1025
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,300
Like a leader of industry.

1026
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,140
- Oh, that's funny.

1027
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,980
I think of you as like, you remember Jeff Dunham had a Jose the Jalapeño on a stick.

1028
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:17,300
You're like kind of a miniature version, like a lesser version of Jose the Jalapeño on

1029
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,300
a stick.

1030
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Yeah, we need to get you a hat.

1031
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,540
That type of thing.

1032
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,540
We do.

1033
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:22,540
Not just any hat.

1034
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,540
A sombrero.

1035
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,540
A sombrero.

1036
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:31,140
For my wedding, for my wedding, will you walk around with a sombrero with guac in the middle

1037
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
and chips around the room.

1038
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,140
[laughter]

1039
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,140
Um...

1040
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,140
Please.

1041
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,140
Okay.

1042
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,140
Yeah, everyone would be so confused when you're part of it.

1043
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,540
Exactly, especially because you're taller than every single person there, so nobody

1044
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,140
will even see the guac and chips.

1045
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,140
[laughter]

1046
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,340
You'll just be walking around with the guac that will fully just turn brown on the top

1047
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,340
of your head.

1048
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
[laughter]

1049
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,340
I mean, I'll do it.

1050
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,340
That's beautiful.

1051
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,340
I'll completely do it.

1052
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,340
That's crazy.

1053
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:12,380
Will you do the same with a bunch of money on your hand?

1054
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,380
I'm going to give you the money, Yamaka.

1055
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,780
I'm going to put it on you ceremonially.

1056
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
That'd be amazing.

1057
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:21,620
You know I converted to Judaism for some time.

1058
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,620
Really?

1059
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,620
Have I ever told you that?

1060
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,620
No.

1061
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,660
I converted to Judaism for about six months.

1062
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,060
What happened?

1063
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,500
This fucking Jewish bitch I was with broke up with me.

1064
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,860
What a hoe, I hate that, I'm sorry.

1065
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,100
No she was a nice lady.

1066
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,820
But I got into, I started going to temple with her and I was like, okay, I was like

1067
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,980
15, I was like okay Judaism is fucking amazing, they're blowing us so far, it's like way

1068
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,020
more fun than like church.

1069
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,100
She had a dope ass temple too, people like jumping around and dancing and shit, it was

1070
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,100
sick.

1071
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,480
Then I went home to my mom and I was like, "Mom, I'm a Jew."

1072
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,660
And she was like, "I don't think that you're Jewish."

1073
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:13,420
And then I started delusionally thinking that my family, that I was actually Jewish, genetically

1074
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,380
Jewish, where I would grill my grandma.

1075
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:22,120
I'd be like, "So, Grandpa's Italian, but a lot of the times people would lie about that

1076
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,500
kind of stuff when they come to the US, right?"

1077
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
She was like, "No, he's Italian."

1078
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,980
and I'd be like, "But some people would lie."

1079
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,620
She'd be like, "Yeah, but I don't think..."

1080
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,700
And I'd be like, "But some people would lie, right?"

1081
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,540
And eventually she'd be like,

1082
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,980
"Yeah, I guess some people would lie."

1083
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,300
And then I'd go around and be like,

1084
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,500
"Guys, I'm an eighth Jewish.

1085
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,500
I'm completely Jewish, but I'm not at all."

1086
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,620
But I really did want to be,

1087
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,540
and I enjoyed my time in the Jewish faith.

1088
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,900
But the reality is, man, the book is too big.

1089
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,060
- It is too big.

1090
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,100
Do you want to break a glass at your wedding?

1091
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,020
The weddings are also Christmas.

1092
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:01,580
I can't miss out on Christmas, man.

1093
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:05,220
The actual reality is that Hanukkah is a piece of shit holiday.

1094
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,220
It's so bad.

1095
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,780
We have completely stopped celebrating Hanukkah in my family.

1096
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
Yeah, there's no reason.

1097
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,780
It's just Christmas now.

1098
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,500
Do you get more gifts because it's like a thousand days?

1099
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,380
Here's what I would like to do.

1100
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,160
It's Jewish, so the gifts are like socks for one of the days.

1101
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,060
Now hold on, what do you mean by that?

1102
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,560
- Well, okay, so--

1103
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,600
- Yeah, what do you mean by that?

1104
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,660
- When you're a kid and you do Hanukkah,

1105
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,160
your parents are Jewish.

1106
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,520
So they-- - Right.

1107
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,800
- The gifts-- - So what, fucking

1108
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,360
incredibly high IQ and creative,

1109
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,960
they dominate the creative field?

1110
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,760
- Right, and the financial one.

1111
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,520
And they do so by giving-- - Whoa, wait, listen!

1112
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,120
(laughing)

1113
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,720
That's crazy, okay?

1114
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:57,060
I'll admit that they have an amazing record for producing artists, successful artists.

1115
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,520
But I'll stop there.

1116
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Okay?

1117
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,120
That's very wise of you.

1118
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
Yes.

1119
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,520
You're treading on thin ice.

1120
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,740
But you know what would help?

1121
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,760
Maybe some socks for Hanukkah that would keep you warm while you're treading on thin ice.

1122
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,240
That's a good point.

1123
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,360
The thing is, dude, I get socks every Christmas and I love it.

1124
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360
Yeah.

1125
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,000
Because I'm a grateful Christian.

1126
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,920
Right. I'm not saying that socks aren't a great gift. It sucked when I stopped getting them.

1127
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,440
When was the last time you bought socks? You just wait until the holidays every year and then you

1128
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:38,480
get them. I buy them every month now because I just lose them. What the fuck is- no. That is not

1129
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:46,080
true. You don't do your laundry. I know that kind of guy. The only reason to buy socks every month

1130
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,800
is because you'll wear them three times and they'll be completely black and you'll throw

1131
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
them away.

1132
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,720
Alright, a little guilty of sharts there.

1133
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:01,160
But I did laundry and I have only like four complete pairs left.

1134
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,800
Oh yeah.

1135
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,480
Yeah, you got some kind of fucking borrower situation.

1136
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,480
Yeah.

1137
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,480
Yeah.

1138
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,640
I just wear whatever.

1139
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,640
Or hear me out, it's the ghost sock.

1140
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,640
The sock ghost.

1141
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:20,680
It's a ghost that steals your socks.

1142
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,840
I think I'm just bad at taking things out of the dryer.

1143
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:27,520
I think that's just something I'm not very good at.

1144
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,680
You're forgetting them, you're not checking the crust.

1145
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Right.

1146
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1147
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,680
I'm in a rush.

1148
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
Yeah.

1149
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:42,840
Yeah, I guess I pretty much lose something every- I always lose.

1150
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,560
My wife always tells me the one thing where she's like,

1151
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,320
when you do laundry, make sure that this delicate piece

1152
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,000
of whatever, this shirt or this sweater,

1153
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,500
make sure that you take this out halfway through

1154
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,120
and you take good care of it.

1155
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,000
It's a prized possession of mine.

1156
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,800
And every single time I do laundry,

1157
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,640
- Forget.

1158
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,920
- I just, I don't even forget it, I lose it.

1159
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,180
Whatever it is, not only do I not take care of it

1160
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,360
the way that she wanted me to,

1161
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,080
I always just completely lose it.

1162
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,520
And then she's across the street asking people

1163
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,840
who speak no English to go through their laundry

1164
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,020
to see if a shirt that she likes is in there.

1165
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,540
I'm terrible at laundry.

1166
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,380
- Yeah.

1167
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,560
I just got a hoodie that I bought on Grailed

1168
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,560
and it came from, let's say, a very Chinese part of Canada.

1169
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,640
- Let me guess, OVO hoodie.

1170
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,720
- No.

1171
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,560
- Okay.

1172
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,800
and it smells so much like a grape swisher

1173
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,700
that I can't wear it.

1174
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,600
- That's amazing.

1175
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,880
Why would you not want to wear it, man?

1176
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,240
That's a pheromone.

1177
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,080
You're gonna be picking up some of the hottest women on earth

1178
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,440
smelling like a grape swisher.

1179
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,280
- I know.

1180
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,000
- Is this the hoodie that you bought on accident?

1181
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,080
- Yeah, yeah, I didn't mean to buy it.

1182
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,360
I just asked him if he would ship to me

1183
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,960
and then he sent me an offer immediately.

1184
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,000
And I was like, wow, this would be rude to--

1185
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,880
- What's the hoodie?

1186
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,720
- It's just a--

1187
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,280
- Put it on.

1188
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,880
- Put it on right now.

1189
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:12,720
- No.

1190
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,160
- Put it on right, what does it say?

1191
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,000
- Put it on right now.

1192
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,820
- It doesn't say anything.

1193
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,680
It's just a black hoodie and gray.

1194
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,520
- It says the N word.

1195
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,400
- Why would it be the N word?

1196
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Why would I own an N word hoodie?

1197
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,920
That would be insane.

1198
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,880
- I could see you owning something like that.

1199
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,840
- No.

1200
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,640
- 'Cause of how crazy you are.

1201
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,720
- Like that six, nine outfit from like 20 years ago.

1202
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,960
(laughing)

1203
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,920
- What is the F word?

1204
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,760
- Pussy.

1205
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,580
- Just walk around like that.

1206
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,400
- Yeah, 69 on that thing.

1207
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,400
Dude, the fake off-white jersey.

1208
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,400
Yeah.

1209
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,400
That was sick.

1210
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Dude, you guys know that Noah used to wear like off-white, like fake off-white in high

1211
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,400
school?

1212
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,400
That makes perfect sense.

1213
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,400
He used to have like those exact shorts and he would wear those and he looked so sick,

1214
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
man.

1215
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,400
Pyrex?

1216
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,400
Yeah.

1217
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,400
You look so sleepy.

1218
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Me?

1219
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,400
Yeah.

1220
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
I am very sleepy, dude.

1221
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,640
I've had two beers in some fucking time.

1222
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,920
And these aren't just any beers, man.

1223
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,400
These are fucking straight from the war zone beer.

1224
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Yeah.

1225
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
And they're tearing me up.

1226
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,400
You're so pink and silly.

1227
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,800
That's because you're not, once you've found out that you're 100% Irish, you're not allowed

1228
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,960
to have any of the Eastern European beer.

1229
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,560
Okay, I'm actually 50% Irish.

1230
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,720
And I actually learned that I have a sensitivity to alcohol and caffeine as well, once I looked

1231
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,400
through the rest of my DNA.

1232
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,240
So I'm sure that you were very interested to hear about that.

1233
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,880
Yeah, I was very interested.

1234
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,480
I wanted to see what your face looked like.

1235
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,360
You're so pink.

1236
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,960
That's because I have night shift on, on my computer.

1237
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,960
Here, I'll turn it off and you'll see what I really look like.

1238
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,960
I'm just stark white.

1239
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,960
You got actual asian glow dude.

1240
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:43,960
You took one beer and you're ashamed.

1241
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:44,960
Yeah, you literally look like an anime character.

1242
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,960
Drawn on a white piece of paper.

1243
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
Alright, I'm turning it back on.

1244
01:00:46,960 --> 01:01:05,360
I need to do, I need to, we should go through as bonus content the rest of my, all my traits

1245
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,720
that I have on my 23andMe thing.

1246
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,160
Because some of them are very, very wrong, man.

1247
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,160
I'll tell you that much.

1248
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,920
There's one in particular that I was like, yeah, this is--

1249
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,680
Is there a way for you to contact them?

1250
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,200
Just be like, I think this is wrong.

1251
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,080
I think you're wrong.

1252
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,560
I'm actually--

1253
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,680
Excuse me.

1254
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,480
I think that I am West African.

1255
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,480
Can you please--

1256
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,200
Can you recheck?

1257
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,240
I think you got me mixed.

1258
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,280
I think you got my DNA mixed up.

1259
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,600
I think you got me mixed up with a white guy.

1260
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,600
Because this is not me.

1261
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,640
99.98% white guy.

1262
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,680
It's fine because if I did that it would just come out like 99.8 Ashkenazi Jew.

1263
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,000
Which would be just as embarrassing. Nobody broke the mold. Okay, get this one guys.

1264
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,840
Caleb, your genetics predict 82% chance that you do not have a bald spot.

1265
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,800
Whoa. 18% chance that you do have a bald spot. I would be so mad.

1266
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,760
Not me dude, I'm buying lottery tickets.

1267
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,280
You're one in a million.

1268
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,120
59% chance you will not experience hair loss or thinning before age 40.

1269
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,240
41% chance that you will.

1270
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,240
Get this one dude.

1271
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,960
3% chance of greenish blue eyes.

1272
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,800
3% chance of blue eyes.

1273
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
There you have.

1274
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,680
Oh my god, my beautiful blue eyes.

1275
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,680
Yeah.

1276
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,640
Jimmy, what color are your eyes?

1277
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,320
Oh, they're like poop.

1278
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,320
They're not like poop.

1279
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,320
Somebody told...

1280
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,320
Beautiful.

1281
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,400
They look like poop.

1282
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,400
I heard somebody say to somebody else the other day that they had beautiful eyes and I had

1283
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,080
never noticed this guy's eyes and I looked into them and they actually looked like they

1284
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,880
had the texture and color of pieces of poop.

1285
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:52,240
I told him, I was like, just so you know, that girl just wants to fuck you.

1286
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,080
You do not have pretty eyes.

1287
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,640
She's just trying to come up with anything she can come up with.

1288
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,840
I mean he's a good looking guy but she should have said like, "I want to suck your dick."

1289
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,640
But instead she was like, "You have beautiful eyes."

1290
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,640
And they were, like I said, not beautiful.

1291
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,640
Yeah.

1292
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,440
What color are your eyes, Rex?

1293
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,760
They're greenish gray.

1294
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,760
Greenish gray.

1295
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Yeah.

1296
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,760
And they change.

1297
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,320
They're probably really gray right now.

1298
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,320
And they change.

1299
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
They do change.

1300
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
They change.

1301
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,320
And they change.

1302
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,320
And I have a power that makes them change.

1303
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:34,800
Well, they change depending on my mood dude, no way no seriously and if I get drunk they get grayer

1304
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,160
Mmm, and if you said you think it's a yellow

1305
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,760
And if he's in love they're pink no, that's fucking stupid. Yeah, you're right if right if it's angry

1306
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,460
Okay, I'm not a fucking animate your abilities is filling free

1307
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:56,820
Yeah, yeah and blue if they're calm

1308
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:05,620
Well guys, tell me how, let's do a quick, here at the end, seems like we're about wrapping

1309
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:10,220
up, let's talk real quickly about, let's give a numerical score to the beers that we drank

1310
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,220
tonight.

1311
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,220
Sure.

1312
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,220
Because that's kind of the point of the show, right?

1313
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,220
The beers we drank.

1314
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,220
We drank them.

1315
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,220
Right.

1316
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,220
Right?

1317
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,620
Oh wait, actually I need to see, you have to take one sip of your melon cart.

1318
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,820
Are we reviewing the beers?

1319
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,900
Yeah dude, we're doing it.

1320
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,520
And by the way, this is a comedy club rule, there's a two drink minimum, Jubio.

1321
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,100
So for next time, keep that in mind.

1322
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,100
Okay.

1323
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,180
Oh, whoa.

1324
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,180
That's good, right?

1325
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:35,180
The melon cart?

1326
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,180
That's crazy.

1327
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,020
I like the melon cart.

1328
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:42,140
Tastes like someone dissolved a piece of a watermelon Jolly Rancher into water.

1329
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,020
Yeah, it's good.

1330
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,100
All right.

1331
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,940
So Zyvec, Z-Y-W-I-E-C.

1332
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:54,860
I'm gonna give this beer, like I said, I've had it before, I like it all right.

1333
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,420
I'm going to give this a 7.1.

1334
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,420
Okay?

1335
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,100
It's a pretty decent beer.

1336
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,060
For the price especially.

1337
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:07,220
Now this other fucking Russian piece of shit, this thing is a 5.6.

1338
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,220
If that.

1339
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:10,020
It might even be lower.

1340
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,340
This is a terrible beer.

1341
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:17,260
Do not recommend, let me see, Melnix Izbochanka.

1342
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,260
This is not a good beer.

1343
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,820
Do not pick that up.

1344
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,820
So yeah, that's about it.

1345
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:29,900
I think I would rate my Coast Beer a 666 because it's going to haunt me forever I feel.

1346
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,900
That's an incredibly high number for a...

1347
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,460
And I'm going to die.

1348
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,900
For an entirely fungal beer.

1349
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,980
It's plant based.

1350
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:46,180
This is a 450 North Brewing Slushy Machine 9 XXL.

1351
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,620
Wow.

1352
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:52,260
That is named exactly like a gas station sex pill.

1353
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,260
Yeah, honestly, like a solid eight, eight and a half.

1354
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,460
For a sour.

1355
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,260
For the price, like a two out of 10.

1356
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,820
It's 10 bucks?

1357
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,700
Yeah.

1358
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,540
Yeah, that's pretty crazy.

1359
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,380
Sheesh.

1360
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,860
Yeah.

1361
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:13,860
Melon cart, very highly rated, seven and a half out of 10.

1362
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,460
There we go.

1363
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,400
I don't know what it costs 'cause I stole it.

1364
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,540
For that, that's a 10 out of 10.

1365
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,860
I don't think they're that expensive.

1366
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:26,260
I think it might be $14.99 for a six pack or something like that.

1367
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,500
Two and a half bucks each, something like that.

1368
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,140
Well it was zero for me and that makes it the best beer in the world.

1369
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,140
Amen brother.

1370
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:34,140
That's right.

1371
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,140
Amen.

1372
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:47,860
Alright here it will play us out, Rage Against the Machine.

1373
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:50,580
That is the official beers we drink.

1374
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,580
Okay, bye.

1375
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,080
Bye.

1376
01:06:52,080 --> 01:07:05,080
