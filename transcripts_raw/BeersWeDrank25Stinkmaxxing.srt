1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(sipping)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:11,880
(burping)

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
- You're listening to Beers We Drink,

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,180
America's number one beer podcast.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,440
(record scratching)

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,020
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,320
- What's up all my chuggers?

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm trying to get that burp out.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,060
(burping)

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,720
- This is a journey into--

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,560
- Into the middle of--

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
- Plain and clean--

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,220
- Bud Light.

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Food Rippin'

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,340
Beers we drank, motherfucker,

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,380
with Juvio, Caleb and Rex.

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,660
And we're back.

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,700
I already opened mine, but I faked

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,340
the sound for you guys.

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,220
I just opened mine just then.

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,940
Guys, check this out.

22
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,020
Well, you still have homeless hangers.

23
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,860
Bud Light Lime.

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,020
Oh, yeah, these.

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,060
Yeah, I spent all

26
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,020
I spent this whole week working on

27
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,100
the new set, which will be out by the time this comes out.

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,800
Yeah, I talk about it, but I used like this really

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,440
heavy duty glue and instead of spreading it with like

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,600
like a spreading tool, like you would use for like like mud, like spackle.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,780
Yeah, I used my fingers and it was really, really smart of me.

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,040
And then I used them a little bit.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,460
And then I was like, oh, this shit's not coming off.

34
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,860
Like I had the idea, I was like, "Oh, I should use a spackling knife."

35
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,780
And then I was like, "Well, it's already on my hands, whatever."

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,140
So I just fucking, my hands are just covered in this shit.

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,180
And it's coming off like a second,

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,300
a second layer of skin on top of my skin.

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,340
Real blue collar worker type of shit.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,300
Yeah.

41
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,380
That's why I got myself a Bud Light Lime.

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,780
This is the first beer maybe I've ever deserved.

43
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,620
Yeah.

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,900
In my entire life.

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,580
Every other beer has been on credit.

46
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
And this one is...

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,660
I actually earned this somewhat this week.

48
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
Earned it and more.

49
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,660
Me and Brian just sat in the office

50
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,660
and he came and helped out.

51
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,660
And we just painted and glued stuff.

52
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
You made Brian work?

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,660
He wanted to.

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,660
He's so bored. His girlfriend was out of town.

55
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,660
He brought beer over.

56
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,660
We listened to Morgan Wallen

57
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,660
for like four and a half hours.

58
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,660
It was fucking awesome, dude.

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,660
He's a man.

60
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Yeah, it was a good time.

61
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,020
But I will say I can see the blood.

62
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,660
I crushed my finger today.

63
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,940
Oh, enough to bleed.

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,300
Yeah, you know,

65
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,540
unpacking.

66
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,740
OK.

67
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,100
Oh, you know, all your weights,

68
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,580
brand new look, Rex is finally settled and he has a microphone.

69
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,700
Yes. And it's a small office.

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,020
No different than the.

71
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,500
Yeah, it's almost sounds worse than the AirPods did.

72
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,740
-Which is kind of impressive. -Why does it sound so bad?

73
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,700
I mean, it just needs to be turned up, I think.

74
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
-It's very quiet. -I think you need to just talk,

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
you need to start talking to the right thing.

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
-Like, have it like this. -I'm talking, I literally,

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,480
it's like in my mouth.

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,980
-I don't know what you want from me. -Yeah, you've been,

79
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,220
this is better, but you were talking into the,

80
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,480
into the mute button.

81
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,020
Yeah, you're talking into the, into the top.

82
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,120
-You got to talk into the-- -So, like this.

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,220
-This is bad. -Yeah, that's bad.

84
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,660
-This is good. -That's perfect.

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,520
[LAUGHTER]

86
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,600
Yeah, good, I guess it's good.

87
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,900
-That is perfect. -Oh, no.

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,080
Okay, well, hold on.

89
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,540
Caleb, can I get your honest opinion on something

90
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,040
while Rex works on his stuff?

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,300
Shoot, you know I'm a straight shooter.

92
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,180
Who's got the worst mustache now?

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,460
Between you two?

94
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,460
'Cause mine is gone.

95
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,420
Yeah.

96
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,720
Definitely you, man.

97
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Me?

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,800
Your mustache is fucking terrible.

99
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Yeah.

100
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Rex's looks like it's only coming on the hiller part.

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,440
Well, I did that on purpose.

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,520
That's what we say about yours, man.

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,180
Yeah.

104
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,580
You can't just take that.

105
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,520
No, but mine's fully developed at this point.

106
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
You're this is not.

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,020
That was last week.

108
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,220
That was last week.

109
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,420
You know, it looks even more.

110
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,860
It looks like a Hitler in the middle of the

111
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,100
media, ultra wide Hitler, like a food.

112
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,820
My drink today is homemade grog.

113
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,000
What's in it?

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,900
It fucking

115
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,540
beer concentrate.

116
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,680
You're a liar.

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,640
It's OK that you said that you can't drink right now.

118
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
That's a gas.

119
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,780
I got to have a problem.

120
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,700
- I gotta come clean.

121
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,500
My homemade grog has no grog.

122
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,540
- So what is it?

123
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,500
- I think it's just like lemonade and like

124
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,860
cucumber, cucumber?

125
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,420
How do you say that word in English?

126
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,260
- Cucumber?

127
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
- It's yummy.

128
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
- How are you saying it?

129
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,940
- Okay.

130
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,760
- He said cucumber.

131
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
- We're moving past that.

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
- Cucumber.

133
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,260
- Cucumber.

134
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,580
- I am ESO and I am under painkillers.

135
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,020
I had a surgery recently.

136
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,500
No one even asked me about that.

137
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,420
- Well, no, but you didn't know.

138
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,580
I didn't even know you had a surgery

139
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,120
until you said tonight I had a surgery.

140
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
- But I didn't care.

141
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,800
- What was the surgery?

142
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,120
ASL's tear from duck heads?

143
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
- I went to the dentist and he told me--

144
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,160
- He told me it was ASL.

145
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,680
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,360
I didn't put up my ASL.

147
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,320
That's not a real thing.

148
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
I went to the dentist.

149
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,440
- Oh, I pulled an ASL cig, you cop.

150
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
(laughing)

151
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,820
- I went to the dentist and he said

152
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,420
I had stinky tooth syndrome.

153
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,400
- Oh, you had a rotten tooth.

154
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,460
I had a stinky tooth syndrome and you have to drill it

155
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,500
to the core and destroy it and make a new one.

156
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,320
- Root canal, they call that.

157
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,020
- Yes. - That's what they did.

158
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
And he did it and he destroyed it and it completely hurts.

159
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,640
And I don't wanna drink beers while I'm still recovering.

160
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,200
- I'm not gonna call this a surgery.

161
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,020
I think that you really, you're--

162
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,920
- I don't think it's a surgery, but it still pains me

163
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,020
and I still have to be careful for the next couple,

164
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,980
like two or three days.

165
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,740
So I'm gonna take it easy.

166
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,480
- So you could die?

167
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,360
I couldn't, I don't think so, no.

168
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,200
- Or get infected and die.

169
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,240
- Talk into the front of the microphone, we can't hear you.

170
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,280
- I feel like we should-- - Just move it to be

171
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,120
in front of you.

172
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Why are you having this weird angle?

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
- Like a corn cob.

174
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,040
Is this fine? - Yes.

175
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,860
- Is this good?

176
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,960
- It's too loud now.

177
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,640
- Look at what I'm, look at how he does it.

178
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,840
- Like this, like this.

179
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
- Okay, okay.

180
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
- There we go, perfect, perfect.

181
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,560
- I'm not a podcast professional.

182
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,400
- You kind of, you are, you are now.

183
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
- I've done maybe one, two of these.

184
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,080
- You've been jumped into the cabal.

185
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,680
This is our like 35th episode or something.

186
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,520
- Don't you hold like talks every single Thursday

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,360
to your cult? - Yeah, but no one gives

188
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,680
a fucking hello sound.

189
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,940
And I do that through a VPN. - Okay, this just means

190
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,280
that nobody is hearing you when you talk

191
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,720
and they're just pretending that they do.

192
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
- That might also be true.

193
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,000
- Yeah, all of your employees are just sitting there

194
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,840
like, "Uh-huh, yeah, play Tetris on there."

195
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,040
- Do you think they hate you?

196
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,400
Do they think, they're like, "Oh, I fucking hate my boss.

197
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,480
"My husband's a boss."

198
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,040
- Oh, of course they hate, everybody hates their boss.

199
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,280
- I'm beloved first of all.

200
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,860
I hate Cameron and Patrick.

201
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,940
I hate Caleb.

202
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm the type of boss that's like,

203
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,880
oh, you want to go on vacation for a week

204
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,740
and you're telling me a day before you leave?

205
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,580
Yeah, go for it.

206
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,400
Have fun.

207
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,240
See, if you were my boss,

208
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,600
I'd say my boss is such a fucking pussy.

209
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,840
(laughing)

210
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,320
He won't even say no to my vacation requests.

211
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Why would I say no?

212
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,600
What a loser.

213
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
Why would I say no?

214
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,260
Because they got a job to do.

215
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,100
They got work.

216
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,920
So?

217
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,760
I got work, but I don't do it.

218
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Fuck you.

219
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, you're the boss.

220
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,920
You're not supposed to do any work.

221
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Wait.

222
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,580
I've just come around.

223
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,880
I think he's a cool boss.

224
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,080
- Yeah, I'm cool. - Wait, actually, no.

225
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
If you're my boss and you're like,

226
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
"I'm not doing any work, I want to kill you.

227
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,000
"I want you to die."

228
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,420
- Well, I do work, but the most important thing

229
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,020
is I'm smarter than everyone,

230
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,900
but just by like this amount.

231
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,740
- Yeah, just not enough to know how to work a microphone.

232
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,600
- So it's like any time they run into something

233
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
they can't figure out, you know,

234
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,580
that requires a brain, not talking into a microphone,

235
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,660
I can help them, and they think I'm smart, they respect me.

236
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,800
You, on the other hand, are teaching me

237
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
about the microphone.

238
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,200
So you're the little tiny sliver, smarter than me.

239
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,640
- Lowly, lowly stupid skills.

240
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,960
- Right, I'm an entry level podcaster.

241
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm getting $8 an hour.

242
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480
- Yeah.

243
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,480
- So I've made a total of $11 for the past three months.

244
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,120
- We have determined that we are blue collar workers

245
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,360
and both me and Kayla have the same amount of real work.

246
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,400
- Well you're a black collar worker

247
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,300
because you're wearing a black shirt.

248
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,540
You're wearing a black t-shirt.

249
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,140
- It almost feels like you were gonna say something else

250
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,840
and then bailed yourself out there.

251
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,060
- That is not true.

252
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
- Okay.

253
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
- I promise you, that was the whole thought I had in my head.

254
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,120
- Okay, well that was such a useless thought, I guess,

255
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,220
that is why it led me to believe

256
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,020
that maybe you had something more planned.

257
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,920
- Well this brings me back to what I initially

258
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,500
wanted to talk about before you chewed me out

259
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,860
about my mic usage, which is that we were recording

260
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,580
on a Tuesday night when all of us were--

261
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,620
- Whoa, breaking the fourth wall,

262
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,520
- What's your fucking problem?

263
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,740
- Almost fucked out, is that what you said?

264
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,580
- Fucked up.

265
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,360
- I didn't say fucked out.

266
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,080
- You're kind of fucked out.

267
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,980
- How are we fucked up?

268
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,160
I just came back from the park

269
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,640
at a lovely dinner, Mexican food.

270
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,800
- What do you have?

271
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,040
- I had a steak quesadilla with extra jalapenos

272
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,160
because I like it spicy.

273
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,000
- Whoa.

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
- Sounds yummy.

275
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,600
- So what?

276
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
- Why is this a fucked up day?

277
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,000
- I moved, I slept four hours.

278
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
- You moved two weeks ago.

279
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,000
- This is a lie.

280
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,440
- Yeah, but my stuff came today.

281
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
- He had to move twice.

282
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,100
- I had to set up my desk.

283
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,760
- He had to move his body and then his items.

284
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
- Right.

285
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,600
- His old inventory appeared today.

286
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,680
- Right.

287
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,400
- Which is painful.

288
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,960
It's a stressful, long day.

289
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,120
You have poop tooth.

290
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,960
Poop mouth.

291
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
- I did have poop tooth.

292
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,880
- That just got solved and now you can't drink.

293
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
- That was so fucked up.

294
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
I could swear that my breath stank for like two weeks or so.

295
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,240
And I was like, "What the fuck is it?"

296
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm brushing my fucking teeth.

297
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,520
And then I went to the dentist

298
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,040
and he completely drilled my shit.

299
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,120
And he was like, "Yeah, it's completely black in there."

300
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960
And it stank so bad.

301
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,400
- It's as black as a bean.

302
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
- It was as black as a bean

303
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,520
and he took all of it out.

304
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,960
It was a lot of it.

305
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,520
And it was completely stinky.

306
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,120
And I was like, "Oh, this is where my stink comes from."

307
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,480
- I hate the dentist.

308
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,560
- I am stink free.

309
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,320
- That's amazing news.

310
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,360
I hate them too, but you kind of have to go.

311
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,960
I've been having a really bad breath in the morning.

312
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Maybe I have a destroyed tooth.

313
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,320
Here's the thing.

314
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,860
I thought that I had stink tooth syndrome, poop mouth,

315
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,360
however you want to call it.

316
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,520
And I hadn't gone to the dentist in like four years.

317
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,300
And I went in and they were like, no, you're fine.

318
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,800
Yeah. You need to brush your tongue.

319
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
That's probably what it was.

320
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,200
No, they were just like, yeah, you're fine.

321
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,560
there's nothing, there's literally your teeth are fine.

322
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,280
And I'm like, I can, I have dreams every week where they fall out.

323
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Do you?

324
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Well, that's a stress thing.

325
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
That's a different thing.

326
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,160
No, that's my brain telling me my mouth is poopy.

327
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,240
No, that's the most common stress dream is teeth falling out of your mouth.

328
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,480
I've never experienced that.

329
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,680
People have been having this dream for like 150 years.

330
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,160
Yeah, because 150 years before that, their teeth just fell out already.

331
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
this is like the post-industrial revolution.

332
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,120
This is the stress stream that people have,

333
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,880
is that their teeth fall out of their face.

334
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,900
And I don't really have that much,

335
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,600
but I have dreams where I,

336
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,960
all of my dreams are mission impossible,

337
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,720
but it's never, I never win at the end.

338
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,440
I always am trying to stop a terrorist attack,

339
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,800
trying to defuse a bomb. - So it's just an impossible

340
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,120
mission? - It's just, yeah.

341
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,360
(laughing)

342
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,400
Yeah, it's impossible.

343
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,880
It's impossible mission.

344
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
And a bomb kills me.

345
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,120
But it's it's some kind of nuclear.

346
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,640
It's like a dirty bomb.

347
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,440
You know that.

348
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
And I'm trying to defeat

349
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,360
some kind of terrorist organization,

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
probably the IRA.

351
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,640
Wow.

352
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,680
What was that scary noise?

353
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
See, that's the kind of I'm also skittish.

354
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,760
I've been thinking about this recently.

355
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,080
I think that I manifest my stress

356
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,960
in the fact that if somebody like

357
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,320
any given person could go, ah,

358
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,760
and I will jump out of my chair, my eyebrows fly off my face,

359
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,520
and if I had hair, it would turn into spaghetti.

360
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,320
I have a question.

361
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,620
Have you thought about, maybe in this scenario,

362
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,720
maybe you are actually the terrorist?

363
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,260
- Okay. - Would a terrorist try to defuse a bomb?

364
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm a really bad terrorist.

365
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,660
I'm kind of a Hanna-Barbera style, can't-win terrorist.

366
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,420
Maybe just like a facade, it's like, "Oh, yeah, let me defuse this bomb."

367
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
but you actually want to blow up the school.

368
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Oh, yeah.

369
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,700
Oh, that's maybe that.

370
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,260
Or it's like, yeah, I'm diffusing a bomb

371
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,460
and I look around and I realize I'm in a cave,

372
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,840
but it's my home.

373
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm living in a cave, an Iron Man one cave.

374
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,740
Well, you're like you're collaborating with other terrorists,

375
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,940
so they plant the bomb, right?

376
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,740
But they don't know how the bomb works.

377
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,280
So you're the bomb defusal expert and you set it up to blow up

378
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,720
and then you blow yourself up so no one finds out.

379
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
The only people who ever die in my dreams though

380
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,600
from all of these massive--

381
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,840
Sometimes it's a natural disaster, a giant wave or something.

382
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,160
It's always only affecting me and like five people that I know.

383
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
-Right. -Oh.

384
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,560
It's never a world-destroying kind of drama.

385
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
It would really suck if a nuclear bomb hit New York

386
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
and it just killed like you and Patrick and--

387
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
-Yeah, you'd just be bored. -Like Brian.

388
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
-That would kill my life as well.

389
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,000
-Like a nuclear bomb hits and it just kills your close eight on MySpace.

390
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,600
-Yes, that would be really, really bad.

391
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,720
That would be a huge bummer.

392
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,160
-It would suck. You'd be like, "Do it someone else."

393
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,480
-Yes.

394
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
I guess for Juvio, it would be equally as bad

395
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,320
if me, Cam, and Pat were all murdered

396
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,320
as if the entirety of New York was completely destroyed by a nuclear bomb.

397
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,520
-Yes. I will have to get replacements.

398
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,280
-Who's top of the list?

399
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
-You would be Cameron.

400
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,160
I guess I could get-- -I would die in New York.

401
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,960
-No, but this is in a scenario where only me, Cam, and Pat die.

402
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,440
-Top three. -I think I could do Jacques

403
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,520
from Second Arrangement as Patrick.

404
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,680
-Yes, for sure.

405
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,280
Good luck finding another me though.

406
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,960
-Kayla, do we know a single other bald guy?

407
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,580
- Well, bald is not my only thing I have going on.

408
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,060
- Oh, I guess I could just ask that guy from the yard.

409
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,540
- You could ask Slime?

410
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,380
- Yeah, I'll just ask Slime.

411
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,860
(laughing)

412
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,580
I think he would do it.

413
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,940
- He might do it, yeah.

414
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,180
- Out of charity?

415
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,020
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

416
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,340
- He just likes the show enough, yeah.

417
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,660
- Yeah, he'd just fucking fly over once a week

418
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,860
and do that, private jet status.

419
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,220
- Yeah, so that's my pockets of a list too.

420
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,680
I haven't looked at your mustache, but you have like the undercut of Hitler mustaches.

421
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,220
Alright, let's move past this stupid joke.

422
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,300
I will say that Rex's mustache is looking a little bit Hitlerian.

423
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,820
Yeah, here's what happened, right?

424
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,180
You have a full, like if you did just the Hitler it would be, like with Jubio it would

425
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
be funny.

426
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,180
That's the savior right there.

427
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
The little soul patch.

428
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,120
savor, the flavor saver.

429
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,940
See, cause here's what happened, right?

430
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,440
I just, I got way too into shaving.

431
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,020
Cause it just felt so nice to feel the skin against the air again.

432
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,940
And then I kind of like did like this part kind of brought this part in and I

433
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,020
kept bringing in a little bit more and I was like, uh, oh, you hit the Hitler zone.

434
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,740
You're on the line.

435
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,540
So I was like, soul pass, little bit of sideburn.

436
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,580
- It doesn't, you only left like the shadows

437
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,140
of where you like, when you unlock a character in the game,

438
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,300
which is like the size of your mustache.

439
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,140
- Yeah.

440
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,220
- And you've yet to unlock them.

441
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,220
- You could have gone Hitler

442
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,860
and you've made a last minute Dave Grohl pivot.

443
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
- Exactly.

444
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,700
- Yeah.

445
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,900
- Which people already say I look like, so.

446
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,940
Which I don't, I don't think that's like a compliment.

447
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,780
- You don't look like Dave Grohl.

448
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,620
- Yeah.

449
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,620
I've seen people say it.

450
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Multiple people have said you look like Dave Grohl.

451
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
Really? Just because you have long hair?

452
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,620
I think so. Every man with long hair looks exactly the same.

453
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,620
In the same way every bald guy looks the same.

454
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Except for me. But a lot of them do.

455
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,620
I mean, you got put on that account that every bald man is Foucault.

456
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,620
So I don't think you get to save that.

457
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,620
I can do whatever I want. It's America. I'm a small business owner.

458
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,900
but I don't look like Michel Foucault.

459
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,860
I would never look like a man whose name was Michel.

460
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,220
- Yeah. - That's true.

461
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,060
- I have no interest in that.

462
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,580
- If you were to branch out with your--

463
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
- C'est l'oeuvre.

464
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,740
- You know, if you were to break out of a,

465
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,940
you know, if you were to start again,

466
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,420
not do some sort of like ball stereotype,

467
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,260
how would you be doing?

468
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,620
- If you could take a pill that shrunk one of your balls

469
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,860
to like--

470
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,160
I don't even care what the second part of this is.

471
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,920
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

472
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,900
- I would do that.

473
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,740
- No, keep going, keep going.

474
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,020
- You could have the most luscious head of hair,

475
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,900
but only one of your balls was like the size of a peanut.

476
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,980
- Dude, nobody knows what my balls are like.

477
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,700
It doesn't matter.

478
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,760
It would take 30 seconds to explain to my wife,

479
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,500
and it's not like she's gonna be like,

480
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,460
"Oh no, you don't have big balls anymore?

481
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,300
"Oh no."

482
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
- Well, you have one big ball and one small ball.

483
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,940
They're mixed together.

484
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,500
The smaller I could get my balls, the better.

485
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,300
Balls are the most disgusting mistake God ever made.

486
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,420
I do not want balls.

487
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,880
- What if you have hair, and you take this bill?

488
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,420
- Just for no reason then?

489
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,960
- Yeah, you get one big ball and you go bald.

490
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,060
- See that is a tougher, so if I could,

491
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:07,500
if you said your balls quadruple in size,

492
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,460
but you get hair. - No, just one of them.

493
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,100
If one ball quadruples in size but I get hair,

494
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,300
I think I would still probably stay bald.

495
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,180
Really?

496
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,860
I'm that serious about not having big balls.

497
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,260
And also, being bald is a disability

498
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,660
that many men live with.

499
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,900
They live amazing lives.

500
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,140
Some of the richest men in the world are bald.

501
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,540
Name three.

502
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,140
Jeff Bezos.

503
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,060
Easy.

504
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,660
Carlos Slim.

505
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,500
Easy.

506
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,320
Not bald.

507
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,580
He could be.

508
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,740
I don't know what it looks like.

509
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
OK, Jeff Bezos, Andrew Tate.

510
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah, OK.

511
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,840
And Jason Statham gets $10 million every Fast and Furious movie.

512
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,540
This guy's rich.

513
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,380
Do you think he's rich?

514
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,040
He makes movies for rich.

515
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,120
Mm, I don't know.

516
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
Rich.

517
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,640
Vin Diesel rich.

518
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,480
The Rock is rich.

519
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,580
Rich men.

520
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,240
The Rock is rich.

521
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,740
Well, Rock is, you know, not the same

522
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,520
palette is you.

523
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,120
-So he can pull off being bald. -So we're only saying bald white guys?

524
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,020
-I-- Well-- -What do you mean pull off being bald?

525
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,220
There's nothing to pull off.

526
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,620
It's just a hair-- It's a haircut like every other haircut.

527
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,220
It's not-- I mean, yeah, it's a haircut,

528
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
but it's close to the head.

529
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,820
Yeah, it's a very well-done haircut.

530
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,720
A close shave.

531
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,220
-No, I think that-- -Do you think I should go and get my head

532
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,720
shaved by one of these guys with this razor?

533
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,920
No, I think you should get--

534
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,800
-Wait, which guys? -The weave, the little thing they put on

535
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,020
that I've seen on Instagram that's like--

536
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
-Oh, the hair system. -Yes.

537
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,560
-Where they just kind of glue a piece of hair to your head. -I want a hair system, man.

538
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,940
-I do not want to do that shit. -How about this?

539
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,520
Would you take a pill that gave you beautiful hair,

540
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
-perfect full head of hair-- -What's up with these pills?

541
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,040
--but it also gave your balls the same type of hair?

542
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
[laughter]

543
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,820
-So you just grew hair at the same-- -I don't want hair.

544
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
I don't like if I would rather be bald than have your hair

545
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Some wizard who isn't me is making these pills. What if you took a pill that I would rather have hair to my chest

546
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Okay, yeah, what if you turn to give you a normal hair?

547
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I wish I had Jubio's beautiful head of hair though.

548
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,800
I'm not saying you have to have my hair, but just any head of hair.

549
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Like the ability to grow perfect hair.

550
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,800
You had literally Jared Leto's hairline.

551
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Giant afro.

552
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Okay.

553
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Okay.

554
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Do you think I was looking for a giant afro? Done.

555
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Yeah.

556
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Done.

557
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Really?

558
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Stamped and sold.

559
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah.

560
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,860
Afro no legs spell you take that fuck yeah can you imagine how well my

561
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,200
Instagram reels would do if I was a white guy with a giant perfect Afro okay

562
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,720
black dynamite Afro what if the pill wore off and you had the Larry David and I

563
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,960
just I'm running home to do to eat my pills at the right time

564
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,380
- You know, like a Cinderella or whatever.

565
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,800
- You are not a punctual person.

566
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,120
- I am a punctual person.

567
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,640
- You are punctual.

568
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,760
- I'm a very punctual person.

569
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm always early at everything.

570
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
- Caleb texted me yesterday

571
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,440
because I was running 15 minutes late

572
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
and he was afraid of--

573
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,880
- I despise lateness.

574
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,720
It is the number one thing that upsets me that people do.

575
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,720
- Maybe I'm just confusing tardiness with cappiness.

576
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
- Tardiness is one thing.

577
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,580
I'll be tardy.

578
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,880
And you're also talking about planning to play video games,

579
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm realizing right now.

580
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,840
Which is, yeah, in that sense,

581
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,840
I probably am not very serious about being on time.

582
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,280
- Caleb is often late to play video games.

583
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,120
- I am very, I am often.

584
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,640
- Not only talking about video games,

585
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,280
I'm talking about you would drop out of our plans

586
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,800
when we were in town, when we were visiting.

587
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Multiple times it happened to us.

588
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
- Which plan?

589
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,640
- I forgot.

590
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,180
What is kinder?

591
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,620
This is a question I've asked my wife before.

592
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,340
Is it kinder to completely bail on something

593
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,360
or is it kinder to be 45 minutes

594
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
to an hour and a half late to something?

595
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,820
'Cause if that is the decision I have to make

596
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,940
between being an hour late to something

597
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,080
or missing out on it completely,

598
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,180
I would rather give the heads up

599
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,940
and say I'm not gonna be there.

600
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,100
'Cause I think that being late

601
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,900
is a disgusting thing for poor people to do.

602
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,140
- I think I'd rather be late.

603
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
- Poor?

604
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,460
Rich people are late, poor people are on time,

605
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,940
they don't value their time.

606
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,580
Rich people, no.

607
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,380
- No, poor people spend all day getting all gussied up,

608
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,780
putting on lipstick and deodorant.

609
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,820
- Disgusting. - Rich people just,

610
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,940
they fall out of bed into their Lamborghini,

611
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,420
it's parked next to their bed,

612
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,940
and they drive to whatever they have to do.

613
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,460
- Yeah, that is true. - Poor people

614
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,220
are cutting people off in traffic,

615
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,220
you know what I mean?

616
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,380
- I have been stink maxing lately,

617
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,480
which is, you know, just not really worried about it.

618
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,380
- You've been stink maxing?

619
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,660
- Yeah, you know, just accumulating stigma.

620
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,860
- You can't coin new stuff on here

621
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,700
without screening it, letting us screen it first.

622
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,780
- Well, you're screening it live.

623
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
You're screening it right now.

624
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,300
I don't understand. - Stink maxing?

625
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,840
Okay, it's getting denied.

626
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,460
I don't want to, this is not approved.

627
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,060
- I stink max from time to time.

628
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,900
Sometimes I don't shower for days.

629
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,940
- That's it, it's catching on.

630
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,100
- It's not getting, this is not spreading like wildfire.

631
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,340
- It completely caught on.

632
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,020
Yeah, sometimes I just don't feel like showering

633
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,140
because I'm not gonna go outside.

634
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,900
I'm working in my home.

635
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,220
So I just take Max for a couple days.

636
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,580
- And sometimes I go to the deli and I'm stinky.

637
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,420
- No, I am a bath and a shower almost every single day,

638
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,820
both.

639
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,220
- Well, that's because you have to go outside.

640
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,180
- That is true.

641
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,220
And because a couple of times my wife has said,

642
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
"I can smell your balls from across the room."

643
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,620
And that really-- - Which is a great smell.

644
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,220
I love the smell of balls. - That really--

645
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,620
This-- (laughs)

646
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,340
- Whoa, wait, wait a minute. - Okay, there's a lot

647
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,100
to unpack in what you just said.

648
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,940
- Bang.

649
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,380
- The soundboard's back.

650
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,980
- I don't have anything. - You have one sound.

651
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,060
(laughs)

652
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,340
- The one that-- - You love the smell of,

653
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,940
you said you love the smell of,

654
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,060
it's okay to love the smell of your own balls.

655
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,900
- Well, that's what I'm saying. - But you said,

656
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,620
"I love the smell of balls."

657
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,420
That's what you said.

658
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,500
- Well, I-- - It is not

659
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,240
Standardized smell my balls you would not like

660
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,760
How do you I mean I can't promise that

661
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,720
You guys want to do a bowl of your balls smell like my balls. What if in a blind smell test?

662
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,460
I do wonder that I wonder if I farted cuz I fart all day long, and I love it

663
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,760
I love sitting in it and stinking up my I'm up

664
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,300
- You're like maxing yourself.

665
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,020
- I live like Trek, I shit and smell it.

666
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,180
I dig my face into the toilet bowl

667
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,260
to get a big huff of my shit.

668
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,060
But if somebody else farted in my room

669
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,540
and it smelled like my fart,

670
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,420
but I thought it was somebody else's,

671
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,060
or if somebody just said, "I farted,

672
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,540
"but I smelled my own fart,"

673
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,580
I think I would vomit.

674
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,940
I think I would actually vomit.

675
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,460
That is so disgusting to me, another person's farts.

676
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,720
- Mine are honestly sublime.

677
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,420
- Okay.

678
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,260
I think.

679
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,500
- Not a fan of my own farts.

680
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,620
First of all, mine smell bad.

681
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,020
- Mine smell so bad.

682
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,540
I am a legendary stinky farter.

683
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,100
- But you still like it.

684
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,780
- People in every era of my life,

685
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,120
I have left a lasting imprint on the person

686
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,000
that I've seen the most in these like four or five year eras.

687
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,840
- Right.

688
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,880
- Where probably one of the three things they know about me.

689
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,040
- All the smelly parts. - The main things.

690
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,600
Yeah, well even this predates baldness.

691
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,120
I've always been, 'cause I used to be vegan.

692
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,940
- Right. - And I think it

693
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:20,940
completely destroyed the micro whatever in my belly,

694
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,840
and it made some kind of mucinex bugs

695
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,000
that sit around watching TV and scratching their ass.

696
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,520
Have we ever talked about how we deemed,

697
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,280
we named your living room the fart room?

698
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,120
The first time that I went to New York.

699
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,040
- Oh yeah, 'cause you and Noah were in there

700
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,880
just farting for like every single night.

701
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,280
And I would open the door,

702
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,160
I would open the bedroom door

703
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,060
and just get hit by just a wall of just farts

704
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,520
that had just sat in there all night long.

705
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
- Yeah.

706
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,060
- Yeah, that's amazing. - Yeah, we'll call it

707
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,880
the fart room.

708
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,020
And then you would come in and you would also fart in there.

709
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,360
And then we would just, "Oh, welcome to the fart room."

710
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,040
and then your wife just hated it.

711
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,140
- Humans are pack animals, what can I say?

712
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,120
I wanted to belong.

713
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,520
- I do think they should bring back sunrooms,

714
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,560
but for communal farting.

715
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,640
- Sunrooms?

716
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,480
- Yeah, you know, like a sunroom.

717
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,640
- Oh yeah, like with screen doors and stuff?

718
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,560
- Right, like a somewhat outdoor,

719
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,560
but enclosed area to release fart.

720
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
- This is a good idea.

721
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,280
'Cause I'm never ever going to,

722
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
I mean, I've done it before.

723
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,200
but I don't want to go to the bathroom just to fart.

724
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,040
Right.

725
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,480
It feels, I feel embarrassed to be in the bathroom

726
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,640
for five seconds.

727
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,880
'Cause then I feel like I have to commit

728
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,640
to the whole charade.

729
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,200
I have to take off--

730
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,040
Pretend to wipe, yeah.

731
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,880
Yeah, I have to take off five pieces of toilet paper

732
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
just in case they weigh it when people leave.

733
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,360
(laughing)

734
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,200
I just don't wanna have to do that.

735
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,760
I've done that in a public bathroom,

736
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,720
when I'm like sitting down to shit

737
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,200
and don't have to shit, just to fart.

738
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,960
Yeah, and you know, you just like you're like and then you drop your phone in the toilet to make it sound like you should

739
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Yeah, just kind of you know, do that and then

740
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,080
Grab some toilet paper, you know, you do the whole thing. Make sure yeah squeaky real

741
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,520
you know make sure they're aware and then kind of

742
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:21,600
I'm one of those. I'm not a dramatic shitter being a man going into public restrooms my whole life

743
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,440
I have found that there are men in this world who are dramatic shitters who talk to themselves

744
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,320
Come on. Yeah, they go on fuck fuck fuck. They do like a reverse

745
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,400
They do reverse sex sounds they do the inverse of the noises that people make during sex

746
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,100
While they shit and I just don't get that I'm a very stoic

747
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,620
shitter

748
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,240
I think if your shits are not drama-

749
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,640
There's two different types of dramatic shits.

750
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,040
And one of them makes you a stoic shitter,

751
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,640
and the other makes you a dramatic shitter.

752
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,640
If you're a guy who's constantly having, like,

753
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,640
nasty, rancid, fried chicken diarrhea,

754
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
[laughter]

755
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,640
that is a dramatic shitter.

756
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,640
If you're a guy that has hard-ass craps that make you bleed,

757
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Really concerning shits. That is a stoic shitter. Nothing surprises you after that.

758
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,640
See, I am a big purveyor of diarrhea.

759
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Oh! You're a purveyor.

760
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,640
I know all about it. And I do a lot of it. I really do.

761
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,920
But I sit there, I look at my phone, I will,

762
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,400
I try to, I watch those perfect loop videos,

763
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,120
and sometimes I'll watch them four or five times

764
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
'cause I'm so focused on shitting,

765
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,940
I don't realize it's a loop, you know?

766
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,440
But yeah, I would say I'm very quiet.

767
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,880
You'll never hear a peep out of me.

768
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,320
But maybe, I think this is just a--

769
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,040
I'm grown, I'm brunt.

770
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,000
This is a metric of politeness, I think.

771
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,840
Yeah.

772
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,560
I'm a very polite person.

773
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,640
I have a lot of regard for the people around me

774
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,640
and I don't want to inconvenience people

775
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,480
by saying cuss words while I'm taking a shit.

776
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,760
- I feel like if I'm in a public bathroom

777
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,320
and I'm farting while I'm shitting,

778
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
I'm gonna get judged by the other shitters.

779
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,440
- I agree, I don't fart in public restrooms.

780
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,240
I would rather fart, if I'm in a Target,

781
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,760
I would rather fart in the kid's aisle

782
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,560
while I'm playing with some kind of,

783
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,280
pretending I'm buying something for my daughter

784
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,260
and I'm squeezing a toy that makes a noise,

785
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,960
and I go, "Oh, that's an interesting noise

786
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,040
for this toy to make.

787
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,000
It's a talking truck.

788
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,920
It's not something that would make any..."

789
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,120
It has no squeaker in it,

790
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,800
but I'm hammering Legos with my hands,

791
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,760
trying to make it sound like a fart would come from it.

792
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,320
I would rather do that than while I'm sitting at a urinal

793
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,640
and there's a man next to me.

794
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,400
- Sitting at a urinal?

795
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,320
- Well, I never learned. I was homeschooled.

796
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,120
- But I also think I'm an amazing crop duster.

797
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,800
- Yes, yeah, 'cause do you do the thing

798
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,440
where you spread your butt cheeks apart

799
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
so that the fart makes no noise?

800
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,680
- I don't even go that far, I don't need to.

801
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,320
- Well, I just gave you a million dollars over the game.

802
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
- You just put me on, yeah.

803
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,040
But let me tell you, I'll release in spurts

804
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,060
while I'm walking.

805
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,320
Just a little pushy.

806
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,560
(laughing)

807
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,520
- Today I was, there was a guy,

808
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,440
I was walking to the park with my wife and the dog,

809
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,280
and the dog had taken a shit and I had the shit in a bag,

810
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,960
but I know that there's not a trash can

811
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,320
till we get to the park, so I just carry it.

812
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,540
And I realized today that I swing my arms way too much

813
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,400
when I walk, I walk like a monkey,

814
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,000
and it slipped out on the backswing, the bag did,

815
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,640
and there was a guy right behind me and it hit his foot.

816
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,880
(laughing)

817
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,180
Which is honestly the best case scenario,

818
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,480
because I was swinging them enough that if I had released it

819
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,080
at the apex of my backswing,

820
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
it would have gone on top of his head or in his face.

821
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,760
Yeah.

822
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,720
Like a McDonald's fudge sundae, dude.

823
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,600
Yeah, exactly.

824
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,360
Just right on top.

825
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,340
Did it explode on the bag?

826
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,920
It did not explode, but he did seem pretty mortified.

827
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,700
But he was on the phone speaking something

828
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,840
other than English, which really made me so mad

829
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,560
because I knew that he was saying something immediately

830
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,400
about what had just happened and about what an idiot I was.

831
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,600
- I just got shitted on.

832
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,520
- Yeah. - Someone just shitted on me.

833
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,960
- Somebody just, he had to somehow explain,

834
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,840
I did get shitted on, but nobody shat on me,

835
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,720
they threw it on me.

836
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,540
- Yeah.

837
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,680
- Which is, I think, a tough thing to say in any language.

838
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,520
- I think I should've just gone like,

839
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,280
no, no, no, I'm sorry, this is my poop.

840
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,520
I dropped my poop, I'm sorry.

841
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,680
(laughing)

842
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,640
- Sorry. - I'm sorry,

843
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,000
I let go of my poop.

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,960
Great, my lunch is ruined by your foot.

845
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,120
Awesome, thanks so much, man.

846
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,740
I'm saving this for later.

847
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,260
But yeah, it was not a good situation.

848
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,960
No, I don't think I've ever had that happen.

849
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,960
But I also, I never used to clean up after my dog.

850
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,400
You're a bad guy.

851
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,880
This is in the same, this is exactly,

852
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,840
you're an only child, right?

853
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,660
Sure.

854
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,980
- I'm fucking wondering.

855
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,900
You're late to things, you leave shit everywhere,

856
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,180
you have no regard for other people.

857
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,220
You're a scumbag.

858
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,300
- True.

859
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,660
- I was, all right, so let's get into this.

860
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,520
I was 15 minutes late.

861
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,380
- Disgusting.

862
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,280
15 minutes late is 50 minutes late.

863
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,540
Five minutes early is on time.

864
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,460
On time is late.

865
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,040
Two minutes, two minutes is the grace period.

866
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,140
- Two minutes, what is this, class?

867
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,180
Are you clocking for first period?

868
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,340
- Class was 15. - What's wrong with class?

869
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,100
Class is amazing.

870
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,780
Class taught me everything I know about the Civil War.

871
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,980
I like class.

872
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,300
Two minutes is what you have.

873
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,620
I loved class.

874
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,720
I was a teacher's pet.

875
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,640
- Yeah, you were like a pit bull.

876
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,260
- Yeah, in a way.

877
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,300
Me and Rex were talking last night

878
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,700
about what bad kids we were in school.

879
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
(laughing)

880
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,380
I'm reverse chewing a little bit.

881
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:26,140
Yeah, we were telling some pretty horrible stories about how evilly despicable we were.

882
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,620
Alright, just tell me the worst ones, the two worst ones.

883
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,180
Um, my...

884
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,900
Probably for me, honestly, probably the one I'm least proud of is that my first

885
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,700
schoolyard fight ever was against a little person.

886
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,220
And I beat him up really bad.

887
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,580
You win?

888
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,740
Yeah, and also he started it.

889
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,900
I'd like to say that. He started it.

890
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
That's not bad.

891
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,940
And I called the teacher the C-word

892
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,780
and said a bunch of nasty stuff about her and her kid.

893
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,940
But I was 11 years old, you know, I was rough and tumble,

894
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,860
kind of a devil may care attitude.

895
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,700
Yeah.

896
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,060
I was so naughty that the mere sight of me

897
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,500
almost put a woman in the hospital.

898
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,420
Oh yeah.

899
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,420
He was saying last night he had a teacher

900
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,340
who he would walk in the classroom

901
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,060
and she'd be like, "I can't, you have to leave,

902
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,660
"my heart hurts."

903
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,300
- I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about you.

904
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,580
- She was in love with you.

905
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,420
- No, she--

906
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,500
- Well, her heart was beating out of her chest.

907
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,180
- She loved you so much.

908
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,020
You were so beautiful to my sight.

909
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,860
- You know they say, hate and love

910
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,440
are two sides of the same coin.

911
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,280
- That's right.

912
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,180
- So maybe she hated me so deeply

913
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,540
it turned back around like yin and yang.

914
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,220
- Yeah, you must leave or I will become a pedophile.

915
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,700
- Do you guys think you ever had a teacher

916
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,800
who jacked off to you?

917
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,460
Like the thought of you slipped into their mind

918
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,780
while they were jacking off?

919
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,080
- No. - No.

920
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,920
- I think I had one.

921
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,740
- I was a homely child.

922
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,140
- I could see that.

923
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,380
- Yeah.

924
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,260
I'm a homely adult, but you know, I was a homely child.

925
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,380
- What kind of teacher is this kid?

926
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,820
- He was a science teacher.

927
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,020
- He?

928
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,740
- Yeah. - He loved you?

929
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,820
- No, he played hard to get.

930
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,560
And he, but then I saw him, it was so weird.

931
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,160
I thought that this was like my one of those teachers

932
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,000
who's your friend and all that.

933
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
Yeah.

934
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,260
And I saw him at a,

935
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,040
I saw him leaving a gas station once,

936
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,800
like maybe two years or a year after I'd left school,

937
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,320
like a short enough time that he would have remembered me,

938
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,840
especially if I'm his favorite student, as he so claimed.

939
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,680
Yeah.

940
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,280
And I was like, I saw him in a gas station leaving,

941
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,600
and I was like, "Hey, what's up?

942
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Good to see you."

943
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,000
And he like looked at me and just like completely ignored me

944
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
and walked past me.

945
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,720
He was over you?

946
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
-Yes, he had found some other fat kid.

947
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,000
-Damn.

948
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,160
-You have unlocked a memory in me of a math teacher I had in seventh grade

949
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,520
that would give me very aggressive hugs.

950
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,360
-Yes, you can't do that anymore, which is good.

951
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,160
A teacher should not be hugging children.

952
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,960
-What kind of aggressive hug are we talking?

953
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,600
-He had a-- Think of Gabe Newell.

954
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,520
He had a Gabe Newell affect.

955
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,200
-Okay.

956
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
-He would be like--

957
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,400
He was lovely and he made the best game of all time.

958
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
He was very folksy and he would be like, son.

959
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,720
And then he kind of like reach his arm around my tiny seventh grade

960
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,840
body and kind of like hug my waist.

961
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,920
Your little 20, 24 waist.

962
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,080
Yeah, exactly.

963
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,400
Wow.

964
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,000
And he'd be like, you gotta, you can't keep doing this.

965
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
You gotta be better.

966
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,160
You're so talented.

967
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,520
You're so smart, but you're so stupid.

968
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,660
-Whoa. What did you do? What provoked this?

969
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,400
-I think I cheated on a test

970
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,880
by programming a calculator to do something.

971
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
-Oh.

972
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,760
-I can't be mad at you for that.

973
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,600
You're a problem solver. -He very well could be.

974
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,160
-No. -Because I'm not

975
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,680
the first person to do it, which was the--

976
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,320
-Yes. People used to do the calculator cheating thing all the time.

977
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,480
-Yes.

978
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
- Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is like school

979
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,400
is really learning how to cheat and get away with it.

980
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,200
- And how to fish an iPod headphone down your hoodie sleeve.

981
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,360
That's what I learned.

982
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,760
- Oh yeah, classic kind of sit like this.

983
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,000
- Yeah, what are you gonna send me to detention

984
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,360
'cause I'm tired?

985
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,240
- Oh, I just need to rest my head on my hand

986
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,480
in a specific way that it covers my ear and you can't see.

987
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
- Do you ever think about how crazy it is

988
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,460
that you spend the first like almost 20 years of your life

989
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,520
having to wake up at like 6.30 in the morning

990
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,180
every single day.

991
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,020
- Yeah.

992
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,100
- It catches with almost nobody.

993
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,380
Nobody if they could choose would keep doing that.

994
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,700
- Yeah, I completely lost it immediately.

995
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,140
And even when I had like a real job for five years

996
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,800
that required me to be up so early in the morning,

997
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,980
I would still always just wake up late.

998
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,600
- If I wake up before 9, it's a miracle.

999
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,040
- Yeah, I've been trying to wake up earlier now

1000
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,520
because, I don't know, it's just like,

1001
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,240
I would rather take that midday nap

1002
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,240
than be like up until four in the morning every night

1003
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,840
and like missing half the day because I wake up at noon.

1004
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,780
- I do feel like if I wake up like around noon,

1005
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,000
I do miss, I do feel like my day is completely gone.

1006
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,640
- Yeah, it's hard to get started at noon.

1007
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,520
- Yeah, but even then, I don't know.

1008
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I don't care much anymore.

1009
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,520
I think on Sunday I woke up at 3 in the afternoon.

1010
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Yeah, that's not...

1011
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
It was horrible.

1012
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
That's not healthy.

1013
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,520
By the time I left the house and went to go get food, it was like 5.

1014
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,520
But Sunday, you want to enjoy Sunday. Sunday's there to be enjoyed.

1015
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
Sunday's a lazy day.

1016
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
It is a lazy day.

1017
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,300
But you want to it's not there's a difference between being lazy

1018
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,320
and being effectively not alive on your day off.

1019
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,960
You know, you want to be just fucking

1020
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,920
you want to be awake and just watching movies.

1021
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,220
What do you do on Sundays?

1022
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,720
I recently I've been waking up.

1023
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,860
I just wake up at the same time every day.

1024
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,920
I wake up at like 730 every day.

1025
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,220
It's crazy.

1026
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,300
It's such a good on Sunday.

1027
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:37,780
I mean, on Sunday, let's see this week, my Sunday I was working on the set, but last

1028
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:50,240
week I woke up, did some cardio, took the dog for a walk, and then I think I probably

1029
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,760
played video games and watched TV for the rest of the day.

1030
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,080
As long as you wake up early, kind of anything feels productive if you woke up early.

1031
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
That's true.

1032
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:07,880
So at 7.30, you wake up at 7.30, you are naturally productive because all the people that would

1033
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,760
make you unproductive won't wake up for the next five hours.

1034
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Exactly, yeah.

1035
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,040
Nobody's bugging me to do something that I really shouldn't be doing because I have other

1036
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
stuff to do.

1037
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,080
Yeah, because I woke up at like five something this morning and I got so much done before

1038
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,440
nine o'clock.

1039
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
So much done.

1040
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
That's what Brian was saying.

1041
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Clean so much.

1042
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
He does.

1043
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,720
He wakes up at five and then he goes for a run and then he falls back asleep until like

1044
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
noon.

1045
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
It's beautiful.

1046
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Yeah, I like that.

1047
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Yeah.

1048
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,560
I like that because the middle of the day, honestly, take it or leave it.

1049
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Take it or leave it.

1050
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Exactly.

1051
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,560
I love the morning.

1052
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
I love night.

1053
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,280
about 11 a.m. until 4 p.m. yeah what are you doing there lunch getting lunch

1054
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:01,000
that break lunch I like breakfast all the love breakfast busy yep anyone that's

1055
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,240
not busy one it's going again okay yeah I had to switch mics cuz my mic broke

1056
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,800
the entire thing but it was probably Julio Rex's fault somehow would you

1057
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,160
- Would you take a pill that made you wake up every day

1058
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,720
at 6 a.m., but it made both of your balls really,

1059
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,080
really small?

1060
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,400
So small, so small that they're completely invisible

1061
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,240
to the human eye.

1062
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,100
- Yes.

1063
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,460
- Would you take a pill that made it so you never got fat,

1064
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,920
but all the fat that would go to the rest of your body

1065
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,320
went to your balls?

1066
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
(laughing)

1067
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,240
- So I'm like working out, and people are like,

1068
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,040
why are you working out so hard?

1069
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
You're in great shape. - You're in perfect shape.

1070
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,600
- You're 7% body fat, but I'm only doing it.

1071
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,040
I don't think I would do that because--

1072
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
- Yeah, how much body fat do you think--

1073
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
- Distributes around your entire body.

1074
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,160
So if I was like a very normal,

1075
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,360
like somebody can look really, really good

1076
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,480
at like 15% body fat.

1077
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,820
But if 15% of my body was my balls,

1078
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,520
that would be a really, really tough job market for me.

1079
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,000
That's gonna be tough.

1080
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,680
- It looks so good though.

1081
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
What do you mean?

1082
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Job market.

1083
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
I would never get a job if I had giant balls.

1084
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
Well, you'd just hide them in your pants.

1085
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah, just wear big pants.

1086
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Well, I'd have to wear a kilt and then I'm admitting to being Irish or whatever that is.

1087
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,680
No, you don't have to wear a kilt.

1088
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,680
You can just let them lean down one side of your pant leg each.

1089
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,680
Okay, but that's – so you need to add this to the hypothetical.

1090
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,680
You need to say you can mold them to be whatever – because yeah, I'll fucking – if I had to split my balls to go down both of my legs.

1091
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,000
Think of them like a giant saggy breast instead of a spherical ball.

1092
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,440
No more addendum to this. You can cut them off but they grow up twice the size.

1093
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,440
They grow up?

1094
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
[Laughter]

1095
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Why would you cut them? You have to go through the pain of cutting your own balls off?

1096
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,440
And then they just come back twice as big?

1097
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Yeah, will you do it?

1098
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
I'll pass this to the next one.

1099
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
[Laughter]

1100
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,680
all that well with the where we started but we do that yeah would you take a

1101
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:21,200
pill that got you insanely high no I would interviewer I think I'm a good

1102
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,240
interviewer what's up no wait how do you who's the bitch this the popular

1103
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:34,480
interviewer now. Bobby Althoff? Yeah that one. Yeah. I think Jubio could be her. I

1104
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,080
mean I'm referring more to a job interview not so much like

1105
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:45,120
interviewing Drake. Well you said interviewer so. I want to get her I'm

1106
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,640
going to interview her in the bathroom from Saw. What do you see

1107
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,720
See yourself in five years.

1108
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,040
Five years I see myself with your job, buddy.

1109
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
Look out.

1110
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,040
Hired.

1111
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,040
Immediately.

1112
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,040
I wasn't even hired.

1113
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
Whatever.

1114
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
No, they like that.

1115
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,600
It depends on, okay, wait, who's interviewing me?

1116
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,080
That's why I'm so good at being interviewed.

1117
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:13,320
Because I'm an amazing kind of Sherlock Holmes-esque reader of people.

1118
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:19,480
Well, I think I remember them asking me a lot, "Why do you want to do this job?

1119
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
What do you want this job?

1120
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,600
And you can't say the actual answer which is money.

1121
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
No, you cannot say money.

1122
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
That's forbidden.

1123
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,880
I've always loved folding towels at the gym.

1124
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
That's why.

1125
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,120
I would do it even – I've always been a member of a gym and I've always just gone

1126
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,120
and folded towels.

1127
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
People call me weird.

1128
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Yeah, and I see in your resume –

1129
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,120
But –

1130
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,320
And I see in your resume, you used to be a very popular podcaster.

1131
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
You had a really successful career.

1132
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Oh, thank you so much.

1133
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,080
Why do you want to throw that all away just to be the janitor at the gym?

1134
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:58,480
Well, because it's not fulfilling in the way that I think being a janitor would be.

1135
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,260
There's something to clocking in and clocking out and leaving your job, leaving your work

1136
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,260
at work, right?

1137
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,260
I just didn't have any.

1138
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
That's not a good answer.

1139
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,260
That's not a good answer.

1140
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,780
I didn't have any division between my home life and my work life.

1141
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,780
They hate that.

1142
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,780
I want you to not have that.

1143
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,660
Oh, you fucking want me to think about mopping the floor while I'm at home trying to watch

1144
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,660
The Simpsons?

1145
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,260
Yes, yes, they want that from you.

1146
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
No they don't!

1147
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,260
Nobody wants that.

1148
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,380
When's the last time you had a job?

1149
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:33,660
The last job I had was I worked at a museum and I was babysitting as well.

1150
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,460
And that, but I, so I've mostly had pretty cool bosses and anytime there's been a, anytime

1151
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Anytime I've had a bad boss, I've just quit the first day.

1152
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,060
- Yeah. (laughs)

1153
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,720
- I worked at a wax museum for one day

1154
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,100
and the boss said, "You have to go stand outside

1155
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,940
"next to our wax statue of Peter Dinklage

1156
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,740
"and try to trick people into paying you

1157
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,660
"to take pictures with it."

1158
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,800
And I was like, "Okay."

1159
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,620
And I did it for two hours

1160
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,900
and then I just brought the Peter Dinklage statue,

1161
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,580
'cause again, I'm a nice guy.

1162
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,580
I brought it inside so it wouldn't melt

1163
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,940
and nobody would steal it.

1164
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,420
And then I took off my uniform and I folded it

1165
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,540
and put it on the toilet in the bathroom.

1166
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,380
And I left and never talked to the lady.

1167
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,380
- I would love to steal a wax, Peter Dinklage.

1168
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,340
- I probably could have.

1169
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,180
- That's probably the easiest thing to steal

1170
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,220
at the wax museum as well.

1171
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,780
- I knew like four people who worked

1172
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,700
at this wax museum in Boston.

1173
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,620
And they all were like, you got to work here, man.

1174
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,460
It's awesome.

1175
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,980
And then the first day they made me sit outside

1176
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,700
on like a hundred degree day and I wasn't allowed to sit

1177
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,540
and I wasn't allowed to look at my phone.

1178
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,420
- Damn.

1179
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,820
- Yeah, it was not a very fun job.

1180
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,820
I think when I quit my real job for five years

1181
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,460
and before I started editing the podcast,

1182
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,460
I was interviewing so much for months

1183
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,220
and I never, ever, ever got any close to getting hired

1184
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,340
except for this one time.

1185
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,380
I've made it through the entire process.

1186
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,360
They interviewed me three times.

1187
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,280
They made me do a quiz and I did it

1188
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,120
and they liked my answers, I guess.

1189
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,080
And then I got to the final round

1190
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,080
where I got to meet the team.

1191
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,840
And I got into the Zoom call,

1192
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,840
and I joined, and it's a team of nine women.

1193
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,120
And it's just me.

1194
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,960
- Fail.

1195
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,080
- See, honestly, that's the kind of work environment

1196
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,000
that I thrive in.

1197
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,720
- I completely, I was like, I was trying to be--

1198
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,320
I was trying to be so personal, I was like,

1199
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,020
oh yeah, this is cool, whatever.

1200
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,680
And they immediately, the next day,

1201
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,440
They were like, yeah, you didn't make it.

1202
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,320
Yeah.

1203
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,120
Yeah.

1204
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
That's what you should have said.

1205
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,600
When I worked at the museum, I only worked.

1206
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,640
There was like one girl that was like my age and then every other employee was a

1207
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,320
woman in their like seventies.

1208
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,520
And I had just, I mean, we just got along like,

1209
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,600
that's the difference.

1210
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,840
It's the older women.

1211
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,720
They, they like when you're a young man and you're a personable and you're trying

1212
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:06,600
to be nice. It's a woman that's your age or maybe five years older than you. They hate

1213
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:16,520
you every single time. I've never befriended anyone my age at my job.

1214
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,120
The only person that stayed with me from any job I've ever had is Cameron because I met

1215
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,400
I met Cam the first day at my, my job at college.

1216
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,840
And, uh,

1217
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,920
he was even weirder back then.

1218
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,200
And I had hair and I was fat and, uh,

1219
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,120
but yeah, I don't think I've ever made another like, like longterm,

1220
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,040
like for nobody else I ever hung out with outside of my job that I

1221
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,880
knew from my job.

1222
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,120
Yeah. I hated everyone on my job.

1223
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,600
Yeah, I quit the gym job because there was a girl who,

1224
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:04,000
I was being targeted for harassment

1225
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,200
because she claimed that I didn't dry the towels

1226
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,640
after I washed them.

1227
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,680
And I did, I did dry the towels, but the dryer was broken.

1228
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,440
So the towels would come out wet.

1229
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,280
And she was like-

1230
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
She was coming, you were harassing her?

1231
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,080
No, she was harassing me.

1232
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,600
And she brought it to management.

1233
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,080
And the manager told me, you need to dry the towels.

1234
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,960
And I was like, I close, I can't stay for an hour

1235
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,420
and run the cycle two times.

1236
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:31,500
This is, it's either you have dirty towels

1237
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,920
at the end of the night, or I do this.

1238
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,320
I run the thing one time and it got too much, man.

1239
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,160
I couldn't handle it.

1240
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
I don't like drama.

1241
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,360
I'm not like that.

1242
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:43,600
I'm not one of these people who feeds on drama.

1243
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,940
I'm not a snake.

1244
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,600
I'm a really good guy.

1245
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,440
So I just quit.

1246
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,000
- What's the opposite of a snake?

1247
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,200
Snakes, you're right, snakes keep to themselves.

1248
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,960
What is the opposite of a snake?

1249
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,920
The opposite of a snake is a human.

1250
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,700
So I'm a human.

1251
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,280
I don't think that's true.

1252
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,960
Or Eve, I guess, a woman.

1253
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,920
I'm a woman.

1254
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,280
Something with a lot of legs.

1255
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,360
Women.

1256
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,760
A centipede.

1257
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,800
A snake is the opposite of a god.

1258
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,520
I guess you're right.

1259
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
Yeah.

1260
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,800
Yeah, according to one myth, I'll say it.

1261
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,320
It's a fucking myth.

1262
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,840
I don't think any of it happened.

1263
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,320
Well, some of it maybe did.

1264
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,480
I only believe in the New Testament.

1265
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,320
You're a no Old Testament Jew.

1266
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
You're a reverse Jew.

1267
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,360
What happened in the New Testament?

1268
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,360
What happened in the...

1269
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,160
Did you grow up religious at all?

1270
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,480
Yeah, but I never really paid attention.

1271
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
What does that mean?

1272
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,480
I never paid attention in a church that would take me.

1273
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,480
I won't like it or listen at all.

1274
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,480
You didn't pay attention to the thing that you thought was the entirety of existence when you were a child?

1275
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,480
No, that never really faced me, I don't think.

1276
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Interesting.

1277
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
I didn't really care.

1278
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
He just liked the candles.

1279
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,480
I didn't like the candles.

1280
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
Candles are cool.

1281
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,480
Well, they used to take me to this Christian church.

1282
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,480
It was one of those Christian churches where they have a band.

1283
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:23,480
And I think the one thing I liked the most was how they put like the drummer in like a cage so it wouldn't make too much noise.

1284
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:39,480
I do love that shit. My mom was a worship leader so I would have to go like two hours before the church started at like six in the morning and just sit there and watch the songs for two hours.

1285
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,480
So I pretty much fuck with contemporary Christian music to a degree that you would never believe.

1286
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,480
I'm going to be honest with you.

1287
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Were you, you know, we were talking about being bad kids earlier.

1288
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,480
I would get in so much trouble on every holiday because, you know, my parents would take me

1289
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,480
to like some three hour long service and I would have an ADD meltdown 30 minutes in and

1290
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
be like, can we go home?

1291
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,480
I want to go home.

1292
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,480
I wish I had my Nintendo SP, my Game Boy SP.

1293
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,480
I had ways of getting in trouble.

1294
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,320
I wish I had my Nintendo SP, my Game Boy SP.

1295
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,600
I had ways of entertaining myself, like before I had like a phone.

1296
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,520
So I used to, I got in a lot of trouble because I used to take the pamphlet that they put

1297
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:26,560
in the, in Christian churches, they put a pamphlet in the, like the, it's a newsletter

1298
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,560
basically.

1299
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,620
It's like, this is what's going on in the church this week.

1300
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:34,720
And I would take it and I would take the pen that they put there so you can like make notes.

1301
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,640
I would take the pen and I would just black out a bunch of the letters and all the words

1302
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,820
so that it would say like like at first it would say like

1303
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,720
There's a potluck this weekend

1304
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:52,080
Everybody come by and bring your favorite dish and I would change it to say I fucked a turd and then I would hand it

1305
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
to my grandma

1306
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,000
She would, she would laugh and she'd go stop.

1307
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,060
And then my mom would catch wind of this eventually and I would get in a lot of

1308
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,220
trouble. But yeah, I would just,

1309
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,900
I would just black out the letters and make it say cusses and uh,

1310
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,700
so you were entertaining yourself, but you still got in trouble.

1311
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,420
The end result was still the same.

1312
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:23,300
Yeah. And also gum gum got me through a lot of church. I would have like, uh,

1313
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,260
my grandma always had gum and uh, I would, I would take, you know,

1314
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,500
a piece of gum every five minutes until my entire mouth was so full of gum.

1315
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,340
I can barely open it.

1316
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,100
I love doing that.

1317
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,740
And then I would blow just the biggest bubble at like the most dramatic part of

1318
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,580
the sermon.

1319
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,220
Completely silent.

1320
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:43,980
Yeah. Just all over my face. I just have a giant pink,

1321
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,340
a transparent thing on my face.

1322
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,740
And there was an upside of not having hair. Can't get gum in it.

1323
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,780
True. I can do a bubble all the way around my head.

1324
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,980
Yeah. You could do the cleft lip bubble.

1325
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,980
- Yeah, I had no, there was no reason,

1326
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,780
or there was a reason that I had to stop at some point.

1327
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,100
I was pushing into a dangerous zone

1328
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,200
by blowing a bubble too big so I could get at my hair.

1329
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,740
Now, the training wheels are off.

1330
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,740
- One thing I never really understood about church

1331
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,680
was when the, what if like the preachers

1332
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,580
would just like start speaking in tongues

1333
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,620
and holding women's faces and like they would cry.

1334
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,100
I wouldn't, I would be like, what is he saying?

1335
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,740
Why is he saying that?

1336
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,620
You guys had speaking in tongues?

1337
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,420
Yeah.

1338
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,340
That's so interesting, because I think of that

1339
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:38,020
as a pretty distinctly like American South Christianity.

1340
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,980
They don't really have that in the North.

1341
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,060
It sounded like a lot of gibberish.

1342
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,540
It probably came from like revivals in Texas and stuff.

1343
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,500
That probably all just spread a few kilometers down.

1344
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,100
I do think that a lot of like churches,

1345
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,580
like Christian churches, also have their starts in Texas.

1346
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,200
One of the, there's like a really big church down here

1347
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,240
that I think they're, they're originated from like Dallas

1348
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,600
and they like send a lot of people down here.

1349
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,120
I actually live like right next to like one of the coffee

1350
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,080
shops where like a lot of the people like come

1351
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,200
and just hang out.

1352
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,040
Just like we used to get like a lot of Americans.

1353
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,320
Do you have Christian coffee shops?

1354
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,160
Yeah.

1355
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,240
Yeah, we had those in my hometown.

1356
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,360
Like coffee shops that are attached to a church

1357
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,960
and you walk in and you're like,

1358
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,800
why are these prices so low?

1359
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,680
Well, there's one that's attached to the church

1360
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,760
And there's one that's like right here

1361
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,020
that's just like owned by one of the,

1362
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,800
either the preacher or someone who works at the church.

1363
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,440
So we got a lot of people who go to the church,

1364
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,240
or people who come from like Dallas.

1365
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,680
Just tell Americans she's hanging out

1366
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,600
in my neighborhood for no reason.

1367
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,920
- That is so awesome.

1368
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,420
- It's all right.

1369
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,080
I don't really like that coffee shop much.

1370
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,480
It's kind of expensive.

1371
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,080
- I love Americans.

1372
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,320
They're very good people.

1373
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,800
- Yeah, sure.

1374
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,500
- Do you have a lot of Americans in your city?

1375
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,880
Not as many as the Mexico City, right?

1376
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,120
- There is, I do think that I live in a neighborhood

1377
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,520
with a lot of foreigners.

1378
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,120
I've seen a lot of Americans that even just live

1379
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,480
in one of these buildings in this neighborhood.

1380
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,680
So yeah, I think there are way more Americans

1381
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,760
than I thought originally, like a year ago.

1382
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,800
- Rex is fading.

1383
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,720
- I'm fucking--

1384
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,720
Rex is fading away. I'm like half asleep.

1385
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,720
He's fading away into another dimension.

1386
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,720
That's okay. It's beers we drank. We can end it early. I don't care.

1387
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,720
If you're actually falling asleep, I think that's a pretty good...

1388
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,720
We could do five more minutes. I'm a soldier. I'm a soldier of beer.

1389
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,720
If you were a soldier, you'd be dishonorably discharged for falling asleep at your post right now.

1390
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,720
Yeah, it would kill you.

1391
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,720
No, I would be on some sort of amphetamine and I would be fully awake.

1392
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,560
Doesn't that sound amazing?

1393
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,000
The shit they were giving people during Vietnam.

1394
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,840
Oh my God.

1395
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,200
- Both of my roommates took Adderall today

1396
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,420
and I like had to like,

1397
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,160
that thing in the back of my brain was like,

1398
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,120
"Just fucking do it.

1399
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,960
Just take it.

1400
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,360
They're offering it to you.

1401
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,260
He's cutting up a 20 right now.

1402
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,120
Just take a little piece."

1403
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:11,940
- You should have just done it.

1404
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,780
- I'd be like, "No, no."

1405
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,440
- It would have gotten you through your whole day.

1406
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,280
- I know.

1407
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,480
- You would have had an amazing day.

1408
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,060
And then there would have been no repercussions.

1409
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,640
You would have just fallen asleep perfectly,

1410
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,560
slept like an angel.

1411
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,280
- No, you know what, now he's gonna go to sleep early,

1412
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,360
well, kind of early, and he's gonna wake up tomorrow

1413
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,960
at 7 a.m., he's gonna go walk his dog

1414
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,320
and throw his poop on someone's foot.

1415
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,280
(laughing)

1416
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,880
- It's a normal morning routine.

1417
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,760
- I'm honestly like, I'm just so excited

1418
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,340
to not work on a laptop anymore.

1419
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:44,000
- Yeah, that's a big upgrade.

1420
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,440
- Yeah.

1421
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,040
I love my stupid desk and my computer.

1422
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,440
- The standing desk is pretty fucking awesome.

1423
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,240
Sitting at the computer is one of the best feelings in the world.

1424
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:58,040
I literally like, I was on my feet for 13 hours today.

1425
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:04,740
And I finally at 6.15 p.m. pulled up my office chair,

1426
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,740
lowered the standing desk and sat in it for two straight hours and didn't move.

1427
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:14,640
I got a better feeling than just sitting at the desk.

1428
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,440
Which is?

1429
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,340
Sleeping on a real bed.

1430
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,940
Oh, I am so excited for that as well.

1431
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,340
I bought a new comforter because I've been getting chilly.

1432
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,340
Yeah.

1433
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,340
I came today.

1434
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,340
It's perfect.

1435
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,340
Yeah, I'm coming to work.

1436
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,340
It's not cold tonight actually.

1437
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:36,380
Yeah, the nights get cold and I'm like right on the street so it's like sometimes you get

1438
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,020
a little wind and action.

1439
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:42,380
And you like to keep that AC nice and low.

1440
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
I do.

1441
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,380
I keep it at 72.

1442
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,940
- Oh, I would never, I would not even be able to think of sleeping at 72.

1443
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,900
That is so hot.

1444
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,580
- 72?

1445
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,620
- I'm a cold blooded creature.

1446
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,580
I'm from the desert, dude.

1447
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,780
- This is what mine's at right now.

1448
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,740
It's a 25, which is, I'll give you the thing right now.

1449
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,740
- I sleep, I'm fully clothed, I'm under a blanket and I'm cold.

1450
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:13,900
- You have a, dude, I cannot sleep if it's above 67 degrees.

1451
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,220
Well, it's like it's hot down here.

1452
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:17,300
So like it's hot.

1453
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,460
Seven is no, I don't live in the desert like I do.

1454
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,220
I live I live on.

1455
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,980
I walk outside their sand.

1456
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,260
I cactus.

1457
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,900
He doesn't understand the desert.

1458
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,220
Yeah, you do not live in a desert.

1459
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,740
You live in a beautiful mountain vista.

1460
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,420
We've seen your view.

1461
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,780
Well, there was mountains in Arizona, but he has like snow capped.

1462
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,020
Yeah, you are full of shit, dude.

1463
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,660
You guys have red mountains.

1464
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,700
What's the hottest your summer gets?

1465
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,260
Say it in Celsius.

1466
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,060
Oh, no, like around 40.

1467
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,520
Yeah, it's 40, 44, 45.

1468
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,060
You're a fucking bitch.

1469
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:50,320
It's not. Yeah, that's nothing.

1470
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,820
There's never been a 45 degree summer in fucking Mexico City.

1471
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,400
Get the fuck out of Mexico City

1472
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,300
in fucking Guadalajara, wherever you fucking live.

1473
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,400
What is 45? 95?

1474
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,560
No, it's like 100 something.

1475
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,760
I mean, it'll be 100 degrees in in New York in the summer.

1476
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:13,600
44.8 this year.

1477
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,040
That was the high?

1478
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,540
Yeah.

1479
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,720
So that is-- sorry, I don't know.

1480
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,400
That's 112.

1481
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,880
Oh my god, that's hot.

1482
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,440
It's a lie.

1483
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,840
He's not telling the truth.

1484
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,920
I'm closer to the equator.

1485
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,600
I just Googled this.

1486
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,920
I literally just Googled this.

1487
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,040
It was 112--

1488
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,600
Highest number in Mexico.

1489
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,320
Highest somebody can count in Mexico.

1490
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,080
44.8.

1491
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,600
It was a hot ass summer.

1492
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
It's finally kind of winding down.

1493
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,600
I'm ignoring this blatant racism by Hitler.

1494
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
It's not blatant, it's very subtle.

1495
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Adolf Hitler 2.

1496
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,600
It's coming at you.

1497
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,600
It looks like twin Hitlers, that's what I'm looking at right now.

1498
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,600
You both have the same...

1499
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Well join us dude. You need to join us.

1500
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,600
I grow reverse Hitler.

1501
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,600
I can only grow the outsides.

1502
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,600
This is how not racist I am.

1503
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,600
The middle of my mustache refuses to put anything there.

1504
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,000
- I'm just gonna pin it on.

1505
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,840
Just get ahead of him.

1506
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,040
- Go into the barber shop, give me the Hitler.

1507
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,000
(laughing)

1508
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,960
- They would do it, man.

1509
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,640
- Line me up.

1510
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,840
- They would do that shit.

1511
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,420
- Line me up with the Hitler.

1512
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,100
- Let's let Rex go to bed.

1513
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,280
He's very, very tired.

1514
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,360
- Goodbye.

1515
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,200
- Goodbye.

1516
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,100
- Oh, wait, wait, Bud Light Lime rating,

1517
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,680
this is a six foot nine.

1518
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:38,000
Michelob Ultra rating, this is a six foot four.

1519
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,840
- I love Michelob Ultra.

1520
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,040
is an amazing beer.

1521
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,080
Meek Love Ultra, it's fine.

1522
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,920
- Yeah.

1523
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,040
- All right, bye.
