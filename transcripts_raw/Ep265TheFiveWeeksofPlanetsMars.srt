1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,080
say what you said camera. He's stuck his wiener. No, no, not that part.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,760
We're not even going to acknowledge that. What do you want me to say? We're

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,320
not even going to talk about that. You said before we start recording. You

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,200
said, why do I feel like it would be so fucking fun to be in a relationship

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,840
with every single person in my family?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,320
I didn't say that you did. You said that I said it right now. Copycatting

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,960
you. Why did you say that? Because you said that he said and by the way, we're

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,840
talking about romantic relationships, and so you were saying why do I why do I

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,260
feel like it would be so I mean I'm already in a familial relationship, but

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,580
you meant like like like I did, man, like finger, I like like my family. I

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,700
love them. You meant like squirting. I love my family. He just said he like

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,360
likes his family likes like more than like my family. I love every member of

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,360
my you like like your own mom squirted on his mommy. Oh, what are you doing?

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
you're taking this to a strange you're acting differently with your hair.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,200
You're doing a strain. You are taking it. Keep that thing away.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,720
Guys, if you can't guess based on how we're dressed today, it's Mar.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,620
Welcome back to the five weeks of planets week to week to day one week

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,860
to day one day one out of two part three week to day one and we've I've

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,560
already seen a fatal error that we've made, which is that we gave Patrick

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,000
something to do. What do you mean? What's wrong with this? You have something to

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,280
play with, which is, yeah, that's, you know, it's not an actual penis, so I'm

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,320
not really grossed out by it. It's nothing wrong with, there's nothing...

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Patrick found... This is gonna be the best episode of all time and it's gonna

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,200
be age restricted. Yeah, that's a little bit of a problem. Yeah, 'cause you have

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,880
this devil tail. It's not a... You're wearing a cock ring, bro. You should have

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
had a red juice. Okay, well, let me tell you a little story, then. Let's go

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,240
through the cock ring. Let me tell you a little story. Wait a minute, wait a

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,320
it green juice, green pants. I do have green pants on because I didn't have red

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,000
pants. But listen, let's go through the costume. I literally woke up, I put on my

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,200
red outfit and I said, I gotta go get myself a red tea. I walked into the

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,880
miniature grocery store and I said, give me a red tea right now. And they said,

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,840
there's no such thing as red tea, we only have green tea. So I got a green tea,

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,960
man. You could have got a brown tea. Brown tea is not brown. It's the red

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,200
planet, but in reality... Okay, but obviously we were all going for full red,

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,840
Yeah, well, let me let me let's talk it over there, because my outfit here, I've

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,560
got the red for Mars, the red planet, which is with oxidation and it's

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,880
everything. Yeah, but I've also you'll notice here I've got the I've got the

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,120
white stripes as well. Wow. And what are the white stripes represent? You might

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,200
ask Jack White and his wife Meg White. That's not what it represents. That's

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,640
what it is. That was the white stripes. That's the name. But what my white

42
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,760
white stripes represent is ice because guys Mars is a cold planet and it has

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,120
ice on it. It's not cold. It's red hot. It's cold as fuck. Okay, somebody okay,

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,400
somebody needs to hear the planet report. I mean, I surely need to be, but we'll

45
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,760
get to that and of course I got my I got I have got red red, a red Mars aid

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,000
Martian red Gatorade G for galactic galaxy galactic aid galactic aid and

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,600
obviously I'm in a red. I'm in a red shirt with some red shorts. Tell me why

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,600
I have a wait. I forgot one thing. I have a red hat and red faction right here on

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,600
the icon on my hat. It's a hand holding a sword and Mars is the God of War. Wow

50
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,240
holy shit man. So I'm wearing the wig because the if you look closely at this

51
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,040
planet of Mars, it is kind of a rust colour. You're wearing a kind of a

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,080
strawberry blonde, strawberry blonde. Mars is kind of a strawberry blonde

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,080
looking planet and Mars is the devilishly red planet. So I have a

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,620
devil's tail on my front.

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,620
And also,

56
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
I thought that that would be...

57
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,120
Why do you have these glittery...

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah, stand up and stand on the chair here.

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
For lack of a better word.

60
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Stand on that chair and face backwards.

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
And he's got the, he's got red underwear on.

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Yep, the shorts.

63
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Underneath, yeah.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
The shorts are very short.

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,120
And these shorts, I gotta say, man, little fruity.

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
What's fruity about that?

67
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,120
I should have had like a lav mic clipped to this.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
That would have been nasty.

69
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
I love making Pat stand on the chair.

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,320
I hit the I hit the headphone cable.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,520
I hit the cable on the way down.

73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,000
I think that if we're going to if you're going to make me stand on the

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,100
chair, you got it. Like make sure if you love you like a ladder. I

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,920
understand you need to stabilize me.

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,020
My outfit man.

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,520
Yeah.

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,400
Well, I have a Marlboro red hoodie on right because what does it dial

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,960
because the Mar Mar's moves so fast through the galaxy that it leaves a

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,120
trail of smoke. Did you guys know that? Why? Probably in your plan to report and

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,420
I have on my jacket, oh, a red jacket, you might think just a normal red jacket.

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait, what does it say? You read to me Cairo, America and college Cairo. What

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,440
country is that in Egypt, Egypt and what kind of thing do they have in Egypt sand

84
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,840
the sand and guess what Mars is covered in or at least it kind of looks like it

85
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,420
sand, some kind of red ass sand, soil and dust and then also wow he's wearing a

86
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,160
bandana. Wait, but that's a black bandana. That's not no red bandana.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Well,

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
guess what

89
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
the bloods wear bandanas. Okay, and bloods are red, but also the gun,

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,380
shoot iron bullets and yeah and also the guns are war like war. Exactly that too.

91
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,440
Yeah, that too man. I mean the layers to my outfit are amazing and my tongue's

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,260
I feel like we really I feel like we we knocked out of the way this one. No, we

93
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,700
hit a hat trick. We got three goals. Yeah, one, two, three, three. Do I have

94
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,460
green pants on? Yeah, man, we're within 90 days of Christmas. So shut the hell

95
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,700
up and green is there is a complimentary color of red. Exactly. The future of

96
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,580
Mars. Yeah, green could have been the past of Mars. That's something I want to

97
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,620
get into. Yeah, there if we do there, if we do nuke both the poles and then

98
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,060
create a new ice age that creates water in Earth. And also don't forget about

99
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,520
but Martians and Sid the slow Martians, which are green yes. So Mars is kind of

100
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,260
populated by green. No, it's happily being okay, all right, green green,

101
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,420
that's why you're green. You're drinking your green bean juice and it's almost

102
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Thanksgiving green bean casserole yeah. So the connections are just out of the

103
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,820
one. There have been so many crazy connection. Oh yeah, wait,

104
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,420
Castle Wall,

105
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,980
but it could be there could be a castle on Mars. So last night, Cameron watch

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,320
jerk. I didn't watch it last night, but I watch it this week. Well, you watch it

107
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,560
this week. I watched it last night independently of Cameron. We didn't even

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,380
know each other. How do you even know each other had watched it until Cameron

109
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,580
said that he watched it this week to tear it to take a day. I said it to

110
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,740
tay. He said it so we booked felt as if watching now. Let's think about this

111
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,580
Steve Martin, Steve Martian. Holy fuck.

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,840
that's awesome. You're a freak, green Martian, greens, Martian, Steve, he

113
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,480
plays

114
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,900
a character named no. He plays the

115
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,700
the Pluto

116
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,440
instead of the banjo. I don't know any that's pretty good. Yeah, that's good and

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,300
he's a does he play the banjo in the movie? No, he plays a band as he's

118
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,900
famous. General, I know that yeah, I was still on the wild and crazy fly,

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,880
because he flies around arose through his head because of war. Well, it would be a

120
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,000
platter could also be pointing to a planet. Yeah, that's oh yeah, that or it

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,280
could be like oh, I'm going to go this way. Yeah, only murder or maybe it's a

122
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,280
reference to to Arrhenius only murders only murders in the

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,880
planet galaxy in the galaxy. That would be actually that be that would be a

124
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,720
very that'd be a very cheery show. Yeah, oh Selena Gomez painted purple and

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,880
because she's an alien, she'd be fully naked. Yeah, be so off. She would look

126
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Max Serena,

127
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,660
she's a purple Salina Gomez, her going live on I G

128
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,020
just fully purple. My name horns popping out of her face, still giant boobs.

129
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,860
Yeah, she's awesome. No, she's not awesome. What's wrong with her? Why you

130
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,180
like her? She is being a dim wit. She's

131
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,260
talking about our earth part problems. Oh, you're right earth earth. We're

132
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,120
you in the past. Earth, we're on Mars. We're in the future. We're over you, Earth.

133
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,840
Yo, Earth, you suck, man. Earth, you suck. It's over for Earth. You got a lot of problems.

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,320
You done, Earth. You done. You got a lot of problems, Earth. You done. Something about

135
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,200
this wig makes me want to talk like this. We got Thomas from Pindeo time. Hey, what's up,

136
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,520
you guys? And he hates Earth, man. I fucking hate the Earth. Speaking of Thomas, no, I was

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,920
I was going to say he put out that rap a couple of weeks ago. You want to get him

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,000
on a OJ track? Maybe. That was a good rap. That was a good rap. That rap that

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,820
Thomas made was very, very good.

140
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:04,000
Should I blow this load? Should I go right into OJ's rap? No, man. All right.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
We talked about it. No, we're going to do plan a report and then we'll do mine

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,980
and then we'll end with OJ, man. Then, speaking of Thomas, his last name is

143
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,000
Report. I don't know if many of you know that. That's not true. It's Re-

144
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,720
Anyway, what I was wondering, do you guys think that what do you think the

145
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,960
states will be like on Mars? The United States of Mars? Yeah, what kind of

146
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,140
states do they have there? They probably will have an analog, it's maybe like

147
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,480
a Bizarro. I bet they have 5,000 over there. Bizarro states, Bizarro USA.

148
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,760
It's not Bizarro Earth though, why would it be Bizarro States? They have their

149
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
own shit. Well, it is kind of the Bizarro Earth if you think about it.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,140
They have no green. It depends... What kind of question is this? It depends

151
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,640
on who is colonizing it, and I hate to say that shit, but that's how it

152
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,760
fucking works, man. Yeah. Whoever gets there first and says, "This is

153
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,560
we called Stephen. Didn't we get there first? The Martians were there first.

154
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,460
Man, we nobody's been there. Well, you would know that if we had gone a robot,

155
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,780
you know, I'll do the I'll do the planet report and I'm going to clear a few

156
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,780
things up. All right, clear this up, clear the air. Join us once again on a

157
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,840
five week galactic journey through our solar system.

158
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Be prepared to learn and to laugh a little too.

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,200
And now the planet report with Cameron Fetter.

160
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh my God, can you open up the drive? This will not be normal for planet

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,840
reports, but I put a little visual aid together for this. This is incredible

162
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,160
already. There's a power point here. That's

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,520
TV is

164
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,520
everybody, but nobody else will be able to see it just us yeah.

165
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,600
Okay, so just ignore all the crazy red lines.

166
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,720
I don't think they can see that. Okay, I know I'm talking to you guys. Oh

167
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,760
okay, I did. Hopefully they can't see I'm sure they can't. So you guys know

168
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,080
about poetry, right? Yes, more than anybody as a rapper. I know and have

169
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,840
you guys ever heard of acrostic poems? Yes, so these are poems where the

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,720
first letter of the poem, every word in the poem creates the word of the

171
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,240
title. Oh, I'm intimately familiar. So this is called

172
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,880
Mars, a planet report by Cameron Fetter and I've put together, it is an

173
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,760
acrostic poem where it spells the word Mars over and over again. So I have

174
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,000
a visual aid here, but if you're just listening, you should be able to

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,100
pick up all you'll you'll get the rhythm of it. M A R M A R S Y'all so

176
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm just going to go ahead and and and start it start reading through it to

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,340
teach you guys some facts in the form of poetry this time. Wow pop Mars all red

178
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,100
stuff

179
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,700
and you're just juvie you're just gonna have to click through for me because we

180
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,400
don't have a clicker, mostly a rocky surface. Okay,

181
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,800
meager atmosphere rather scarce

182
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,140
makes all respirators suffocate. Wow. Me air require some

183
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,100
Mars air really skinny. There's not this skinny

184
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Mars average rotational speed

185
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,600
matches almost rotational speed.

186
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,000
My affiliated residential sphere, the Earth

187
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,160
have a similar rotation. Moons, ah, revolving speedily.

188
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,440
Mars as rocky satellites.

189
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,060
That's a British kind of twinge there. Mars as? Moons amount, roughly some.

190
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,260
Oh, Phobos. And Deimos. Mars, the name, also represent significance.

191
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:35,180
Moniker ancient Roman supreme mascot and representing strife.

192
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,740
I love strife.

193
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,880
Military action, ruckus, swords.

194
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,500
Many aliens really seem majority at Red Sphere.

195
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,580
Okay.

196
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,220
Martians aren't real species.

197
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,060
Maybe, ask research scientists.

198
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:03,240
My answer requires studying more asinine research scientists.

199
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,940
Martians are real stupid.

200
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,560
Moron.

201
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Really sorry.

202
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,340
That's kind.

203
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,200
My anger rises sometimes.

204
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,020
Me apologize really sincerely.

205
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,380
Man.

206
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,420
Anyway returning subject.

207
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Mars actually rather small.

208
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Mercury, ah, remember?

209
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Smaller.

210
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Most all round spheres,

211
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
much ampler round size.

212
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Many astronomers recently spotted

213
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,420
markings about reservoir subterraneanly.

214
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Mankind hasn't reached surface.

215
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,820
send Mars actually rich scientist

216
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,520
Musk astronauts recruiting send Mars a royal situation

217
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,620
me and recording squad. That's us. Yeah

218
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,820
Musk a door real shit

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,420
me and recording squad

221
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,020
Mars all repay sexually what all repay sexually all mentioned all research

222
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,860
statistics

223
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,500
mystified anything relax see

224
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,740
me after report sayonara

225
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:39,140
and that's today's planet report from all my God amazing that was amazing that

226
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,420
was one of the best reports I've seen. I learned so much shit man. What are you

227
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,220
saying that we have to suck and fuck Elon Musk? Yeah, I just figured out

228
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,220
tweeting the offer. If he's not going to send us a Mars for free, but what if

229
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,560
why there's got to be something between free and well, the line is lined up.

230
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,500
What else am I going to do money money? No, it was it was a RS. There's all you

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,980
can do money sexually. No, the M is not the M. The M is not in place. All all

232
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:13,780
repay significantly. So money all wheels we are. I would have found I feel like

233
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,920
that doesn't fit money. Gently all are sending sentiment. That's not that you

234
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,860
said the only money.

235
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,420
Massim, that's what you're saying right now. Money all are the letter are

236
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,940
sending again. The M is any money apostrophe. There's a what we are. He

237
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,900
doesn't need what are we going to offer him besides a pleasure? What was

238
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,400
moonshine? It's something home. All are sending. You have to be something that

239
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,020
you can't buy and that's that's sex from they make sense men who don't normally

240
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,860
sell sex. Well, that is the rare thing. It's priceless. I guess you're right.

241
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,420
Yeah, there is almost no price on having sex with my bottom. Yeah, yeah,

242
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,500
there's not anything that's priceless. My bottom is completely priceless. It's

243
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,380
something they would auction off. It's worth like so billions of dollars rare.

244
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,860
It's like it's never been done before. Well, it's like a like an olive wagyu

245
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,540
kind of like level of rarity and like this has never been seen before. Yeah,

246
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,500
I'm can't even you can't even assign a monitor. This is like I'm like when

247
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,780
Martin Shkreli bought that Wu Tang album, yeah, is it that could have easily been

248
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,220
my butthole? You could you could do the same thing where you add in a clause

249
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,220
that someone can come rescue you? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Someone can come steal

250
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:30,660
you back.

251
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:38,820
I'm looking here at this Google thing and it says the Google image or the Google

252
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,220
the bar up here, whatever it's called Mars is amazing. It's images, news,

253
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,980
videos, photos, planets, definitions and then chocolate. Can you click on

254
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,500
chocolate? I'm going to see Mars, making Mars. Oh my God, they should just add a

255
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,140
chocolate tab for everything. Now you can always web images, shopping and

256
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,860
chocolate. Wow, my snacking Mars makes a kind bars. What the hell is that? What

257
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,600
what the fuck

258
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,600
they make orbit orbit. That makes sense, but kind is kind is a surprise. I

259
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,340
didn't surprise, but

260
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,500
yeah, well alien kind on Mars. Have you thought about that? Well, the TV went

261
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,320
back. Oh yeah, that's true. I fixed it. Mars chocolate fix the TV.

262
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,520
Oh my God, I said that it's jittering anyway. The TV doesn't matter. The TV

263
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,140
does not matter. What does matter is our planets back to Mars guys, the five

264
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,920
six planets. We're rolling through these at a breakneck speed and almost they

265
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,960
were rotating every single thing that we need to get out every thought we've

266
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,420
ever had about these planets ever. Here's my thought about this planet. Why

267
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,120
is it called Mars? It's called you weren't you paying attention to the

268
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,240
planet report shut the fuck up shut the fuck up. He wasn't paying shut up shut

269
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,640
up shut up shut up shut the fuck up. I said moniker. I'm not done. I'm not

270
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,160
done.

271
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,760
Why is it called Mars, but there's only one of them

272
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,760
because of the ancient Roman Empire, be called Mar

273
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,240
Mar,

274
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,880
something I was thinking about here's something that I was thinking about on

275
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,680
the walk over here. Actually, when I think about more stuff, Mars is I

276
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,160
believe the month of March is named after the planet of Mars. Is that true?

277
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,300
I think that's true and we're in March right now, and I think that even one of

278
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,360
the days of the week might be named after Mars, Mars day, Mary, no, never

279
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,520
mind. There's no Mars day. I got mixed up thing. A Monday, yeah, I was thinking

280
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,360
moon day you're thinking of moon day. My bad, my bad y'all there's, but there's

281
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,800
a sad, but there's a French day that we called Mardi Mardi Gras now what's that

282
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,360
Tuesday? It's fat Tuesday, Marty Gras day is named after Mars. Marty Gras makes

283
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,960
women take off their bras,

284
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,240
but I

285
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,120
bars and spars and spars and sparts. Well, they're already doing it at spars

286
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,480
year round around true year. I know wait guys. We should literally become

287
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,380
a spa worker so we can see women naked all the time.

288
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:05,880
That's a fucking it's a great idea. I never thought of nobody thought of oh my

289
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,640
God yeah I'm all these people who are wasting their time jacking off to porn.

290
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,840
Just get a job at us.

291
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:20,360
You doing are you brain dead? Then you're making money while you look at

292
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,880
all the naked women. Yeah, that's a great idea. Cameron

293
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,060
Oh, my God, a great thing to say we have to go on shark tank. We have to pitch

294
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,800
the mark Cuban and Mr. Wonderful. You have to a spa for women who don't mind

295
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,280
being ogled yeah, a spa where you spot how about there's a spa where you go for

296
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,860
free and you get a bunch of perverts who pay to why oh it's like add it's like

297
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,060
free. Yeah, it's a premium so like if a woman wants to go to a spot, you could

298
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,280
either you could either perverts are paying double with

299
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,720
it's a great idea. You either pay fifty dollars to go to a normal spot. You pay

300
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,040
zero. Meanwhile, the perverts, Patrick and Cameron are sitting behind. I didn't

301
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,440
say that I was going to be there. Oh wait, here's the thing, though you could

302
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,000
do even I'm literally the inventor of this company. I wouldn't be one of the

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,680
perverts. You can even do you. Well, you have to test it out. You can even do

304
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,520
tears of the I would honestly be whipping and torturing the pervert. The

305
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,440
pervert tears could be this dude. Listen to this. You can be you could either

306
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,920
have it's a it's a perfect. It's a perfect honey pot. We pitch this business

307
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,060
from Shark Tank and then we

308
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,560
we post

309
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,400
we tell them afterwards like we and this the secret don't air this part on your

310
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,240
TV show, but actually we're going to kill all the perfect. We don't want to

311
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,740
kill. We're going to get the and John and Tanchik were you guys. Okay, you

312
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,280
guys are fucking idiots because you're wasting a million dollar idea. You could

313
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,680
even have a wants to go. You could even have it be tiered where there's windows

314
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,820
that you that they can be seen through both sides and that tickets fifty

315
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,180
dollars. They already have in there shut up. There's one that is that is a

316
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,900
a mirror. What do they call that a double sided mirror, one way, one way,

317
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,940
two way, a two way mirror, it really is and that one is more money so that

318
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,300
your identity is hidden and then there's one that's even more that is a

319
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,540
private cube. They have they have this already the window and everything it's

320
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,940
called a peep show, but these women, these women are just doing their own

321
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,660
thing, though they can put on a show yeah, but wouldn't you want to pay for

322
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,700
women doing the show? If we're trying to maximize profit, I just thought of an

323
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,500
even better idea, Caleb kind of jumping off of your two way mirror idea.

324
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,700
yeah. What if we have it? It's all two way mirrors. The perverts pay a

325
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,200
hundred dollars to come watch from behind the mirror, and the women also

326
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,580
are charged a hundred dollars to use the spa, and they don't know the

327
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,440
perverts are watching them.

328
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh, and it is that's double the money. The perverts pay an extra five bucks.

329
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,380
They could fuck the women.

330
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,200
Well, no, because that kind of brings the whole thing tumbling down. Yeah,

331
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,060
well, let's just let's just cut out the whole spa thing and just guys pay five

332
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,640
bucks to fuck women. Yeah, I guess that's in a bathroom. I feel like you

333
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I don't know. What do you mean? The girls get a cut. The girls get $2.50? Yeah, they also

334
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:01,220
get to have sex. Sex is awesome. They're going to say yeah. I don't know. I don't know about

335
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,660
that. You don't think we'll get any girls? I don't think we'll get any girls. I think

336
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,660
if it was men, I think you could get gay men to do this. Why do they have to be gay? Because

337
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,520
(laughter)

338
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,900
- Okay, woke.

339
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
- Yeah, what, you're trying to woke-ify it.

340
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,420
- I'm trying to woke-ify it.

341
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
Yeah, okay.

342
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
- Okay, wait.

343
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,500
- Okay, yes, I was trying to woke-ify it.

344
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,460
- Let's think about this even better.

345
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Okay, so a spa where gay guys pay to watch straight guys

346
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:33,180
and the straight guys are, nah, that might not work.

347
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,740
- Yeah, but if you're a straight guy going to that,

348
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,080
there's like, you're like a little bit,

349
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,280
you're a little bit, you're maybe like a one on the Kinsey scale or some share or

350
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,440
two, if you're like. Is that gay or straight? I think that's like. Which side

351
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,160
is which? He thinks. Well, which side is which though, I'm asking. It's Patrick

352
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Kinsey, by the way.

353
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,760
What if we invented a machine that turns straight guys into gay guys? I think it,

354
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,480
what is it, a zero and then the negative is completely straight. You should come

355
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,560
up with your own Kinsey scale. It should be Caleb to Patrick.

356
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,840
And Cameron kind of right there in the middle.

357
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,180
sure yeah, that's a pretty good idea yeah, and why does this guy came out and

358
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,620
we're all

359
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,920
really

360
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,260
tiny yeah

361
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,400
zoom it out. That's from four to five.

362
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,420
This is the

363
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,400
Cameron Patrick scale. It's a subset of the kids. It's nine point seven.

364
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,580
More specific than the Kinsey scale. This is the way to do

365
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,520
it's like the brackets on or like the lines on a ruler.

366
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,080
Somehow, it's somehow a triangle overlaid over the line of the

367
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,860
Kinsey's get like or somehow out in three different directions

368
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,820
from the same like

369
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,500
it's different subclasses. It's

370
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,000
that's funny.

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
This wig is itchy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I keep moving my I

372
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,800
don't want to take it off. It will ruin the outfit. You think

373
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,880
it'll ruin your fit? I don't think it will ruin your fit. If

374
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,360
you took it off. I did say this before you do look like a magic school bus

375
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,300
character right now. Yeah, you the one with the mustache, the one who's

376
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,400
sneaking onto the bus to hang out with the kids. You do look like a car to

377
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,800
name is frizzles me Carlos. I don't know if you remember me

378
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,900
last night, so don't think anything

379
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:28,280
where we go today. We're going to we're going to the we're going to the public

380
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,120
pool. I have an idea. Let's all shrink down and go inside my body. Yeah,

381
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh, my God, I feel a little sick today. I think about I guess I can't go. It's

382
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,860
really go. All these kids should just go in and that's it. There's a bus of

383
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,120
yours and miss and you can stay here and you can watch and also to make sure

384
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
the kids nothing bad happens. You can make sure that

385
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,640
I

386
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Billy Madison, if he was on that magic school bus, I mean

387
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,240
God only knows what that would have been. He'd be peeing his pants all over

388
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,760
the bus. He'd be going.

389
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,000
He was

390
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,240
that thing. How about this? How about a movie theater? You know everybody hates

391
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,140
these jacking off style movie theaters. Yeah, that Pee Wee Herman got cut in.

392
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,200
Why did he get in trouble for that? Because he was jacking off. That was a,

393
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,720
that's got to be a, it was a porno theater. Yeah, but you're still not

394
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,360
supposed to be doing that. You're, it's a gray area. People always say that. I

395
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,840
mean, it's like it's still legal. You can't be like, oh, it's a playground, who

396
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,760
cares? That's different. That's a false equivalency. No, it's the same exact

397
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,500
thing. No

398
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,840
what you think you think mommy's and daddy's you think mommy's and daddy's

399
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,960
were in the movie theater, because when I got that story explained to me as a

400
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,560
child by my uncle Kevin, he said that he was jacking off in a movie theater. He

401
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,500
did not tell me he was jacking off in an adult. Well, it's your kid. He's not

402
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,760
going to tell you about porno theaters. Almost every movie theater is for a

403
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,320
don't. He was saying what jacking off was, but he doesn't want you to let you

404
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,480
know about me a little. It's like how you're allowed to say like to your to

405
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,680
nephew, you can say like you know it's possible to make napalm with home

406
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,420
ingredients, but you can't listen to listen. I like you. I guess I can see

407
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,240
the logic breaking bad. You can kind of go through all the steps of cooking

408
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,400
meth, but you have to change what it's got to be and it's got to be candy. One

409
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,240
crucial step. That means that when you try to make it at home, it kills you.

410
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,680
Yeah, that's what they should have done. I'm breaking about. They should have

411
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,040
done it like a recipe for meth, but if you follow it, you die. It makes poison

412
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,360
gas and kills you. I think or it doesn't it doesn't make meth. It makes like a

413
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,080
fucking like it just makes a slime or elephant toothpaste or something

414
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,440
elephant toothpaste. That would have been funny if they made a

415
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,400
fist. Oh, I thought you just said we got to show him a thing to say that's a

416
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,840
thing. If I was on breaking bad, I would have been like and here we go,

417
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,320
cooking the meth. Here comes baking soda and

418
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
flour, flour,

419
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:55,240
now just see it's time for a very sweet charlie, our secret ingredient, blue

420
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,520
food,

421
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,020
so

422
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,820
it's how we make the blue math and nobody else knows how to make it jesse

423
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,780
that's what it is. I can't believe it. They can't believe it's blue. Why don't

424
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,060
they just put blue food coloring in it man? That's what the

425
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,520
competitors would do and I think the competitors do to that plot. Oh no

426
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,820
plot hole. I think they make that in the show. Here's another plot hole better

427
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,500
call. So this show takes place afterwards, but all the characters are

428
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
younger. Huh, I think it's a lot of characters who died are still alive.

429
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,140
That makes no sense. I think it takes place before. No, it takes place after

430
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,140
came out after yeah came out after right takes place. Well, you can oh they had a

431
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,940
time machine yeah. They did. They had a so smart camera. Walter is Walter. It's

432
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,820
a he's not brick. He's not Rick. He is Rick Sanchez. Basically, he's the Rick

433
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,340
Sanchez of his universe. Okay, I have to I'm touching my pain. Okay, do it almost

434
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:47,020
like a tick. You're touching your pain and guys last night. He said he's

435
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,420
touching his pain. I didn't say I'm talking about pain and I'm touching my

436
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,780
pain

437
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,220
almost like a tick, almost like it's a tick and let remember it and the size

438
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,380
of it last week.

439
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,160
Take that rubber band off your pain.

440
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:07,180
We're going to cut their rubber band off your pain and like fight club.

441
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,100
I'm glad you guys are having a lot of fun with this man.

442
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,640
You know I'm not even going to know. So no,

443
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,760
you guys want to say just nonsense shows your pain. Everybody wants to see

444
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,640
Listen to everyone, they're fucking excited as shit right now.

445
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,280
Listen, even the bugs are excited to see your painting.

446
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,160
Last night, stayed up late,

447
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,960
poured myself a glass of non-alcoholic cooking wine because

448
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm not really drinking right now.

449
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,960
Cooking wine?

450
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
Yeah, some cooking wine.

451
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,440
That's got salt in it.

452
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah, it tasted not that good but I needed it in a glass.

453
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
But you drank Marsala?

454
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,600
It was Marsala cooking wine.

455
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,360
I did that in high school and it's really not good.

456
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,960
Well, it was non-alcoholic as well, and it just tasted like grape juice basically.

457
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,460
Ew.

458
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,460
But listen y'all, I stayed up, put on a little Luther.

459
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,960
Never too much, never too much.

460
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,460
And I just started painting away.

461
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,160
Yeah, Luther the TV show?

462
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Luther Vandross.

463
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
No, not Luther Vandross, the TV show.

464
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
What's Luther?

465
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
Luther.

466
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,460
What's Luther?

467
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:08,960
With Idris Elba?

468
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,460
Yeah, you ever seen Luther with Idris Elba?

469
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
No, no, no, no. I was thinking Luther.

470
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,460
That's what I draw in my relaxer for whenever I'm painting and drinking wine.

471
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,960
and I was throwing on some Lutheran, Sir Paino,

472
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,120
I had wifey pull out the watercolors, because last time was a digital

473
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
painting guy. Yeah, yeah, now I'm going for a first of all. This is my warm up

474
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,840
painting just to get me all ready.

475
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,420
Okay, let's let's hear a description. An artist statement guys, this

476
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,060
I don't even know what to call this. This came to me in a dream

477
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,560
that I had two nights ago. I have no idea. It's some kind of purple

478
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,400
kind of

479
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,000
weirdly tired fruit almost and it's saying member wow yeah, and as you see on

480
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,140
the back, I was started a little more ambitiously

481
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,220
a bunch of

482
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,820
and I gave up and I just did one. We'll call it a member Barry y'all wow, but

483
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,280
that's what I came up with that yeah. I came up with this is that's amazing. My

484
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,800
original thing it looks great and he basically would say

485
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,860
member fourth meal, that kind of thing

486
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,200
anyway.

487
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,420
I love the sound of your paintings. Yeah,

488
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Thank you. Guys, and here it is. Here is my painting of the red planet itself. There is

489
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,580
Mars.

490
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,540
Oh my God.

491
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,180
Holy shit.

492
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,620
Wait, what is this right here?

493
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,020
Mars.

494
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,180
There's a little black dot.

495
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,900
There's stars and stuff. What are you saying black dot?

496
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,740
Right here.

497
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,060
That? Oh my God. You are so fucking right. There is a little black dot on here.

498
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,260
That looks like a person. That looks like a stick figure.

499
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,360
let's take out our magnifying glass and get a little bit of a closer look.

500
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,200
How's that sound? Yeah. Okay. I need to see

501
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,500
who's that?

502
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:57,520
Who's that? Oh, wait, that's me. That's me on the surface of Mars painting my

503
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,000
member berries photo on the surface.

504
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,520
There I am guys. Oh my God, this is an incredible pain. This is incredible.

505
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,660
This is very oh my God. You can't have a full head of hair and I like

506
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,160
wait,

507
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,500
hold on okay, sorry, I just like to point out Patrick Patrick says you have a

508
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,060
full head of hair. I'm also on Mars man, who cares if I have a head hair corner

509
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,980
that's my that's like my artist name is Michael. It's my middle name.

510
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,060
I thought you're all I thought your middle. I thought your artist name was

511
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,820
DJ something you're holding a knitting needle. I'm holding a paint brush. I

512
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,260
change it. They're all called my they all have Michael on the bottom. Okay,

513
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,040
But yeah, it's been up to a couple hours to do this.

514
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
- Looks great.

515
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,840
- Yeah, it looks good.

516
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,920
- We're gonna have to put these up.

517
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,480
- I got those gray sweatpants on, you see that?

518
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,320
- Yeah, I can see.

519
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,140
- Your cock print is immense.

520
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,520
- You're wearing a Nike Flytech.

521
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,120
- It's obviously got me salivating a little bit.

522
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,360
- Yeah, I got the Nike Tech on.

523
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
- Nike Tech.

524
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,040
- I should have put the Nike Tech on my...

525
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,360
- Oh, you should have put the Nike Tech on,

526
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,200
then Ice Spice would have hit you up after seeing this.

527
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
- Do you guys think I'm a good drawer?

528
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,920
- I literally wanna run my fingers

529
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
through that matted curly hair

530
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,920
and lift you up by your pube hair.

531
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,040
- Really?

532
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,640
this man Jesus Christ, drawing got me that's completely a certain type of way

533
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,060
that's sexual as hell, but

534
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,740
the redness of the planet. I don't know yeah had to get a closer look at this.

535
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,140
Who's this hunk down there on the anyway? These are going to be for sale. I

536
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,060
literally want to make you shoot a hunk of sperm, the junk of red. Honestly,

537
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,140
we're in the hot shower together. You shot so much jizz and it congealed into

538
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,660
a brick. I've been thinking about freezer. I've been thinking about

539
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,900
well, actually it's hot. I've been thinking about fucking you guys again.

540
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,560
yeah, that's been coming back into my mind Mars. Mars is

541
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:42,660
bringing each other together with these planets. I think I was thinking that I

542
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,280
was going to have a zoom in and it was going to be Patrick kind of like like

543
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,000
doing me, but I didn't want it to be disrespectful to him and I knew it was

544
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,380
going to go on YouTube, but Patrick, I do straight up want you to do me man. I

545
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,220
just got to say that it's kind of put that out here. I want you to do me day

546
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,100
to day two of week two. I think we might see a doing painting. I mean on

547
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,800
Patreon you know. Oh here's what I'll do from now on the YouTube ones will be

548
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,700
stuff like this. The Patreon ones are going to be in SFW. That's right. That's

549
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,040
right.

550
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,240
If you know what I'm talking about, so maybe next time I'll just do Patrick

551
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,640
just with his thing out.

552
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,880
You better you better not why

553
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,800
overdo it. You know you bet I better if you're putting my thing. If you're

554
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,960
going to painting of me of my thing out, you better not use your imagination.

555
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,040
okay. I want it to be do what you should do. You should do a dry rubbing of his

556
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,640
penis, like when you find a leaf in the forest and you're like the Vietnam

557
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,360
Memorial.

558
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,600
Oh yeah, I would like to do that. Oh yeah, I know you're talking about when

559
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,800
you see a name you think is funny. So yeah, you rub on it. So you rub the name

560
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,520
so you take your fingers and you rub it really fast. It's named like Michael

561
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,040
Riblet or something. When you see a name that you don't like, so you try to

562
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,480
scratch it and rub it out with your fingers. Try to scratch it out of the

563
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,880
Memorial. Yeah, you put a piece of paper over it and then you put charcoal down.

564
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Yeah.

565
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,520
God, I'm sorry. I'm just lost in my beautiful...

566
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
It's a good painting.

567
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

568
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
I'm gonna hang this one.

569
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah?

570
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah, this one.

571
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Do we have thumbtacks?

572
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
No.

573
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
I'm gonna hang it up over this.

574
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
Okay.

575
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:20,000
All right. He's taking down... It's a painting of Cyrodiil. Now, can you... I do want to

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,480
keep this. I've had this since... I've had this for a while. He's now hanging up his

577
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
painting.

578
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,080
So do you guys think we're going to reach Mars and our spaceships? I think

579
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,380
that we will and how long I don't know. Has there already been a mission to

580
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,860
Mars? No, man, you weren't the Mars. Mankind hasn't reached surface as it

581
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,880
reached. Well, I mean, is there a mission that like they launched the jet

582
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,560
right now? I'm sorry, a space ship. Have they launched a space ship now and

583
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,280
they're going to get there in a couple of years?

584
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,880
No, because of the space travel. No, they have not even I mean they've put

585
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,140
rovers on Mars that curiosity rover. Elon wants to do it, but Elon also wants

586
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:04,220
to build like a bunch of fucking trains or something. Elon wants to turn

587
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,760
Twitter into a bank, I'm sorry, X into a world bank. I think that Elon might

588
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,700
be able to get the first man on Mars if he stayed off the dope.

589
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah. Let's just look this up.

590
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,740
Stop going on Rogan. Elon, stop going on Rogan and stop smoking weed. You

591
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,380
have no time to enjoy yourself. Rogan is a bad influence on you, Elon. Stop

592
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,240
trying to enjoy yourself. You need to commit your life to sciences. It's

593
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,660
fucked up list of missions to missings to Mars successful mission. There have

594
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,500
been a bunch of successful missions, but no human kind.

595
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,180
They put a bunch of rovers in route. Wait, who's in what psyche? Well,

596
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,100
there's no but a psych that's not a person. Oh yeah, they're saying psych.

597
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,900
It's not actually there. It's just a fly by a gravity assist. Okay, oh,

598
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,900
whatever. Yeah, it's kind of I kind of hope that we'll be able to be the first

599
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,500
man on Mars. Yeah, I don't want to go to Mars, man. I want to visit Mars. It has

600
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,500
an odd atmosphere and it would be hard to live there, but I feel like we would

601
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,620
befriend the Martians. Yeah, or if and then if we failed to befriend them, I

602
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,300
feel like we could probably eradicate them with the common cold or the

603
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,660
norovirus. Are those the same thing? Well, they'd probably give us some crazy

604
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:16,260
Martian disease. No, we would use hand sanitizer. A virus is a stomach. Yeah, we

605
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,900
would give one of those. Oh, the rhino virus is the cry no virus. I don't mean

606
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,340
knows you all. I've been getting into learning the meanings of words. You have

607
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,020
to actually. What was it to etymology? Marci no, I'm so into etymology because

608
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,780
the thing is, Latin is always, always what I'm thinking of our genus of alien.

609
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,140
Sorry, you knew immediately what it meant. You know what it made, but it

610
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,300
makes me think I think the reason that I want to know all the words that

611
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,900
the reason I want to know all the names of the words or

612
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,380
the reason I want to know well anyway, you know what I'm saying now,

613
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,160
because of the names of dinosaurs, oh,

614
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,140
because that's all they all have name like they all the names all mean big

615
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,120
way and big wings or spiky wings or what would your dinosaur name be

616
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,680
probably

617
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:07,900
Maximo P Nassius, Maximo P Nassius yeah. What the hell is P Nus? What's the

618
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,660
Latin Root?

619
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,620
big peen because of his hard shell. He would be a dinosaur, the hard show be

620
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,600
like an inkyla source. I don't know. I'm saying if they found your bones yeah and

621
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,880
they were like this dine is they nobody would guess based on your skeleton that

622
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,780
you had a peanut. When I die, I will have a shell, maybe a peanut. By the time I

623
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,220
die, I will have I will have a shell around my body. Yeah, I don't think so. I

624
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,220
know him. I know him pretty well. He will I'm go. I've been working on getting a

625
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,080
genetically certification. Something has been wrong with me. I can't focused on

626
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,840
words that you're trying to create new words. I can't, I keep saying things that

627
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,560
don't make any sense. You're becoming a wordsmith. I keep, I think I keep having

628
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,840
some type of mini stroke that lasts for weeks, that keeps coming and going. I

629
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,240
already told you guys about how I couldn't remember how to tie my shoes.

630
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,360
Yes. Okay, good. You told me, so I feel like that happens to you a lot, though.

631
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,680
That does happen a lot. No, it fully happened to me where I think I definitely

632
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,320
had a mini stroke, which I think is caused by probably energy drinks and

633
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,800
nitrites from all the bacon that I'm eating. Too much damn bacon. I remember...

634
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm putting bacon on everything. I was thinking about nitrites 'cause we were

635
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,960
talking about them, and I remember my grandpa telling me when I was little,

636
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,400
before I knew really what nitrites or a heart attack or anything like that

637
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,120
really meant, he was like, "My doctor said that I have to cut down on eating

638
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,120
bacon, but I'd rather die than not eat bacon and I was like what are you

639
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,780
talking about? What does that mean? Everyone

640
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,320
you'd rather die, not even does not understanding what the link between

641
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,840
those two things could be. Yeah, it's a crazy thing to say to also everyone

642
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,080
always

643
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,880
he wants to

644
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,920
he's going to eat bake until he dies. People always say that, but then you

645
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,640
start fucking dying and yeah

646
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,440
no, do you like salt? Yeah, what

647
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,880
Okay, salt is good though, but you can't switch to like turkey bacon or

648
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,800
something. You'd rather die. Have you seen this stuff? New salt? It's like

649
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,480
sodium bromide or some shit. The fuck are you talking about? It's science.

650
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,840
I saw a thing called NU salt. Mars is making you war like. Yeah. Me? It's

651
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,600
making you pretty much... Combative and war like. It's not salt too. That's a

652
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,880
movie with Angelina Jolie. Oh shit. It's called NU salt. Oh, new like new

653
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,080
metal like yeah,

654
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,480
salt to I don't think that this is

655
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,880
clicking on the wrong. Yeah, you're

656
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,780
obsessed with salt right now in you

657
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,480
salt and you

658
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,780
new salt. So you suck. You're the

659
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,180
word. This is in you in you say

660
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,680
your favorite say your favorite fact

661
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,380
about Mars right now. I bet he

662
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,780
doesn't even have one. I bet you

663
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,880
don't have a single one. Oh, there.

664
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,080
Yeah, I saw this at the store the

665
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,180
other substitute.

666
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,780
You can't even speak just has no

667
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,680
sodium or something. I think it is.

668
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Yeah, sodium free salt, potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride.

669
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Salt is good for you man, you have to have salt to live.

670
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Salt is a basic building block of life.

671
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Do they have salt on Mars?

672
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
They have salt on Mars.

673
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
They have water, so they probably might have salt on Mars.

674
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I feel like they have to have salt on Mars.

675
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
At the very least they have rocks.

676
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Do they have lettuce on Mars?

677
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,680
No, they have radishes and rutabagas though.

678
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Okay, beets?

679
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Did you guys ever see that movie, The Martian?

680
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Oh my God, the contributing factor to the redness of the planet.

681
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,880
the planet. It's all beats. Oh my God, that is guys, because God ate a bunch of

682
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,580
beastly shat Mars. Oh, that's not how he made the planets. That's how he made

683
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,380
Mars, specifically Mars, because Mars, I didn't know something I learned when I

684
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,340
was doing my planet report research. I had no idea Mars was so small. I thought

685
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,440
it was the same size as Earth. I thought it was the second smallest. What the

686
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,720
hell if you don't count Pluto? What the fuck? What's smaller than Mercury? Yeah,

687
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,680
Mercury is this Mercury is the smallest. Oh, we're going to smaller than that, but

688
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,040
planet. They kicked it out. They kicked it out. It's too small. There's a dwarf

689
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
planet. We are...

690
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,660
Yeah, sorry, man. No, no, no. I keep... Alright, you know what? I know what will

691
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,460
bring us back on track. Yeah. Oh, I know what will.

692
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,560
So,

693
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,400
you wanna introduce this? You guys,

694
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,120
we promised it on the premium episode.

695
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,460
We promised that there would be

696
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,520
a collab, a collaboration track.

697
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,400
combination combination. This is a collaboration track between OJ, the

698
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,480
alien and Dr. Dazzle and before you play it, I just want to say I haven't

699
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,480
heard this yet. I don't know what it's about, but what I did hear

700
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,220
apparently there were some people like picketing the recording studio and Dr.

701
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,000
Dazzle was recording his verse and apparently something made them really

702
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,320
mad. The hell's wrong with Dr. Dazzle? Everybody likes him. I don't know,

703
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,000
yeah, everybody likes him, but apparently he did something really wrong

704
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
during the song. So it must be something about, he must have said something

705
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,160
about Mars. I don't know what it like. I guess it's got to be about

706
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,680
Mars. The whole song is called Wise Guys on Mars.

707
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,120
Oh, he probably just talked about crime.

708
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,800
Yeah, maybe that's what it is.

709
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
It's usually so positive.

710
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,400
So let's hear it.

711
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
Roll it. Play that boom before.

712
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Oh wait, start it over.

713
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,700
In space prison, dinner was always a big thing.

714
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,700
We had a galactic pasta course and then we had an alien meet.

715
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
Pauly did the prep work.

716
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,700
He was doing a year for space contempt.

717
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,200
He had this wonderful system for doing the space garlic.

718
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,700
He used to light sabers.

719
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,700
He used to slice it so thin that he used to liquefy in the pan with just a little grease oil.

720
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,700
It's a very good system.

721
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,200
Once upon a time on a planet so far, me and Dr. Dazzle were just hitting the spar.

722
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
When this alien chick, she pulled up in a flar.

723
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,700
She says, "Hey wise guys, come on, let's go to Mars."

724
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
So we did, we hopped in her car

725
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
That's an alien model, it's a flying kind of car

726
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
It doesn't run on gas, it runs on rocks called cars

727
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
A car is a fuel that goes in a flask

728
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
So we pull up to the mobile to get some gars

729
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
When out pops a guy who has guns for arms

730
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700
So we shot his ass and we hit him with the flask

731
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,700
And once again, a car is not a flask

732
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Wise guys

733
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,700
We have Tommy Guns

734
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,700
We're on Mars

735
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
We're on Mars

736
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,700
We're on Mars

737
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
We're on Mars

738
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,700
We have flying cars

739
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,700
We have flying cars

740
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
We have flying cars

741
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
We have flying cars

742
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
Now me and OJ own this Mars operation

743
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Underneath the nose of the Galactic Federation

744
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Running kaggots at the Robot Casino

745
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700
Wearing sunglasses like Robert De Nino

746
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
Space caddy and Mars balls with gravy

747
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Camel life on Moon V by Martians, Corsace

748
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Green Street stays on the rotation daily

749
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
A planet's rotation is how long it's may be

750
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,700
Mars years are longer, almost two-fold

751
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
So if I was on Mars, I'd be on Mars

752
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,760
Almost two-fold, so if I was on Mars I'd be twelve years old

753
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,380
Smoking Mars, pearl golds and sippin' on the moonshine

754
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,700
Fuckin' on adult women in the boom time

755
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
Every time the moon is up I'm in the motel

756
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,100
The women have to book the rooms 'cause I'm twelve

757
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,300
We'll do it all again, I know all the styles

758
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,100
I'm a sexual machine that turns women into pedophiles

759
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Big smile, but we know how to use it

760
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,300
Turn down the gravity, throw on some music

761
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,400
Give her my bean and make her scream

762
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,900
Even though she's twenty-eight and I'm not even a teen

763
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,200
Do it on the couch, PG movie on the road, cool

764
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,440
Cushions get so wet that it feels like tofu

765
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,760
Hid it from orbit 'til the atmosphere smells

766
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
I am twirling

767
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,400
Wise guys

768
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,880
We have gone into space

769
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,640
We're on Mars

770
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,920
We have flying cars

771
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh my fucking god, man

772
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,840
As far back as I can remember

773
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,720
I always wanted to be a wise guy on Mars

774
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,960
(laughter)

775
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,000
- OJ the alien.

776
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,400
Dr. Dazzle.

777
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,760
- Wow.

778
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,560
That is a...

779
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,160
(laughter)

780
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,200
God, I mean, that's a masterpiece, man.

781
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,900
I'm gonna be honest.

782
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,480
That was, that blew my fucking mind.

783
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,340
- I don't know why people were mad at Dr. Dazzle's verse.

784
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,180
I think maybe--

785
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,380
Yeah, because he said, "Oh, I'm 12 years old."

786
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,980
Nobody who gets mad, that's victim blaming.

787
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
Yeah.

788
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,100
Well, I think the thing that people were maybe mad at was that he's...

790
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,700
So he'd be 24 on earth.

791
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,700
Right.

792
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:12,700
So then the women are 48, so they are 57?

793
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,700
No.

794
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,700
No?

795
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,700
56.

796
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,700
56.

797
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Yeah.

798
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,820
Well, you have to hope, yeah, I guess that he's talking about the Mars age of the women.

799
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:26,560
so he'd be so people are upset that it's the Mars age, which there's also already

800
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,660
an age gap, but then I think maybe they were upset about the age gap.

801
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,560
It was an age gap thing. I think it was like a Leonardo DiCaprio.

802
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,160
He's 56 year old women having sex with a 24 year old. But why would they picket

803
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,920
the recording studio of Dr. Basil? I guess they just thought... I mean,

804
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,820
there was something unsavory, I guess they thought about. They thought maybe

805
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,520
the content was not typical for his usual... Are these SJW types that are

806
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,980
picketing this because if so, we can basically ignore everything.

807
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,600
They're saying, yeah, maybe, maybe it's SJW. Okay, so it's just people

808
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,000
getting basically triggered, but... SJW, space jumping... Because they don't

809
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,880
believe in space. Space jumping warlocks, man. Space jumping warlocks. Yeah.

810
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,640
Which is a scary thing that you have to dodge in your alien astronaut

811
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
space... When you do alien type of songs. Yeah. I guess I do

812
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,740
kinda wish that Dr. Dazzle maybe talked a little bit more about the

813
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,880
wise guy stuff. He seems like he kinda went off topic, but... He did.

814
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,080
there's another I guess that is true. I mean it didn't have that much to do with

815
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,080
being a wise guy except for the hook brings it back. Yeah, I guess Tommy guns

816
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,560
yeah right yeah, but there is another verse that wasn't recorded. That's

817
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,240
mostly about floors and what a floor and what a floor is and basically the

818
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,360
history of the floor Mars bars about that. It was like about the floors. Let

819
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,880
me tell you something about these things called floors back in twenty thirty three.

820
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,320
They replaced all cars

821
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,220
continue.

822
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,420
And also they discovered these things called guards. They were rocks and they

823
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,420
go into flowers.

824
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:57,220
Okay, so it's basically the exact same as the other. But then it goes into the

825
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,620
history. I think maybe the right OJ the alien only got a little bit. The

826
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,520
flowers wars through. Yes, there's the flowers wars and then the you know all

827
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,320
that stuff. But then there was these space jumping warlocks inside the studio

828
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,020
that were protesting and picketing and he said fuck it is needs to go out right

829
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,620
right yeah. We need to show this song was originally going to be four minutes

830
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,680
long and they were like no, we need to it needs to be drop it drop it. Now

831
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,100
this is the single cut it. I'm curious. How does OJ the how did OJ the only get

832
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,460
linked up with Dr. Dazzle? It seems like they're in completely different

833
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:36,380
planetary communication yeah well, Dr. Dazzle, I'm not asking about how they

834
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,380
talk to each other, like if I said how did doja cat and pink man and chat rooms,

835
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:47,460
shouted ice yeah. You don't say oh they talked on the phone. If I say how these

836
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,100
two people mean, well that's probably how they did that probably is how they

837
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,260
linked up man, but who's not like they what do you think they just teleported

838
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,500
into each other's rooms. I'm just wondering I had to make plans. Why did

839
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,740
they who reached out to who? Why did they collaborate? I heard that I heard

840
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,860
that OJ the alien asked Dr dazzle to hop on yeah.

841
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,620
I think that's what it was so OJ watched our I think that I don't yeah. I think

842
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,660
like OJ probably was thinking is like oh, Dr. Dazzle famously dresses in all green.

843
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,700
That's one of the main facts. Oh, true.

844
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,500
He wears that one jacket. Yeah, the green jacket. Yeah, so he probably was like

845
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,220
this guy even looks like an alien a little bit. Yeah, if this jacket was his

846
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,460
skin, he probably thought he was an alien. And it's probably also a thrilling

847
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,900
contrast to the red colour of Mars. Yeah, same with OJ the alien, who was a green

848
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,340
alien. Yeah, and he was probably even thinking us green guys can make a song

849
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,340
about red Mars, because if it's, listen, if it's about wise guys, there's a, and

850
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,180
it's in the one thousand and twenty. So there's a chance it's going to be black

851
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,340
and white man. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, there's no difference. Yeah. It's kind of

852
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,220
combining the two. It's combining the something that like they used to do in

853
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,660
hip hop a lot where they would put

854
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:59,020
they would put like samples from like mob movies, gangster movies, stuff like

855
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,660
that. Like they put Scarface stuff in music and then they would have like a

856
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,980
string section kind of Scott Storch style. Yeah. The sample from Moonfellows

857
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,580
was really sick. Yeah, the sample for Moonfellows is very good. So then it's

858
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:16,580
combining that with the new space age style rap that OJ the Alien does. So it's

859
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,900
basically what this song is, is it's bringing the past and the future together.

860
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:25,940
Right, and that's, that's the ethos behind Wise Guys, old on Mars, future,

861
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,580
which is a thing that

862
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:33,500
everybody wanted. Yeah. Everybody wanted to see Wise Guys on the planet Mars. I

863
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,860
the man, it's one of the things Cowboys versus aliens, yep, aliens versus

864
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:42,800
predators, yep, we haven't seen a combination or on Mars mafia and aliens

865
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,700
that much. There was one combination of

866
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,980
maybe like

867
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:53,380
not mafia, but yeah, I guess the mafia is in it is a little movie called Pluto

868
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:53,920
Nash,

869
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,660
which may have been the inspiration for

870
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,900
There's an Eddie Murphy movie from 2003 where he goes to a space casino and I

871
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,300
think he's a, he has to deal with the space mob. Oh shit. Like Robert De Nino?

872
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,020
Robert De Nino, but Luis Guzman is in it as well. Luis Guzman. He's Buzz Alien?

873
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,580
And I'm pretty sure Joe Piscopo is in it. I don't remember if I know this movie

874
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,020
that well. Luis Guzman is always typecast as an alien or a mushun. He is always an

875
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,620
alien. Or himself in Community. Can you, can you look up Pluto, The Adventures of

876
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,700
Pluto Nash. I need to remember some stuff about this.

877
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,620
That's a good name for a guy who spends much of his time in space.

878
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,620
Yeah. Pluto Nash. Oh, 2002.

879
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,620
That's like me being called New York.

880
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,620
Oh, Joe Pantoliano, not Piscopo.

881
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
Joey Piscopo.

882
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:45,620
Joey Pants is fire, man.

883
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,620
And Joey Moore. Yeah.

884
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Miguel A. Nunez Jr.

885
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,620
This had a pretty stacked cast for 2002.

886
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,620
Yeah, Rosario Dawson.

887
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,580
I Lena Douglas from

888
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:02,940
and dating Martin's Corsetta plays Doug yeah. There's all types of people in

889
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,060
this movie man yeah, all all different types of levels of fame, like Olga

890
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:08,980
Golova Nova,

891
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:16,340
and Vladimir Vicro, yeah, Olga Golova Nova was in in Pluto Nash

892
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,120
real martian that she was in turbos every zimney,

893
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,980
yeah, and turbos and Mr Pranka.

894
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,240
I know Mr Pranka the fuck is Mr Pranka. I know Mr Pranka and

895
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:38,220
no, they have a really bad bunch of movies in Russia. I think man that's

896
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,420
why they are so they're lashing out and making fake McDonald's and shit because

897
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,860
they didn't grow up with the movies. We grew up with man. Well, they have these

898
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,640
bunked up movies. We got Mr. Deeds, they got Mr. Pranka. Every Russian movie is

899
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,920
about like a piece of rice that runs away or something. It's not ever happy.

900
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,080
They let art get into their movies a little too much. Yeah, they basically...

901
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,460
They kind of dodged commercialism a little too much. Yeah, like Pluto Nash

902
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,700
has like a million different types of

903
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,880
Las Vegas puns and stuff. Yeah, but you see, like you ever... You see,

904
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,480
and I don't know if you guys have probably seen all these old Russian,

905
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,720
the Soviet cartoons that people always post, the Soviet animations, and it's

906
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,560
always about a wiggling man, yeah, running away from his wiggling doctor,

907
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,560
yeah, and it's all basically that everything is always about going to the

908
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,520
doctor with these.

909
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,900
How many times you go to the fucking doctor? If you live in Russia, they

910
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,680
probably literally already have a wiggling show in the US. It's called

911
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,360
home movies and there's no doctors in it at all. It's about kids. There was

912
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,800
one wiggling doctor. Yeah, come on, doctor cat, doctor cat. Yeah, well, but

913
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,840
they don't even have therapy, but he's a therapist. That's not a doctor, not a

914
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,460
doctor. And by the way, in Russia, they only have doctors. They don't have

915
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,940
specialists. No, there's no... The doctor is the therapist, technically. Yeah.

916
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,580
But you walk in and you say,

917
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,060
"I have ADHD and also I need to have my legs sawed off." And he does both.

918
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,000
I need to have my legs sawed off 'cause I keep getting distracted by the

919
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,640
boil in my foot. You go... In Russia, if you go to the doctor and

920
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,340
you tell them you're depressed, they'll prescribe you one pill. And guess what?

921
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,200
It's a lead pill and it's fired out of a gun at your fucking head.

922
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,080
Holy shit, wait, that's actually bloody crazy. If you dare to break conformity by

923
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,460
having anxiety over there, they will little or rolly put you in buried in the

924
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,720
ice. And here's what I fucking hate about all these kids walking around in the

925
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,800
United States saying, "Yeah, man, I want to be a communist and I want to walk

926
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,720
around with my hammer and sickle and a book or whatever." Like, dude, look at

927
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,500
Russia. Look what's going on in communist Russia. What are they doing?

928
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,540
Russia used to look like Miami. Russia in the 1960s- And then they got- then they

929
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,520
just to have women would be now they now they got communism. Everybody's got a

930
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,480
now. It's like the damn thing, bro. I heard saying I heard that in in Soviet

931
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:50,360
Russia, Soviet Communist Russia, I heard that in Communist Russia, which it

932
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,520
already still, which it already still is. I heard that the TV watches you.

933
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,240
That's horrifying. I fucking hate communism. I know I'm supposed to be

934
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,440
watching the TV. I'm supposed to be and now I have to do interesting stuff all

935
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:01,920
days. Yeah,

936
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,500
my whole life entertaining my TV. What the hell kind of backwards bullshit is

937
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,020
this man is backwards as fuck isn't it? It is kind of reverse. I heard the cars

938
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,380
drive you as well. Yeah, the cars drive and one of the most horrifying things I

939
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,100
heard that in in Soviet Russia. Actually, I could defeat Chuck Norris.

940
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:26,500
But let me stop you there, not even in Soviet Russia. Do you have a chance to

941
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,740
get? Why do you look at me like that? Say fat chance at chance that show

942
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,200
Cameron, that's so rude, a fat camera and I know what your subtext is there.

943
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,760
When you say fat chance, what's you versus fast Norris fat Cameron,

944
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,780
fast Norris, fast Norris, so you don't stand a chance yeah man, it's so

945
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,660
fucked up over. You could have said my chances were skinny or narrow or

946
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,040
something like that. I'm say fat chance, fat as fucking a

947
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,780
I BMI chance,

948
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,500
fat fatty and plus a chance

949
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,500
but that's a snore that's not annoying me and Julio were on a quiz website or we

950
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,340
took a quiz to questionnaire to get signed up for a I to the whiz that's

951
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:08,660
white

952
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,580
machine that fixes erectile dysfunction by using sonic waves. I want to get in

953
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,300
that we asked you for your height and weight and the

954
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,100
weight was three hundred pounds

955
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,740
was one foot six.

956
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,440
that

957
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,860
default, they said it they you click on next page and it auto fills in one foot

958
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,160
six and that'd be a oh. I had a great hypothetical that I discussed with a lot

959
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,660
of my friends the other day. Yeah. Would you rather be

960
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:46,180
like a five out of ten or four out of ten face, but you're six foot five or

961
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,660
would you rather be a ten out of ten, but you're three and a half feet tall.

962
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,260
That is a good in the face.

963
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:59,100
you your three your face is three and a half feet. No, no, no fuck you, you're

964
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,900
you said in the face in the face, yeah, a ten in the face. If I had a

965
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,060
fighting, I have three and a half face. No, you guys are okay. So this is a new

966
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,400
hypothetical. Would you rather have a six foot tall face or a three and a half

967
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,460
foot tall? Probably a three and a half, but what if the rest of your body is a

968
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:17,500
hundred feet tall? So then the six foot probably wouldn't matter very much.

969
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,660
What I pick either. Well, it actually kind of would man and what all the size

970
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:27,840
almost always double the size, no matter what size your body. Yeah, what no

971
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,620
three is half of six man. That's what I mean, but it'd be it'd be a little bit

972
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,020
better than having three. If you had a hundred foot tall body, I feel like if I

973
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,940
was a hundred feet tall, I'm not good. The three feet is not going to bother me

974
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:43,340
much. Either way, the six if I was in you got other problems going on yeah,

975
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,900
yeah, I mean I'd be concerned that, but what you're asking man that's like

976
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,460
walking. That's like being the kind of guy who walks around says I'm six foot

977
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,940
one and a half or something. I'd be very, very concerned. My head's actually six foot and

978
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:00,620
a half feet instead of three. I know it. If I'm 100 feet tall, I go pee somewhere, that's

979
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:07,500
a tsunami. No, you have your current penis. Oh, then I have a really big problem. I have

980
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,020
a really big proportional problem. But you have the bladder of 100 and urethra of 100

981
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,860
foot. You want your current size penis because there's no 100 foot woman. Well, there might

982
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,460
might be who knows that might be part of the hypothetical that I come up with

983
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:23,200
your most likely probably going to have to end up fucking a normal sized woman

984
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,100
or an ellen, not going to want a big giant, you know, ten foot long penis or a

985
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,140
way from the

986
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:34,000
because I'm not having if I'm one hundred feet tall, I'm not having sex for

987
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,040
pleasure. I'm sure it would hurt at some you're not having sex for pleasure. Why

988
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,340
would it hurt your sex drive will be gone? No, my sex drive will be

989
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,340
completely gone. I'm not seeing it. You know I would not have a libido at all.

990
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,460
That's true because yeah, because everybody's an ant to you, you're not

991
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,560
kind of ants like I want to fuck that and I have a question. I have a question

992
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,220
what would your phone be big your phone? Yeah, you get to keep your phone the

993
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,520
sit, okay, and I'm comfortable size. Then I look at sex or will picks on my

994
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,400
phone. You can't masturbate because your penis is human size. Then you have

995
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,400
these giant hand. You're just like I'm not even human anymore is what you're

996
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,400
saying you're

997
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,060
no, it's kind of hard giant. You're big on the hard. I was like ten twelve feet

998
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,720
tall. You're you're literally a hundred feet tall with a three foot head.

999
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,560
is the hypothetical that I was talking to my friends about.

1000
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,640
So yeah, I guess well now it is it was a completely different. It was a

1001
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,760
different question completely, but would you be okay? Here's the new

1002
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,360
hypothetical.

1003
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,560
Would you be a hundred foot tall with a three foot head?

1004
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,880
No, if you had to oh yeah, I had to yeah yeah, I would if I had to if I had

1005
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,880
the choice, if there's no other option, yeah, if there's no other option, I

1006
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,640
would be yeah, I guess I would I wouldn't

1007
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,480
Wow all right, just my kind of thing. Yeah, that's all right, but do you think

1008
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:47,720
that

1009
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,280
that guy would have more fun on Mars? No, you guys ever heard about the face on

1010
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,480
Mars speaking about? Yes, I have. What's the face of Mars? They have a face on

1011
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,000
Mars. They have a giant face on Mars. Let me see this. Pull up the face of

1012
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,400
Mars. There's a ongoing scientific theory that Mars is a head. I heard that

1013
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,640
scientist, not actually a planet at all, it's a floating head. Can I run a, can I

1014
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,760
run a late night joke by you guys? Yeah, I'm putting in my packet. Whoa, so

1015
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,000
apparently Elon Musk is putting together a Mars expedition. Yeah, he

1016
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,280
wants to yassify the face on Mars. Oh, wow!

1017
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,120
Wow, yeah, that's... You think that could be funny on a TV show? I think

1018
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:26,720
that general audiences would understand that, yeah. He wants to yassify the

1019
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,920
face on Mars. Whoa! Okay, that looks like a bear. And Elon Musk would say,

1020
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,040
"Yeah, we're going to look at pedo bear on the face of Mars." 'Cause that's

1021
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,760
what that actually does look like. He wants to yassify pedo bear, 'cause that

1022
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,600
it kind of does look like pedo bear. Pedo bear would have a better time if he was

1023
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,600
yesified. I never understood what makes his bear such a pedo. He has he probably

1024
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,240
has actions. Yeah, it's mostly his molestations. But he's a toon, man. He is

1025
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:57,720
a he is a pedophile. He's a simple toon. We you know what we need? We need a

1026
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,200
friend who's a meme historian who we can call at any hour of the day. He can tell

1027
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,320
us the entire history. Bring it in like Pawn Stars. Yeah. Hey, take a look at

1028
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:04,860
this.

1029
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:09,760
Can you tell me everything about this? That's actually David the Gnome. This

1030
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,000
photo of this ugly woman. David the Gnome. That's actually David the Gnome.

1031
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,680
It was a meme that only lasted for a year in 2010. This is very rare.

1032
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,360
Please show me socially awkward penguin facts. I need to hear socially awkward

1033
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,640
penguin by the low down gang. Don't look up socially awkward penguin. Not you.

1034
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,600
Well, I guess Jubio kinda is a meme story. We're looking up too much stuff,

1035
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,320
man. It's too much. Yeah, it needs to be about... It needs to be stopped.

1036
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:33,320
We are about Mars today. We are exiting Mars's orbit, I will say.

1037
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,920
we are exiting the orbit. Let's go back into the orbit just for the last little

1038
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,600
bit. Okay,

1039
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,360
tell me about it, man.

1040
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:43,720
Well, I mean, I brought up face on Mars. I'm trying to think of something else.

1041
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:46,760
They have ice caps. I mean, that gets very cold. They have ice ice spice.

1042
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,040
They're looking for water as well. Red hair. There could be water underground.

1043
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,280
I spice as a Mars.

1044
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,640
You keep rubbing your penis against my leg, man. That's the thing about okay,

1045
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,560
so everybody's so everybody's so obsessed with if we find find life in this

1046
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,200
reservoir of water that's on Mars. Yeah, but dude, I don't give a fuck if a

1047
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,160
fish is on another planet. It's not even gonna be a fish man. It will be a

1048
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,560
dot. That's a dot of course, but even a lot of dots biggest fucking thing ever

1049
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,760
would be that there's a fish on Mars. Yeah, I don't give a shit about I guess

1050
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,240
a dot. Well, it wouldn't look like our fish and it would be interesting to see

1051
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,920
it would be as if you were watching one of those nature documentaries where they

1052
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,960
say, can you believe this is an animal? But what if it did look exactly like our

1053
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,720
fish. What if it just looked like a fucking tuna? I guess that wouldn't be

1054
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,200
so exciting if they found something that looked exactly the same. If they found

1055
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,720
a tuna on Mars. I guess, yeah, if you take the... That'd be more exciting.

1056
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,500
But if you find a dot, that means that one day it'll evolve. I could believe

1057
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,520
that they're, that we find an octopus on Mars. Into a circle. Yeah, it's probably

1058
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,920
gonna be a seven legged squid or something. Yeah. Do you guys believe that

1059
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,960
octopi came from another planet? No. No. I do.

1060
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:57,040
Okay. I believe that. That's cool, I guess. And I also believe in

1061
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,720
mechanicals all life came from other planet. I think it's true. I think that

1062
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,560
the big bang they said that they said not that right. No, I said that they

1063
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,520
said that all life comes from a different planet. Yeah, no dude. They

1064
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,760
said who said that Steve Jobs.

1065
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,560
No, he didn't man. Steve Jobs said that what is what if somebody who's a

1066
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:21,000
completely not a scientist at all, but like has just has a very high standing

1067
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,480
and maybe seems like a smart person like Steve Jobs or someone like that did like

1068
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,540
a press conference and made a huge announcement, just like they have set

1069
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,300
we're now announcing that all life comes from another plan to set something

1070
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:37,100
completely wrong. We have discovered life on every planet in the entire

1071
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,020
universe, somebody who you're like you seen you're like well. I don't really.

1072
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,760
I guess I don't know why he would lie right. Did this seems like maybe he

1073
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,940
would be someone who would know about that? I get maybe yeah, sure, probably a

1074
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:51,620
little yeah Carson daily, okay, I guess yeah, I guess I trust. I guess I trust

1075
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,840
I know I got a lie. I mean I've been a really man you news. Okay, I'm a

1076
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,440
scientist or like Steve jobs is lying. He's not going to believe and then

1077
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,760
yeah yeah and then see jobs is like the scientists are lying. Steve job

1078
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,120
basically versed science in his last couple moments. He wife anyway. He

1079
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,520
verse sides versus juice yeah and juice science y'all science low key molly

1080
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,320
walked him no because it remember he said I bet if I drink juice every day,

1081
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,320
I'll fucking die

1082
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,400
and they were like you have cancer. The juice is what's killing you and he

1083
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,900
I'd prove it bitch. Yeah, he started the Jews thing before he found out about

1084
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,460
cancer.

1085
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:30,800
I bet you I'll die. Give me cancer. I bet you I'll get cancer and die in one

1086
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,760
year. If all I eat is juice, all I drink is apple juice. They said okay man,

1087
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,080
knock yourself out. He's like I told you, has it been released? I bet you

1088
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:39,760
guys and I

1089
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,920
has it been released a full regimen as an I bet you an iPad. Now I got a

1090
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,160
I

1091
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,040
I bet you an iPad. I fucking die of cancer from drinking juice in one year.

1092
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,740
Yeah,

1093
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,760
they released his full regimen of what types of juices he was drinking. He was

1094
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,640
drinking like green juice, like pineapple. He was drinking a lot of

1095
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:05,960
pineapple, I think, but he was trying to make that less lowly apple juice. It's

1096
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,880
just fucking, just like metal and just

1097
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:14,120
not even fruit. It's just juice of like metal juice. It's oil. Juicing his

1098
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,680
t-shirt.

1099
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,440
putting it in like a big big. I've tried all the fruits. The fruits are working.

1100
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,740
I'm over all the fruit. I've tried the bed. I have to try the fruit of the loom

1101
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,620
my underwear. I'm going to drink my underwear, the juice of my underwear.

1102
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,920
I've tried the meats. I've tried the fishes. What else is there? Fish,

1103
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,720
even eat meat man. He drank clam juice. Well, you think you have meat would have

1104
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,020
saved him. He combined he made he made it would have fully saved him man. It

1105
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:43,660
actually would have I think I think that meat say yeah. What do you think? Do you

1106
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,860
think he held strong to the last day. Do you think maybe on he was dying, his

1107
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,120
soul was completely leaving his body and getting uploaded to the cloud, a little

1108
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:56,660
computer joke and he was and he was like fuck shit. It wasn't it was me

1109
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,860
all along man. The veggies gave me

1110
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:05,300
kind of man. It was the pesticides man. Yeah, you do in the GMO beef could have

1111
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,920
saved me. He had this juice cocktail that he was doing, though he did actually

1112
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,180
like

1113
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,180
there's like a lot of like different supplements. Like he had like tomato

1114
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:18,780
juice and clam juice and vodka and celery and a whole chicken and

1115
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,620
it's just

1116
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:27,060
a bloody Mary

1117
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,780
with a doughnut on it.

1118
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:31,540
A huge celery. That's why

1119
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:37,180
that's a big Caesar. Bottomless mimosas.

1120
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,940
he got prescribed hair of the dog man yeah

1121
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:47,220
hair of the tumo hair of the tumo kind of old. I really wonder what his last

1122
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,400
thought was before he died. If he was his last thought was probably man, I

1123
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,440
should have I should have well, we

1124
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,440
made

1125
01:05:52,440 --> 01:06:00,200
my computers look too clean and I pod with two screens. I spent my whole life

1126
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,460
making tell them tell them to take away the

1127
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,920
the headphone port.

1128
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,040
They need to get rid of that light. He just completely

1129
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:13,940
he's dying and he's like he's seeing like fucking like like biblic accurate

1130
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,740
angels and he's like the world is like psychedelic. He's completely delirious.

1131
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:22,220
He's like fully nothing is making sense in his in his world at all. He's his

1132
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:26,400
brain is firing random electrical pulses and he just says no head phone,

1133
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,000
important

1134
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:35,220
the CEO for about one more minute. So we have to do it. I guess we got to do it

1135
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,500
man, whatever just standing there or Tim Cook's, and he's like what you say to

1136
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,160
head phone, no headphone

1137
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:49,780
oh, that's a good idea yeah. He wants to get rid of the headphone port. I

1138
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:53,540
would have loved it. He saw he saw he was hallucinating and he saw a human

1139
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:56,840
head having sex with a telephone and he said headphone porn

1140
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,920
okay.

1141
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,240
All right, Steve,

1142
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,880
I got to do it. We already sealed your will and it's notarized or whatever we

1143
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,640
can't say, but you know what we'll we'll for make an exception just for you.

1144
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,180
We're going to we're going to scribble this in there.

1145
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:19,160
Poor Steve Jobs, yeah, well, whatever well, him and beautiful gone, you'll see

1146
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,940
him in beautiful heaven, a Los Angeles. Oh yeah way speaking of beautiful heaven,

1147
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,840
what's more beautiful than Malibu, California and right next door to that

1148
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:31,400
is Los Angeles, California and in Los Angeles. There's a venue called the yard

1149
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,880
I will be at next week on Friday, November 17th, with my buddy Gus Viveiros, doing 30

1150
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,120
minutes of stand-up. I wrote about two minutes so far, so this is going to be a really fucking

1151
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,840
amazing show. We're doing two shows.

1152
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,840
You want some of my jokes?

1153
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,480
Yeah, give me one of your jokes right now.

1154
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,720
Okay. I wrote this new one.

1155
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:46,720
Okay.

1156
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,720
You could go up immediately, get on stage, right?

1157
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,720
Immediately? Okay, immediately get on stage.

1158
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,720
Right when you're, like Gus introduces you.

1159
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,720
That's a good start to a joke.

1160
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
Gus introduces you.

1161
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,720
You immediately get on stage.

1162
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,560
You walk out, you're waving to everybody. You say, "Yeah, I just flew in here from New York,

1163
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:05,920
market boys, my ass tired because I flew in here from all the farts propelling my

1164
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,280
ass. I although I farted all the way here. I feel like my if I was far

1165
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,660
iterating fart, if I was generating farts enough to propel me across the

1166
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:19,420
country, I would think my mouth would get tired before my ass from eating all

1167
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,280
of the propellant.

1168
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:25,600
No, but the fart okay, wait, I have a I just I just thought of which I thought

1169
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,360
of a joke. You could do you could try to go over your head. It'll be like this

1170
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,860
sometimes maybe like observational style comedy. I'd be like why why do they

1171
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:37,380
call the why do they call them, but cheeks is it because my butt is like a

1172
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:37,820
mouth.

1173
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,620
I could go up immediately and say you guys are like go up and first go up

1174
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:46,260
immediately get up on stage immediately. No intro, no in just get up immediately

1175
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:50,380
and say we're going to start five minutes. Why they call my channel, why

1176
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,340
do they call them, but she is it because I'm there's a smile between them yep and

1177
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,420
you mind putting your face in between you guys know me. I'm dirty jessling style.

1178
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,780
I'd go up and I'd say I call him butt cheeks. I store a year's worth of nut in

1179
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:07,740
him like a fucking shit. You say why they call it butt cheeks because my butt is

1180
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:10,180
because my butt has a Hitler mustache.

1181
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:15,140
I say no it doesn't, but then I pull it out my pants and it does or you could if

1182
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,540
you want to get really nasty. I mean you could just or you could be like why do

1183
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,620
they call these cheeks? It's because they look like butt cheeks. It's because

1184
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:24,780
all that I eat. My mouth is like an asshole. It's called Cheeks is all the

1185
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,460

1206
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,200
(static)

1207
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,760
- If you couldn't tell, we're dressed up like Venus today.

1208
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:57,280
Although we had some amount of disagreement, I guess,

1209
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,840
over what color Venus is.

1210
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,400
- That's okay, I got both going on.

1211
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,040
- You do have both, but what's this black wig about, man?

1212
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,480
- Well, we'll go down that.

1213
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,680
You want me to start with my costume?

1214
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,520
- Yes, I want you to start. - Are you dressed up

1215
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,600
as Coraline?

1216
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,440
- No.

1217
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,280
(laughing)

1218
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,400
I'm dressed up as V--

1219
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,680
If I walked out on the street right now,

1220
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,020
any person who knows literally who attended first grade

1221
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:16,860
would know I'm dressed as Venus.

1222
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,580
I think some people would think you were Coraline.

1223
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,780
No, a first grader would look at me and say, "That's Venus."

1224
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,540
No, they wouldn't.

1225
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:25,020
A child who was into science and into movies,

1226
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:26,820
who would have seen Venus in a movie.

1227
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,020
Why did you say movies?

1228
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,780
Of course, they'd say Coraline, man.

1229
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,860
Well, Coraline's a book, too.

1230
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,420
Around Halloween time, if they saw me in a costume like this,

1231
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,420
they would say Venus.

1232
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,420
They would say, "That's Coraline. She's very pretty today."

1233
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,060
No, they wouldn't say that.

1234
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:42,420
They would say, "I like Coraline's mustache."

1235
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,180
Jumping off of pretty here,

1236
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:48,460
venus is actually the name of the god is business is named after the goddess of

1237
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:49,580
beauty

1238
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,580
uh...

1239
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:55,220
so i elected to put on a beautiful way today and then it was a really a little

1240
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,260
raincoat my beautiful hair

1241
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,780
cameras are asking about the yellow raincoat so let me explain this to you

1242
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,740
venus

1243
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,580
uh... big the color can be some people say it's yellow some bills a yellowish

1244
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,660
white some people say beige

1245
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,980
this raincoat is yellow definitely to yellow for venus some people but i would

1246
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:17,220
say beige. I think two people would. Two people would say beige. But, Venus is surrounded by

1247
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:22,300
sulfuric clouds. It has a sulfurous atmosphere, which is why it's that color. And in the upper

1248
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:30,300
atmosphere, constantly acid rain. Oh. Wow. Wait. So you're dressed up like Coraline because

1249
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,020
of rain. So that's the yellow, it's the yellow acid rain. And then I have a yellowish white

1250
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:41,400
shirt here. Uh huh. This is kind of closer to the color I feel. You dressed up like Coraline.

1251
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,380
And then, dude chill, I'm dressed up as Venus. I don't know why you guys are stuck on this

1252
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,420
cor- I don't look anything like Coraline. You pull up a picture of Coraline it's going

1253
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,340
to look completely different from what I'm wearing right now. I said Coraline though.

1254
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,020
Yeah, you said Coraline. That's not, then you said a nonsense word and you're proud

1255
01:12:54,020 --> 01:13:03,020
of that. You're proud of making up a word. That's you man. That's, that's, that's your

1256
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,860
I don't know what you're talking about guys.

1257
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,620
I didn't try to dress up like this.

1258
