84
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm not gonna play like a bitch and be coy about this.

85
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,220
This is a 7 foot beer.

86
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
This is an 8'6".

87
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,940
This is a great beer, man.

88
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
You love the Sapporo.

89
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
I do.

90
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Alright, I'm gonna open mine.

91
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,900
I have a seasonal favorite, Feast Beer.

92
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Victory.

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,020
It looks like Fest Beer to me.

94
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Victory Royale.

95
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,220
It's Fortnite beer.

96
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,700
It's a Fest Beer.

97
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
You're right, it is a Fest Beer.

98
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,580
I was very hungry and I got the feast beer.

99
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,860
Now I guess it's just an October festival.

100
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,100
So let me guess, this is the same people who make sour monkey.

101
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
Victory, right?

102
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,060
That's the name?

103
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,140
This has got to be some kind of pumpkin-esque ale.

104
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,700
Well, it's a Madison style lager.

105
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,620
Let's take a sip.

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,760
That is a regular beer.

107
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
That is a solid 7.0.

108
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
Oh, okay.

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,760
A league average 5.6.

110
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
Okay.

111
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
This is an above average.

112
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
5.6 is league average to you?

113
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
5.6?

114
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I think so.

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I think so.

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
6.5.

117
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
In what league, man?

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
I think that's what it is.

119
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I think the TV makes you look taller.

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
I don't think it makes you look longer.

121
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
In the Israeli league.

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah.

123
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,680
Yeah, I gained new respect. I gained new respect for a

124
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Man named Iman Shumpert an NBA player this week because he dropped one of the craziest bars. I've ever heard in my entire life

125
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,880
He's talking somebody DJ Vlad. I think asked him. He was like if Kevin if they put Kevin Durant in the NBA right now

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,800
Do you think he could score a hundred points and he said

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,680
First of all, he said you want a man which was funny enough

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,920
But then he said if you gave him that little rock he could shoot all the way from Arkansas and that

129
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:20,120
Good he came up with that on the spot in front of DJ Vlad which he was probably nervous

130
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,040
Yeah, cuz who wouldn't be in front of DJ Vlad DJ Vlad very little rock. He'll shoot it from Arkansas. That is fire

131
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
That is insane. No way

132
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,360
It's amazing. I was like I have to hear more of this guy turns out he has a big penis. Okay, Juvio

133
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,520
So

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Think many of you know this

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,960
But there's an insane

136
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,640
alcohol curfew in my my city

137
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,280
Where on Sundays you're not allowed to buy any sorts of alcohol at the at the corner store

138
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,680
Past like 6 p.m

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,040
So I am I just scrub whatever we had in the fridge. It's one of my

140
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,680
My go-to hangout beers

141
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,620

Fucking white dude little rewriting. Let's see. Let's see how this holds up to the last time you rated

145
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
It's just the best beer of all time

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,760
I mean, it's the best one to hang out in and drink 20 of them.

147
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,180
- You wanna hang out in that?

148
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,760
You fucking little, little man.

149
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
- This is how I hang out with my friends.

150
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
I just drink this like once.

151
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,520
- And that's it.

152
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,360
- And that's it.

153
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,960
I just eat some chips and I leave.

154
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,760
- You do kind of do that.

155
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
You do love chips.

156
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,680
When you came to my house,

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,400
you ate a bag of chips every single day.

158
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,960
- Yep, and then I left.

159
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,080
- I would like to say something.

160
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
Before we get into the nitty gritty,

161
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,800
kind of the down to dirty, the mud of this podcast,

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,480
which is, for those of you who've never been here,

163
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,080
stick around if you like stories

164
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,760
stick around if you like

165
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,880

on our one hundredth episode

171
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,560
or one hundred and first episode this is the one hundredth on our one hundred and first

172
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
episode

173
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,920
i propose

174
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
that we do

175
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
liquor

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,720
we've enjoyed

177
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
okay

178
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,920
liquor which is

179
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,120
eat now we know and now that's kind of it now because i'm thinking maybe we do a

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
little bit

181
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
of a

182
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,160
kinda more higher class highbrow style thing maybe we dress up

183
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,000
okay where the same suit i wear to my wedding

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,420
that i have in the only button down shirt that i own

186
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,900
and maybe we sit back with foreign meat

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,260
but two fingers worth of something delicious like screwball something

188
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,800
really classy

189
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,760
we sit back and we sit on this week is that

190
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,900
jumped out on them

191
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,060
now i like that and it's settled next week

192
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,840
liquor we've enjoyed

193
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
yeah okay

194
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,860
rex

195
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,320
tell us the story that you wanted to tell us earlier

196
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,880
so i uh...

197
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,540
i was at a time i flew back in today

198
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,700
uh... part of the reason why this that was it was late

199
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,020
and i was

200
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,300
color like rushing to get off the plane is kinda like a fucked up thing where

201
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,140
the plane landed too early

202
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,980
and then you're like waiting at the gate

203
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,980
and then i was like way at the back of the reform southwest by the way

204
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,460
affluent all over

205
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,620
but have you found southwest airline airline uh...

206
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,260
no doubt

207
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,980
so you know they fuckin

208
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,460
like just don't have assigned seats it's just a free-for-all

209
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,980
no i have not flown southwest airlines i'm realizing yeah

210
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,260
that can't be [ __ ] true it's completely true

211
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,780
first class is first come there's no first class

212
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,180
it's just all class whoa you can see there's no dividing

213
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,220
communism airlines i hate that [ __ ] i was just way at the back of the plane

214
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,540
because i had like the last boarding pass but whatever so i

215
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:19,540
So I finally get off, I'm rushing through LaGuardia, I'm like, I haven't sent any texts since I

216
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:26,940
landed, I'm like ready to go, get in my cab, have a nice relaxing cab ride, send all the

217
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,540
texts I need to, over the 30-40 minutes it's going to take.

218
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,540
You love texting.

219
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,380
I do love the text.

220
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,340
So I get in the cab, and I'm like, he's like, "Where are you going?"

221
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,540
And I'm like, I tell him my address, and he just starts driving, and I'm like, "Don't you

222
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,140
need to you know put that into your GPS?" He's like "no no you direct me." I was like "what?"

223
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:58,140
Okay, so you got a voice. All right. So uh well I didn't mean to do the voice. Anyway. You already

224
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:06,460
did it so you have to continue. Yep do it again. So I'm like "okay uh go right here" and so he just

225
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,940
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

226
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,580
- This is not an Uber, this is a taxi.

227
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,420
- This is a taxi, this is a taxi.

228
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,020
- And tell me why you would choose a taxi

229
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,860
over a Rideshare app.

230
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,380
- It was closer, and I was lazy.

231
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,340
'Cause at LaGuardia-- - 'Cause it was.

232
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,020
- Button on your phone, man. - The exit?

233
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,060
- No, no, no, no, no, to the exit.

234
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,500
- 'Cause you have to go to the,

235
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,860
you have to walk over to the parking deck at LaGuardia

236
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,260
to get into an Uber, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

237
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,400
You go down the escalators,

238
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
and then your just taxis are right there on the left.

239
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
- Yeah.

240
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,360
- Or you can walk to the thing and do your Uber.

241
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,420
And I was like, I don't feel like fucking with that.

242
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,200
The taxis are fine.

243
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,600
I've never had a problem with the taxis.

244
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,880
So I get into this taxi and you know how like

245
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,760
every app gives you like little mini directions

246
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,800
to optimize your route.

247
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,460
So I'm like telling this guy like, okay, take a left.

248
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,300
Okay, now take a right.

249
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,400
- And you're looking at your phone.

250
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,120
- I'm looking at my phone the whole time

251
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
trying to direct this guy.

252
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,820
He little does he know you are his GPS.

253
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,660
- Yes.

254
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,540
And like maybe like five minutes in, I'm like,

255
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,440
"Hey, this would probably be easier

256
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,260
"if I just input it into your GPS for you.

257
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,280
"Is there any way I can do that?

258
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,220
"Would you do that?

259
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,920
"Maybe that would be a better..."

260
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
So she goes, "Same thing, no difference."

261
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,360
- Wow.

262
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,600
- I was like, "Okay, all right."

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,800
So I thought-- - I think that this

264
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,720
was either his first shift

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,720
or his very last shift as a taxi driver.

266
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,480
- Yeah, I was like, what?

267
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,960
It was the most confusing thing of all time.

268
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,400
And I just couldn't believe it.

269
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,840
Like what kind of person drives without using the app now?

270
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
- Especially picking up people

271
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
from the airport all the time.

272
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,720
- Right.

273
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,120
And it wasn't like he didn't have the GPS built

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,760
into his car directly in arm's length of him.

275
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,320
He just didn't want to do it.

276
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,840
So did you push after this?

277
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,320
Since he said it's the same difference.

278
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Like, do you just go with it?

279
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Yeah, I had to!

280
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
He said no difference.

281
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Might as well just put it in if it's no difference.

282
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
If it's the same thing.

283
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,320
No, he said no difference as in like, it makes no difference

284
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,320
if you just tell me the direction so I'm not going to do it.

285
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
He's saying it's too much of a hassle to put it into the GPS.

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Yeah.

287
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
You know what I would have done?

288
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:47,200
a

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,160
and taking the train back because it was pissing me off so much. Yeah that would

290
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,120
have made me pretty mad. I mean if you know if you brought this up to go in on

291
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,840
taxi drivers let's fucking do it man. First of all. Also they have a new app now what

292
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,960
the fuck is that? A new app? Yeah they have arrow instead of curb. Oh what

293
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,360
really? Yeah. So you do use an app to call it? No no no no I got it cuz cuz curb has

294
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,620
the screens right? Uh-huh. Well this had the screen but it was for something called

295
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,720
Arrow. Had Sandy Kenyon and fucking Jeopardy. It just did the same loop every

296
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,460

North Carolina waited about half an hour for it. We go downtown. Oh, this is what guy it by the way guys

318
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,140
This is why I want to class stuff up a little bit while I was in North Carolina

319
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,920
me Chad and Adam went to a

320
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,400
Cocktail bar at bespoke cocktail bar mind you with a bartender who had a twirly mustache

321
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Uh huh.

322
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,200
And instead of a menu he'd say, "What kind of spirit do you like?"

323
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Oh, a spirit.

324
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,280
And I'd say, "I'm not too kind to those of the other world, those who have passed on."

325
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,040
He said, "No, it's a name that we gave alcohol."

326
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Uh huh.

327
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
I said, "Okay, well I like that."

328
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,520
And he said, "Do you like gin, vodka, whiskey, or tequila?"

329
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
I said, "I like tequila."

330
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,560
He said, "Do you like savory flavors or fruity flavors?"

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,160
And I said, "I like savory flavors!"

332
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,680
I like fruity flavors, actually.

333
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,320
I really like fruity flavors.

334
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,360
And he made me one of the most delicious things I've ever had, guys.

335
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
And this was an amazing drink.

336
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,680
So now I'm into this kind of thing.

337
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,200
Anyway, on the Uber over there, I get a woman named Paulina.

338
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,480
She says, "Where are you going tonight?

339
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,160
What's Ernest Money and Sons?"

340
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,640
Name of the bar, by the way.

341
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,720
Ernest Money and Sons.

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,000
Ernest Money and Sons.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
is

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:56,240
a

345
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,160
want to meet Ernest Money I'd like to shake the hand of every single one of his sons.

346
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,280
Bring them all out right now. But if you're in Wilmington, North Carolina this is a good

347
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,200
place to go guys. It is a private club which means you have to pay $5 to be a lifetime

348
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,040
member so if you don't have your money straight, if you don't have your cash correct, don't

349
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,880
even try. Anyway, Uber over there, a woman named Paulina picks me up, she's about 80 years

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,920
old and she says, "What is Ernest Money and Sons?" I've dropped people off there before.

351
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:32,040
listening to positive encouraging K love radio which is a southeastern Christian

352
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:39,160
radio station and I say it is a bespoke cocktail bar basically say exactly what

353
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,120
I just said to you guys bespoke cocktail bar and I thought she was gonna say well

354
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,880
what is that what's bespoke mean she says what is a cocktail she's 80 years old

355
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,480
old man and she had never heard of this concept and I said a cocktail is when you mix two

356
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
things together.

357
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
That's true.

358
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,800
She said well that sounds great and then full silence as we drive all the way, about 25

359
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,880
minutes there, just blasting Newsboys on the radio.

360
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
That's awesome.

361
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah, it was great man.

362
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,080
Someone linked the Earliest Money and Sons webpage and I'm looking at their Instagram.

363
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,520
Guys, they need more traction in their Instagram.

364
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,120
We should do a shout out on our stories

365
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
for Ernest Money and Sons on Instagram.

366
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,960
- See, people who own bars don't realize

367
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
that nobody sees a picture of a drink like this.

368
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,620
It's not like food.

369
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,240
There's no like, nobody's doing like a cheese bomb

370
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,920
type of thing on this where it's like,

371
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,840
oh, I need to eat those fries so badly.

372
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,400
This is like, this could be a fucking...

373
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,040
Uh, uh, this could be piss.

374
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,240
This doesn't look like anything.

375
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,580
Yeah, none of these look like anything.

376
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,300
This is the same problem I have when I watch, uh...

377
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,600
Badlands.

378
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,560
Badlands Chugs.

379
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,720
Is he'll just like-

380
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,840
I miss my people.

381
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,720
-Earn this money. -He'll just-

382
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,000
He'll just have like a bucket and just like

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,200
put a bunch of like different sodas in it and just make a black concoction.

384
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,720
And drink it and go like,

385
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,320
"Aww, that's so yummy."

386
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
And I watch that every single day, basically.

387
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,760
and i go like i don't know what how what my how much support to feel but after

388
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,960
watching that they are my supposed to a great soda

389
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,040
my supposed to be a c_e_o_ me

390
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,880
you think he he has big soda

391
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,440
propping him up

392
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,040
i think completely a

393
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,360
one hundred percent

394
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,960
he might be big soda

395
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,880
uses so they would call him if you played basketball

396
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
you know b is gonna name on the court

397
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,880
but before we get off of uh... rex's trip

398
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,220
i wanted to tell

399
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,060
to quickly mention, when we wanted to record like in the middle of the week, I checked

400
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:51,160
Discord and at like around 11am I see a message from Rex where he sent us a picture of a Rick

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,820
and Morty cart and a Squid Games cart.

402
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Oh yeah, I have it right here.

403
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,220
I'm hitting that shit.

404
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Wait, you have them?

405
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,220
We're like, oh that's so funny.

406
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,540
No, no, it's the same thing.

407
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
So it's an R&M brand.

408
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Which stands for Rick and Morty.

409
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Squidbox.

410
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Oh, okay.

411
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,980
Okay, so I'd like for you to give us a vape review, live on air.

412
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
First ever.

413
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,500
And I'd like for you to talk into your microphone as well.

414
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
It's not very good.

415
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,820
Somehow it got quieter when you got closer.

416
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,700
It's not a very good microphone.

417
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
There we go.

418
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,100
But it does have a wind strap.

419
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Detachable even.

420
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,900
That's what I thought was so crazy.

421
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,100
Why would you ever keep a vape on your wrist?

422
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,180
Well, it's even, it's a neck strap so you can, you know, work at your gas station job

423
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,900
and you don't lose your vape.

424
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
That's just fuck.

425
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:55,300
Anyways, he sends this at 11am and then around like 2 or 3 my time I text the group chat,

426
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,700
"Yo guys, you guys want to record tomorrow night?"

427
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,180
And what do you know, Rex tells us.

428
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,500
Oh, I am so sick. I can't even say like more than two words before I start hacking

429
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,280
So I was like this motherfucker

430
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,560
Gave himself cancer and it's like no I can't I just can't record the podcast anymore

431
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,700
You think he got got by the squid box?

432
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,660
No, I was already sick when I bought this guy's what it looked like and it was really funny to me

433
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,460
That he got completely gone by the squid box

434
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,940
Yeah, that was not a wise purchasing decision I was in the middle of

435
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Southeast Missouri, I went to a gas station to buy a vape.

436
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,200
I bought, uh, like a diamond air bar.

437
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,260
And I bought a favorites and I bought a squid box because it made me laugh.

438
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,940
And I tried it once and I thought I posted it.

439
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,660
Someone said, relax.

440
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,500
He's not, he's not well.

441
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,580
He's actually not well. He hit it one time. He didn't cough the first 20 minutes.

442
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,180
And now he's having to... He turned off his microphone to cough.

443
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,980
Oh.

444
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,580
Whew. Anyway.

445
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:18,380
I posted it on Twitter and someone replied that the people who got

446
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,880
tracheotomies from vaping got them from hitting the R&M vapes.

447
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,580
Is that true?

448
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,980
I didn't know.

449
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,220
I don't think it is, but the little part of me that thinks it could be true made sure I never hit it again.

450
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,380
And here you are hitting it.

451
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,500
It was not, it's in the chat. He's making fun of you.

452
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,940
Yeah, I am fucked up dude.

453
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,020
I hate being sick, but I haven't been sick in some time and I'd like to get it sick again.

454
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,500
No, it's not pleasant. You think it's not that bad and then you get it and it is bad.

455
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,060
So what got you?

456
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:59,200
See the only kind of sick that's good is when you're kind of making it up a little bit like you don't feel great

457
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,640
But you could definitely still live a normal life, but you're taking the excuse. Yeah

458
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,460
Yeah, okay. I'm sick. I get to be sick for two days. Whatever

459
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,940
watch TV

460
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,100
So what's the thing that got you actually Rex?

461
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,140
It's probably

462
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
the coronavirus

463
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,080
It is most certainly the corona. Yes. I definitely got it from a from like a they're saying it's back

464
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,440
They're saying COVID is back, sleeping bugs are...

465
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,940
*Squeak*

466
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Bed bugs, sleeping bed bugs...

467
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,120
Sleeping bugs?

468
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
Are crawling all over every single major town in the world.

469
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,160
The fuck is sleeping bed bugs? I wouldn't be worried about a sleeping bug.

470
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,400
They are completely immune to any weapon now, is what I've heard.

471
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
Alright, have you guys ever had bed bugs?

472
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,520
No, and I really hope to keep it that way.

473
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
I had them one time when I was in high school.

474
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,320
And it was the same week that our washer and dryer broke

475
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,240
Oh, I had to haul I had to haul all this shit

476
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,360
Till that cuz you're supposed to like put it in the dryer for like three hours or something

477
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,620
Because it kills them or some shit and I had to I had to like dry

478
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,040
Everything that we owned at a laundromat down the street and I definitely I didn't know what I was doing

479
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,440
I definitely gave bed bugs to like 4,000 people

480
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,560
For sure. Yeah, that's awesome. Anybody else who went in that launcher Matt definitely got bedbugs

481
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,840
My yeah

482
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,880
Apparently like started in Paris and it's been like spreading fucking all over

483
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,360
It's a Mexican destructible bedbugs. Yeah. Yeah, it's a Mexico City right now and I just picked up

484
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,200
My girlfriend who just came back from Mexico City

485
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,040
So I will be spending the next part of it and not sleeping on our bed. I'll be sleeping on the floor

486
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,300
If it started in Paris, it's definitely in my bed

487
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,640
What is that? Why is that?

488
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,520
What's that people I have over

489
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,560
Parisians

490
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,040
Beautiful Parisian women stinkies lay in my bed and I paint them. They're completely stinky. Yeah, I

491
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,560
Paint beautiful women I do amazing

492
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,840
What do you think?

493
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,160
Huh, what do you think has the stinkiest apartment out of all of me? I have a fucking dog. I have a dog

494
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,020
Yeah, it's true. Yeah, it's got to be me if you have a dog

495
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,540
Please say my mom's house smells like so much fucking shit, dude

496
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,880
I walked into my mom. They have two dogs and it smells so it smells double bad and

497
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,900
They're what both of the dogs are so fat. They're the fattest dogs of every single time

498
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,000
There's a video my mom took like two years ago

499
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:43,980
Where I hadn't been home in like a year and I got home and my my mom's dog got fat in that one year

500
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,320
Went from like just a normal dog to the fattest dog. You will ever see in your entire life and

501
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,020
There's a video she took of me hysterically laughing and like like getting back in my car

502
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,120
Because I like can't even I can't even look at him. It was like the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life

503
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,320
anyway, that is the fattest ugliest dog of all time and

504
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,760
Yeah, dogs smell like shit cats. I don't know which one was worse though a cat apartment or a dog apartment

505
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
I think

506
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,080
Usually it's got a bunch of hair in it all over the place

507
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,240
But a dog apartment has just a bunch of piss and shit all over the floor

508
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,800
Yeah, a dog apartment has piss and shit. You literally keep the cat shit in the house

509
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,720
Yeah, but they shit in the little

510
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,520
that's what it dot my dog doesn't she but i guess it's shit inside at the end

511
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,500
since he was like

512
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,360
two months old

513
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,320
he just smells bad because he plays in shit

514
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,620
vote the previous tenants

515
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,920
at my place

516
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,680
the like downstairs they just locked the dogs in there all the time

517
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,040
and let them just piss and shit on the ground

518
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,820
and the entire like a_c_ is like straight-up yellow

519
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,520
from michael it's uh...

520
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:12,440
the

521
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:19,440
that

522
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,440
You and Brian going to get kidnapped for an entire Saturday.

523
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,740
- That sucked.

524
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,520
- I didn't also talk about my little thing about my haircut,

525
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,480
which I thought was really funny.

526
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,940
- Uh-huh.

527
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,120
- And I think that's the four things that happened this week.

528
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
- Okay, well let's go through them in order.

529
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,920
What was the first one you said?

530
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,560
- I mean, I guess the first one that happened

531
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,720
was my haircut.

532
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,960
I just thought it was funny.

533
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,360
So I finally went to get my haircut

534
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,080
after like a couple months,

535
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
and I didn't really know where to go,

536
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,400
So I just went to a place that my girlfriend has gone to before and I went with her.

537
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,920
So I was like, "Oh, I'll just go with you and I'll just get a haircut or whatever."

538
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:08,760
So we go to this place and a little callback when we're talking about glasses, I have got

539
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,560
both the things.

540
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,880
I can't see far or near.

541
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,840
So whenever I'm getting a haircut and I take my glasses off, I can't see myself in the

542
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,920
mirror.

543
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,260
So I just sit down, she's cutting my hair, I'm like, "Oh, you know, I just want..."

544
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,700
I didn't really have the strength to be like, "I'll just get like a mullet or whatever."

545
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,100
So I just want to get like, you know, two on the sides and just a little bit off of

546
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,100
the top.

547
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,020
You know, normal guy haircut.

548
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Normal Hitler haircut.

549
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
Yeah.

550
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,780
So basically, she starts cutting and I have to hold back for like the entire time because

551
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:49,500
I'm like I just came to the HGW hair place where the guy next to me is getting his hair

552
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,380
like painted like pink and yellow and I'm just like sitting here asking for the Hitler Youth

553
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,380
cut.

554
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,020
And I was trying so hard not to laugh and then she's like okay I'm done, put my glasses back

555
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,220
on and is like oh it doesn't look like Hitler that much.

556
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
And like.

557
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,380
You look like a complete Hitler.

558
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,380
I immediately, the fan service was like this is so funny.

559
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
I just got the Hitler at this like, S&W.

560
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,380
You went to sports clubs with two S's man.

561
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,380
You need to stop going there.

562
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:24,380
No, I went to the, it's like complete, it's you know, it's where girls, annoying girls get their hair painted in crazy ways.

563
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,380
It's where, you know, it's in a rich part of town.

564
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,380
It's completely not where a guy is supposed to just go and get like, oh let me just get a two and live off the top.

565
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,380
And I still went there and I was like, yep, let me get that, let me get that Hitler, please.

566
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,580
But they did a good job, I feel great.

567
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,540
You need to get a funny haircut.

568
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,860
You need to get a normally...

569
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,940
I wanted to get a mullet, but I was too meek and quiet and shy.

570
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,560
Don't be so shy and quiet then.

571
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,420
You're such a bombastic piece of shit.

572
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,300
This guy, for people who don't know, Jubio is like Chris Farley style.

573
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,340
He shows up, he opens your fridge, he starts rummaging through perfume pills and shit,

574
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Russian

575
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:29,340
to

576
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:43,340
the

577
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:50,340
one woman that's bold. Who's that? Will Smith's wife. True. I thought you were talking about

578
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Doja Cat. She is the Hitler cut, you know what I'm saying? She is in the Hitler cut. She's

579
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:05,180
making Hitler cuts. Yeah. That's the kind of music she makes, y'all. Thank you. Thank

580
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:12,420
you Doja Cat. Let's go! This is a racist Nazi. Get the fuck away from me, you skinhead. Yep.

581
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,420
I thought you were pointing at me.

582
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
And she completely dates white guys.

583
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
And also, stop dating honkies.

584
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Thank you so much.

585
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Stop showing me your feet in our racial chat rooms that we hang out in.

586
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,420
And get your feet out of my mouth.

587
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
Maybe the all time funniest tweet.

588
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Forever.

589
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Who is she?

590
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Noreatka.

591
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
Noreatka, dude, he's the man.

592
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
She in racial chat room, showing feet.

593
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
Alright, now.

594
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Next thing in order.

595
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Caleb and Brian got kidnapped for half a day.

596
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,420
So like I was saying last time on Pears We Drink.

597
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Previously.

598
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,420
Me and Brian had to go to a...

599
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Party.

600
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Nevermind.

601
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
I was gonna say it.

602
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
I have to say it.

603
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
I have to say it now.

604
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
I won't say it.

605
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,420
We get there, it looks exactly like a plantation.

606
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,540
and they immediately make us clean up.

607
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,380
That's all I'm saying.

608
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,200
- That's awesome.

609
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,700
- That's all I'm gonna say.

610
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,660
They made us clean up.

611
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,780
That's all I wanna say.

612
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,500
Anyway, we get there and this is the most

613
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,420
demonic shit ever, guys.

614
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,460
There is so many, like this is an evil piece of property.

615
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,100
There's scary demon, they had a demon

616
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,100
that had a big cock, like statue.

617
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,460
And I was like, what the fuck is up with that?

618
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,460
That's some crazy shit.

619
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,780
and they were like yeah uh... it's just the the the previous owner was a

620
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,020
collective

621
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,660
the clack they collected the the fuck you tell me about cock guys yes here's a

622
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,920
cock

623
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,860
they had a scavenger hunt for that

624
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,820
alcohol for the car

625
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,540
and me and brian all those all two of those scavenger hunt places they're like

626
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,180
a map that's getting from the map that had all the alcohol

627
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,960
the place you get out the whole lake

628
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,880
marked on the map and people were only going to the two closest ones.

629
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,280
So me and him are there for 12 hours.

630
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,400
So at the end of the day, the last three hours were me and him walking to the last three

631
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,380
places and just taking all of the wine and stuff.

632
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,320
It was really awful.

633
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Everybody was taking mushrooms.

634
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Really?

635
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
God.

636
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,640
Except for me and Brian.

637
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,480
People are taking, they're micro dosing mushrooms.

638
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
They're sitting there.

639
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,320
I gotta be quiet because you might hear me.

640
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,680
They're sitting there, everybody there was dressed like a fucking pirate.

641
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,040
sitting around eating the worst food imaginable.

642
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,120
They were like, "Oh, dinner will be served soon."

643
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,440
Dinner was some fucked up eggplant salad that was like, it was disgusting.

644
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,440
It was so disgusting.

645
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,640
And then also Brian got in a fight with a woman because he thought that she didn't like

646
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
him.

647
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,560
He was just all fucked up.

648
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,360
a girl who's like not that nice to him and at the end of the night he walked up to her

649
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,560
and he's like "so you fucking hate me"

650
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,720
"you fucking hate me, what's that about?

651
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
why do you hate me so much?"

652
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,160
she was like "what are you talking about?"

653
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,440
and she was like "yeah, i can tell you fucking hate me"

654
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,640
"what, is it how i look?"

655
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,680
and i just went to the bathroom and i was like "i can't be around this dude"

656
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,920
drunk brian is so crazy

657
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,000
I get scared when I'm around drunk Brian.

658
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm like, he might get in a fight.

659
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,880
He might punch someone right now because--

660
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
- He was so ready to go.

661
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,760
- He tried to fight, one time we were playing pool

662
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
and he wanted to fight this guy

663
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,160
and then I had to explain to Brian that the guy was gay.

664
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,240
And I was like, you can't fight this guy, man.

665
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,320
This is not a good look for you to fight this gay guy

666
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,400
at this bar right now.

667
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,240
Because he thought that he was being mean

668
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,160
but he was just saying kind of gay stuff.

669
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,000
he was like yeah like it was a brian would like miss a shot and the guy would be

670
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,040
like nice shot and brian was took that as like fuck this guy but really he was

671
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,960
just being kind of catty or whatever right but it was so fucking funny and

672
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:19,200
anyway that day sucked okay next one oh you were you became a slave to your mom

673
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
on your trip.

674
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,720
Okay guys, so I went to North Carolina this past week.

675
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,160
I went to North Carolina because my mom called me about a month and a half ago and she was

676
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,760
like "Hey, the car that you sold your stepdad is still in your name because you didn't get

677
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,360
the bill of sale notarized."

678
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,320
Wow, he's opening the Sour Monkey triple IPA, or triple Sour Monkey already?

679
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
You finished the beast sphere?

680
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
The beast spheres?

681
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,820
if you see yourself

682
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,060

683
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,120

684
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,060

00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,160
so while you're here you can help us move

701
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,120
and i kinda see what's going on at this point i'm like okay i think i'm seeing

702
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,360
what is really happening

703
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:48,240
So, I look at flights, the flights that leave on the 30th and come back on the 2nd are like,

704
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,240
they're like $500.

705
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
They're like so expensive.

706
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,480
And I was like, I'm not paying more than $100 to come help you move.

707
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
This isn't happening.

708
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm going to come on the 3rd and leave on the 6th.

709
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
And she was like, "Okay, whatever."

710
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,000
She was all mad about it.

711
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,440
I get there on the 3rd.

712
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,440
She picks me up from the airport, immediately takes me to her old house.

713
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,440
They waited to move until I got into town.

714
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
Oh my god.

715
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,120
So I spent the next two days, all I did on my trip home, except for go to Ernest Money

716
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,840
and Sons and have an amazing tequila cocktail, is move boxes of fucking books and bullshit.

717
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,160
And also she didn't pack in normal boxes, she just put everything in the Tupperware she

718
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,740
has in her house because she didn't want to spend money on boxes.

719
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:38,400
So I'm moving a box this big with pins in it, and I'm stuffing it into the back of her car.

720
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
It made me, I was fuming dude.

721
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Oh god. I would be pissed.

722
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,400
And then we get to the, and it gets worse guys, we get to the DMV.

723
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Uh huh.

724
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,400
Hand them my ID. I like to handle the thing that I like to do.

725
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
She says, "Oh well you, yeah, exactly."

726
00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:00,400
She says, "Oh well you could have just gotten it notarized in New York. They send you a fax and then you could have just sent it."

727
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh no.

728
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
This bitch makes me come down.

729
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,380
And also so she was like she was like I'll pay for your flight and I said, okay cool

730
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,440
She says I'll reimburse you $50. So I'm losing I lost like a hundred and thirty bucks

731
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah on just the flights to go home and help my mom move

732
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,800
To help my mom. I had to help my mom. How awful is this story?

733
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,000
This is the worst story of all time. She needs to go to jail. Yeah, I'm sorry

734
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,540
That's horrible.

735
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,600
I'm popping off on everybody.

736
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Taxi driver's my mom.

737
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,300
Whatever.

738
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,220
Yeah.

739
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,180
I'm sorry, man.

740
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,220
I'm s-

741
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,720
Yeah, that is horrible.

742
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,220
That's okay.

743
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,100
That- It's okay.

744
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,840
It makes me fuckin'-

745
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,520
It makes me sick to my stomach.

746
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,860
Well, at least I don't have cancer like Rex.

747
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,320
What was the fourth one?

748
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
What was the fourth one?

749
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,980
Uhhhh...

750
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,780
I forgot.

751
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,820
I think Rex-

752
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,320
I- Rex-

753
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,120
You went out of town.

754
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,940
You didn't even tell us.

755
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,320
You- I- I found out-

756
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,480
Like, a day or two ago when I-

757
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,600
I said something to you and you were like,

758
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,100
"Oh, I'm out of town."

759
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah.

760
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:07,900
it

761
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,060
wins too

762
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,900
so i small town

763
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,420
into me to my girlfriend's parents

764
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,100
and stay with them for a week

765
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,220
uh... and i immediately got sick

766
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,420
and then like

767
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,900
the first by the way now that i think about it was probably what they were

768
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,540
expecting from uh... it was a guy dating their daughter coming from new york city

769
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,040
Yes.

770
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,540
Do you just get off here immediately?

771
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,040
Like, do you have a handkerchief?

772
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
And my nose is running.

773
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
My allergies.

774
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,540
So anyway.

775
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,040
I finally start to like feel a little better on like Thursday.

776
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,540
And uh...

777
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,040
They're like, "We want to have family game night.

778
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,040
Please join us."

779
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
And the dad gets Heineken.

780
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Like a 12 pack of Heineken.

781
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
Okay.

782
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
So I'm like, "I'll have one beer.

783
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm gonna like be as non-competitive as possible. Yeah, I'm gonna be like we're playing uno. It's going great

784
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,380
the dad comes in and

785
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:16,560
He's carrying the big bowl of assorted poker chips and decks of playing cards, and I'm like, oh my god

786
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're already locking in. I'm like no don't do this to me

787
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,600
so they start playing blackjack and

788
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,880
And like, they're playing it like PvP, like they're like playing against the dad.

789
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:39,080
Or like playing against, they're like, but not as the dealer, he's just another guy.

790
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,080
I didn't ask this when you told me this last, were you guys, was anybody putting any money up?

791
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,800
No money, just the chips.

792
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,920
So it's already making you mad just that there's no stakes?

793
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,840
Yeah, it's already zero stakes, there's absolutely nothing to be gained.

794
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,560
Just a waste of fucking time.

795
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,960
But I'm like, oh, that's not actually...

796
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,840
The rules aren't actually that...

797
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,040
You know, there's like a dealer, everyone plays against a dealer.

798
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:04,840
It's not like...

799
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,000
It's not PvP like this.

800
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,200
You're playing it like poker.

801
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,200
And so I'm like, why don't I just deal for you guys?

802
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,320
And I'll just show you guys the rules.

803
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,280
And so I'm doing...

804
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,200
I kind of like get into like the character of like an online poker dealer.

805
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,200
And I'm like, "17, would you like to hit? 13, would you like to hit?

806
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Alright, Parajax, would you like to split?"

807
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Yeah, Sexmonster, I don't know who Kanye West is.

808
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
He's immediately such a pro.

809
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Yeah, I'm like, saying the numbers immediately, I'm like,

810
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,200
taking bets, I'm like, "You win, you lose, congratulations, sir.

811
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
21, blackjack, you know?"

812
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
I can't do it to you.

813
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Yeah, so...

814
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Reading the chat.

815
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,480
I can't, Ryan I'm reading the chat, we're doing crazy time.

816
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,900
*cough*

817
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,400
*cough*

818
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,240
Oh fuck.

819
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,080
Oh jeez.

820
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,580
Anyway.

821
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,040
He's doing this whole thing the entire time, he's just coughing into the damn cards.

822
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,540
Yeah.

823
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,460
So anyway, they're having a blast, they're having a good time.

824
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,720
I feel like I'm like hiding my gambling level appropriately.

825
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,460
Like clearly I know, but I'm not an addict.

826
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,960
Uh huh.

827
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,560
And then they're like, "Okay, let's play poker."

828
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,060
And so they started exploiting the rules of like Texas Hold'em, because like only the mom knows.

829
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:30,520
And we get into this hand where it's like myself versus her brother, and I have a pair of- I have a pocket aces,

830
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
he has pocket kings.

831
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,360
Nothing happens on the first four cards, river comes, it's a king.

832
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,760
He flips over his cards, and I look at him, and there's like a violent twinkle in my eye.

833
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
*laughter*

834
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I am just like, holy-

835
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,760
There's no stakes. I am just pissed. I am like you, like in my head I'm like you

836
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,320
river bitch, you fucking piece of shit, I'll fucking kill you. Like you know, it's

837
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:06,480
over nothing. There's no stakes. But in my head I'm like, oh I can't, I'm like, oh

838
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,880
that's a great, good luck man, that was awesome, great win. Just like violently

839
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:26,320
the

840
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,160
and you're like, "Oh, sweet bananas, what's that?"

841
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,000
- What is that?

842
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,080
- Okay, wait, so eight grapes pays 40x?

843
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,940
Oh, okay, very interesting.

844
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,440
- Oh, that's so interesting.

845
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,400
- You should've taken the casino.

846
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,920
- You should've said, "You wanna know about gambling?

847
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,720
"I'll show you gambling."

848
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,560
- Yeah, well, I was trying not to be like,

849
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,080
you know, I have a $300 a week gambling habit.

850
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,120
Thank you for not saying addiction. We don't use the "A" word in this podcast.

851
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,000
It's not an addiction. It's a habit.

852
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,760
I've made it a habit by being addicted to it for three years.

853
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,640
I think, um...

854
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah, I think that gambling addiction might be...

855
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,960
could be worse than, like, opioid addiction

856
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,440
when it comes to, like, in-laws finding out.

857
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,960
Right. Exactly. I'm like, this is the one thing they can't...

858
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,000
they can know I'm Jewish.

859
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,960
If you're addicted to fucking kills, at least you're skinny, you know?

860
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,460
Yeah.

861
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,580
Kind of non-threatening.

862
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,760
Yeah.

863
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,920
If you're a gambling addict, you're painfully sober,

864
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,020
you've been up for three days,

865
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,760
Yes.

866
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,920
and you are asking them for money.

867
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,800
So that might be the worst case scenario.

868
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,380
It is truly, like, the one thing that, like, every father-in-law would hate to find out.

869
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,300
Yeah.

870
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,100
Yeah.

871
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,760
I was like, "I cannot let them know."

872
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,820
that was like the first time

873
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,540
first time I ever played pool with Jana's family was at my brother-in-law's

874
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,300
wedding

875
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,320
like four years ago or something

876
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,660
and they're just white guys they just play pool they just hit the ball as hard

877
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,140
as they can

878
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,340
and

879
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,980
I'm a good pool player and I

880
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,660
had a eight ball break and run I broke

881
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,020
the rack and then I hit every single ball without my opponent coming to

882
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,980
the table

883
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,220
a single time

884
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,980
and I was so locked in and they were like

885
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,220
uh it was like a magic trick to them you would swear that I was like David

886
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,540
Blaine they couldn't believe it and they were like that was crazy and I

887
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,940
was like dude it is so crazy and then but I felt a demon come over me

888
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,260
and I was like maybe we do like 20 bucks on the next game

889
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,940
no no it's actually a bachelor party let's put 20 bucks actually here

890
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,940
I'll put 20 bucks, you put 5. I'll give you 4-1 odds on the game.

891
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,940
No, dude.

892
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,940
And yeah, I took like... doing that I took like $35 off him on his bachelor party.

893
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,940
Just because I was so addicted to playing pool.

894
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,940
It is so funny when you just accidentally show your real evil personality to...

895
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,940
Like the one people you're not allowed to.

896
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,940
Yeah, the one people you need to put on your pool.

897
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,420
Also, every time I hang out with my in-laws, they're always like,

898
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,020
"You guys want to get crazy tonight and have two beers each?"

899
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,020
Exactly.

900
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,060
And I go like, "I don't know how I'm going to handle two beers, guys.

901
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,460
That might be a little much for me."

902
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,860
So I was only going to have like one beer with her family, and the dad kept bringing

903
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,860
me more beer.

904
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,860
That was a test.

905
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,860
I hate to tell you.

906
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,860
That shit was a test.

907
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,700
Well, he brought me three beers, which is a completely normal amount of beers to drink.

908
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:52,260
I feel like. But then the next morning, he goes, "Oh, my head. Those three beers really

909
00:46:52,260 --> 00:47:01,700
beat me up." So I think fast, think fast. I'm like, "Oh, me too. So hungover. I can

910
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,900
never drink that much beer." Oh, those three beers got me coughing.

911
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,820
What even happened last night guys?

912
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,340
Oh fuck me I had, I had three beers.

913
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,140
Oh my god, three beers?

914
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,980
I don't even know how I did that.

915
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,180
Yeah, I was talking to somebody today about, I think my mom probably thinks that I'm like

916
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,540
a massive alcoholic because every single time I go to her house I just drink wine the entire

917
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:34,460
time like from noon to midnight I'm just drinking wine and I don't have the heart to just be

918
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:49,460
the

919
00:47:49,460 --> 00:48:04,460
on

920
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:11,460
just

921
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,460
right now

922
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,980
I talk to my mom maybe once every month and a half on the phone.

923
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:31,700
I want to give her some kind of jitterbug style or firefly, whatever that like kids phone was.

924
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,620
Something where I can, there should be a program on your iPhone where if you want to you can

925
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:43,140
set a time limit on a phone call and then after 15 minutes or whatever it just makes

926
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,680
it look like the call dropped.

927
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,900
It says call failed.

928
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,940
That would be, if they came out with a new iPhone that had that feature, I would be sitting

929
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,500
in, I would be camping outside of the Apple Store to get this new phone.

930
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I know.

931
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,340
Just certain contacts in your phone.

932
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,660
Imagine being able to stop your mom from talking to you for longer than something.

933
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,740
Dude, it would actually be my mom and the landlord of the office.

934
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Yeah.

935
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,900
Because he's talking to me about how lazy people who pick up trash for a living, how

936
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:21,340
lazy garbage men are. Does he call you often? That's so fucking sick.

937
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:29,660
Your hand plugged is mic'd. I had a crazy thing with my landlord recently.

938
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:34,020
She let us know like I think last month or three months ago. She was like, "You know

939
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,820
what? I don't think I'm going to be able to keep renting to you guys past our winter

940
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:44,060
contract was up which is in January. She just let us know like with

941
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,780
enough time so we can like look for another place. She's like yeah I just

942
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,700
can't do it anymore and you know I got whatever. She's like some excuse I

943
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,400
forgot what she said not something not that crazy. But then like last week she

944
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,140
texted like the previous people like they were staying here and she's like

945
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:07,060
yeah there's like all these issues and I've got like all this all like these

946
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,340
health problems and I just I feel so ashamed with the new guys you

947
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,300
know what and I just completely run out of money and now I was like dude what?

948
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,660
run out of money? I just completely ran out of money when she has done nothing to this

949
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,700
apartment in nearly a year and we pay our rent on time every single time

950
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,820
with that deposit she just completely run out of money I don't she is so insane I

951
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,660
I don't know what she does.

952
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:39,580
I wish I had the patience to ask her what is wrong with her,

953
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,420
but I just--

954
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,700
- You just wanna have to have a conversation with her.

955
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,540
I get it.

956
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,300
- Yeah, every time I see her, it's just so stressful.

957
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,100
I'm like, you know what, it sucks that I do have to go

958
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,100
in January, but I'd rather not deal with you anymore.

959
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,160
I'll take that hit.

960
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,780
I'll take a move to not deal with you.

961
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,180
- I went to buy a house so badly,

962
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,740
but guys, here's a problem.

963
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,200
i have no money

964
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,420
if i had met but uh... thousands of dollars i would buy a house i would have

965
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,120
one of the most fucked up mortgages of all time

966
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,060
i would be paying if the house cost a hundred thousand dollars to buy

967
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,860
in the long run i probably play paying one point eight million dollars that's

968
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,660
the kind of thing i would qualify for

969
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,020
i would still do it

970
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,120
just because

971
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,620
the idea of having to rent for another like ten years

972
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,320
drives me out of my mind and

973
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,220
that's just a little

974
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:40,220
there's no hope

975
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,860
somebody does this after forty minutes every single time

976
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,120
this might be a big deal

977
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,380
uh... this is the there's there's no hope for us guys

978
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,560
in new york city

979
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,920
we need to be living in west texas

980
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,660
i remember driving through west texas and i was looking at zillow

981
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,080
and it was like a hundred acre lots for like

982
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:18,520
for

983
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:25,520
like

984
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,960
The mortgage was about what I pay for like here.

985
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,960
Yeah.

986
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
Dude.

987
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
Yeah, that's my mom.

988
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,000
My mom told me her rent at her old place and it's like huge.

989
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It was huge.

990
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,200
It was like the, it was the biggest house she's lived in, in my lifetime.

991
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,480
It was giant.

992
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,000
And she paid $1,400 a month for it.

993
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

994
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:04,480
for

00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,720
one of those like old drug dealer mansions

996
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,560
yes i think so corny

997
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,440

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,720
yeah nothing green at all but fountains

00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,200

And it's a- it looks weird.

1025
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,460
No, he lives in New York.

1026
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,860
Yeah, I don't know about the Amp House.

1027
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
Why?

1028
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,860
I don't think I want to become a Kaisenet.

1029
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,860
I want to become low-key and mysterious.

1030
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,860
You...

1031
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,860
You're the least mysterious person I've ever met.

1032
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,860
Yes I am.

1033
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,860
Tell me one thing about me.

1034
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
So that's what I mean. It's not that you're mysterious.

1035
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,860
It's that there's just not a lot going on.

1036
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,860
Yeah, there's no mystique.

1037
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,860
Tell me one thing about me.

1038
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,860
You don't have any secrets.

1039
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:55,860
There's nothing worth discovering.

1040
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,860
Yeah, you have kind of just nothing.

1041
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,580
I mean, you need to establish, if you want to be mysterious, you have to have something,

1042
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,220
you need to have like people peeking, you know what it is dude?

1043
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,620
Have people peeking in while you're streaming.

1044
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,220
The hood is actually doing a lot for me.

1045
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,020
I'm going to be completely honest with you.

1046
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,020
That is mystique.

1047
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,940
I think the big thing, Kaisenat's big break was that there was a mouse in his room.

1048
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,940
That's true.

1049
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:25,900
Yeah, that was like, the thing that skyrocketed him to stardom was that there was a mouse

1050
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,900
in his room and he went like *high pitched scream* or something.

1051
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,900
I think it's also the thing where he's just yelling all the time.

1052
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,900
Yeah, I think that you can do that. You need to up your volume

1053
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,900
in a major way. That's what you have to do nowadays to be like the

1054
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,900
biggest streamer in the world. There's a guy... You have to be a scream man. Yeah, there's a guy

1055
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,900
who's like a league streamer who was just like

1056
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,900
meddling, like okay streamer, who wasn't really doing like crazy numbers

1057
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,300
But then he just like switched his whole personality to be like a screaming SQC type beat.

1058
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,900
And right now he's like the biggest European League streamer of all time.

1059
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,900
Really?

1060
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
Just because of his personality.

1061
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Why is that guy who's always at Brookland screaming at League?

1062
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,900
No, he's European. He's completely in Europe.

1063
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,900
Oh, okay.

1064
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Yeah.

1065
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,900
Yeah.

1066
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,900
But as you can see, it's just children, dude.

1067
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,900
It's Kesha.

1068
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
They need to hear screaming.

1069
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,900
Yeah.

1070
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,900
Yeah, I don't know.

1071
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,900
Yeah, I don't know. I don't like streaming that much.

1072
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,900
My little brother who's like 12 years old was just like...

1073
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,900
I would just be... like the night after we went to Earnest Money & Sons, I was like...

1074
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Hungover. Legendary.

1075
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Guys, this is one for the books. We went to Earnest Money & Sons, ate cookout, and we were home by 11 o'clock.

1076
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Oh, dude. I wish I had cookout. We talked about Escape from Tarkov the entire time we were at the bar.

1077
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,900
Game that you played once.

1078
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,300
a game i played one time but i just was

1079
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,440
very interested

1080
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,540
yeah and we were talking about the uh... has had a few people talking about

1081
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,700
missing from park on the entire time

1082
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,300
and the bartender was like

1083
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,520
uh... sorry i can't help but but uh... for a little bit

1084
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,740
it sounds like you guys have compared to our usual clientele so pretty

1085
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,740
interesting lives

1086
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,740
(laughter)

1087
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,740
We were talking about a fucking video game for two hours.

1088
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,740
What the hell is wrong with you?

1089
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,740
But, he was cool.

1090
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,740
Um, what was I saying?

1091
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,740
Oh, yeah, so the night after that, I'm so hungover,

1092
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:35,740
and, uh, we are, I'm sitting at my, at my mom's, like, table, her dinner table,

1093
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,940
dinner table and I'm like eating like a like cereal like dry cereal cuz she only

1094
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,340
had oat milk and I don't fuck with that shit and my little brother comes down

1095
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,980
the stairs like this like tinted fingers right because he thinks that this is kind

1096
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,460
of a cool thing that you do he's 12 years old he's 12 years old by the way six

1097
00:57:53,460 --> 00:58:01,900
feet tall so he towers over me he walks down the stairs like this sits down and

1098
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:08,900
goes "Caleb, have you seen Skibbity Toilet?"

1099
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,900
"Yes! Yes!"

1100
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:22,380
And I said, "Buddy, don't even fucking get me started on Skibbity Toilet right now."

1101
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,700
And then I spent about 20 minutes saying, "Dude, who do you think is going to win? The

1102
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,940
Skibbity men or the cameraman, man? The Skibbities are basically invading the entire city. This

1103
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,720
This is getting really scary if you're a cameraman.

1104
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,000
It was awesome.

1105
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,440
That was like probably the most I've ever bonded with any family member.

1106
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,440
That's so sick.

1107
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,200
Was him telling me about Skibbity Toilet.

1108
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,720
Was he team toilet or team cameraman?

1109
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,800
You know he team toilet.

1110
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,800
They got that song.

1111
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,800
That's true.

1112
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
The one song.

1113
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
They got that song.

1114
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Every single one video.

1115
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,720
Yeah, how could you be team cameraman when Skibbity got that song?

1116
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,600
I thought the skivvies were the evil ones and the cameraman were the good ones.

1117
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,040
I got an evil brother man.

1118
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
That's true.

1119
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,720
Is he the tallest in your family?

1120
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,720
By far.

1121
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,720
Oh yeah.

1122
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,240
He's 12 years old, he's 6 feet tall.

1123
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:16,160
It makes me so mad dude.

1124
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,120
It makes me so fucking mad.

1125
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,720
And he also has, he can't, he can't play sports.

1126
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:31,560
He like is interested in the knives on CSGO, but he doesn't play CSGO.

1127
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:36,200
He gets on and he looks at every knife skin and then tries to find real life versions of

1128
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
them.

1129
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
That's his version of a sport.

1130
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Oh dude, you're making me depressed.

1131
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,560
It's, no, no, it's very cool.

1132
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:48,760
It's very cool and he will grow up to be one of the most normal adults who ever lived.

1133
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:55,760
He needs to be playing sports, he needs to come home and be training on aim trainer.

1134
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:01,760
Your ass went to a small town for one week and you're like, this boy better be on a football event.

1135
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,760
We need eugenics.

1136
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,760
This boy needs to drop that damn Xbox and a phone. It's making him fruity.

1137
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,760
He loves the phone and it is making him fruity.

1138
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:20,240
Yeah, I think having a brother that much younger than me has definitely made me...

1139
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,160
I think whenever I want to have kids, we're going Amish, dude.

1140
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
Okay.

1141
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
There's no...

1142
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,760
TV and video games and looking at a phone is so bad for a kid.

1143
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,280
Well, okay.

1144
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,360
You were on the computer when you were like 11.

1145
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,000
Not, but I didn't have this one.

1146
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,720
I didn't have this tapping one.

1147
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:46,120
I think there's a balance that you'll find when you get to that point that you are not

1148
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,440
thinking of right now.

1149
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,440
Yeah.

1150
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,040
No, no, no.

1151
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,880
I think...

1152
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:57,800
I like to believe that I would pass down the genetics able to be on the computer all the

1153
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,020
time and turn out at least moderately normal.

1154
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,040
You are going to tell your kid to play Mario 64 and be like "you're going to enjoy this."

1155
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,040
I would not do that to them.

1156
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,440
You're going to do that.

1157
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,680
I was thinking today whether or not I would let my kid play the Persona games and what

1158
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,680
it would teach them.

1159
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,200
I think probably 13 years old.

1160
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,120
Well it's Pokemon but then there's all this weird stuff with boobs.

1161
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,120
Then I skip over.

1162
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,360
Skip all the stuff with the boobs.

1163
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,800
What happens with the boobs?

1164
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
They jiggle.

1165
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,120
And it's just odd.

1166
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,080
supposed to be in high school and the whole game is like now we're gonna go to

1167
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:43,760
the I'm trying to discover the mystery of the serial killer and they're like

1168
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,600
before we find the serial killer let's all go to the bathhouse and all the guys

1169
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,280
are gonna try to sneak up on the girls that look at them in the in the shower

1170
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:58,400
yeah and I fucking watch it just so I know how to avoid it my next playthrough

1171
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,000
so that I know exactly what parts to skip.

1172
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But it really is odd, man.

1173
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'll say that much.

1174
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,500
And it's not like it's a game from the 1800s.

1175
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,700
Guys, this is only a 10-year-old video game.

1176
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,700
Mm-hmm.

1177
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:17,000
The thing is, it's just fine for Japanese to be slight pedophiles.

1178
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,500
Uh...

1179
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,000
Yes, we'll probably end on that.

1180
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That's probably a good--

1181
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Don't make my plan that's the end!

1182
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
That's probably a good place as any.

1183
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,720
- Rex thinks that, and I think that's enough for this week.

1184
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,560
- In the episode.

1185
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,800
- That's two weeks in a row, you can't do this to me.

1186
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,480
- You had something wrong with you.

1187
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,640
See Lex, something about being a pedophile.

1188
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,480

1193
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,360
