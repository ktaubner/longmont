00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:06,280
Yeah today at my work a guy came in and he was dressed in like a LARP outfit.

35
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,360
He said he was like Peter Pan. He looked like Peter Pan or Robin Hood, one of the two. Or

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,960
Robin Williams. He was wearing, it was green. Yeah that's true. That's both. Yeah that's kind

37
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,560
of the combination. Yeah and he was holding a big. Robin Peters from Hook.

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,680
a big staff, he had a giant staff and he was like "I'm here for the shoot" and I was like

39
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,760
"I don't think there's a shoot but I like I guess I can check" and he was like "I'm from

40
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,880
experimental media" I was like "okay I'll go check if there's an experimental media shoot,

41
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,880
I'm pretty sure there's nobody here I don't think but I'll go upstairs and I'll ask" and I went

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,280
upstairs and I was like "is there a shoot today?" and everyone's like "no" I was like "yeah" so I

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,480
thought I went back and he was gone. Yeah he disappeared. He threw down. What if no because

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,560
He came to teach you a lesson and his job was done so he just, he just dissolved.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,920
If I hadn't gone upstairs to check you would have cursed me.

46
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,960
Yeah, he left to go, or no, somebody came downstairs and was like, "Oh, it's Robert, okay.

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520

62
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,120
kindergarten yeah but I got in today and then I was hanging out I went I went

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,880
skating down Sunset Boulevard and then I was immediately saw just like a

64
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,040
dude attacking a group of skateboarders and I got so nervous. I was like

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
is that what they do to skateboarders here?

66
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
It's a big problem.

67
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Yeah.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
It's a skateboard apartheid here.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
That's why there's all those tents. They're skateboarders.

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,620
(laughing)

71
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,080
- They make the skateboarders live in Skid Row.

72
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,920
- Yeah.

73
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
(laughing)

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,120
- But, oh, so then I turned around

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,400
to get away from the guy, 'cause I was like,

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
okay, I don't wanna get caught up in this.

77
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
- You're like, I'm next.

78
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,200
- Yeah, exactly, like, oh, I don't wanna be guilty.

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,340
- You looked up, looked down at your skateboard,

80
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,520
and looked back up and ran the other direction.

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,320
- It's like the Scooby-Doo run.

82
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,240
But then I turned around, I was in that parking lot

83
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,280
with the right aid, and then I got--

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,200
- Gower Gulch.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
- Yeah, so I got on the sidewalk,

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,740
and then like a woman walked out of the start like old woman with like

87
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:10,100
sideways beehive hair. Fuck you looked at me and went no skating on the

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,900
sidewalk.

89
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,700
I didn't know what to do. So I just went back to where the guy was fighting.

90
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,400
You're like rather take my chances with yeah. So then I yeah, I don't want

91
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,800
the beehive lady to fucking kill me and then I went back and then I like

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
asked one of the dudes. I was like, Hey, is everything cool here? I don't I

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,000
don't know what's going on. Things like nah man, this dude's bugging. I went

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,200
all right, went back. I'll see you guys later.

95
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,800
I went back to the beehive lady. Yeah, and you said, listen, listen, I'm

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
gonna level with you. You need to tell them to not tell them. You need to go

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
tell that guy to stop beating up the skateboarders. Yeah, they'll listen to

98
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,320
you can I grind your hair yeah so I did I tell you the dude was he had a camera

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,580
with him so from far away it looked like a dude was filming his friend skating

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,880
yeah so I was like oh shit classic LA moment damn and then I get up and the

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,920
dude is in like taking pictures of someone being like what's up oh and then

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,840
the guy had his board like in his hand like he's about the truck smack him and

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,420
he was like you need to go brush your fucking teeth. What kind of was it a flip

104
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,720
video camera? No it was like it was like an old like it was like a DSLR. Really?

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,240
It looked like an older one it had like leather on the sides and like silver. Oh

106
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,400
damn. Wow. They're making a movie. So it's probably just an SLR. Yeah. They're probably making a

107
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,960
movie. They're probably making the new. Mid 90s. The new mid somar. Can't walk

108
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,720
anywhere without making a movie in Los Angeles. Yeah. Yeah I thought I was

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,980
I was walking into a shoot.

110
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,920
I was like, so it was so disorienting

111
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,760
to see like the dude saying, "What's up, ho?"

112
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,580
- What's up, ho?

113
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,900
'Cause no movie would ever have that line.

114
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,740
- People don't say that.

115
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,420
- They wouldn't say it that many times.

116
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,260
- That's true, yeah.

117
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,260
- 'Cause every time the camera got back in the dude's face,

118
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,660
he went, "What's up, ho?

119
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
"What's up, ho?

120
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
"What's up, ho?

121
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,840
"What's up, ho?"

122
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,320
- I'd watch that movie.

123
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,160
- Yeah.

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160

125
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Yeah. Why would he sue me? For putting his credit card online? Also that is traceable back to you.

191
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,100

192
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,980

195
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,600

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,060
like a cast, it's like stuck like how people,

197

Sunset the girl twins have identical have identical dogs yeah I saw it so

274
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:18,080
those are the ones I saw today yeah so there's yeah it's terrible there I think

275
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,860
think they just walk around just waiting for somebody to be like I'm sorry are you

276
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,000
legally are you the girls from legally blondes and Zack and Cody and they say

278
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,240
like and they walk in lockstep gate they walk in lockstep down the street it's

279
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,000
like to look like a glitch in the matrix and isn't isn't this like near like

280
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,120
they're all like agencies right there's right they just walk right past outside

281
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,840
here outside this building. Maybe they think this is a big modeling agency. Maybe.

282
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,880
They're like one day they're gonna see our strut and they're gonna pick us up off

283
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,920
the street and make us famous. We need twin models. We need, we want to, we want to do a

284
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,600
photo shoot where one person's looks really, was wearing really cool clothes

285
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,120
the other person's wearing really lame clothes. Yeah. Highlight our cool clothes.

286
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,520
It's called the prince and the pauper. Yeah. I don't like these twins because

287
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:20,520
it's clear that they have had sex with each other. They're gonna say that they have money but that comes with...

288
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
That's probably why they did it, it's for money.

289
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,520
They were like oh I'll give you $600. Yeah and they just trade it back and forth.

290
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,520
No I'll give you $600. 601! Sold!

291
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,040
I just remember the reason they walk down here is because there's a rest there's a

292
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,040
fast food place called twin sliders. Oh yeah. That serves pairs of sliders and

293
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,520
it's so they go there and they order. You get it for free if you're twins. No.

294
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,400
I've seen them go there. They just buy food. Did you did was it you who's

295
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,080
telling me somebody told me that the twins like walked by while they were at

296
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,480
twin sliders and one of the guys who was ordering at twin sliders turned around

297
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
- I go, "Ha ha, twins for the twins!"

298
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
(laughing)

299
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:17,000
- Remember in like 2004, 2005 when like twins was apparently

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,720
the, according to beer commercials,

301
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,400

302
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,240

308
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,100

I've definitely looked at this website before actually, now that I think about it.

374
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,660

- I'm so ready to, I mean, this'll be definitely

385
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,300
the highlight of my time in L.A. probably.

386
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,560
- Yeah, it's four days.

387
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,180

389
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,520
- 'Cause I have like the biggest paper

390
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,840
I have to fuckin' write.

391
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,680
- Yeah?

392
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,040
- I'm gonna talk about it all week

393
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,840
and I'm never gonna do it. - How many pages?

394
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
- No, it's a word count.

395
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,300
- How many words?

396
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,260
- 3,500.

397
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
35 words?

398
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
That's easy.

399
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,260
I don't even know that many.

400
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
3500 words.

401
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,980
3500, that's fucking...

402
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,540
How many pages would 35 words be?

403
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,660
3500 words would probably be 2 pages.

404
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
No.

405
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,300
Probably be 1.5 pages single spaced.

406
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,260
It's one page that is 3500 words long.

407
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
Yeah.

408
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
That's what I would say personally.

409
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,380
14 pages.

410
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,940
Don't blow into the microphone.

411
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Dude, I'm fucked.

412
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
That's easy, man.

413
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
14 pages double spaced.

414
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
Yeah.

415
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,460
Well, either way, I mean, I can't fuck it right.

416
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,460
3,500 minimum?

417
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
Yeah.

418
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
That's something.

419
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,460
Wow.

420
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,460
That's a lot.

421
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Yeah, this dude sucks.

422
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,460
That sucks.

423
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,100
The longest paper I ever wrote was a paper that I basically just wrote to prove to my

424
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,420
mom that vaccines didn't cause autism.

425
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Nice.

426
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,380
That was like my thesis paper in high school because I was homeschooled.

427
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,220
And she was like, "Just pick a topic."

428
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,300
I was like I'm gonna prove her wrong yeah I'm gonna own my mom with facts and

429
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,140
logic right now my thesis paper in high school was about Chuck Palahniuk

430
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,020
really cool guy yeah yeah what do you guts is nasty to write it huh

431
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:25,740
you mean like the program I was in was like a classical education program

432
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,380
seems like a co-op so I did have like an actual thesis that I had to yeah I had a

433
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:36,540
thesis - my school is super like college prep my we had a program called college

434
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,380
and career ready but that didn't do anything for us yeah like it was

435
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,280
basically like oh you need to know how to use Excel yeah I wish they taught me

436
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,900
how to fucking cook top ramen and have sex at my college yeah um how come in

437
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,780
math class they don't teach you how to balance your checkbook yeah man I haven't

438
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,580
really thought about it like that man but that's kind of fucked up what what

439
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,580
What the fuck?

440
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
What the?

441
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
Wait a second.

442
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,500
I'm starting to think school is kind of like sort of a fucked up institution and shit.

443
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
You know?

444
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Yeah.

445
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,900
School is basically telling me I shouldn't pay my taxes.

446
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah.

447
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
By not teaching me how to do it.

448
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,820
If I can't figure it out, I'm not going to do it.

449
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Yeah bro.

450
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,900
I don't know how to use wikiHow and shit.

451
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,420
You think I know how to use that fucked up bullshit, that green ass website?

452
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
I don't fucking know.

453
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Is it green?

454
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
Oh yeah, I guess it is green.

455
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
It is green, man.

456
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:40,060
has green yeah how is green between wiki how is green we're watching videos where

457
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:46,680
the guy makes yeah he makes the best he does one that's like feathers right he

458
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,180
makes this guy makes guns out of guns guys make swords out of knives this guy

459
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,140
makes imagine I couldn't imagine owning that looks like fucking soul caliber yeah

460
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:03,980
Soul Calibur was such a premium fucking game. Yeah loved violence and ginormous titties. Oh, yeah, they had the best physics

461
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,220
Yeah, they did have the physics

462
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,540
Yeah, they should put Caleb in Mortal Kombat

463
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:19,360
But like no special abilities like I'm so easy to kill no attacks yeah, you're kind of like

464
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,220
You just go

465
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:32,000
Like the never soft I in the Tony Hawk's first gear 3. Why did they that there's a bad gig for that? I yeah

466
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That used to like make me want to vomit when I

467
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,460
Watch the the never soft intro and they would stab the eye and I like I would close my eyes during the the never soft

468
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:51,100
Logo when I was when I was playing portal for the first time the valve thing scared the shit out of

469
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah, I was like damn I'm actually

470
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,980
Scary about it is you don't know what that valve is controlling so yeah

471
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,820
I think controlling like water up and down his like

472
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,980
It's like right or is it his consciousness that you were like and also if you put it halfway. What is that doing?

473
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,740
You know yeah, it's true. It means turn around and mmm. It controls his head. Yeah, or is it?

474
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,460
He just move his head around with it. It's like a handle. It doesn't turn

475
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,420
Damn, he's got a smooth out this handle

476
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,960
Is he you think he's going to I think it looks cool if he does he made a bit so the guy in the video made

477
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,740
a bismuth knife

478
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,660
And which I guess it bismuth is sharp is pointy. Yeah, it's like a mineral. That's oh, he's he's melt

479
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,140
Oh, what the fuck? He's well. That's what he does at the end of his videos

480
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,060
I think I think he destroys the knives a lot of the time us

481
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
Maybe that's not what he's doing now.

482
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,580
He just spilled some fucking bismuth on the counter.

483
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,580
Damn, he's gonna die.

484
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,580
Yo. Bismuth.

485
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,580
You got your bismuth everywhere.

486
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Yeah. Whoa.

487
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Oh, it's fine. It dried instantly.

488
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,580
We can't be watching videos.

489
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
Yeah. It's a bad idea.

490
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Pause it. Press pause.

491
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Dude, we have like

492
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
two seconds left. No.

493
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,580
No, there's a minute. A minute. Okay.

494
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
It's a minute of premium. That's so long.

495
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,400
yet people are paying for this

496
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,640
exactly

497
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,220
yeah we could talk about my guess i mean i'm going to

498
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,540
i feel we've talked about on several times we have a lot of that not in depth

499
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,700
the i mean i looked at his website what it would he has a no doubt i guess i

500
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
could use for that

501
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,100
cancer disease he was a plate in his head yeah

502
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,340
yeah i think i i i think i was a good asset is a new

503
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,620
is not only does any fell off a ladder

504
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,220
and they had to reconstruct is that

505
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,680
so i can't spell

506
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,960
That's probably why he can't spell yes. He's really bad at spelling. Also I do know that the weather greatly affects his

507
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,400
his life because I guess

508
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,400
if like the the pressure in the air gets to some point

509
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:02,120
his head starts really like the metal starts like hurting starts ringing. Yeah, so I do know that

510
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,920
it does affect him. The metal is still a big part of his life. Yeah. Yeah. Um anything else?

511
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,560
No, just covers it.

512
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,840
Uh, is he, is he, does he have style?

513
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,040
He has some of the most amazing style I've ever seen.

514
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Yeah.

515
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,400
Is he, what's his favorite color?

516
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,080
His favorite color is green.

517
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Are you sure?

518
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Yeah.

519
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
100% sure.

520
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Can you ask him?

521
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Yeah, I could text him.

522
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Let's give him a call.

523
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Oh, there he is.

He is a humongous dream theater fan, that's

00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:02,660
What's his name Mike Portnoy is at the dream theater drummer. I think so. Yeah, that's like his bits like his

There it is

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,600
That's a cool photo. He uploaded to my space some fractals. He just thought a fractal was cool. Yeah, yeah

538
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
Get off the screen. This is

539
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Most we're reading something why this is what you do. You're just doing what you do when you call in which is

540
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,360
You just love clicking so much. Well, at least this time you can't hear that you click

541
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,020
Yeah, this is gonna be the first episode like a while or you can't hear me. Can't hear any clicks. Yeah

542
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah, Patrick loves clicking. You'll hear Cameron's natural clicks that come from his body. Yeah

543
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:52,640
That's a snap. That's a click. No, it's not. I was not snapping my fingers. I was just coming out of my mouth. You were snapping your fingers.

544
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:01,000
That's the noise I'm making with my mouth. I can make it simultaneously as I'm speaking. Let's watch a Tech N9ne freestyle video. Stop watching videos!

545
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,240
It's a video of Caleb's uncle. Tech N9ne.

546
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,540
Well, okay, Tech Nine. Do you remember when that other rapper named Tech Nine

547
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,320
died? Yeah. And I was like, it really scared me for a moment. I thought, we're

548
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,640
not going to get a worldwide Choppers 4. Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm going to

549
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,720
change my name to someone really famous and then kill myself. My name's Brad Pitt.

550
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,080
Barack Obama killed himself. Obama Boulevard, baby. Obama Boulevard. I drove

551
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,880
by, there's a street in Los Angeles called Obama Boulevard that I drove by

552
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,920
That's cool. It's named after Malik Obama. It's named after Malik Obama, yeah. Yeah. It was cool.

553
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,840
And then I did a voice to myself for a long time in the car. Yeah, what voice? Don't worry about it.

554
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Yeah, it was good though. Yeah, I'm assuming it was a French accent. It was a French accent.

555
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Boulevard yeah exactly yeah yeah

556
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
man

557
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Obama

558
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Boulevard

559
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
God damn man

560
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Are they gonna hear that on the

561
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Probably not

562
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,360
There's a lot of fuckers downstairs

563
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
I don't really care

564
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Obama Boulevard

565
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,360
They done fucked up in Gabe Obama Boulevard man

566
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
God damn

567
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,360
This is the price they have to pay for

568
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
not having it be over Skype

569
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
You have to hear some people yell in the background

570
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah you have to hear a bunch of theater kids

571
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,360
We can't give you a single good episode.

572
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,180
- I know.

573
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,020
- No matter what.

574
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,860
- No matter what happens.

575
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,680
- That's the podcast about let's promise.

576
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,760
- We absolutely refuse to give you even one.

577
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
- There's gonna be one glaring thing wrong

578
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,640
with every episode.

579
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,460
- With every single one.

580
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,300
- That's right.

581
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,920
- And then someone's gonna point it out.

582
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,760
- Yeah.

583
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,200
- Also they're gonna point out that we can't,

584
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,640
we can't differentiate our voices.

585
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,480
- Oh yeah, fuck.

586
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,300
- When me and Cameron get back to Boston,

587
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,600
we will start pitching my voice up three octaves.

588
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,440
- Okay.

589
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,260
- For every episode.

590
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,100
- That's a good idea.

591
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,000
- Yeah.

592
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,500
Yeah.

593
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,000
Me!

594
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
[LAUGHTER]

595
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,320
And it'll sound like that.

596
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,840
I'm Caleb.

597
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,600
That's Meatwad.

598
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,240
Now that-- we should get Meatwad on the podcast.

599
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,360
That's me, Caleb Pitts.

600
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,080
[GARGLING]

601
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Mom.

602
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Mom, it's me, Caleb Pitts, coming to the house.

603
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,440
Meatwad was probably the first voice I learned how to do.

604
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:06,940
Yeah.

605
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,440
Pretty easy.

606
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
Yeah.

607
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,980
Yeah.

608
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,960
I used to say, Mom, I don't want to clean my room.

609
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,120
That's pretty good.

610
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,000
And your mom would go, Meatwad, go away.

611
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,840
Meatwad, you don't have a room in my house.

612
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,240
[LAUGHTER]

613
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Why are you calling me mom?

614
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Fuck you mom

615
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
AHHHHH

616
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
He just screams

617
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
in the top of her lungs

618
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Oh you're ok

619
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
BSR

620
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
You mean wide voice

621
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,240
What else is

622
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
on his website?

623
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
His website? Yeah

624
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
His ghost hunting tools

625
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
So let's go through here, he has JVC camera

626
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:58,800
yeah then he's got the Fujifilm. We should have just asked her to talk.

627
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,880
As soon as she was leaving I was like oh fuck. One of the cleaning lady came to the office and

628
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,520
we're recording this in a windowless room yeah which I think is a first for us.

629
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,880
At work. No our work doesn't have. No it had windows. No it didn't. Yeah it did.

630
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,120
No that did not have windows. On the left side it had windows. They don't go there literally into like a wall.

631
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,760
Yeah, they're there's an alley. They're frosted so you can't see anything

632
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,000
through them and it's directly into it still there is natural sunlight that

633
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,680
permeates that window. Shut up! I'm saying this is our first window. No, also

634
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,320
how we do used to do in the basement of uh of uh the one when we checked out

635
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,040
that room. Yeah, I'm smart dude. I forgot the way that used to be our spot to

636
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,400
record. That will probably go back to being our spot. Damn, I'm gonna be

637
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,760
graduated though and y'all are gonna be taking this old-ass man into the...

638
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,280
To sign you in. Yeah. Yeah. And I'll just be like, "Huh. There's something about this place that's so

639
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,920
familiar to me. I can't quite place it. Wow." Oh, I remember when I used to roam these

640
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,840
halls. I used to record a podcast with a fat guy and a retard right here.

641
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,840
You're like, "Okay, man, I need your ID."

642
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Yeah, it's still, you're not proving anything.

643
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
You have to leave.

644
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I love you.
