Ack, back, cack, dack, yak, fack, gack, hack.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,480
Do you remember--

29
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,020
I don't know if I should say his name,

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,360
but there was a comic in Boston who was also a rapper.

31
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
We probably actually talked about it pretty early on

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,940
in the show.

33
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,960
There was a comic in Boston who got in trouble for sending--

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
Shane Hoban?

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,420
Yeah.

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
Did you ever listen to his rap?

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,240
We were talking about--

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
you sent a clip of his rap.

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
Dude, it was fucking amazing.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,160
There's a part in the song where he's like,

42
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm a sex offender! I'm a sex offender!

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah, and then it slows down while he's saying that.

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Yeah, I'm a sex offender.

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Crazy, crazy that they like, I don't know, there's like that whole article about him on like the Turtle Boy thing.

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,960
to life when I hear that telltale noise.

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
- What noise? - What's a telltale noise?

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,920
- Sex noise.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
- Oh, oh, like the sound of the chastity belt

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
hitting the floor?

89
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
(laughing)

90
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,240
- Yeah, the lock, the big padlock on the chastity belt?

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,060
- Yep.

92
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,080
- Do you guys ever get like, feel your chastity belt

93
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
like rides up a little bit?

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,360
- I hate it 'cause like I'll go out and skate, right?

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,780
And like I'll sweat and then like,

96
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,740
not even just the cage 'cause I have the belt on

97
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,720
and the cage.

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,560
- Yeah.

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,920
It's I mean, it's it's just like the metal. Yeah, it up against my sweaty

100
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,000
No, and it's it really sucks - I hate I hate fucking having to put the diaper over it

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
That's the second worst part. Yeah

102
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,860
Absolutely. It's like just the you know, it's it's so hard to clean. Yeah, you get in the shower. It's gonna get rusty

103
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,520
I don't write right. I put like a big corn husk over it. Oh

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
Oh, like an empanada.

105
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
That's kind of my--

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,480
because also, my private parts are very squishy, like masa.

108
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,420
So I do have to kind of squish it together

109
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,640
much like an empanada.

110
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,400
Is it empanadas that are in--

111
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm kind of holding it.

112
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,560
You're thinking of tamales.

113
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
Tamale, yeah.

114
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Yeah.

115
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Yeah.

116
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,640
So I was thinking that when you said it,

117
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,960
but I did not want to try and correct you on food.

118
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,080
Also, the chastity belt tan line is

119
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,480
one of the most embarrassing things. It's like a lightning bolt. That's the first thing. That's

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,120
the first bad thing about it is the tan line. It's a tan line. Yeah. Because like, and well,

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,880
not that anybody knows, because I wouldn't ever take it off, at least not until I'm married, but

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,960
right. Not till I'm married the second time. The first marriage I'm staying on. Forever. Right.

123
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,120
I mean, yeah, because like, I know that that was just going to be kind of just nothing to me. Yeah,

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,120
hey, it's called the first marriage for a reason. It's the first one. Exactly. I wouldn't call it

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,400
your first marriage if you weren't gonna have a second one.

126
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Exactly.

127
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,040
So, with my first wife, I won't even take it.

128
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,920
I won't even let her look at my chastity.

129
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,360
I pretend my chastity belt is my privates and I won't let her look at them.

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Yeah.

131
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Yeah.

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,720
My things bend metal since I was born.

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
My things always bend metal.

134
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Really?

135
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,440
I mean, that's the other thing you gotta, you have to, you know, with trends of sex changing,

136
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,960
the way people have sex changing and like you know you got to wear a chastity belt and an

137
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,400
ass to the belt because you never know when your wife's going to come at you from behind

138
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:18,040
that's fucking true as shit actually yeah that's a really good point an ass to the belt yeah

139
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,200
how about your wife ass titty belt might be a really good spencer's gifts idea yeah

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:31,000
yeah that could be good yeah it's got ass and titties on it yeah and it's a belt yeah do you

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,920
Do you remember like in mid 2000s when people were into like belt buckles?

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
What the fuck was that?

144
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,440
People having belt buckles that spun and shit.

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
People have like a-

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
That was sick.

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
That's cool as fuck dude.

148
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
With a studded belt.

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Bring that back.

150
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,000
Dude I almost bought a studded belt.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
I almost bought a studded belt and then I didn't.

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Probably good that I didn't.

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Yeah, I don't think a studded belt is, I don't think it'd look very good on you these days.

154
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
You know what would look really good?

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,760
A karate belt with a big cowboy belt buckle.

156
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,480
I think that could be a really good fashion look.

157
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:12,800
I think any type of karate items would look amaze-y on Meezy.

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
They would look amaze-y on Yeezy?

159
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,440
It would look amaze-y on Meezy.

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
You really think-sies?

161
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,760
Oh, I think-sies it looks amaze-y on Meezy's.

162
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
That's good, man.

163
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,800
Yeah, that's what I say.

164
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,040
My brother had one that was like it like spun around and shit.

165
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
A karate belt?

166
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Yeah, a karate belt.

167
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,440
No, he didn't have a karate belt.

168
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,200
I was the one who did karate, okay?

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
What belt level did you get to?

170
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
It was because my parents got divorced and they thought that it would be...

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I was one under black belt.

172
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Getting...

173
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
No, you weren't.

174
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I was.

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
No, you were not.

176
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
No, you were not.

177
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
No way.

178
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah, in Taekwondo.

179
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It was called a bochudon.

180
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
No.

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,240
Okay, well, we're not talking about that show.

182
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,080
You said karate also.

183
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
But I did Taekwondo.

184
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,640
We're not talking about that show with the little balls come out of the cards.

185
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,660
you what I was not the thing is about Taekwondo is it's just as if you do like

186
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,340
like if you do it for 18 months you are a black belt you don't have to like fight

187
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,840
someone or be good at it you just have to be like good at like saying yes sir

188
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,120
right and then they gave you I hadn't turned 13 yet so they gave me a bochu

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,000
dan instead of a black belt once you turn 13 you are like have this like like

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,760
it's like a it's like a it's like a like a weapon license like what you can have

191
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,080
the black belt but before that you have to have a provisional black belt. Yeah, exactly.

192
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,840
It's like a learner's permit for being insanely gay every time you fight.

193
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,560
Is it, like if you are a black belt, is it karate that you have to like legally declare

194
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,000
yourself a weapon? You have to register your fist as a deadly weapon. That's not true.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,960
I don't think that's anything. That's nothing. I think you saw like a Steven Seagal movie

196
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,000
where he says that. Yeah. And you're like yeah, that's supposed to be one of the rules of karate.

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,480
probably one of the things that happens in karate. Probably one of the five pillars of karate.

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,360
I, I, well it's funny you can tell me it's not true I'm still gonna believe it. Okay. Yeah, I mean

199
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,400
why would it matter to declare your hands as a deadly weapon? Does it mean you have to like

200
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,720
conceal carry them or or what? Yeah keep it in your pockets. Hands always in your pockets. That's

201
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,600
why like nerdy homeschooled like karate dorks always walk around with their hands in their

202
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Exactly yeah, yeah, it's cuz they pulled them out in their giant foam or it's like

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,120
You're charged with a different crime if you kill somebody and you know karate then yeah, you definitely karate

204
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,480
Yeah, it's no longer manslaughter because it's no way

205
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:42,280
You're charged a second-degree karate slaughter yeah, the only thing cooler than manslaughter

206
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,360
It's crazy how cool

207
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,160
Manslaughter yeah, yeah, hey our job is

208
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,720
Hearing man's laughter

209
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,440
Hearing

210
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Or making guns laughter

211
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:06,360
But we do comedy man's oh yeah, yeah, I mean in that that way you would have been charged for that joke for sure

212
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,780
Cuz I guess as some funny now is the man that's some shit

213
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
- That's a big right now.

214
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,480
- Oh yeah.

215
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,300
- Yeah.

216
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,400
- That, you think you could get away with that in court?

217
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,840
Is like saying like, no,

218
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,560
that you forgot to put a space there.

219
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
- Dude, you know what?

220
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
That's, I think the next big,

221
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,280
the next big like, you know,

222
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,200
improv theater scam where we can get a lot of money

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,520
from people who want to go into the industry is,

224
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,360
you know, a comedy training style school thing

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,600
that uses karate type belts.

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
And you have different belts and you--

227
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
- That's so true.

228
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,100
- Like maybe, dude, maybe it's a roast--

229
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,940
- No, but if it was an improv thing--

230
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,480
- Maybe it's the school of roasting

231
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,680
and you go, you have like roasts.

232
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,360
- Oh shit, can you imagine how many of those belts

233
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,920
would be used to like accidentally kill themselves

234
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,560
while trying to jack off with it?

235
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,920
Like literally that would be like a fucking epidemic

236
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
in Los Angeles.

237
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,280
- If it's improv though, it would have to be like bow ties.

238
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
- Yeah, everyone's just walking around

239
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,960
with like red bands around their neck

240
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,460
where they permanently cut off circulation.

241
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,600
All these freaks who think roasting is like some high art.

242
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Yeah, yeah, that's the best dude people who are like, yeah, like roasting like that's the only real thing

243
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,320
It's gonna be like what's up fat guy. Where'd you get your pants the fat ass pants ass? Fuck you store

244
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,760
Yeah, and it's like what if there was like a whole podcast dedicated to like

245
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,920
people making fun of one person

246
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, oh could you imagine like people thinking like roasting one guy is funny

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
- That would be kind of slow.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
- I'll say roasting one guy.

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
- That would be really mean.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
- That would be so mean.

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
- Roasting one guy who plays up his stupidity a little bit is pretty funny if you do it for long enough.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But roasting a bunch of people is kind of messed up.

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But just making fun of one single guy I think is probably okay.

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
- I think it's probably really mean and unjust.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I think that if anybody knew of anything like that,

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
they should swarm the person who was roasted to make sure they're okay.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,200
they're okay and make sure that they're in a healthy friendship. They should send a lot

258
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,000
of messages and make a lot of social media posts and just make sure everything's right

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,760
between the three or however many guys are doing whatever this thing is.

260
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,440
It's funny, we can't make this joke because I wasn't on the last two episodes so now it

261
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,400
seems like we had a problem. Because my dad texted me and was like, "Why aren't you on

262
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,600
the last two episodes?" Dude, you need to set a fucking boundary with

263
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,680
your parents dude. They should not hear me right now. Yeah, no my dad said that he looks

264
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,500

265
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,640

266
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,560
into a fucking sport, have some, he's gotta have some extra wood laying around, fucking

267
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,160
build something on Saturdays. Why are you listening to your son fucking talking about

268
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,680

269
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,680
hates me dude probably listen to the episode with Tom now what are thinking

270
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,280
my dad listened to the episode with that with Tom because of the name so I kind

271
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,800
of I was trying to torture the fan I received my comeuppance for that one

272
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,600
yeah and he loved it that someone asked him what I did and there is a podcast

273
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,920
and they like found it somehow and then they called him and he was like hey I

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,600

his friends oh that was Snoopy Sarah but she's a complete Snoop Snoopy Snoopy

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
Sarah and her husband knows he did.

279
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,060
But just imagine being like, all right, all right, kids, like

280
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,080
we're going to listen to my friend's son's podcast on this

281
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
car ride.

282
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
Well, apparently you don't know him.

283
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,800
But it's like, you know, it's like his oldest friend ever.

284
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,200
And so his family's like, oh, let's listen to like, like they

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
know my dad, but I don't know.

286
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:14,920
They got it.

287
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
And they turned on the radio and they're like, you know what?

288
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,720
No, we should be supporting the Pitts family today.

289
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,920
That boy, that boy has always had something wrong with him.

290
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah, let's find out exactly what.

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
They thought it was gonna be a movie podcast.

292
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Poopy, poopy boobs.

293
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Yeah.

294
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,480
Apparently they called him and the guy was like, "Don't ever listen to that.

295
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
You will not be proud."

296
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,480
And my dad was like, "I fucking already knew that."

297
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Pretty cool.

298
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Yeah.

299
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,420
I mean, it's cool that your parents don't listen to it, but I guess my parents just know

300
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,840
everything that's ever happened to me now.

301
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,440
Yeah, I guess that's pretty tough, huh?

302
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Yeah.

303
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,040
Do you feel like some stuff is off limits?

304
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,400
can't talk about your... Is that why you're so bashful? Maybe. Is that why you're such

305
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,800
a shy bashful soul? That could be it. Because I know you're hiding in your sweater and going

306
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,080
"ohhh" We actually hang out outside of this and let me tell you Patrick's parents, your

307
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,760
son is an absolute dog. Yeah. Something, I actually never hung out with Patrick outside

308
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,440
of recording the podcast. What do you mean I'm an absolute dog? Come on Pat, you're a

309
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
You're a dog on the loose, don't lie to me.

310
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,560
You know, yeah, I guess.

311
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,640
Yeah, you can't be chained up.

312
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,560
You're a rabbit.

313
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,600
You're a dog and you like bones.

314
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,040
Yeah, you're hungry for baby rabbits.

315
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
You're a dog, you're barking, you like bones,

316
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
and you chase cars.

317
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,560
And I love to sleep on the floor.

318
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,840
You love to sleep on the floor, you're an absolute dog.

319
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,320
You sleep in a little pillow on the floor that I bought you.

320
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,280
You sleep in my room, sometimes at the foot of my bed,

321
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,360
but then my wife kicks you off

322
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
'cause you're not allowed up there.

323
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,400
Yeah, it's true.

324
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,520
And you like bones.

325
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,880
I throw coins at you to keep you under control.

326
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,920
- Why would you throw coins at a dog?

327
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,800
- It keeps the dog under control.

328
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,760
You know when you shake a can of coins

329
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,560
next to a dog or cat to scare it

330
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,320
so it doesn't do whatever it did?

331
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,160
- It's because they're so stupid

332
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,160
that they can't conceptualize money at all.

333
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,040
- I don't do that, but you've never seen people do that.

334
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,160
- I've never seen somebody throw coins at their pet.

335
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,480
- Not throw, he's saying that's the better idea.

336
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
You shake a can with coins in it.

337
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,600
- The normal thing that people do who are weird

338
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,680
is they shake a can of coins next to their pet's head.

339
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
- It's like a whistle almost.

340
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,240
- Yeah, it's like a whistle or like when you spray water

341
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
or whatever.

342
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,280
- Windex.

343
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,240
- Windex, so you spray Windex into your cat's mouth.

344
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,880
- Yeah, you can spray Windex in the cat's eye.

345
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,720
- Well, the whole thing is like--

346
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
- I've heard that, but throwing a coin is too much.

347
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
- The Windex thing makes sense 'cause it's like--

348
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,360
- What if it's only a dime?

349
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
It's a very small coin, very light too.

350
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,760
- Yeah, I guess dime will work.

351
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,600
- Okay. - Dime is fine.

352
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,720
- Well, let's, I mean, if you're okay with dime,

353
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
how about a nickel? - Let's role play

354
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,040
this situation.

355
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,240
- Nickel, no.

356
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
- Okay, penny, penny, penny.

357
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,640
- Penny's in the middle, come on.

358
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,480
- Yeah.

359
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,640
- And that's called negotiation.

360
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,720
That's kind of a business,

361
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
'cause he was not okay with any coin,

362
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,400
and then we got him up to penny.

363
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,360
- We got him up to a penny,

364
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,440
which is worth one entire cent.

365
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,320
- Yeah, so.

366
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,520
- So it's not only is it a good size of coin

367
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,360
to throw at your pet. - We don't even need

368
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,180
to print pennies anymore.

369
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,080
- But it's worth barely anything,

370
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,360
so if your pet eats it, that's fine.

371
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,640
- I thought with dogs you're supposed to

372
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,160
yank on their tail real hard.

373
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,440
(laughing)

374
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,280
When they do something wrong.

375
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,620
- I thought you're supposed to like,

376
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,400
wrap them up in chains and swing them around your head.

377
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,560
If your dog is being mean to you, you tie up the end of their tail with a rubber band until

378
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,400
the circulation cuts off.

379
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
It's like the Yakuza cutting off a pinky.

380
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:32,560
I thought you were supposed to take a big piece of plywood and drop it on them.

381
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
It's not that heavy.

382
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,920
You're supposed to drop a log on them from really high up.

383
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,600
I thought you were supposed to make them run on a log in the middle of a pond and the log

384
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,280
spins as they run and if they fall in the water they're disqualified. I'm thinking

385
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,480
again a dog I can't decide on size though. Right. You should get a you should get

386
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:56,400
like a bull terrier. You should get a small type of dog that you I think would

387
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,540
be a perfect owner of because you will kind of look like a bull terrier. I think

388
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,660
your bull is scarier. Is there a bald dog? Yeah you. A bull terrier looks like Caleb. No it

389
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
Let me look it up.

390
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Let me look up a bull terrier.

391
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,460
Is this like a cool, like, Puerto Rican dog with a mustache?

392
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,380
Oh, this is the inbred, the crazy inbred one.

393
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,100
That I could never remember the name of.

394
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
Now I will.

395
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Bull terrier?

396
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,860
I don't look like a fucking bull- I don't have tiny little eyes.

397
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
You look like a bull terrier.

398
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,860
Shut up!

399
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
No I don't, dude.

400
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,500
You think I'm saying I look like the fucking target dog?

401
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,340
You have the same kind of like, like, like head shape.

402
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
You have the same demeanor as one.

403
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
What, loyal?

404
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,340
I mean, like, you guys don't- And a little hungry?

405
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,780
You don't look that much like it except you have similar ears.

406
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,860
Yeah. My ears do not make a triangle shape.

407
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
Yeah they do.

408
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
What about these ears, are they triangular or large?

409
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,860
You better shut up.

410
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm on a website right now.

411
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Can we do like a quiz to see what type of dog Caleb should get?

412
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Yeah let's do a quiz.

413
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
What type of dog should I get?

414
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,860
Here Caleb, answer these questions.

415
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm here for them. I'm ready and I'm willing and I'm ready to help my family.

416
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Okay, quiz.

417
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,020
what dog breed matches your personality from 4paws.com.

418
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,540
What's your activity level?

419
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,440
- I hope I don't get like evil pet a dog.

420
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,280
(laughing)

421
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,700
- What's your activity level?

422
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,940
Pretty low, moderate, high, very high?

423
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,120
- Very high.

424
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,360
- Okay, pretty low.

425
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,200
- Yeah, yeah.

426
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,020
- I'm running right now.

427
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,860
- Honest to God, if you had a dog,

428
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,700
you would never want to walk the fucking thing.

429
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,620
- Lie.

430
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,460
- No, you would--

431
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,280
- What do you mean?

432
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,120
I walked today.

433
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,260
- All right, point taken.

434
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:42,180
I walk today right now. I'm fucking yabba-dabba-dooing with my feet as I sit in this far right here. We're not very high

435
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,900
I am it's are you are you are you an introvert or an extrovert or somewhere in the middle somewhere in the middle?

436
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,620
true

437
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,020
Sometimes I'm shy, but sometimes I can low-key be the the the loudest voice in the room

438
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,420
What's your absolute favorite thing to do and here are your options read a good book?

439
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,400
I know it's not that travel to new vacation spots

440
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,780
Biking running and anything athletic camping hiking and anything outdoorsy or hang with friends and family

441
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,540
watch TV

442
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
I'll put that under

443
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
Is there like a trip?

444
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,740
Is there a watching TV dog that kind of is like really comfortable to sit on like a couch?

445
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I think maybe a golden doodle

446
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,260
You think a golden doodle would be like could just withstand the weight of my ass when I sit on the couch

447
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,940
and I watch the Simpsons. I my parents have a golden doodle and

448
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,660
He watches TV with me all the time

449
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,780
Would you rather try something you never done before or do something you already know you enjoy a dog with a human vagina

450
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,780
So do something you already know you enjoy yes, sir

451
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:53,820
What's the most important you your relationship self-improvement memorable experiences staying healthier the environment

452
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,340
Okay

453
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,000
(laughing)

454
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,460
- Which describes you best, low maintenance,

455
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,360
up for anything, or family oriented?

456
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,940
- Most evil man who ever lived.

457
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,780
- Up for anything. - So low maintenance.

458
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,900
- Up for anything, yeah.

459
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,780
On a weekend, would you rather explore a new city,

460
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,960
go backpacking in the woods, have a backyard barbecue,

461
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,700
run a 5K, or work on a creative project?

462
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,740
- Run a 5K, I would love to run a 5K.

463
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,500
- There's so many questions on here.

464
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,420
Do you intend to go with the flow, take the lead,

465
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,180
come up with ingenious solutions?

466
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,900
- That one, ingenious solutions!

467
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,580
I don't even want the other one.

468
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,340
Ingenious Solutions, that is me.

469
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,980
- Go with the flow, take the leader,

470
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,660
come up with ingenious solutions.

471
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,380
- Are you chill, a leader,

472
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,420
or just the biggest genius ever?

473
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,520
- Show results.

474
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,020
Athletic Weimeriner.

475
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,260
- Oh, dude, yeah, a Weimeriner?

476
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,180
- Weimeriner.

477
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,020
- Weimeriner.

478
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,860
- Weimeriner.

479
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,680
- Weimeriner!

480
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,140
- How do you spell that?

481
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,220
- Weimariner.

482
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,380
- Oh, dude, this is a complete me of a dog, dude.

483
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,340
yeah it does look a lot like you it's great

484
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,360
i'm great up

485
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,060
this is all from the uh... melanin in my skin that i'm just great

486
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,540
is like a dog from the blue monday video

487
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,940
this is a good dog

488
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,500
there you know

489
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,340
now let's look at it i think i'll look up athletic by speed thirty five miles

490
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,260
per hour

491
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,320
now i could beat him

492
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,060
i think that's the speed limit in all of new york let's see if they're any

493
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:38,940
available for adoption in New York City? Cost. $700? No. But if you get a top quality dog,

494
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:48,100
$1,700. It says their energy level is 5, but their affection level is only 3. Their heat

495
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,660
sensitivity is 3. I need the least affectionate, most energetic dog so he can do much worse.

496
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,320
This one is not very affectionate.

497
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Friendliness is only two levels.

498
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,320
It only has a level two friendliness.

499
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,040
I didn't realize dogs had stats.

500
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Who knew either?

501
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,920
But they do on Pet Finder.

502
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
It says right here.

503
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Can I change the attributes of the dog and lose a point for one?

504
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
It's like a racing game.

505
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
You can't really change the stats.

506
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,920
It's just like a different car?

507
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,360
Do I at least get a boost or something?

508
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,200
Can I upgrade it with more experience?

509
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,680
I think you can put a nitrous tank on the back.

510
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
That's actually a really good idea.

511
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,520
have to you'll have to have a nitrous tank that's perfect all right anyway

512
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:39,780

*laughter*

526
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
Some kid just posted a bunch of pictures

527
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520

Oh no! Oh, that's so sad!

534
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Why would you do that?

535
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
*laughter*

536
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Just a bunch of pictures of him, like, holding his

537
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,900
His stomach just saying, "As you can see, I can grab generous handfuls of my stomach.

538
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,960
Do I seem any fatter, skinnier now?"

539
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,760
There's another quiz by a different person.

540
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,920
It's, "Am I getting too fat?"

541
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,920
Uh-oh.

542
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Oh my god, dude.

543
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Oh, that's like a kid.

544
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
What the fuck?

545
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
This is gonna be a...

546
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
Oh, this has to be fetish.

547
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,400
This has to be evil fetish stuff, doesn't it?

548
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,680
Oh no.

549
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,520
This is an evil website.

550
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,120
We can't take this nerd test.

551
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
No.

552
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,240
I want out of that website.

553
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,080
I just got like the most horrible feeling in my stomach.

554
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
That is a diabolical...

555
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,520
It's funny that we are always like two clicks away from the most fucked up evil thing online.

556
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,120
I don't know how it happens, dude.

557
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,060
Every once in a while I will like stumble on like an evil portal until this is the worst

558
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
website ever.

559
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,480
Remember the one about fucking monkeys?

560
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,960
Yeah, fucking monkeys.

561
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,280
That was evil.

562
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,120
There's definitely been shit that we like clicked on before you started recording.

563
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,640
We were like, "Oh no, this is not the movie."

564
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Yeah.

565
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,640
Yeah.

566
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,960
All right, anyway.

567
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Number one, best way to get revenge on Younger Sister.

568
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,040
Steal just one thing from her room per day.

569
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,760
Why not just steal a lot of things?

570
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
That's kind of genius.

571
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,200
I mean, what would you start with though?

572
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
I would just take the bed first.

573
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Just the whole bed?

574
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Yeah.

575
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
And see if she notices?

576
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
Exactly.

577
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
Because if she doesn't notice that, you've got free reign.

578
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,340
Yeah, younger sisters are so stupid and annoying that she probably wouldn't even notice when

579
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,560
she walked in.

580
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,120
She'd probably sit on her phone to go to sleep.

581
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Mm-hmm.

582
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Hi, guys.

583
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,480
She probably wouldn't even know if there was a pea under her bed.

584
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Yeah.

585
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Hi, guys.

586
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
Here's a comment.

587
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Hi, guys.

588
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,160
It's Angel Dust here, and I have a brother to try all these pranks on, two thanks.

589
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
P.S.

590
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,240
If you want to have sex, write it in the comments.

591
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Here's what I would do.

592
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,740
- A good prank would be like,

593
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,400
kind of a similar like, you know,

594
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,340
like incremental change is get like a bowl of your piss,

595
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,180
right?

596
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,500
And then just like go in once a day

597
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,620
and just flick it like holy water all over the room.

598
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,920
'Cause like the first day she probably won't notice,

599
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,080
but by day seven,

600
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,100
that's gonna be a lot of piss all over that room.

601
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,460
- True. - A lot, yeah.

602
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,300
- Just dip your fingers in it.

603
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,260
- But at that point you won't notice it

604
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,500
'cause it's been gradual.

605
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,960
- Exactly, nothing's gonna be wet.

606
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,340
There might be like little dots.

607
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,820
That's the thing, you could just like pee in your hand and just that once you're peeing

608
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,020
and then just carry it.

609
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,260
You don't have to keep your piss.

610
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
You know what I mean?

611
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,500
Well you don't keep it, I guess.

612
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,660
I mean you do, you put a little bit in a cup and then you dip your fingers in and then

613
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,860
you, why do you want to hold your piss so bad?

614
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,700
Well I'm trying to just like cut out keeping piss in the equation.

615
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,460
You don't have to like keep, you can dump it out whenever you're done, but like you seem

616
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,140
really kind of obsessed with like holding piss in your hands like a camel? No. Yeah.

617
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,860
I, no, that's not true. Well so, so you're saying you would, you would use a piss and

618
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,660
then so you just keep it in your hands for the rest of the day? No, keep it in

619
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,980
your hands until you bring it to the room. And then where would you put it? In

620
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,140
your mouth I'm guessing is what you would do? No, on the, you flick it on your

621
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:21,100
sandwiches for flavor. Did you just come up with that? That's good. That's amazing dude. Yeah, it's a punchline I just

622
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,620
thought of that's really really good use that for me i feel like it could use a

623
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,900
different setup but i feel like you could be i feel like you could be even quieter

624
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,260
when you said it too

625
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:34,780
yeah yeah um here's some comments um i tried but my brothers are twins he used

626
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,700
his other brother shoe

627
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,300
here's one i have a band name pink diamond come see us

628
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,300
this comment is really sinister

629
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:53,300
*laughter*

630
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,300
How the fuck is good as either?

631
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Pink, dude, you don't wanna go see Pink Diamond?

632
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
Pink Diamond sounds good.

633
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:07,300
They don't have, they don't have the day of the show, they don't have the anywhere to find, they don't have the bandcamp.

634
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
You want them to do fucking everything for you?

635
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
God damn Pink Diamond.

636
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:17,200
If you search pink diamond band the only thing that comes up is like wedding bands that are made that have pink diamonds

637
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,540
Right the terrible sir. You know pink diamond. I'm I've become your manager. I'm taking over

638
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,280
They clearly need somebody to take charge

639
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:34,180
Uh-huh nobody's hearing all this shit the pink diamond review from London an alternative group from London a world where 60s film

641
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,600
I decided to do three things to my younger sister.

642
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,120
Yeah, that was the one I was gonna read. Very sinister. Very creepy.

643
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,720
That, my friend, I am so going to do it. I'm feeling evil today.

644
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,960
Good opinion. Thank you a lot. I wish I was as smart as you.

645
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,860
This is a good kid. Great, but I just want to be friends with my sister.

646
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Yeah. Oh.

647
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,360
And she went insane.

648
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,080
He read the list just in case she doesn't want to be friends with him.

649
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,280
Yeah, right. She went insane. I took her favorite toy that she calls froggy and she is absolutely embarrassing. I

650
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,960
Share room with her that does complicate it a little bit. Yeah, she walks in your bed is gone

651

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,120
Well thought out. We'll give you the last laugh.

654
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
This will work miracles on my sis.

655
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,480
This list should be called "How to get in extreme dead meat with your parents."

656
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:50,680
This- here's a comment here. "This is the same as stealing. You should be ashamed."

657
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,300
Works every time. Smack him on the ass.

658
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,120
Number two.

659
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Wait, I got one- there's one more here.

660
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:11,680

664
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,400
teacher in the eighth grade we put like scotch tape over the sensor on his mouse

665
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
It doesn't count as a prank.

666
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,400
And he called the IT department and they replaced the mouse for him.

667
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
They brought like a whole new mouse.

668
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,400
One time I tried to do the thing, you know where you put shaving cream on someone's hand and tickle their face while they're asleep?

669
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
I tried to do that with my little brother and my friend.

670
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:59,400
And my friend like tickled his face with the feather and my little brother just fully asleep just put his hand on my friend's face.

671
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,640
(laughter)

672
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,600
- Just like smushed it onto his face.

673
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,740
- Yeah, I don't understand why you wouldn't just put

674
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,680
the shaving cream on the sleeping person's face.

675
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,280
- Yeah, like why do they have to pie themselves, you know?

676
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,120
- Yeah.

677
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,800
- Like just fucking, the ender,

678
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,440
why are you making all these steps?

679
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,400
Why do I have to like capture a bird

680
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,300
before I can do this prank?

681
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,180
- Right.

682
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
- Here's a comment.

683
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,760
I tried that before with my little sister

684
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,520
and she hated me from October till March 11th.

685
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,280
(laughter)

686
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,360
- This is the best thing ever.

687
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
I might even try it on her food.

688
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,580
I'm gonna prank on her sister

689
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,080
by putting lemon juice on her salmon.

690
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,480
- Yeah, I'm gonna put lemon juice on her lobster

691
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
in the butter, it's gonna be, she's gonna hate it.

692
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,920
- She's gonna be so mad.

693
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,680
I'm gonna put pepper, I'm gonna grind pepper

694
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,760
onto her salad 'til she says when.

695
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,040
She's gonna be so upset.

696
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,760
- Yeah, my sister has acid on her teeth,

697
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,480
which is really gross anyway,

698
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,200
but I tried this and her teeth were yellow and she stunk.

699
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,040
Thanks.

700
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,960
- My sister killed me.

701
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,220
(laughing)

702
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,160
- Love it.

703
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
My sister is yelling at me

704
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
'cause I'm playing my instrument.

705
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,960
- Greatest idea ever in known history.

706
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,560
Whoever posted this is greater than Albert Einstein.

707
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,660
- She will totally freak with the lemon taste.

708
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,520
- I like lemon juice.

709
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,720
I don't have any sisters, but on my cousin who is three,

710
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,560
that would be better.

711
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,280
I want to kill her so badly.

712
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,440
What comment here that says, "I don't love Ella"?

713
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,700
(laughter)

714
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,800
- Yes, just stop that.

715
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,640
- Better post it there than say it's a family dinner, right?

716
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,480
- Yeah, that's a good point.

717
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,300
- Oh yeah.

718
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,140
- Get it out of the system.

719
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,960
- Get it out of the top tens.

720
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
- Here's a comment.

721
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,340
How do you do the prank?

722
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,600
- Tried it.

723
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,200
Let's just say she broke my Xbox.

724
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,840
- Yeah, let's just say she did a little thing.

725
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,680
- She broke my Xbox.

726
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,720
He broke my Xbox.

727
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,000
This sounds hilarious, but probably not a good idea to be honest.

728
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I like this one.

729
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,040
I put lemon juice on her toothbrush and hot sauce in her refreshments.

730
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,640
Her refreshments!

731
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:14,000
Yeah, yeah, she was drinking her bloody berries.

732
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Ah, he gadzooks my refreshments!

733
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,880
What a clever, great, pleasant prank.

734
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I am putting salt on her tooth-proof.

735
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Tooth-proof?

736
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
Tooth-proof?

737
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
T-B-R-U-T-H.

738
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Uh oh.

739
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:34,520
Um, number three, jump out of a closet.

740
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,880
Yeah, that's pretty good.

741
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Yeah.

742
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
It's also, you know.

743
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Nothing wrong with this.

744
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
Pretty impressive.

745
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Yeah.

746
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,280
Jump out of a closet.

747
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,760
Yeah, your, the biggest prank on your sister is coming out.

748
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
Jumping out.

750
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Yeah.

751
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I'm gay, ah!

752
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,000
(laughter)

753
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
- That's jumping out of the closet.

754
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,840
- Here's one.

755
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,280
- Hey mom, dad, I've been wanting to talk to you about something.

756
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,120
I'm gay!

757
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,460
(screaming)

758
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,760
- Here's a comment.

759
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,280
Haven't heard of this prank before,

760
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,720
but I'll give it a whirl.

761
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,060
- I did this to my sister.

762
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,560
She got so scared she ran into the wall.

763
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,000
- I am an only child, but it sounds good to me.

764
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,400
- Just doing it on yourself.

765
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
I'm an only child too, and I was adopted from China.

766
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,760
Maybe I'll do it to one of my annoying friends.

767
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,720
This one here, so it says, you know,

768
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,160
title, jump out of the closet,

769
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,720
and then Epic Jake comments and says,

770
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,220
and then scare her.

771
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,640
- I like this one a lot.

772
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,040
Don't, because I'm stuck for sure now.

773
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,280
(laughing)

774
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,680
- I'm stuck for sure.

775
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
- Just like the movie Buried,

776
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,440
just like stuck in the closet.

777
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,880
Has he tried this prank?

778
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Yes, I love scaring!

779
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,880
This will work, thanks the top tens.

780
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I love scaring.

781
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,400
Oh my god, I did the same thing when I was in India.

782
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,640
Also, my sister was 11, I was 15, now I'm 16, she's 12.

783
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,960
I climbed into my uncle's closet and then jumped out literally screaming, "It's me, Green

784
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Lantern!"

785
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,320
She literally fainted.

786
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm scared of Green Lantern too.

787
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Yeah.

788
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Number four, tell their secrets.

789
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,500
Here's the top comment. What a horrifying thing to do. Even if your younger sibling is annoying, they are still family.

790
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Now your sibling will never trust you.

791
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:32,240
I mean, it's hard for youngsters to confide their secrets in others. You shouldn't be tossing them around like they're nothing.

792
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
Yeah, I found the little sister

793
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
commenter on this list.

794
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Oh my fucking God!

795
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,780
Yeah, I don't I don't uh why are boys so obsessed with secrets? What kind of secret can a girl even have?

796
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,460
Pregnancy

797
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:58,080
Wow, you think so? I don't know. This person says get over it softy. So my older sister told me that I

798
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,240
Had missing walk because I said she couldn't play GTA 5 on me Xbox

799
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,360
So she said okay, then I'm telling mom that you have missing work. Oh

800
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,160
changed that you wouldn't play on it either so her secret is she's acting

801
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,280
like a boy towards girls

802
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:23,760
Caleb this is this commenter agrees with you here what secrets girls being fat

803
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,060
isn't a secret dirt it's true it funny when you do it to them but when it done

804
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,640
to me I freak more than I told embarrassing secrets because they would

805
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,640
give me an oreo if i did

806
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,800
uh...

807
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,200
uh...

808
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,420
yet

809
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,360
easiest ways by music fans

810
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,120

815

Number five, pretend that you're putting a curse on her and do bad stuff to her after.

818
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:14,800
Yeah, so this is good, well this is good because you can combine it with any other item on the list.

819
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,300
Yeah.

820
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,640
You first, you say, "I'm putting a curse on you," and then you put lemon juice on her toothbrush.

821
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,940
You know, this is kind of like...

822
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,940
Oh, and then you're cursed to have bad teeth.

823
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,440
Yeah, exactly. So this is kind of like a, this is...

824
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,500

849
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,460
I didn't know that. Now that I know it, I'm pissed.

850
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,900
Me too.

851
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:33,300
I did this once and I even rubbed it in some poop. So it was really gross. I did this to my brother though, not sister.

852
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,500
Oh, okay. Well don't say it then. Yeah, if it's not to your sister, don't say it. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree.

853
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,780
I'd do this, but she'd get sick and she would be at home while you're at school. That's the only thing. Epic Jake.

854
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,660
I did and now her stomach hurts. I am scared that something really bad will happen.

855
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,920
(laughing)

856
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,860
- Just kidding.

857
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,500
- Dude, you know that kid is like freaking the fuck out.

858
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,540
- Yeah. - Oh yeah.

859
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,040
- Like to type that out and post that on this website,

860
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,900
I'm scared that something really bad will happen.

861
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,680
- Yeah, he made his sister eat shit and she just dies.

862
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,440
- Yeah. (laughing)

863
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,820
- Remember to leave it in there when you're done.

864
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,180
That's a bad idea, just like,

865
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,420
I'm not gonna use my toothbrush,

866
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,460
I'm not gonna be like, oh fuck, where's my toothbrush?

867
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,300
Oh, it's just in the toilet.

868
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,940
I have this black sharpie and my sister has her own.

869
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,340
She had hers from years ago

870
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,780
and I just bought mine a month ago.

871
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,620
She wanted mine because she lost hers.

872
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,860
I'm like, you have your own.

873
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Then I get mine and see another black sharpie.

874
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,680
I draw lines and see which is better.

875
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,000
She snatched mine.

876
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,140
I shouted, give it back.

877
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,820
Then my parents got involved and I got mine back

878
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,740
and she was winking like a baby.

879
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,380
And then my mom just took mine.

880
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,540
Then she gave it to my sister.

881
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,220
So now it's revenge.

882
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,180
- Oh my God.

883
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,340
- Cruel for idiots.

884
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,900
they could die from a toilet disease

885
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,040
i like that like

886
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,100
like i think at least half of these people just think that what this prank

887
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,220
will do is give them bad breath

888
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,420
like right now is it that you're making the people who puts that other breath

889
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:06,380
discusses no bad you have stinky green lines coming out of your mouth yeah

890
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,940
uh...

891
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,140
number seven

892
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,860
poor cold water on her while she is in the shower

893
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:20,140
I've done this. I remember, yeah, I did this to my older brother once and he ran out of

894
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:26,700
the, he like ran completely naked, like chased me through the house to beat me up. He was

895
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,580
so mad. It was awesome.

896
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,700
When you like flushed the toilet to make it run cold for a minute?

897
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,140
No, we had like ice water.

898
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,140
That never happened.

899
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
And dumped it over the thing.

900
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
That happened at my house.

901
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
Yeah, the toilet thing never worked at my house.

902
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
That never happened at my house.

903
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
That worked at my house.

904
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,260
It was just too rich. Just like my water was like mad hot all the time and shit.

905
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,540
I have boiling hot toilet water.

906
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,260
- The reason that that happens is because

907
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,260
when you flush the toilet,

908
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,100
all that water goes into the shower.

909
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
- Yeah.

910
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,220
- So, and that water's cold.

911
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,060
- That's a good point.

912
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,880
- 'Cause it's been sitting in the toilet all day.

913
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,720
- I do wish that's how it works,

914
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,120
'cause that'd be a great prank.

915
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,680
It goes like Play-Doh, spaghetti your shits

916
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,900
out of the toilet, or the shower head.

917
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,980
That'd be awesome.

918
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,500
- Yeah, pee too.

919
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,340
- Here's a comment.

920
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,580
- Yeah, and even some pee in there too.

921
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,940
Some toilet paper, some nasty,

922
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,500
and maybe if you put a Q-tip in there.

923
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,780
- Here's a comment.

924
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,080
and watch the makeup slide off

925
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,800
or maybe turn off the heater in winter and see if she likes a chill surprise

926
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,280
uh...

927
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,280
this is this idea was awesome my little sister got sick and puked everywhere

928
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,560
from cold water

929
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,000
sounds like a baby

930
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,280
it's still puking

931
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,440
there's already water

932
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,440
You're already getting hit with water and then...

933
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,440
She's probably... it was probably the... like chewing is like shock.

934
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Shocked her system, yeah.

935
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Just instantly vomited everywhere.

936
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I guess that's the best place to puke is in the shower.

937
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
Yeah.

938
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
What if you see her naked?

939
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
That's a very strong point.

940
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah, that is a good point, yeah.

941
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,440
Number eight. Find a balloon and put it in her pillow so when she lays he head back it will pop.

942
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,840
You don't think that they would notice a giant party balloon?

943
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Just like one of those ones that's like shaped like Spider-Man, like the ones that are like

944
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,640
like the big like Spider-Man balloons.

945
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
Yeah, the Mylar balloons.

946
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,840
It looks like a giant one.

947
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,440
The ones that like you can't even pop by like, laying there.

948
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Yeah.

949
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,240
I did this and she screamed, ran to mom and said, "My head cracked open.

950
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,140
It was so funny."

951
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,140
She sounds stupid.

952
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,440
Can kids under 18 do this?

953
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,940
(laughing)

954
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,780
- No. - No.

955
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,040
- Yeah.

956
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,440
My mom would kill me, she doesn't like her carpet wet,

957
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,440
but I will put bags in it to rumble around.

958
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,900
- I'm doing 'cause sis took money.

959
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,160
- She started to scream and cry a lot,

960
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,000
then she ran up to my mom, oh yeah.

961
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,480
Might crack my head open, yeah.

962
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,320
- Yeah.

963
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,580
Yeah.

964
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,420
- Nice job, but no. - I shouldn't have

965
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,260
proofread it.

966
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,600
Alright, and then number nine, this is a, this takes a serious, cruel drop off here.

967
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,800
Did we read this one?

968
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
What?

969
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,360
"LOL sometimes I hate boys, they can be so stupid.

970
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
P.S.

971
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,800
Spray her least favorite bathroom spray on her chair."

972
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,440
That's a very polite brother.

973
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,480
What is a bathroom spray?

974
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Like, like, Glade.

975
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Yeah, yeah, her least favorite.

976
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
This is a very polite-

977
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Oh, I hate cinnamon!

978
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
I hate the smell of cinnamon!

979
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I hate the smell of cinnamon!

980
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,480
You know I don't want my chair to smell like that.

981
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,480
You know I don't want my chair to smell like that.

982
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Yeah, bake her her least favorite pastry.

983
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah.

984
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,480
Give her her least favorite money.

985
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,480
Yeah. Number nine.

986
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Number nine.

987
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
Post their nude pictures on the web.

988
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Yeah, I don't know about this one.

989
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Listen, to all the brothers out there,

990
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,480
this might seem funny,

991
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
but you're gonna go to jail.

992
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,480
Yeah, you're gonna go to kid jail.

993
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:02,320
go to jail you know it's that one and then number 10 lock them out of the

994
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:08,620
house like a very serious crime and it's like you don't get to come in and have

995
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:18,440

996
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,400
this to my little blackmail sister what I think this meant blackmail like

997
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,760
my little sister, I said my little black male sister.

998
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,960
(laughing)

999
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,760
- I was confused for a second.

1000
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,200
- Doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

1001
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,040
- No.

1002
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,240
- My older sister drew on my face

1003
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,420
and I'm trying to get revenge.

1004
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,680
I would lock her out of the house,

1005
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,120
but she has anger issues.

1006
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,960
That's smart.

1007
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,640
You don't want your anger issue sister to attack you.

1008
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,480
- I did that to my sis and she was very mad

1009
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,240
and I was like, "Mom, no me pegas,

1010
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,740
"'cause I don't know Spanish."

1011
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,260
I once fell asleep doing this and suddenly they got in from the window.

1012
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,660
Did you guys ever get locked out of the house growing up?

1013
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Yeah.

1014
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,080
Dude, I got so good at just like, I had a wallet for so long that just had like my dad's old

1015
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,520
triple A card in it when I was like 12 just so I could whenever my older brother would

1016
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,640
lock me out I could just expertly just safe crack my way into the door.

1017
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,240
Dude, I was so good at it.

1018
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,440
I didn't get locked out like as a prank, I just got locked out by accident.

1019
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
I didn't know.

1020
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,280
- I didn't get locked out as a prank.

1021
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,800
- Yeah, I didn't have any brothers, so.

1022
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,600
- Dude, brothers are, brothers will--

1023
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,520
- Brothers are the ones who will lock you out.

1024
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,840
- They teach you a lot.

1025
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,760
- I've definitely locked out my sibling

1026
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,360
out of rooms and doors before.

1027
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,520
That's very fun to do.

1028
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,360
That's one of the ultimate brother activities.

1029
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,200
- It is very fun.

1030
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,720
It's one of the easiest, it's basically a button

1031
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,280
that is an instant prank.

1032
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,120
- Yeah.

1033
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,440
- It's fucking genius the way they have

1034
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,200
these doors locked these days.

1035
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,800
- It's great to do to a wife or girlfriend, too.

1036
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,640
- Absolutely.

1037
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:56,480
had Jana locked out a couple weeks ago on a 104 degree day outside. She's in our

1038
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,920
she's in our hallway banging on the door for about 40 minutes. It's very funny.

1039
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,220
And I was playing video games with sound cancelling headphones on. I go out there,

1040
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,520
she's crying her ass off talking about how she has has to carry all these

1041
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,440
groceries and then I get to play it off as a prank. Right. It's pretty good.

1042
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,280
Now that it was a prank so like you can't even get mad about it. And then the tears turned to

1043
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,120
laughter almost immediately. Yeah. Yeah. It's also it's funny as hell to do to

1044
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,080
your older family members like a grandfather or grandmother who are 80

1045
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,560
years old or older. Here's a really funny prank that you can pull on a grandmother.

1046
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,420
So instead of locking her out, that's a little cruel, basically cover your entire

1047
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,720
bathroom in olive oil and then lock her in, right? And then say, "Grandma, I think I

1048
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:47,040
saw a mouse in there." See that wouldn't work because she would never go if there's a

1049
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,160
grandmother will never go in a room that has a mouse in it. No, you have the door

1050
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,060
locked. She says, "Let me out!" You say, "Okay, Grandma, I'm trying to find the key to the

1051
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:00,320
bathroom, but I want you to know I did see a mouse or a spider in there." Yeah.

1052
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,000
Yeah. And also, Grandma, I would love for you to try on those new rollerblades I

1053
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,400
got you. Yeah, and Grandma, I'm really hungry. Yeah, I'm so hungry I might push you over.

1054
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,520
I need you to come make me food right now. You need to try and get out of that

1055
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,400
room. Yeah, you can come make me delicious food. If you want to give her a treat, set up a slip

1056
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,000
and slide between her room and the kitchen and say, "Grandma, you know what time it's lunchtime,

1057
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I would like my sandwich." A really good classic grandma prank is a pitfall. Yeah. Works every

1058
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,560
single time. You put foliage and jungle vegetation in the middle of her linoleum kitchen floor. She

1059
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,440
says, "I don't remember these stairs up to the top of this, all these leaves being here."

1060
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:49,160
I say, "Grandma, I really need the jelly toast that you make so well. You make it like nobody else. I need jelly on toast right now."

1061
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
*laughter*

1062
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,660
Yeah.

1063
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,660
And then you put friendly spikes in the bottom.

1064
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,160
Right.

1065
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
Yeah. Mario spikes.

1066
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,160
Yeah. Make her bounce up and hold her bottom.

1067
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Warning! Do not do this prank if your grandma has one or less lives left.

1068
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,160
*laughter*

1069
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,660
She will not respawn.

1070
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,160
Yeah, if there's like-

1071
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
She will go back to the beginning of the world.

1072
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,000
If there's only one little picture of your grandma's face in the bottom left corner of the screen do not do this prank

1073
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,120
It's a bad idea

1074
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,960
Number 11 hide just one of their best shoes

1075
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,000
That's such a great idea because Christmas is coming up, and they will want to wear good shoes

1076
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:34,420
Facts we've been saying this where it's missus coming up in a hundred days when you feel stupid as fuck though

1077
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,900
if like your sis like grabbed her one single sketcher,

1078
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,460
went to school and like low-key started the next big thing.

1079
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,420
- Mismatched shoes.

1080
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,580
- One shoe.

1081
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,900
- One shoe, mismatched shoes.

1082
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,520
- It's 137 days till Christmas.

1083
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,860
- So that's amazing you knew that off the top of your head.

1084
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,300
- Yeah, that was really impressive.

1085
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,140
- Did you just count that?

1086
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,300
- Yep, I did one, two, skip a few,

1087
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,700
and I got all the way there.

1088
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,580
- There's a comment, this is where ferrets come in.

1089
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,860
What does that mean?

1090
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,100
I don't know. Oh, you put a ferret in their shoe.

1091
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,660
That's a- Of course. I don't think a kid can get a ferret.

1092
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,940
A kid can get a ferret.

1093
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,340
I don't think a kid should be able to get a ferret.

1094
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,820
My friend in high school had a ferret and it killed itself.

1095
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:15,960
What?

1096
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:22,980
It jumped out of his hand, uh, and backwards and- and hit its head on the bathroom sink.

1097
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,580
Sounds like your friend killed his ferret.

1098
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,860
I don't think so.

1099
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,780
Yeah. I believe what he told me.

1100
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,580
Yep, the Elliot Smith himself, the ferret did.

1101
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,340
Yeah, the ferret drove a steak knife through its own heart.

1102
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,340
It's pretty amazing. If you guys knew this ferret,

1103
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,620
you know the ferret, he was making some comments, and I was like, he was leaving

1104
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,820
some... Were there hesitation wounds? He was giving away

1105
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,340
some of his most prized possessions to people close to him. Oh really?

1106
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,380
He was saying stuff like, "This is the last time I'm ever going to see you

1107
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:58,260
again." And they'd say, "Why?" And he said, "I'm going on vacation."

1108
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,420
Ferret sounds not very discreet, if you ask me.

1109
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:08,020
bit on the nose she was a drama queen

1110
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:13,020
yeah obviously he killed himself

1111
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,100
uh...

1112
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,380
let's skip around here

1113
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,820
we got number nineteen shaving cream and feather while sleeping trick

1114
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,220
we discussed that already

1115
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,340
that's a number

1116
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,980
number twenty one be happy when she's in trouble

1117
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,580
pretty good

1118
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,860
that's a good prank, just smile big whenever she gets in trouble

1119
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,300
Delete games on our iPod/iPhone.

1120
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,160
That's pretty fucked.

1121
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,100
Yeah, that's not, if you, I mean,

1122
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,620
it's most games that's okay, but Flappy Bird,

1123
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,980
if you delete Flappy Bird, you cannot get it back.

1124
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,620
I actually heard that on the news, on CNN.

1125
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,980
Number 36, put diarrhea medicine in her food.

1126
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,460
(laughing)

1127
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,180
And I don't know if that means like,

1128
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,940
like anti, like imodium, or like,

1129
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,660
or if that means like laxatives.

1130
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,340
Yeah, pro-diarrhea or anti-diarrhea?

1131
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:07,300
Yeah, like are you trying to... I gotta say if you're putting like anti-diarrhea medicine in her food,

1132
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,740
yeah, that's just a good brother. But if you're putting like laxatives in her food,

1133
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,420
that I mean that's a prank. Number 30 is put a hot sauce in her drink and a comment says

1134
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,420
"what were you thinking my mom caught me?"

1135
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:26,340
You idiot! Had you not considered that my mom may catch me!

1136
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,120
Number 31, put salt in her soap.

1137
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,920
He he he he he, the salt will dry her skin out and she will scratch herself.

1138
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,320
It will be so funny for her to scratch like an animal in front of her crush.

1139
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
So funny.

1140
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
We share soap, my whole family.

1141
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,320
[Laughter]

1142
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
One bar of soap for everything.

1143
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,320
And throw it in the dishwasher.

1144
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,820
Number uh, 53, tell her Santa is not real.

1145
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,320
Oh my god.

1146
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,680
There's a prank, there's a prank, and then there is being cruel.

1147
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
This is cruel, so just stop.

1148
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,280
This is so mean and would crush her dreams.

1149
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,880
I wouldn't be able to do this.

1150
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,320
She's so stupid, she would prove to me he is real by showing me the elf on the shelf we got in 2014.

1151
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,960
I told an eight-year-old illegal immigrant who lives in her house,

1152
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,640
who was six at the time, that Santa isn't real.

1153
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,720
And she said that she actually knows that.

1154
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,880
That's a comment from IHatesSchool.

1155
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,320
And there's a comment from Popsicles in response to that that says,

1156
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,200
"I'm not gonna ask why there's an illegal immigrant living in your house."

1157
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,920
This one, I like how straightforward this one is. Number 55, "Eat on her bed."

1158
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,440
Number 40 is, "Tell your dad that you heard her say she was a lesbian."

1159
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,000
And then someone comments, "I did this and my family is Christian. Works perfectly."

1160
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,160
Number 75, "Fart in her mouth while she is asleep."

1161
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,400
Have you guys ever had someone do that to you?

1162
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,400
What, fart in my mouth?

1163
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,960
I think that's the most mad I've ever been is one of my cousins farted in my mouth while

1164
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,920
I was asleep and I woke up right as the fart entered my brain and I just was, I mean I

1165
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,680
was furious dude.

1166
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,360
That is like, that is the ultimate disrespect I think.

1167
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
Kick her butt.

1168
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,720
Just beat the shit out of her.

1169
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,440
Message her random stuff.

1170
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,120
Um, that would get her pretty good.

1171
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,680
Slap her, hit them with a broom.

1172
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,360
Pick the lock while she's in the bathroom.

1173
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,360
Yeah watch her poop.

1174
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,600
That would be funny as fuck.

1175
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,960
Tell her how much you love her when at school or in public around friends.

1176
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,120
Put bug spray on her food.

1177
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,680
Number 91, hit them with a broom.

1178
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,480
Rip their homework in half.

1179
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,160
Get a scary toy or a toy that she is already scared of and show it to her.

1180
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,640
Follow them around everywhere and stare at them non-stop.

1181
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,440

Yeah, demons, but you know, tell them that there's terrorists.

Scare her with her worst fears.

1214
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,200
Force her to annoy your pet cat.

1215
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,200
If she did that, then the cat will claw her face.

1224
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,760
You're gonna have to get under your desk, there is an emergency. But just you, you're

1225
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,680
the only one who's in danger right now. I have bad news, there's an emergency.

1226
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,420
They just had an emergency in our house, so you're going to have to hide.

1227
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,720
How would you guys prank your sisters? If you had sisters, if you had a younger sister,

1228
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,060
How would you prank them?

1229
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,400
- I would probably do number 265.

1230
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,920
- I think poop under her bed is like insanely strong.

1231
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,760
- That's a really good prank.

1232
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,160
- That's just like-- - 265, throw away her makeup.

1233
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,920
- That's mean though, that's like,

1234
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,120
poop under her bed I think might be the least damaging,

1235
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,760
the perfect balance of like,

1236
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,260
like it's gonna piss her off,

1237
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:57,000
but she's not losing anything.

1238
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,840
- Right.

1239
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,040
- I mean I guess poop, a fart in her mouth is funny too.

1240
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
- Well, then you gotta clean up poop.

1241
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,880
- You don't have to clean it up.

1242
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,160
No, she and then when your parents are like when she goes to your parents you

1243
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,880
just say yeah she keeps poop on her bed. She's trying to frame me for poop on her bed.

1244
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,600
You say what you think my poop looks like that? No way.

1245
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,000
Look at that it spells her name. You really think I could spell?

1246
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It says C-A and that's crossed out and that says her name.

1247
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,760
Yeah. So what I have a lot of poop and it's real thin.

1248
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,800
Who cares? It's almost like I put it in the in the the uh

1249
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,440
the cake icer that we have in the kitchen and then sprayed it but nope came right out of my ass.

1250
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,160
By the way I can't find the cake icer. Yeah, no idea where it is but it's definitely not in the

1251
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,080
trash can so there'd be no reason to look in there. It's definitely not still in the drawer

1252
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,720
because somebody couldn't find a place to hide it so don't try to use it if it is. And if there

1253
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,160
is something if you do find it it has normal icing in it and not poop it's just brown icing.

1254
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,400
By the way I'm allergic to cake I can't ever eat cake made in this house again.

1255
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:04,220
And you guys are also allergic to cake except for my sister who actually loves cake with brown icing on it

1256
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:10,240
And she her birthday's tomorrow and you guys forgot it. Yeah, that's it says all of that written in poop

1257
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:19,260
Dipping your your your quill and to poop like it like it well, yeah

1258
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,240
And there shall be a cake with the brown icing. Yeah

1259
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:30,800
They find they they like find it in like like the dumb waiter that never gets open in the house some

01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,400
