1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
As the end of the week approached, we needed to act fast and get this heist going.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
The plan, I thought, was pretty good.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,560
The building sits in downtown Gunn City, the I-Cup headquarters.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,640
It is one of those older models that has four ground floor entrances with sliding doors.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,140
It's a charity building, so there's no immediate security protocol.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,520
That was disabled in a cost-cutting measure back when ICUP was under Papi Chuko's Technoslime.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,060
However, once inside the building, there were certain security and authentication measures

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,820
that anyone would need to get past private security hired for the affair.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,220
Since the guys told me girls and frogs don't count, our crew was five people.

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,580
That means I needed to get six more.

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,980
I looked high and low and pretty much everywhere else as quick as I could, and lucky me, I found

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,380
the best heist guys around.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,580
This is Sullivan's Eleven.

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,880
Matrix Biedermann, E-Bomb's greatest hacker.

15
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,660
He can turn any security system into an insecurity system, because it's full of holes.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,720
So also into Swiss cheese, that's another way you could say it.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,580
That's right, I'm the most devious hacker in the world.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,160
I was bricking systems since I was in diapers at age 8.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,860
This seems like a tough job, but my skill set will be more than enough to hack into the

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
mainframe and delete the force field program.

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,860
Space Belden. He's an alien who can read minds and control us puny E-Bomb rings.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,860
I'm glad he's on our side.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,860
I am not from here. I am an alien. I understand things you can't comprehend.

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:50,860
JFK was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald. Frogman, I detect you are thinking about pussies.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,860
I will use these powers to read the minds of the guards and find out when they need to go to the bathroom.

26
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,540
Maximum Watson. This guy is basically a living EMP bomb.

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,660
He radiates electromagnetic pulses like a...

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,540
I guess an EMP bomb is the only thing that does that.

29
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,340
The name's Maximum Watson and I'm the only electronic being on this

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,340
godforsaken planet that can deactivate the godforsaken robot security system in

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,700
this godforsaken building.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,380
Stand back and let me work or I'll zap ya!

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,860
The Class Clown. A man of mystery. Nobody knows his real name or even his

34
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,220
roll in the heist but we all know one thing his his funny ass sends people's

35
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,780
sides into orbit. Alright so here's what we're gonna do I go slap a couple

36
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,380
kick-me signs on the guards after they start kicking each other I get inside

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,540
the control room there I will disarm them with my boyish humor and coerce them

38
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,380
into a game of oogie-cookie pants around the ankles racing to blast on a

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,300
mrs. Fields cookie I keep in my cargo pocket you know guy stuff that's when

40
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,620
you all strike when no one's looking at the camera.

41
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,060
And please, make sure you hurry up.

42
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,820
I'll buy you as much time as I can,

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,140
but I really don't want to eat that cookie at the end.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,700
- The Home Planet Twins, master acrobats.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
You might think the count is two people,

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,340
but twins, scientifically, each only count as half a person.

47
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,020
- We are the Home Planet Twins.

48
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,500
We come from a planet called Home Planet.

49
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,700
We will cartwheel and somersault our way into the vault

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,540
to help steal the money.

51
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,460
That's our job in the heist.

52
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,860
We like candy. We love to eat candy.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,460
And our extra special member of the crew, Drake.

54
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,460
Yeah baby it's Drake. Oh I'm so cool. Listen to my song. Hotline Bling, Spotted Eye.

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,460
Along with the rest of Sullivan's Eleven, we were all in position. The heist was finally ready to begin.

56
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,460
Oh no! What's happening?

57
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,060
There's a laser, it looks like, right near the entrance of the building and oh no!

58
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,900
Everybody's walking into it one by one!

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,060
All the people who are new to the team are all walking right into the laser!

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,660
Oh no, Matrixpeederman, look out!

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,740
Try using bullet time!

62
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,460
This laser is hacking into my body and fishing out my guts!

63
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
AHH!

64
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,820
SpaceBeldon, what are you doing?

65
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,540
Using my extraterrestrial intelligence, I detect that I am dying, Frogman.

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,940
And that Steven Paddock acted alone.

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
Ooooooh!

68
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,580
Maximum Watson, stop!

69
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
You're gonna overload!

70
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Into the laser!

71
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,060
Not the class clown!

72
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,580
There ain't nothing funny about that!

73
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
Oh!

74
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,300
It's curtains for the class clown!

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,340
Gettin' sent up to the big principal's office in the sky!

76
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,620
twins oh no two for the price of one oh no a laser

77
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,060
and our extra special member of the crew drake

78
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,180
oh no i'm dying i'm dying no no no

79
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,100
oh i i just remembered i was supposed to

80
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,620
i'm supposed to turn off that razor for the uh

81
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,620
for the heist.

82
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,120
Well, well, well, anyway, uh, uh, we got this. It doesn't matter.

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,120
This is where Ray comes in.

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,620
The private security is, uh, is, uh, automation. It's robotic.

85
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,620
So he would be able to hack in and make sure that any accosting from the security force passes by us.

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,120
However, we need to be able to get him into the first floor control room to make that happen.

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,200
Barry Gee, lucky for us, knows a guy on the inside who owes him a favor, after inspiring

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,200
him to be an entrepreneur. Barry will meet this guy, Goofus Gallant, describe Ray's profile,

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,120
and have Ray carted into the security room. Meanwhile, Blotoss will be scoping out for

90
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,240
each of these three identities, Doug Jerk, Stephen A. Smith, and Stinky Eric. These are

91
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,040
The three people who frequented the building have crypto credentials.

92
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,180
Once he recognizes one of them, he will know that he is the one who is trying to make the

93
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,560
transfer for the crypto money so that it can be reinvested.

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,840
You have to dispatch of them and assume their role.

95
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Then follow Fatima into the security area where the vault is.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,160
The dispatching of one of these guys is where Travis comes in.

97
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,440
Travis will lead the target away from Fatima, handle it discreetly, and then contact Barry

98
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,480
Gee to signal that they both make their way toward the vault too.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,280
Travis will trail Blowtoss and Fatima through the vents and follow the blueprint while Barry

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,920
Gee takes a route through the plumbing in the girls bathroom.

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,440
That way when they get to the security section underground, should anything go awry, Travis

102
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,520
can jump down with his dual pistols and dispatch the security system and Barry Gee can use

103
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,720
the love slime bomb to destroy the vault door. Patrick Yoda meanwhile... well actually I wasn't

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,960
sure if he'd still have brain damage by the time we needed to do the heist so I was just

105
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,440
gonna sort of have him work the floor and if he saw something suspicious kind of yell ice

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,040
cream into the walkie talkie but uh so right now he'll just be working the floor looking

107
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
for any sort of variables that could happen.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Mommy Goodlegs will be running interference with Fatima if need be.

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,040
She bugged her during their conversation, so hopefully we can get some information from there.

110
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Finally, once we are able to download the money, we have to leave.

111
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,040
If nothing goes wrong, Bluetoss will send a signal and everyone will leave their stations.

112
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
And we'll head on out of there.

113
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
If something does go badly...

114
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Oh, fuck.

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
I guess we'll have to figure it out.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:53,880
and me as always I'm the getaway driver and I was told that if I leave without

117
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,440
them I would have to wear a dress and I don't really want to do that very much so

118
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm just gonna stay put until the job is done they said otherwise I'll probably

119
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,720
die so I'll just hang out here so this is it this is the heist you guys have

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:22,600
the

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
the

122
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
the

123
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
the

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
the

125
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
the

126
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
the

127
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
the

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
the

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
the

130
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
the

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
the

132
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
the

133
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
the

134
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,600
the

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:59,880
I mean, is that?

136
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,840
Hey Patrick, Yoda, are you okay?

137
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
I'm fine.

138
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
Okay.

139
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
All right.

140
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I'm fine, Bar.

141
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Oh, no.

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Okay.

143
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay.

144
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
So, all right.

145
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Wow.

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
That's a little better too.

147
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Okay.

148
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm making a new one.

149
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I'm making a new one.

150
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm making a new one.

151
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm making a new one.

152
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm making a new one.

153
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,080
I'm making a note to become like a brain scientist later in my life and try and figure out, try

154
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,680
and study what the difference between the two places I hit him was that caused the ice

155
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
cream bar and I'm fine bar.

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:42,440
Can we just try to see, okay, Patrick, what's your favorite color?

157
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,760
I guess green, like my skin.

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,480
Okay, all right.

159
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
All right, good.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All right.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,840
I think we should probably just make our way in there now

162
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:00,360
I just are running as fast as I can I'm really okay

163
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,680
See him running and I yeah, I'm gonna be the first one in there I'm just way too fast for you

164
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm trying swinging my arms in front of me trying to like trying to happen. It's not working

165
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay speed skill

166
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,460
I mean, it's just your movement. I teleport ahead of your move speed. Yeah, I mean you do have teleportation. Yes, I

167
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:29,920
Mean, are you guys actually are you guys racing? You guys racing to get in there? Yeah

168
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,480
All right, cool. So you guys are racing to get in there Travis and and

169
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,880
Patrick and Barry Gee are you guys just walking in there normally or you guys also racing? I'm moseying you're moseying

170
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,360
Okay, we got a mosey. Yeah, I'm walking walking normal style. I'm walking chill. I'm chilling out

171
00:10:47,360 --> 00:11:03,240
the

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm in a suit too.

173
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I mean that's up to you.

175
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
You can be the suit.

176
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
You're still like drooling all over the place.

177
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
It's like...

178
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
You have two lines of snot that are just going directly into your mouth.

179
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I have snot but I'm aware of it.

180
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm aware of it.

181
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
So I'm like snorting it, trying to snort the snot back up.

182
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Yeah, that's all in slow motion.

183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm trying to look like a cool

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
grind set guy.

185
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Also there's stuff coming out of your ears too.

186
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
ripping out of your ears.

187
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Yeah, mm-hmm.

188
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,120
So yeah, you guys go inside, and it is sort of as Sullivan described, based on the blueprints.

189
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,920
It has a fountain in the middle that is with this-- right now it has Papi Chuco on it.

190
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,600
There are plans to reassemble it eventually, you know, now that it's no longer under Papi

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,920
Chuco's Techno Slime Corporation.

192
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,960
But yeah, it's a fountain just shooting out little squirts of water that used to be Techno

193
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:29,720
the

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,520
Yeah. What? I hope that's just his last name and not his full name.

195
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,160
Oh, me too. But his full name is Gallant Goofus. So you can sort of look through the directory,

196
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
you can maybe you have his number. I don't know. How did you get in touch with Gallant Goofus?

197
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,360
I contacted them through the most exclusive way I contact everyone I know,

198
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,600
through my public DMs of my social media accounts.

199
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,240
Okay, cool. So does he know, is he going to meet you down there then? Is that the plan?

200
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,800
Or are you trying to be secret about it? What's your plan of meeting with him then?

201
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,880
Yeah, he can just meet us down there. I'm sure if they bring the whole crew,

202
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,800
they'll be chill and we'll do a deal that won't go down badly.

203
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah, for sure. Bloat toss. Meanwhile, your job right now is to try to scope out and figure out

204
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,360
which of the people with the crypto credentials is going to be working with Fatima. Fatima's

205
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:34,280
office is on the fourth floor. She would presumably come down to the first floor to meet with whoever

206
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,240
that crypto person is. Obviously, if you want to try to make it up to the fourth floor and intercept

207
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,120
her, you can too, but you might be better off trying to spot who the crypto person is either

208
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,800
outside or in the lobby here, and then make sure you direct Travis in the right direction after

209
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:56,200
that. So I think that it'll probably go down in the lobby, isn't it? The exchange? I'm going to

210
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,560
to hide in the trash can in the lobby.

211
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,280
Okay.

212
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,160
So yeah, we're going to have to do, we'll have to do, and I'm going to put that my

213
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,140
ear against the inside of the trash can.

214
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,320
Like I'm listening through a wall to make sure I hear everything.

215
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,140
All right.

216
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,780
We'll do some roles for that in a second then.

217
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,020
Um, Travis, I don't know if you have any, I mean, obviously you're sort of

218
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,640
awaiting orders, but I wasn't sure if there was a, anything you wanted to do

219
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,260
or a game plan you had in mind in the meantime, um, I'm whistling.

220
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,720
Great.

221
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,420
And you've been practicing your shot, right?

222
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,420
Do you feel in control of your chimp arm now?

223
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,420
Or where do you think that's at?

224
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Yeah, I've been feeling pretty good about it.

225
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I've been clutching my balls during my jerk-off sessions

226
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
and nothing's been torn off yet.

227
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
Okay, so this is sort of, yeah, good.

228
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,420
Alright, so I just wanted to make sure, I wanted to see where that was at.

229
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,420
And, yeah, Ray, you're kind of waiting on Barry Giesley here

230
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,500
Because Barry he's going to meet with that guy.

231
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,820
So I guess you're just kind of posting up or is there anything else

232
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,060
you're you're handling in the lobby while we wait for that to initiate?

233
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm just lamp and smoking a cigarette.

234
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,500
Love that.

235
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,700
But I'm also smoking.

236
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,540
I'm smoking a cigar.

237
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,500
Oh, I'm smoking too.

238
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,780
I'm smoking too in the trash.

239
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,420
You guys are running.

240
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,100
I'm trying to.

241
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,260
I'm trying to smoke.

242
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm trying to smoke, but every inhale that I take makes me throw up.

243
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,380
Yeah, I'm smoking.

244
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,740
I'm smoking a cigar in the trash can.

245
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,420
You have to go ahead and ruin smoking all you want,

246
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,120
but I'm just normal smoking, having a really enjoying myself.

247
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,860
What's what did I what do we ruin?

248
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
He's vomiting. You're in a trash can.

249
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,320
What's wrong with that?

250
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,000
Um, so, Patrick.

251
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,940

You can see he's a so he works as one of this

00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,020
one of the sort of like human security guides,

256
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,800
which means that all his job is to do is to just monitor the automations.

257
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
So, yeah, you see Gallant Goofus and he walks down to see you, Barry Gee.

Well, you know, I still have my day job, but I'm taking all the advice

265
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,480
you said and put my money in a few of those funds.

266
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,880
And I'm really watching some growth and I have a few investments, a few friends of mine.

267
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,080
I really tried to look for the guys who had the same vision you were talking about that go get her spirit.

268
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,280
And I really think that something's going to come of it.

269
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
So I owe you everything.

270
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,080
I owe you everything.

271
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,380
Yeah, I'm following memories because I meet so many losers who want to make their own business.

You're like the Amazon to have poop.

Anyways, I got to take three minutes at the same time.

297
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,540
Right.

298
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,860
No total deception for that guy either, because he just is just happy to believe

299
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,340
anything.

300
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,420
Um, uh, okay.

301
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,940
So yeah, Mary, yeah, you can, you can now make your way to the bathroom.

302
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,980
Um, um, you know, you might want to wait for, where's the women's bathroom, by the

303
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,260
way?

304
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,660
I know I'm a man.

305
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,220
I just want to know just so I don't go there.

306
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,780
Oh, of course.

307
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,100
It's just, no, I get it.

308
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,620
I get it.

309
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,080
You got to know where everything is.

310
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,520
That's how you stay ahead of the game.

311
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,900
Well, it's towards the back and, and, uh, well, where you, you make a left

312
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,440
and then there's sort of two ways to go over as a women's room and the men's

313
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,780
room, and you're going to go towards the women's room while you're not going

314
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,380
to go towards it, but now you know where it is.

315
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,120
Yeah.

316
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
It's so, it's so embarrassing.

317
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
I did that once at a sushi place.

318
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,920
I was, I was so embarrassed.

319
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,160
All right.

320
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,560
I'll show you.

321
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,840
I walk away very fast.

322
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,540
Yeah.

323
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,520
Um, okay.

324
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:08,860
Yeah.

325
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,120
So yeah, he's gonna Gallagher's gonna turn to you, right?

326
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
He'd be like, come on, I'll show you where the security is.

327
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:15,880
It's great.

328
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,920
It's a really nice room.

329
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,120
It's air conditioned.

330
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
There's only one other guy in there named Lance.

331
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,160
He's chill, though.

332
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
He's awesome.

333
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,560
And he starts leading you back there.

334
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,980
Can I be holding my he's going to holding my hand?

335
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,580
Do you want to hold your hand?

336
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,080
I can't tell where I'm going unless you hold my hand.

337
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,220
My eyesight's not that good these days.

338
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,120
Roll up. Persuasion.

339
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
disclosing his eyes.

340
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
He's not sure if that's okay to do.

341
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
My eyes are completely closed.

342
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
16.

343
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
I just, I can't see a damn thing.

344
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
[laughter]

345
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,120
He's like, "Oh, well, ah." He holds your hand.

346
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
He's like, "Okay, well, I guess, just let's keep going this way."

347
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
Then he's like, holding your hand and dragging you,

348
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
leading you to the security room.

349
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Cool, okay.

350
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Blotas, I want to resolve your hiding in a trash can.

351
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Yes.

352
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,720
if you're doing that now, there are still security bots that are more or less active.

353
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:19,480
So, can I tell, before I sneak in, can I tell by looking at the security bots if they

354
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,640
have thermal scanners or anything like that? Yeah, what I would do, because we don't have,

355
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:33,000
I would say that this is kind of a, let's just do either intelligence or arcana, I think, to sort of

356
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,920
assess the the like technical aspects of these things.

357
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,600
All right let's see here. Okay 10. Yeah um yeah I mean you can tell that

358
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,800
they're they're they're not not advanced. They might

359
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,720
have thermal it might not be great but it also might be good enough

360
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,200
for the trash cans. You can't really tell.

361
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,720
It's like but what you know is that they definitely have things that are beyond

362
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,200
just like sensing things right in front of them.

363
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,880
Okay because I was going to try to turn invisible and just walk in and climb

364
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:27,760
I'm

365
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,760
to have the stealth into the fountain. Okay that's fine. Okay roll stealth.

366
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:45,200
8. Alright, Scriba you fucked this up. Cannonball into the fountain. The water goes everywhere.

367
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,800
And not only does the water go everywhere but there are a bunch of coins in the fountain

368
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,480
like when people throw it into Wish and all the coins fly out and they catch the sunlight

369
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,720
and they flash in every guard's eyes.

370
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,060
Oh, yeah, okay.

371
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,660
The robots are gonna come over and go, "You can't be in the fountain."

372
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
I do.

373
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm like, "Hey, get your hands off me!"

374
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Like, even though they're not touching me and I kind of like slink away.

375
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,000
But I'm also, I'm slinking away, but I'm not going straight away.

376
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm kind of looping around to go towards the back of the building and hoping they don't

377
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
notice.

378
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,960
Okay, yeah, no, I think that's fine.

379
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,500
I think it's more of just, they're just, they're pretty simply programmed.

380
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
So it's like an aberration, okay, the aberration ceases, okay.

381
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
So we'll come back to that.

382
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:39,540
Okay, Patrick Yoda, you are working the floor with, right now with Travis, who's also sort of chilling at the floor.

383
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:47,540
You hear a "tss" from your PSP, and it's Mommy Goodlegs.

384
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
And she says, "Patrick, Patrick, come in!"

385
00:22:49,540 --> 00:23:03,420
the

386
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,420
*laughter*

387
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,420
I think that I'm fine.

388
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,420
I think that I'm fine,

389
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
but I don't know I'm saying

390
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
bar after everything.

391
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Because Cameron, or Blotus

392
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
kicked me in the head or something earlier.

393
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
And it's kind of like, made me

394
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
a little bit loopy again.

395
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Patrick, okay,

396
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
I need to ask you something.

397
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
This is part of the mission.

398
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
Okay?

399
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
Eagle legs?

400
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,420
What?

401
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Mom?

402
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
Eagle legs?

403
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Okay, can you put-

404
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Is there anybody else on- near you?

405
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,420
I'm here, I'm right next to him.

406
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Oh, okay, the sociopath. Okay, so-

407
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
Good.

408
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Um, okay.

409
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Hi.

410
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Hi, hi Travis.

411
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Hello!

412
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Okay, I looked into

413
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:06,140
who was looking into the building and using the Papi Chuko pseudonym.

414
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
I think-

415
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,380
I close the call and I start playing Ridge Racer on the PC.

416
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,300
Yeah, it's just...

417
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,220
Yeah, that just like doesn't get resolved.

418
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,980
Let's go back to Juvio.

419
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Very gee.

420
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,740
So you're heading towards the girls bathroom.

421
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,360
Are you just going to rush in there without waiting for the guards to be rerouted or deactivated

422
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
or are you going to wait outside?

423
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I just want to know that.

424
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,480
There's women's bathroom guards in this building?

425
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,840
No, there's just guards in general who if they...

426
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,920
They're not very woke, dude.

427
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,800
And so if they see you going towards that lady's bathroom, they're going to be pretty

428
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
PO'd.

429
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Okay.

430
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,280
So you can sneak and you can maybe make it, but I just wanted to see if you were going

431
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,200
to wait to see if Ray William Johnson can turn it deactivated or not.

432
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,480
I want to make an awesome sneak maneuver.

433
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,160
So I'm going to head to where the bathrooms are.

434
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm going to get into the male bathroom and as soon as the door closes, there's going

435
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:18,880
to be a puddle of little magnets that crawl from under the door into the woman's bathroom.

436
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
I like that.

437
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,120
I become a man right as I walk in. So I'm still a man in the woman's bathroom.

438
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,240
Cool. Good. Okay. Yeah, I think, yeah, you're able to turn to Slither and then Slither

439
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:39,400
is going to give you, you're going to have lower DC check on any sort of stealth checks you make.

440
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:46,440
So I would say roll stealth. So you turn into the puddle in the men's bathroom. I mean, you could

441
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Just go into a stall, just do that.

442
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
And hit the stealth button.

443
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
You can just do that.

444
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
You can just do that.

445
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
You can just turn into a puddle in the men's bathroom.

446
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
You get advantage, so roll again.

447
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Just because you're a slither.

448
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
23, there we go.

449
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,440
You kind of make yourself into a very thin strip of liquid and just sort of slide along the wall.

450
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
And slip into the girls room.

451
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
And do you...

452
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Yeah.

453
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,400
nobody in there right now. It's pretty early in the day.

454
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,680
People haven't started their some of them. There might be

455
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,320
people coming in to do their PB routine, but it's not like

456
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,160
lunch hour or anything. So you can turn back into a man for

457
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,360
now. Ray, you're being brought to the security room. I'm being

458
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,520
led by led. I apologize. Yeah by hand you're in there by a

459
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,120
gals. Goof is gallant gallant goof and he says, okay, here it

460
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:57,100
is

461
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,500
to the bathroom and leave you two at it."

462
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,940
And he gives you another big wink and he leaves.

463
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:08,340
You see Lance and Lance is just sort of like, Lance sort of looks like Carl from Aqua Teen

464
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,260
Hunger Force.

465
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,380
And maybe he sounds like him too.

466
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:19,140
And he's sort of like, "What do you, did you want me to show you how this works or what?"

467
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,000
I need you to show me around this entire place.

468
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,500
But the thing is, I can't see very well.

469
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
So I'm going to need you to hold me.

470
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,780
You need to be led by hand?

471
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
Yeah.

472
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,780
Okay, yeah.

473
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,780
You're not the first one.

474
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,660
I mean, it's not too much.

475
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,180
We got the control panel over here.

476
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,700
This is where we control all the robots.

477
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,940
Then we got the monitors over here so we can see what's going on.

478
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Can't see in the ladies room though.

479
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
I've tried.

480
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,940
And yeah, I mean, that's about it.

481
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,540
I mean, we got a, do you want to, I got snacks too.

482
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,860
Do you have like maybe a a giant like 128 ounce soda?

483
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,660
Yeah, hold on one second

484
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:09,780
He goes underneath the the control panel and pulls up the opposite. He pulls out a big big ultra big gulp

485
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:16,180
Okay. Oh, this is oh, this is gonna hit the spot. This is gonna be good. Yeah. Did you want this? Yeah

486
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:20,540
Yeah, come on hand it over. Okay, you can have a couple sips, but you know, this is my lunch

487
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,120
This is my dinner and it's my lunch and dinner for tomorrow too. As soon as it touches my my hands, uh, it it flies

488
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,900
Because my hands are so so clammy from holding a boy's hand, right?

489
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,700
I was getting so nervous and sweaty the soda flies and the soda gets all over every single piece of every panel

490
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,020
Oh, no, what the fuck? Oh, i'm

491
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,740
I'm, sorry, you make me a little nervous

492
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,620
Oh, no. Oh, I mean you make me nervous too, but this is terrible and uh,

493
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,940
uh yeah all the robots are they're they're going to be out of commission for some time um

494
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,700

495
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:08,060

496
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:16,300
uh yeah the robots are in uh are in a bad place so you blow toss you can now hide in the trash

497
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,380
Yeah, so I yeah I was I I did the thing where I was circling around the back and I did but

498
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,820
My intention was never going to go in the back door

499
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,080
I was just gonna circle around and try to jump in the fountain again, and I'm not aware that the robots are

500
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,240
So I just jump back in the fountain and then I go inside and I climb into the trash can and I light up a big

501
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Fat cigar and nice smoke is coming out of the trash. I tap in Morse code on the trash can all the robots stopped working

502
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
*laughter*

503
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Yeah, you learned that from working Morse Code.

504
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Working for the Bureau of...

505
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
I start crying,

506
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
because the Morse Code is really scary.

507
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
I think it's a robot that's coming.

508
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
He's so scared he thinks it's rain.

509
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
*laughter*

510
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
I think it's the trash can rolling

511
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
down a hill.

512
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
*laughter*

513
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Okay, yeah, so,

514
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
meantime,

515
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
um,

516
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
robots are shooting at the train.

517
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
*laughter*

518
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Uh, Patrick Yoda,

519
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
you see Fatima

520
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
coming down the stairs.

521
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Um... I take the PSP

522
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
out and I hit, I dial *6-9*

523
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
because I realize I've fucked up

524
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
something. Okay.

525
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
*laughter*

526
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Yes, who would you like

527
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
to contact? *laughter*

528
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Doesn't *6-9* call people?

529
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Does it call the person back

530
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,880
who called you or is that star six seven? No, star six nine is the anonymous phone call.

531
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,480
Oh, star six seven. I hit star six seven then. No, no, no, star six seven is what you hit

532
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,120
if you want to do an anonymous call. Star six nine I think does call back the person. Not

533
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,160
on my phone. Okay, then I hit star six seven and then I-

534
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah, it refers to last call of turn. You're right. You're right. Thank you. Let's make

535
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,500
sure. It's star six nine and I don't call anybody

536
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,600
because I got the numbers mixed up. You were actually right. It is star six nine.

537
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
It is star six nine. Yeah

538
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,480
No, I already said it's different on my phone. So you call still you call back mommy

539
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,400
And she says okay. Can you can you talk now? Is everything okay on your end? I

540
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,600
Said you guys just some trouble

541
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,520
What this is mommy you mommy good legs my mommy

542
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:34,800
No, not your mommy. Your mommy's a Yoda. All right, I chokeslam Patrick Yoda and

543
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
take his PSP.

544
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
[laughter]

545
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Hello?

546
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Travis, okay.

547
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Here's the thing.

548
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:55,040
Fatima doesn't know, but in the security vault, the person who was looking for me, or was

549
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,440
looking for the building, that was...

550
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Sorry, wait, hold on. I want to make sure I get the name right.

551
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,440
I want to make sure I get the name right.

552
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,440
Dr. Toulateralis.

553
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,440
I almost forgot the name.

554
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,440
I thought it was going to be something hard to pronounce.

555
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,440
I gasp really hard, but I don't know who it is.

556
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
You might not know who he is. But he worked with the boys.

557
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,300
But he worked with the boys on helping-

558
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:29,800
FARRRK

559
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,220
Uh, yeah, sure.

560
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,680
Um, glad the chokeslam didn't put you totally out of commission, Patrick.

561
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,480
It actually kinda helped me, a little bit.

562
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:39,980
*laughter*

563
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,300
Seems like it.

564
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,420
Also, you're on speak-a-phone and everyone around us can hear us.

565
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
Alright, I rip his mouth off.

566
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,500
*laughter*

567
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,900
*unintelligible*

568
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,340
He just met his lips.

569
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
*laughter*

570
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
There's something inside-

571
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340
*laughter*

572
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
*laughter*

573
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,340
*laughter*

574
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
I seal his mouth.

575
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,340
Um...

576
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,340
There's something in the vault

577
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
besides the money.

578
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,340
He wasn't able to tell me what it was,

579
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340
but just be on your guard.

580
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,340
That's all.

581
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Okay.

582
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,340
Okay.

583
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,340
With you right now, what are you?

584
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,060
I'm i'm sort of been listening to fatima. It looks like she's gonna go meet

585
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,700
No, I mean what else what else is going on?

586
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,340
Oh, um

587
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,380
Oh, I mean I had I I I have a I have a son now that was a recent

588
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,060
Good he was born between the episodes. Yeah. Goodbye

589
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,620
And uh, yeah, so Fatima is coming down now so Patrick or Travis you can notify

590
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,460
Up to Fatima. I run up to Fatima immediately

591
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,900
I pick up the trash can and I hold it upside down so that blowtoss falls out. I run up to Fatima and I say

592
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:11,020
Oh shoot one of the three generous millionaires who gave us so much money it's so wonderful to meet you

593
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,820
Oh, you don't have a mouth, okay, that's funny

594
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
*unintelligible*

595
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
and uh...

596
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
when...

597
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,860
when the trash can got turned upside down and I fell out

598
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I landed cigar first

599
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
and the cigar went into my mouth

600
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
and I involuntarily swallowed it

601
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
and I just instantly turned completely green

602
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,860
*laughter*

603
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,860
and I'm very sick

604
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,860
okay

605
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,860
well you also see walking in

606
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Stephen A. Smith

607
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
*laughter*

608
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
oh my god

609
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,860
*moaning*

610
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,780
So Travis, you would remember that from the dossiers as well.

611
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,340
Patrick Yoda right now seems to be entertaining Fatima.

612
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,900
So I would say this is an opportunity where you can apprehend Stephen A. Smith,

613
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,980
blow toss, you could turn into Stephen A. Smith and make the transfer of the money.

614
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,420
Okay, I'm gonna immediately turn into him.

615
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:15,460
Yeah, you guys can kind of like make eye contact and know exactly kind of how this should go

616
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
or know that you have to do something.

617
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
Okay.

618
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
Um...

619
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,460
Excuse me, sir.

620
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,460
You dropped five quarters.

621
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
What?

622
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
Behind you.

623
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,460
No, I didn't.

624
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Yes, you did.

625
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Roll deception with advantage.

626
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
That's fine, but then I will be gone.

627
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,460
I have to roll deception for that?

628
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Yeah.

629
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
I mean, it's either that or nothing.

630
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,460
Right?

631
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Okay, fine.

632
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
I'm sorry, give me one second.

633
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
No worries.

634
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
You get advantage on it though.

635
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Oh yeah.

636
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Nice, 21.

637
00:35:50,460 --> 00:36:03,660
You know what, I feel like I had about 5 quarters in my pocket the other day.

638
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,860
He starts looking around on the ground.

639
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
I rip his head off.

640
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Yeah, right.

641
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Okay.

642
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,860
(laughter)

643
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
Okay.

644
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
(laughter)

645
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Alright, I mean, he is a civilian.

646
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,860
So you will be- and he is also

647
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,860
distracted, so just roll

648
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Krav Maga 2000 with

649
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,860
advantage.

650
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,860
While this is going on, I go over to

651
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,860
the front desk of the hotel and I-

652
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
(laughter)

653
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,860
I go to the-

654
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Casino?

655
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Casino!

656
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
I go to the- I don't think it's either of those things.

657
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
And then I go to a hotel.

658
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
Yeah.

659
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,860
He's been at a hotel the whole time.

660
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Every, every, uh, every casino I've ever been to has been a hotel.

661
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
So I just assumed that there was a front desk here.

662
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
This is not a casino nor a hotel.

663
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,860
We're at a charity event? Right.

664
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Um, so- This is no event.

665
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
We're just in a charity building.

666
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Right, charity event at a casino slash hotel.

667
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:17,060
flash hotel yeah not just like the room the place to the desk that has markers

668
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:24,580
screen kiosk at the McDonald's I go to the I go to wherever they have markers

669
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
and I draw a new mouth on him.

670
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,580
And I walk down the aisle,

671
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
and I see the bride.

672
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,580
I draw a new mouth on my face, so I can speak again.

673
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
Patrick walks out of the store,

674
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
walks out of the store,

675
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
is now called the store.

676
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
He's in the store!

677
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
I don't even know where we are.

678
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
I'm so disoriented now.

679
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
I was in a casino!

680
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
I get a message from Wawa.

681
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
He goes to a Staples.

682
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,580
I suffocate because we're in outer space.

683
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
*laughter*

684
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Okay, cool.

685
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Yeah, you draw on a mouth.

686
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
So Pat goes under the marker room.

687
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,580
The party room of the casino.

688
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:18,580
No, it's a charity building with a marker room that's a casino.

689
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,580
Charity building?

690
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
the charity building

691
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
that's a marker room

692
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
basically a charity, basically a headquarters for a

693
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,580
for a non-profit is essentially where we are

694
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,580
yeah so there's a lot of markers

695
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,580
they do like markers

696
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,580
at non-profits

697
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,580
and whiteboards

698
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,580
I always be writing on whiteboards

699
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
so I take one of the markers I draw a new mouth on

700
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
so I can speak normally

701
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,580
what do they write on those whiteboards like uh

702
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
how do I not make money

703
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
yes there we go

704
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,580
the

705
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
the

706
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
the

707
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,580
the

708
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
the

709
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,580
the

710
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,580
the

711
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
the

712
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
the

713
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,580
the

714
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,580
the

715
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
the

716
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
the

717
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,580
the

718
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:19,740
The rolling sound oh and roll 20

719
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:32,500
Looks really upset Caleb's had a rough week. All right. Do I succeed in decapitating? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

720
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,720
I mean this guy's just like a chump like yeah, I will say though that people notice you decapitate

721
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
So I you should know that that would happen

722
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,840
Okay, I quickly reattach his head and I hold

723
00:39:45,220 --> 00:40:02,100
on

724
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,780
with his head on his like fully on his body.

725
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,020
- I look like him, but I'm completely green

726
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,740
'cause I'm very sick.

727
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,620
- Okay, so yeah, you can go up to Fatima though.

728
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,980
Patrick Yoda was distracting her

729
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,900
and then drew his mouth back on.

730
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,500
- I walk up to Fatima and I'm like,

731
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,180
hello miss, how are you?

732
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,180
- Oh, okay, this is good.

733
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,420
Before you were going,

734
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,180
you were making pretty scary sounds.

735
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,020
So I didn't know you were.

736
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,700
- I'll go on your mouth now.

737
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
Oh, that's so exciting.

738
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,700
Yes, are you from Sky, England?

739
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
I'm from... I'm from...

740
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
Sucka-fucka-ba.

741
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Nah, I'm from Sucka-fucka-ba.

742
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Oh, okay.

743
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
Oh, yes, you're Jordan.

744
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
Um, yeah, both of us.

745
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
Sucka-fucka-ba-ba.

746
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
Wait, now there's two Stephen A. Smiths and one is a puppet.

747
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Yeah, unless you want to dispatch

748
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
the other is just green.

749
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,700
Take the puppet one into the bathroom.

750
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
Yeah.

751
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
carry on his duty.

752
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,580
I'm going to just make an announcement outside too.

753
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Like, you're not far away from the lobby.

754
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,460
Like, you're in the lobby.

755
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,460
Like, you could...

756
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,780
You'd have to still figure out a way to dispose of him,

757
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
but it's not like you can't get rid of him.

758
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,460
Alright, we should stage some kind of fight between the two Stephen A. Smiths

759
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,460
where Lotus wins and defeats his doppelganger.

760
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm okay with that, yeah.

761
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,940
Yeah, we're gonna do it, yeah.

762
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,980
I can't control that.

763
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,580
I can't control what you do.

764
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,900
"Ohhh I'm so sick because somebody's copying me!"

765
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,900
"Oh, Steven!"

766
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
"I'm your evil twin!"

767
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,180
"And I punch him like really lightly and his head just flies off."

768
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,180
"And his head also, it's not attached."

769
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:49,820
"And people just applaud and say 'Yes, finally, the real Steven A. Smith has defeated his

770
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
evil twin!'"

771
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,140
"Everyone watching, both of you roll a performance check."

772
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,260
The effect of this is that people will think like, "Oh wow, security's really good around

773
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,180
here and nothing strange is happening."

774
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
I say that out loud.

775
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,180
Because they can deal with threats.

776
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,020
I say that exact thing out loud.

777
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,100
I got a 4 on performance.

778
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,140
11, okay.

779
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:22,620
Yeah, people are less convinced that you were able to punch his head off.

780
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,020
But they're not necessarily unconvinced that that was the evil Stephen A. Smith.

781
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,420
Because you do look like Stephen A. Smith now.

782
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,140
Exactly like him, but green.

783
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,820
But they do think that your performance of budging his head off seemed like you were

784
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,620
trying to beat him.

785
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,620
But you...

786
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,420
Okay, okay, I admit it.

787
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,980
I faked killing my evil twin because I wanted you guys to respect me.

788
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,300
I've been an outsider since my first day at this job, and I thought that this was going

789
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,740
to be the day that that changed, but I guess not, so let me just get whatever code I need

790
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,380
to do my job and go home and fuck with you myself.

791
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,700
I applaud, I try to start another round of applause.

792
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Roll persuasion.

793
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
Uh, Travis.

794
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Both of you.

795
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I beat you for winning.

796
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,700
Zero!

797
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,700
Why did you do that?

798
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
Why did you try to clarify?

799
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Why did you

800
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,140
Friend I mean, it's so horrible. It's just like

801
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,420
It doesn't convince anybody of anything in particular, okay, I

802
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,340
Just say just kidding everyone

803
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:41,420
Yeah, I mean like everyone at this point is like completely perplexed by the scene

804
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,540
But you do look a lot like Stephen a Smith and sound like okay

805
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,340
And none of the real

806
00:43:49,340 --> 00:44:11,120
Is true, but you fail persuasion

807
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,620
Yeah, that's kind of what's happening here, I mean oh man, I mean like nobody believes you

808
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:24,460
We don't be known what to think about you like you're not you haven't done a single thing. That's made either made sense

809
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:31,700
You could pretty much say whatever you want

810
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,820
Anybody to do anything ever for you on your behalf

811
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,820
the

812
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:52,820
the

813
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,420
just goes to you Stephen, Stephen slash blowtoss and says oh so good that you're

814
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,620

00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:14,980
basement so please right this way Stephen. Easy for me. I'm Stephen's aide and I

I'm sorry. I just we're only going to have so many

820
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,220
You know the security protocols is it's not going to allow it's okay. It's okay, but your brother

He'll come he'll come

It's okay. I can come I can come inside. Yeah

823
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,620
Instead of me

824
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:54,780
Well, so I'm just kidding I'm just we to go and you say back

825

So I'll go with you Steven look if your younger brother needs to be or sort of you know

827

828
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,180
Security chamber, okay, and then we'll play by year once more about my older brother and I point to a guy

829
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,180
a guy I don't know.

830
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,180
Guy I mean...

831
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,180
I... uh...

832
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,180
I don't know, I think we'll just keep it with you younger,

833
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,180
but you felt a lot weirder than when we first met.

834
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,180
Um, let's just uh, short term make our way there.

835
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,180
Sick.

836
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,180
And um, yeah, you guys

837
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,180
started to start walking there, Travis you're coming along.

838
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,180
Um, at this point.

839
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,180
Meanwhile, uh,

840
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,180
Ray, you're being led now

841
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
to um, uh,

842
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:42,180
uh, Goofus Gallant

843
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,720
By Lance and Lance is like I goofus

844
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:53,000
Goofus. Oh, yeah Lance. Yeah this guy. He spilled a bunch of shit on the fucking control pan. What the fuck?

845
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,260
No, this guy spilled all this shit

846
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:00,320
Every fucking thing in the whole goddamn room. Oh my hand

847
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:10,840
Okay, yeah goofus goofus doesn't believe you

848
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:24,020
you

849
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,020
So well, I believe in you

850
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:33,040
I mean you wouldn't necessarily be aware of it. This is happening. Well, but if you just had it like a motherly instinct

851
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,340
Yeah, he just knew that

852
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:42,120
I'm not trying to interfere what's happening. I'm just I'm just trying to give him like like a some reinforcement. Yeah, it's fair

853
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,760
Yeah, I'm sure he has like a bot that sends encouragement to

854
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,780
Patches he probably has some kind of bot

855
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:59,000
My latest post which is a video of me going like you need to start selling off your family members possessions

856
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,780
They don't they're not doing anything good for you. You need to sell them off and I'm saying that to him as well

857
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:11,700
Yeah, I think goof is I think without you even sending that goof is is trying to remember that you're very good

858
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,640
So well, you know, let's just go to the control panels go to the scene and just try to try to figure out what to do

859
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,300
You know, I think blaming other people that's not that's not that's not the the mindset here

860
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,720
Let's just try to problem solve, you know, let's just try to problem solve right?

861
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,380
I can solve your problem right now. You fucking fire this idiot what? Oh

862
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,980
Don't listen. He's a fucking demon. You listen to a demon

863
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:40,820
I am NOT gay. You told me to grab your hand, but you said that you liked it

864
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:47,540
I liked it, but whatever I like a lot of things. Yeah, like like, you know what it's not about who's gay

865
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,660
Yeah, that's right. It's not about

866
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:56,700
I always build all the soda in the whole room and destroy every last part of the security system

867
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:03,140
Let's just move on from this and if you can bring me to maybe another room and boy am I thirsty

868
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,140
if I mean I can a

869
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,660
Giant bottle of orange juice

870
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:12,780
What do you say

871
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:15,380
Roll persuasion

872
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:23,260
7 okay, one worse. It was like I think I think we should just sort of let's let's just go back to the security room

873
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,700
And just try to try to fix the problem

874
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,980
And then and then and then I can get you that OJ. Okay?

875
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,820
All right, sounds good, okay cool

876
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:39,500
They were being brought back to the security room with Lance who's pissed at you. You're you're both going back there now

877
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,740
Going back to you

878
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:51,500
Barry key, so I don't know blow toss. I assume you've I mean, well who did the robe? Yeah, ray you keep the signal of people

879
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,700
Did you get the signal that the robots were well? No

880
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:01,300
Travis was able to probably communicate that to people so very key. You can now start to travel through the vents

881
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,780
Travel through the the plumbing. I mean through the girls bathroom

882
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:11,220
Yeah, so if you want to do that, you can start doing that you could go back and slither again use another charge

883
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,420
To get into the into the plumbing

884
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:22,020
Yep, I'm smithering. Oh, yeah, so you're slithering through the plumbing and this is the girls bathroom

885
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:29,060
so one of the big problems is that there's a lot of buildup of a lot of just like the kind of stuff that comes out

886
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,060
of women and

887
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:37,380
Unfortunately, yeah, no it's attacking you

888
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,640
The girl stuffs attacking you know

889
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,420
Cancel the campaign

890
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,940
Yeah, I'm sorry guys

891
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,420
No

892
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:52,180
because I thought about it a lot and I was like if he goes to the plumbing like I have to try to be realistic and

893
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,460
trying to like tell the story in an accurate way and

894
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:01,060
Girl stuff attacks you so roll initiative Barry G. You're being attacked by tampons

895
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:09,420
You're being attacked by by girl doodoo, which is worse than guy doodoo. Yeah being attacked by discharge

896
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:17,060
just general yeah and bugs and bugs the only other thing that girls have a

897
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:35,580
pussy fly the fable pussy fly girl but rat in there - I hate when I see a girl's

898
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:52,980
butt rat. Dude when the butt rat string pokes out of their shorts. Not for me. Nope. Not

899
00:51:52,980 --> 00:52:01,100
my thing. I said a butt rat traps all over the floor in the bathroom. Yup. So we'll go

900
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,220
back to that so Fatima is leading you now down there

901
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:11,260
blowtoss with with Travis and she's saying you know

902
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,860
the thing is is that there's there's a lot I want to do with

903
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:18,860
this charity you know and I think about the the three gentlemen who donated all

904
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,460
those that's money and I think about what that could have done what that did

905
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,260
for us you know that's kind of generosity because

906
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,380
there's not a lot of it in Gandshetti and I think about what we can get done here

907
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,980
And the things that we can start to do and it's very exciting.

908
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,340
So you're going to see a lot of money in this vault and it's very good.

909
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,020
And I'm looking forward to what we can do with this.

910
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,740
I don't know what funds you're thinking of or potentially sort of if there's a particular

911
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,380
coin you're thinking of trying to turn this into.

912
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,780
I know we only talked about preliminaries.

913
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,940
Yeah, there's a certain type of coin that I've been really interested in putting my

914
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,420
money into lately, and it's called my coin.

915
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,420
I'm gonna turn this all into my coin.

916
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,420
Oh my coin, my coin.

917
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,420
What is that? What's that run on?

918
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,420
Me. OS.

919
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,420
Windows ME.

920
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,420
iPhone.

921
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,420
A vintage coin, that's interesting.

922
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,420
I'm gonna win those coins

923
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:29,100

00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,500
I hate him. He's my evil brother

927
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,900
We have to kill him

928
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,780
Give him a noogie with my chimp arm

929
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:52,220
We get into a big fight

930
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,220
*laughter*

931
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,720

933
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,220
and like when they- they- the balloon goes up and covers the security camera

934
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,220
but it serves no purpose at all

935
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,220
*laughter*

936
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,720
but it is a fight to the death

937
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,720

938
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,220

997
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,300
yeah

998
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,300
It's going like...

999
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,300
[Mimics the sound of a cat]

1000
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,300
You know, a pussy sound.

1001
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,300
And it's attacking you.

1002
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,300
Okay, what is your AC?

1003
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,300
Oh, your AC is higher, I just realized.

1004
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,300
Because you're in slime mode.

1005
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,300
So it tries to shoot acid at you.

1006
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,300
Um...

1007
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,300
And the concentrated acid that comes out of...

1008
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,300
So yeah, it misses though.

1009
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,300
But it's going to try one more time.

1010
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
Because it gets two attacks in this beautiful world of ours.

1011
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,300
Do I get a million attacks?

1012
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,900
You get two attacks.

1013
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:39,900
How about...

1014
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
...forty?

1015
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,400
No.

1016
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,900
You know, it does hit you.

1017
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:46,400
It hits you for eight damage.

1018
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,400
It shoots its acid at you and it sort of gets your slime...

1019
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,800
...uh, body.

1020
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,400
Your weird fucked up slime.

1021
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,900
FUCK!

1022
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,400
Not my slime body!

1023
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,400
[laughter]

1024
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,900
Yeah.

1025
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,400
But it's your turn. You're up.

1026
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,400
This fly is sort of blocking your path so you can't plant the bomb if need be.

1027
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,400
I kill it in one fell swoop.

1028
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:27,320
the

1029
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,320
Yeah

1030
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,040
If you depolarize somebody's cells you can mess with their

1031
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,280
Diaper I was doing some is that true? All right. Well, fuck well

1032
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:43,240
It's because of it's one aspect of when you depolarize someone cells things you can do to their diaphragm

1033
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:48,660
I don't recall in in deus ex. Is that something you can do it in? I don't know about

1034
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:55,960
7-7 it was just something I was reading about the depolarization of cells. Yeah, I read about the - I'm gonna deploy race all that pussy

1035
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,460
I guess.

1036
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:07,160
Yeah, okay. So then hit depolarize inside the attack and spell casting thing. It's in the middle of your sheet.

1037
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,840
Oh, I got it.

1038
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:15,040
Oh, yeah, that hits roll for damage. No, no, so hit depolarize in. Okay. Oh, damn. Okay.

1039
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,760
I got a 12. When I rolled that,

1040
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,520
Oh, he rolled for damage. Okay.

1041
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,080
You rolled.

1042
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,720
Juvia just hit depolarize inside of the chat window.

1043
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,360
I see.

1044
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,160
That's a fake one.

1045
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,860
That's also a fake one.

1046
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,660
It's going up sequentially.

1047
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:34,960
Hold on.

1048
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,760
Do it one more time.

1049
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,960
Okay, fine.

1050
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,360
Do it.

1051
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,460
Oh, that's weird.

1052
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,760
Okay, you got it.

1053
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,360
You got it.

1054
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,460
So you got date.

1055
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,360
Did you use any of your charges?

1056
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,760
I use the you can use one charge to paralyze it for six seconds.

1057
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,260
Yeah, I'll just paralyze it and go out of my way.

1058
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,760
I don't want to...

1059
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,860
So, for six seconds, it means you paralyze it for one round,

1060
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,660
which means during that round, you can try to run away from it

1061
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,560
and you can get some good distance on it.

1062
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,460
You might not be able to totally disengage from the combat,

1063
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,860
but you can start to make moves to do that.

1064
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,560
How strong is it anyways?

1065
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,160
I mean, you can do it.

1066
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:17,560
You can...

1067
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,560
Just say a number.

1068
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,060
Say a number.

1069
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,540
You have a roll insight.

1070
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,220
I'll let you do a free insight check to see if you can get a

1071
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,640
sense of how strong this fly is.

1072
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,540
We can tell it's not, it's not, not tough.

1073
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:34,280
Um, yeah, but it's also a pussy fly.

1074
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,720
That's true.

1075
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,840
It's not really, it's not really fucking around.

1076
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,740
Um, it's, it's fairly tough, but it's not that tough.

1077
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,800
Um, like you can take it, but, but we'll kill you.

1078
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,400
I'm going to go for the kill.

1079
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,420
Like I always do.

1080
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,840
So are you gonna use any other charges or you just gonna keep it paralyzed or no?

1081
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:57,120
I'll do the other the three charges thing the drive on destruction

1082
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,400
Of course you fuck up this flies diaphragm

1083
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,580
So it takes 1d for damage every turn until they long rest it moves at half speed and it's disadvantage on all saving throws going

1084
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,580
forward

1085
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:15,040
So we'll come back to this combat in a second we're gonna go back to the Ray William Johnson

1086
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:22,000
Workplace comedy and so you're going back into the security and you see that the I mean the drink is spilled

1087
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,240
The security bots are broken because of it and gallus goofins like all right. Well, well, let's just see if we could try to

1088
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,320
reboot this

1089
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:38,960
No, listen, I'm an expert of technology and basically I'm gonna need you two boys to suck all this soda up with your mouths

1090
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,620
Every last drop. All right. I'm gonna say role persuasion with advantage because you do have a computer attached to your back

1091
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,300
15

1092
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:54,460
Nice. Yeah, you see gallus immediately start sucking the the juice from there

1093
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,780
- yeah

1094
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:07,020
And you see Lancy like I I don't know if I want to be sucking this

1095
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:13,860
Sucking my soda from the control panel you are you uh, hey everybody this guy hates soda

1096
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:17,540
Okay, okay he runs over there

1097
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:24,260
So, yeah, you got them both sucking on it, um, uh, you're still able to see the security cameras so you can see

1098
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:27,720
travis and and blow toss with fatima

1099
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,980
Approaching one they're one door behind the security chamber where you won't be able to see them anymore

1100
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:40,420
And so we cut into that area and we see you two and you see Fatima she says, okay, so we're gonna go in here

1101
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,740
So travis you're going to wait out here if that's okay

1102
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,100
And then me and and steven here we're going to go inside

1103
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:51,940
And we're just going to handle this transaction and then you guys can keep hanging out being brothers. That's all cool with me

1104
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,500
Okay

1105
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,100
fine

1106
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,180
Okay, and so uh, she leads you inside steven steven blowtoss

1107
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:23,660
on

1108
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:34,540
the

1109
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,540
*sigh*

1110
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,040
and then?

1111
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,140
and after that

1112
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,140
I mean then she, then she um

1113
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,040
I, I don't know, what do you, what do you guys want?

1114
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,440
no and then?

1115
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,540
she gets all sticky

1116
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,840
she gets very sticky at the end of it, ok

1117
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,340
ok, that's good enough for me

1118
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,440
so that

1119
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,540
so

1120
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,140
what part of that

1121
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:58,740
when the door opens, it lets her, it's gonna let her and

1122
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,340
Travis, and Travis

1123
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,840
her and Blotas inside

1124
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,640
mhm

1125
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,640
um

1126
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,540
and then I just sort of scoop my foot into the door

1127
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:09,840
You're gonna scoop so I mean it's like it's a kind of door where so I should describe this a bit more

1128
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:15,300
It's a kind of door where it's gonna open. It has like an opening from the center of it and it like an aperture

1129
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,620
Yes an aperture 100%. Okay. Wow. Thank you. Um, and

1130
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,860
Wow, thank you. And you can see you can uh,

1131
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:31,740
You can try to step inside. It's gonna close pretty quickly. So if you do that, we're gonna have to do a dexterity check

1132
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:40,420
And if you fail it could be you know, it could be bad you all right I put all the valuable parts of my body in first

1133
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:47,600
Starting the penis then the head

1134
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:51,880
Trying to

1135
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:57,200
Yeah, I guess kind of like a cab cow away move to make that work. I feel like um

1136
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,120
Okay

1137
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:05,480
Roll just roll straight deck. So if you go into your nice fuck, okay

1138
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,680
Wow

1139
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,680
Yeah, 19 you slink in there and at this point

1140
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:18,920
You guys don't need Fatima anymore because that was the biometrics man

1141
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,640
so

1142
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,640
I'm letting you know what that happened because Fatima's gonna be like, um, I just I don't know if

1143
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:33,060
We can have you in here. She's gonna be like that, but she's not doing that yet. Yeah, and it's fine guys

1144
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,180
What's she gonna do? She's all sticky anyway

1145
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,320
Stick her to the wall

1146
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,300
I do a quick perception check on the ceiling of this room

1147
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,600
Mm-hmm. Okay

1148
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:52,680
Can I do a quick perception check to check whether this is the real vault or if it's one that they built in a in a

1149
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,800
warehouse to trick security cameras

1150
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,720
I just want to get ahead of this if it's gonna happen.

1151
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:05,240
I'm gonna do a perception check just because I'm really not sure where I am.

1152
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:08,320
You need persuasion, Pat.

1153
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,000
Yeah, see, everything's all going to the fritz.

1154
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,080
Yeah, alright, so, yeah, checking the ceilings, I mean, you gotta crit fail on your next perception.

1155
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:31,040
So Pierce, you look at the ceiling and yeah, what you do notice is the gold plated discs

1156
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,640
that would need to, that could only be, that would come down and slice any intruders.

1157
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,000
They can only be dismantled with the golden guns.

1158
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,440
So you do notice that and obviously yeah, they could be activated, you don't know how

1159
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,560
or when or why.

1160
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
know

1161
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,640
but you did clock that before you did anything the Fatima

1162
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
okay

1163
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,840
um I guess I rip her head off

1164
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:06,080
yeah she's a civilian you can do that she just wanted to make the world a better place

1165
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,280
uh roll an attack roll on her

1166
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,280
poor thing

1167
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,840
you fucking idiot

1168
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,080
yeah roll damage she's dead

1169
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,000
You killed Fatima von Kissyface.

1170
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:28,240
And yeah, she just, she said something in her unintelligible, I think I was trying for

1171
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,760
Dutch accent and then dies.

1172
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:39,800
The gold discs from above sling down to decapitate both of you, the two of you.

1173
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,480
Travis.

1174
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,680
I turn invisible.

1175
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:54,400
Travis, this is your this is your shot, OK?

1176
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,400
Roll attack roll. With your golden eagles,

1177
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,480
OK? Alright, wish me luck guys.

1178
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,960
Good luck. Bad luck. There we go.

1179
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,840
Well, all of your training, your whole life has been leading to this moment where you

1180
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,440
whip out your golden.

1181
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,440
Describe to me how you do this.

1182
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,440
You got 25.

1183
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,820
How did you do it?

1184
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:32,800
So I cross draw for my right golden deagle and both holsters are on my left side.

1185
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:37,640
So I cross draw with my right hand and my left hand I'm also drawing so that I'm fully

1186
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:45,720
akimbo. Fuck yes. I still have a cigar in my mouth, I swallow it, and then I breathe out

1187
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:53,040
the cigar smoke through my nostrils. Sick. And then I squeeze the triggers using my index

1188
01:08:53,040 --> 01:09:01,200
fingers. And then of course the slide goes back and then a little bit of exhaust comes

1189
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,200
Roll a wisdom saving throw too.

1190
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,200
Yeah, why not?

1191
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,200
[Laughter]

1192
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Okay. You were able to pull this off.

1193
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:20,200
But the amount of control and effort it took to do that, to suppress your chimpness,

1194
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:25,200
has caused your chimp arm, after the deed is done, to kind of go on the fritz.

1195
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:30,400
it is scratching your own ass, it is scratching your balls, it is trying to pick bugs off

1196
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,920
of Blotas' head and eat them.

1197
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,420
Your chimp barn will be out of commission.

1198
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,960
But you will be able to pull this off.

1199
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,520
Okay, great.

1200
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:46,560
So these gold disks that cannot be destroyed except by golden bullets from golden deagles.

1201
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:53,200
Blotas, you're gonna be at the vault, we'll come back to you.

1202
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,700

01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,840
I think you missed a spot.

1222
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:54,840
They both of them are holding their tummies going "Ohhhhhh"

1223
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,840
"Ohhhhhh"

1224
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,840
"Ohhhhhh"

1225
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:02,840
I feel like they're just in a lot of pain.

1226
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
pain.

1227
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:16,280
Okay, well, uh, I'm not- I'm an expert on technology, not on tummy aches.

1228
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:23,760
So, um, I'm not sure how much I can help you two further, but I hope- I feel like I learned

1229
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,960
a lot here.

1230
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:32,040
Um, two grown men who can't hold down 60 ounces of soda.

1234
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,760
I'll text him on Instagram.

1235
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:11,080
Yeah, yeah, I go "Yeah, sure, of course" and then I text Barry "Your friend is rolling

1236
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,920
around on the ground, he drinks so much soda that I think he's going to die."

1237
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,920
You need to stop drinking so much soda. You are burning your business by drinking this much soda.

1238
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,920
*laughter*

1239
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:39,920
Uh, Patrick Yoda, yeah, that guy's like, "Look, I did not mean to say, uh, F you, you know, I'm trying to understand your culture, I'm trying to meet you where you're at, man, like, I'm not, I'm really sorry about that."

1240
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,920
the

1241
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,920

the

1245
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,920
the

1246
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,920
the

1247
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,920
the

1248
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,920
the

1249
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,920
the

1250
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
the

1251
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,920
the

1252
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,920
the

1253
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,920
the

1254
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:14,240
Marketing yeah, nobody could say anything that you always can just say marketing. It's true. I just do a cartwheel

01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,280
If that was your intention.

1260
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:53,240
He's not impressed.

1261
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,720
He's mostly just tiffed.

1262
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,760
tiffed.

1263
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,760
Using the parlance.

1264
01:14:58,760 --> 01:14:59,960
Well, it's us.

1265
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,960

You got your laptop.

You've got access to the vault now.

1269
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,120
You have to get your credentials to get yourself in there.

1270
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,120
I open up my laptop.

1271
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:18,300
Travis, did you tell Blowtox that there's something else in there besides the money?

1272
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,300
Or did you not tell him that?

1273
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,300
I'm curious.

1274
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,300

No, I forgot.

1296
01:16:52,720 --> 01:17:01,240
banging on the vault door like slamming banging and then you hear it subside and

1297
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:10,440
when you hear you hear like sort of like a warping noise hey what was that

1298
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:19,000
oh classic sound okay oh yeah and that's what you hear oh wait what did I hear

1299
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
What was the second part?

1300
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
What

1301
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,160
Maria oh

1302
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,280
Yeah

1303
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,120
Is it Mario or Luigi

1304
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:41,840
That's all that you're left with is either Mario tell me right now is it Mario or is it Luigi can't tell you what that was

1305
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:47,400
Okay. Well also, what did I not go? I thought we were in the vault

1306
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,800
No, you were in the security chamber you down outside the I thought we got the biometric

1307
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,800
Okay, I go into the unless you wanted to use Fatima's to I

1308
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:03,560
Mean, yeah, I thought we were in the I mean, I'll go into the vault. Okay. Yeah, I'm not afraid of going into the vault

1309
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:05,800
so what you see is a

1310
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,120
pedestal

1311
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,040
That doesn't look like it fits in with anything

1312
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,920
It doesn't look like anything you've seen in gun city. It has sort of weird arcane design

1313
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:22,460
It doesn't look like it fits in with anything you saw in the Temple of Doom, Temple of the

1314
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:25,160
Penguin of Doom.

1315
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:30,760
You see it there for a moment, you see it flash a brief bright red, and then you see

1316
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,480
it vanish.

1317
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,640
Erm Mario much?

1318
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:39,640
But you get your money.

1319
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,280
I say erm Mario much.

1320
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:46,240
I laugh and laugh.

1321
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:52,560
That's the joke that I say whenever I see anything red.

1322
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,240
Even though I'm not seeing this at all and I'm in a completely different thing, something

1323
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:02,400
takes me over and makes me laugh just a little bit to myself.

1324
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:05,400
I try to punch it up by saying "erm Elmo much"

1325
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,640
I stop laughing too.

1326
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,280
I suddenly stop laughing.

1327
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,720
An eerie air rolls over my neck.

1328
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,720
Yeah, then I say I'm just kidding.

1329
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,720
You got the money.

1330
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,220
OK.

1331
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,160
You know what the gang now?

1332
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,600
Uh, yeah, I'll just walk upstairs to tell them.

1333
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,200
You know, I'm going to follow.

1334
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,540
Yeah, security is down.

1335
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,100
Very good.

1336
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,440
I'm also just shooting my guns indiscriminately at the ceiling and shit.

1337
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,040
The gang people.

1338
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,580
Hey, you guys make it to the lobby.

1339
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:44,580
You have the money.

1340
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:46,580
Um, you can go.

1341
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:54,980
Okay, I- in front of everybody I transform back from green Stephen A. Smith into myself.

1342
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,980
In front- in full view of every employee.

1343
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:09,480
Everyone gasps. Uh, the second you do that, still in the building, after there is security footage of you going in as Stephen A. Smith and now leaving the place as Blotas,

1344
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:14,480
There is a security warning now.

1345
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,480
Don't worry guys.

1346
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:20,480
Looks like they're just letting us off with a warning.

1347
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:35,480
And you see a massive, massive robot sort of break through the back area of the lobby and sort of confront you guys.

1348
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,480
I need you all roll initiative.

1349
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,480
Whoa.

1350
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,480
Fuck.

1351
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,480
I'm in the pipes.

1352
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,480
I'm in the damn pipes.

1353
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,480
What the fuck?

1354
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,480
You fall through the pipes.

1355
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,480
You fall through the pipes.

1356
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,480
Yeah.

1357
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,480
Yeah.

1358
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,480
And you say ow, ow, ow.

1359
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,480
You say owie, owie, owie.

1360
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,480
God.

1361
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,480
Yeah, no, I can't control this.

1362
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,480
That's out of my-

1363
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,480
And I see you and I go, "Oh, you smell like pussy fly."

1364
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,480
I started licking him.

1365
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,480
I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom."

1366
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,480
I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom."

1367
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,480
I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom."

1368
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,480
I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom."

1369
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:12,200
fly I started licking him cool okay let's see we got here oh okay cool let's see

1370
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,840
what we got here

1371
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:30,920
it cool sick ass that showing up in the audio you know what you're talking off

1372
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:37,200

1373
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:48,600
farting pep now okay yep okay Travis it much you're up first this is a massive

1374
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,880

1375
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,880
ok.

1376
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,400
it is ready for you.

1377
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,400
it is pissed that you woke it up.

1378
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,840
it looks like all your dads.

1379
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,280
whatever that is for you.

1380
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,280
ok.

1381
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,600
i'm gonna kill you ok?

1382
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,360
i say everything's fine.

1383
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:12,920
i mean it's not it's unconvinced.

1384
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,040
it's unconvinced.

1385
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,040
wow.

1386
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,320
try again.

1387
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,320
I mean it. Everything's okay.

1388
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,040
Damn. Okay. I shoot it maybe with a gun or

1389
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:31,120
Yeah, absolutely. Give that a shot. All right. Well, keep in

1390
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,160
mind, I get it. Give it a shirt. We're gonna be doing half

1391
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:37,580
damage, right? Only one. Your Travis chimp arm is going to

1392
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:42,480
crazy mode. Okay, then I roll for damage. Okay, so you only do

1393
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:47,480
four damage here. It pings off of the robot and you seem like

1394
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:59,840
it

1395
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:17,840
the

1396
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,100
(laughter)

1397
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,160
- Can the robot also fly?

1398
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,420
(laughter)

1399
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:31,320
- Can I try to teleport inside of the robot?

1400
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,120
- So funny little motherfucker.

1401
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:38,920
- Does it, 'cause I know it's like a mind control thing.

1402
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,320
- Yeah, it's not really inside.

1403
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,000
- Or, is there maybe a vent or something

1404
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,760
that I can see inside so I can physically teleport

1405
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:54,640
just inside of the robot's body and try and fight it from the inside.

1406
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,120
Not really, it's sort of just like a compact.

1407
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,880
Not even in the bullet hole?

1408
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:00,880
In the bullet hole?

1409
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,600
It wasn't like a bullet hole, it was like a slight indent, yeah.

1410
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,480
Ok, I'm gonna attack that.

1411
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,400
What's an area that I could attack that would make a hole?

1412
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,320
Oh yeah?

1413
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,800
Oh yeah, uh, let's have you do insight.

1414
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,720
Let's have you do insight.

1415
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,600
See what you can sort of assess from this guy.

1416
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,600
17.

1417
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,600
17?

1418
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
Fuck yeah dude.

1419
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,760
Um, yeah, I mean the Don't Wake Daddy bot, you can see that the eyes, the pupil, the

1420
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:35,800
material around the pupil, where the pupil would be, is not as, um, like, robust as the

1421
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,320
rest of the material.

1422
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,600
Like that was clearly at some point meant to either be like, commanded by somebody and

1423
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:48,640
they were meant to see out of that or something like that. It's not as robust though.

1424
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:54,600
Okay, I'm going to shoot my Grinch gun at that eye area.

1425
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,120
Go for it. And I have advantage because it's my first

1426
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,640
turn and he hasn't gone yet. That's true.

1427
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:05,560
Oh, why is this not working? Oh, here we go. I don't know. I'm not in charge of that.

1428
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,560
Alright. Alright.

1429
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:12,040
Okay, it's a 30-20. Both of those hit. It's got pretty low AC.

1430
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,040
I think it's double damage for critical hit, right?

1431
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,040
Yes, it is.

1432
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,440
I mean, like, typically we do two rolls, but I like double damage better.

1433
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,340
It's just simpler.

1434
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,440
Oh, okay.

1435
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,840
That's fine with me.

1436
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,840
I mean, I went ahead and did four total rolls.

1437
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,840
Yeah, I know I did that.

1438
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,440
Oh, I see what you did. Okay, yeah.

1439
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,440
That's fine. That makes more sense anyway.

1440
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,440
Yeah, so I mean, it's good. A shit ton of damage.

1441
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,640
21 damage? Yeah, you're able to, like, um, like...

1442
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,440
If you're concentrating that on that pupil,

1443
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,540
*imitates drum roll*

1444
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:40,840
with that intent,

1445
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,900
It's like ding ding ding ding and it like shatters, you know,

1446
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,040
after like the fourth bullet hits it.

1447
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,540
So, yeah, so it's sort of like hasn't.

1448
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:52,240
Cool.

1449
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,340
What kind of action is my teleportation?

1450
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,020
Is it a.

1451
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,920
Oh, that's a good question.

1452
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,620
I remember if it's a bonus action or I know I'll just wait until the next turn.

1453
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:01,180
Whatever.

1454
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,020
Well, hold on.

1455
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:05,160
Let's find out together.

1456
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,020
Let's find out.

1457
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:08,400
Do they're in there as my action?

1458
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,900
Yeah, you can certainly try.

1459
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:12,400
He gets in there before me, I'm going to throw a fit.

1460
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,900
I get really small.

1461
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,700
I just sit there.

1462
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:22,000
I'm I'm beginning to become into a puddle to stay there.

1463
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,600
Where's your teleport?

1464
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,600
You have 30 feet.

1465
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,300
I think it was a bonus action before but I know you took a lot

1466
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:30,500
of it.

1467
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,100
I did nerf a lot of stuff from it.

1468
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,400
But if it was a bonus action before and I didn't nerf that.

1469
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,500
No, it doesn't look like I nerfed that.

1470
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,900
So I can't really I can't make a claim.

1471
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,740
OK, I go inside the robots body.

1472
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:42,900
God damn it.

1473
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,980
Alright, I mean it's just Misty

1474
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:46,140
step anyway at that point,

1475
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,040
so that's kind of fine.

1476
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,440
I can't really.

1477
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,540
Take any blame I can't.

1478
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:53,320
You know, we'll take blame.

1479
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:54,380
I mean, that's what I mean.

1480
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,780
Actually, yes.

1481
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:58,160
Cool, yeah, you find your way

1482
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,880
inside of the eyeball of the bot,

1483
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,500
so you're sort of like

1484
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,920
curled up inside of there.

1485
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,000
I'm smoking a cigar.

1486
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,500
Cool.

1487
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:18,880
the

1488
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:25,280
It doesn't have like cells the same way that organic material does, so it might not work.

1489
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:29,880
Well, I guess I'll just use my mines.

1490
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,880
You can use your magnet mines.

1491
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,480
Yeah, I'm going to try to use my mines and throw them inside of the robot so maybe it

1492
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:38,480
also hits.

1493
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,560
Whoa, whoa, what's this about?

1494
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,920
So you have multiple kinds of mines.

1495
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:49,440
You have bomb, you have clown gas, you have EMP, and you have charm bomb.

1496
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,440
Can I only throw one kind of mine?

1497
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:01,040
No, so you have three magnet mines, you can use as many of them as you want in action,

1498
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,200
but you just like only have three per long rest.

1499
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,400
If you want to use all three mines though in one action, you can.

1500
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,680
I want to use two mines.

1501
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,840
I want to use an EMP to maybe immobilize it and a clown gas to make blowtuffs laugh in

1502
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,840
the robot.

1503
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:22,840
So for the EMP mines, it can work on simple security measures or robots, cyborgs, hard to work on more robust systems and computers.

1504
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:33,840
I would say this falls under the more robust systems and computers, but if you use more than one, if you just use two for EMP and both of those connect, then you can do it.

1505
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,840
Alright, I'll do two EMPs then.

1506
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:47,720
the

1507
01:28:47,720 --> 01:29:03,600
is

1508
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,800
seconds and that's and that's awesome that they are they're actually

1509
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:20,480
differently abled is what we say right sorry yes yeah I mean Jimmy tried to run

1510
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:27,540
away from a pussy fly in six seconds and those things are fast I think they get

1511
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:37,800
up there. I will run. Yeah. I'm still, I'm inside it. You can run too. I'm just gonna

1512
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:45,160
leave you, I'm just gonna leave you. I mean at this point, combat is over. It's disabled

1513
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:52,300
for 18 seconds. So what you guys want to do is walk up to the robot. Walk up to the robot.

1514
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,300
Connor you look like me father.

1515
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:59,300
Can we all leave and just leave Patrick here?

1516
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,300
I will gladly leave Patrick to die.

1517
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:03,300
Is there any buttons inside the robot's head?

1518
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,300
No, nothing like discernible. It's like wiring, you know.

1519
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:13,300
Is there a red wire or a green wire?

1520
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:16,300
Yeah, there are wires of different colors.

1521
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:19,300
I think I see what you're asking, but like, I mean it's not like...

1522
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:24,720
It means only so the wire the wires are visible right now to me to him to you

1523
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,340
Oh, sure British had s up and get out of here. You'll okay. I

1524
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:34,440
Climbed down the road down the robots throat into its stomach and I get pooped out

1525
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:42,700
There he is boat also you do it down then I run away you guys sprint out of there Sullivan

1526
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:49,220
Yeah, you guys are running out of there Sullivan's in the car he's like do to do do to do

1527
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:54,980
Listen in music. What's your listening to? What's your listen to? He's listening the xxx contassion

1528
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:59,900
Whoa, kick him away digging your pants. Yeah

1529
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:06,080
I'm driving the car away. Mm-hmm. It's slow ride

1530
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:16,500
You guys get away you guys get away with it, um

1531
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,500
Yeah, you know we all of it

1532
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,960
No, you have to go with the hiding

1533
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:30,320
Because you were very much identified by the end we drive back and we drop Travis at the

1534
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:38,960
Yeah, he did it and he's also a sex pervert

1535
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:44,680
We were Joe we were in there trying to stop him from doing horrible sex crimes to everyone in there

1536
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:50,060
That's the only reason we were on the security footage he's my evil twin

1537
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:59,820
Yeah, I mean you guys got your money back I think it's officially cannon Lee revealed that he is my evil twin

1538
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:09,300
So we did it you got the money split it five ways between the guys and

1539
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:14,180
Then get any since it was all my fault. They said and we went our separate ways

1540
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:20,260
Travis traveled back to earth. So we said and he may have slipped back in the espionage

1541
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:25,980
It's hard to know what that guy but in any case he said he's gonna use his share to rebuild his chimp

1542
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:29,360
I'm Empire. He completely destroyed before hanging out with us

1543
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:35,660
But all the chimps would have one human arm and they would each have their own golden gun. So it's pretty scary

1544
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:40,600
Barry Gee decided to use his share to actually pay off the Scarface house

1545
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:45,560
he pretended to live in, and he started a new podcast called The Mental Heist, stealing

1546
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,560
from the mind to give to your wallet.

1547
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,120
The three guys each headed into retirement.

1548
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,360
It was, after all, their last job.

1549
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,960
With a kid in college, I'm sure Blowtoss and Ray have their hands full.

1550
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:03,720
And with all the debt following Patrick Yoda around, he always got me something to do for

1551
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,440
him.

1552
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,560
But me, I'm doing okay.

1553
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:13,080
It was fun getting the crew together and it felt even better to pull off the heist.

1554
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:17,320
Though I do wonder what Mommy Goodlegs wanted to talk to the guys about.

1555
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:20,520
Nah, it's probably nothing.

1556
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,520
It's never anything really.

1557
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,600
There's never nothing that really ever goes on for us.

1558
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,400
I'm pretty sure it's nothing out of this world.

1559
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,400
.
