33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,640

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,800
Bushwick with a toilet seat in your hands it's like the most embarrassing

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,200
thing I've ever had to go through really every single person was everyone trying

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,940
I mean people are laughing at me. Yeah, people made me wear it on my head and they could shit in my mouth

It's already in my mouth you're just wiping the shit that's already in my mouth back on your ass

39
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,160
It's like if you use the water from the toilet to wipe your butt, I guess

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,920
So basically, yeah, well Caleb's tongues a bidet basically, but well I can't gleek yeah, I can't

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,540
Just a bidet takes the poop water

42
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,260
It's I don't think it does it's English

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,080
That would be crazy if it did that. Oh, it's you can't you can't pee and then use a bidet cuz it'll just shoot people

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,320
Fucking shit and use a bidet. It'll put shit water. No, I mean any water is not directly touching the poop is clean

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,480
I mean, you could drink it.

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
That's not true.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,120
I mean, that's what, it comes from the pipes.

49
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,960
I don't know.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
Poop literally dissolves.

51
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,100
It's literally the same pipes as your kitchen faucet.

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,720
So there's no reason you shouldn't be able to strain out.

53
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
When I turn on my faucet,

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,240
if I'm not seeing like some unidentified sludge,

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,800
then I'm like, something's going on with my plumbing.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
Something's wrong here.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,320
That's the water in New York, baby.

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
Oh yeah.

59
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,280
Oh yeah.

60
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
I mean, New York water.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,080
New York water is good, baby.

62
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,680
What's better than this water?

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,860
You know?

64
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,620
Oh, it tastes so nothing.

65
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,060
Oh my God, it's so good.

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,260
Well, you know, I was raised on New York water

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,520
and because of that, that's why I'm so tall for Italians.

68
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,940
Yeah, true, yeah.

69
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,760
I do forget how tall you are.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,700
Most Italians stop at like four or five

71
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,160
and I made it up to four nine and that's New York water,

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,340
baby, that's that extra four inches, those nutrients.

73
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,460
Yeah, it's got all the, it's basically vitamin water.

74
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,380
That's what 50 Cent likes, vitamin water.

75
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,040
When you said four nine for a second,

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,640
like oh is he really four nine wait

77
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,280
it's like anybody get to anybody's under six feet if they tell you they're any

78
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,680
height oh yeah I have no I have no metric for any height that's shorter than six

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,200

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,480

81
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,800
dude I love being the noble tall guy - who doesn't lie about his height cuz a

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,040
lot of tall guys who will be like 6'2" and try and tell you they're 6'4", not me.

83
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,920
And I stare him down and I say, "Listen pal, you better stop lying or

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm gonna come over there and I'm gonna stand next to you."

85
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,520
Why would you even start lying?

86
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm gonna stand next to you and I'm gonna say, "I'm 5 feet tall! I'm only 5 feet tall!"

87
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
Yeah, you don't know that us short guys are always lying about how we're

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,280
always like, "Oh, I'm actually 5'3" when you're really 5'5". We're always just trying to...

89
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:25,920
why would you lie only four feet tall that means I can't be in trouble I'm only

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
It's so weird.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
You know?

100
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Yeah.

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
You're in the end zone and you're doing the worm with your dick out.

103
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Yeah.

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Just fucking just be.

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Well, no, you're in the wrong end zone doing it.

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
I mean, it's completely, you don't even have to be, you shouldn't be doing the, you know?

107
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
I don't know what I'm saying.

108
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah, you don't know football at all, it sounds like.

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Yeah.

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
No, I think my brain just short-circuited there for a second.

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I was about to explain myself and I was like, I have no idea what I'm about to say.

112
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
No, you don't get it, man.

113
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
You're like dancing on the field goal.

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
I don't even get it.

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah.

116
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,440
Did either of you ever play like junior sports?

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
Like football and shit?

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,800
I was forced to play basketball by my mom for a little bit.

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,840
Oh my God, I bet you were so shy.

120
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,160
I was, dude, yeah.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,520
I did not talk to anybody else on the team.

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,360
Yeah.

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
But you could dunk on 'em.

124
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
Yeah.

125
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
I couldn't.

126
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,940
You could dunk, dude.

127
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,780
No.

128
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,720
Honestly, Cam, if you gave me three months of your time

129
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,560
and $30,000, I could teach you how to dunk.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm only four feet tall.

131
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
No.

132
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:56,060
gonna work on me. I'm not even allowed on a basketball field. My height that I tell

133
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,200
people has gone down about an inch every two years since I got a license. Yeah.

134
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,840
Yeah it's like it's slowly you know I went from like when I first got a

135
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,600
license because they didn't even measure me at the thing so I just told him I was

136
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,120
like 5'11" so that if anybody's like "how tall are you?" it's like it says right here 5'11" so

137
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,920
yeah and then every year it's just been like all right I'm 5'10" I'm 5'10" fuck I'm 5'8"

138
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,320
fuck me dude. It's a horrible height to be dude. Yeah you're not even you can't even like walk

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,640
around being like I'm 5'7". Yeah yeah I can't brag about being 5'7". I walk around I walk around my

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,960
house and I'm just going "hey everybody just try to measure me!" I had a friend who was the same

141
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,000
height as me and he would always tell people he was like yeah I'm like about

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,040
six feet tall and I was like no you're not and then one night I like I just

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,240
measured him I was like you can't leave my house until I measure you and he was

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,580
five nine on the fucking dot it is so fun even just like not even being tall

145
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,760
but it's lying in general about your height is very funny it's the most

146
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:04,160
easily like yes just immediately apparent yeah it's not like the dick

147
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,380
size we're like nobody's really gonna see your penis you know. Yeah, it's like no one

148
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:16,020
will ever see your penis. I actually have red eyes. Yeah, yeah, yeah so I'm pretty cool for that.

149
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:23,360
Yeah me walking around, "Do you guys like my dreadlocks? Should I cut them? Are they offensive? What do you think of these?"

150
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,780
Yeah my favorite thing is that that they lie about NBA players heights like all

151
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,340
the time. So there will be like a guy, there's always some, every year there's

152
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,420
some fucking kid in the draft who's from like either Zambia or like Eastern

153
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,460
Europe and they'll be and he's big he's probably seven feet tall but then all

154
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,540
the scouting reports would be like like day after day it'll be like one day it's

155
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,380
like he's reportedly 7'2" and then the next day I'll be like he's growing at a

156
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,820
rapid rate he's approaching 7'5" now and then by the time he's in the draft

157
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,420
they're like he's eight feet tall and then they measure him at the combine and

158
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,460
he's 6'10" yeah everybody's like what the fuck is like I just don't get it man

159
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:09,920
Yeah, well, they didn't bring the rulers actually came from America. So Columbus found tomatoes and yeah rulers

160
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,860
And he brought the tomatoes to Italy and rulers to a couple other places, but not everyone got it. It's what happened. Yeah

161
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,960
What do you guys who you guys think is winning this this year football game today?

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,660
One can be one we on England. I'm on England or we on Italy. What's up?

163
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,380
Probably the damn advertisers and the owners of everything.

164
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,620
That's a really good point.

165
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,580
That's a really good point that they should have me on ESPN almost every day as an analyst

166
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,580
to make that point.

167
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,220
Yeah, by my analysis the ads here are totally vapid.

168
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,180
Yeah, Stephen A. Smith would be like, "So Caleb, who do you think is winning the Super

169
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Bowl this year?"

170
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,140
I'd be like, "Probably Doritos."

171
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,100
Probably Doritos and probably GoDaddy.

172
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,620
Yeah, we have our Marshall McLuhan representative here.

173
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,980
Disney Corporation I think. Yeah, probably, probably, um, yeah Mickey damn Mouse is

174
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,440
gonna be making a killing today if you ask me. Yeah, probably, uh, you might make a

175
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,260
touchdown too. Probably Acme. Honestly, like, Acme is probably gonna, probably gonna take it

176
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,900
this year because of all the advertisements and the products they have. Probably Pfizer!

177
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,740
- Kaiser.

178
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,580
- Yep.

179
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,400
(laughing)

180
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
- That's right.

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
(laughing)

182
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,920
- Yeah.

183
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,740
(laughing)

184
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,580
- That's the end of the interview.

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,540
- Yeah, this is immediately cut.

186
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,380
(laughing)

187
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,380
- I don't know, Raytheon.

188
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,220
(laughing)

189
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,040
- Edgebox, something like that.

190
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,880
- I'm gonna go with corporation.

191
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,120
- Check out my podcast.

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,620
- Probably the Chum Bucket.

193
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
- Yeah.

194
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,460
- Probably plastered the airway this year.

195
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,300
- Like Doug Dimmadome, that guy.

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,140
- He was rich.

197
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,460
(laughing)

198
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,980
I wanna get like an ESPN show so bad

199
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,820
'cause every year they're like--

200
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah, that would be sick.

201
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,580
They're less and less about sports, you know?

202
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,460
Like there's that one with Dan Lebitard

203
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,840
who he just has like his old dad on there.

204
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Dan.

205
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,740
His like old Cuban dad.

206
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,620
Lebitard.

207
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,100
Yeah, Dan Lebitard.

208
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
No worries, Sarah.

209
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,860
So he just has, he'll be like,

210
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,060
he'll be like watching some clip and he'll be like,

211
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,700
and here comes, you know, the fucking quarterback,

212
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,560
he's throwing a beautiful thing

213
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
and it's right in the end zone, wow, what a play,

214
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,220
and then his dad will just like wake up and be like,

215
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,220
touchdown, yeah, touchdown, another touchdown.

216
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,680
- What would our ESPN show be?

217
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Probably something political, right?

218
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,120
- I mean, it would have to be basically like,

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,520
I mean, I'm all about the intersection

220
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
of sports and politics, you know?

221
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,100
- Well, basically, yeah, today the two teams

222
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,240
are a little bit like the Democrats and Republicans

223
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,200
in that I hope neither of them win.

224
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,040
- That's right.

225
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,280
(laughing)

226
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:53,560
some smarmy Bill Maher's the Bill Maher presents podcast about lists yeah yeah

227
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,520
just like you know like Lakers versus the Bulls well whoever wins we fucking lose

228
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,440
tell you that much you know who wins somehow yeah somehow like losing an

229
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,200
insane amount of money despite like saying like I like hating politics in

230
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:20,020
sports like yeah that's the best dude I wish it I could be a pro athlete just so

231
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,600
I could just focus on dribbling the ball and not have to care about all this

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,240
politics stuff that I'm super smart about you know yeah it's really true

233
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,640
just be easier you know why can't they have that that standard for comedians

234
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,360
and podcasters you know why do we have to care about politics why can't we just

235
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Like, nobody wants LeBron to say anything

236
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,560
about the president, but like,

237
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,680
I mean, everybody's asking me, dude.

238
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,520
Yeah, dude.

239
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,340
Yeah, they're asking me to condemn--

240
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,180
We're getting asked every day.

241
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,000
It's starting again.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,120
They're asking me to condemn the president,

243
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,720
they're asking me to condemn the mayor of every town.

244
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
Yeah.

245
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,040
It's like, did you guys get that?

246
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,920
There was a, did you guys get that?

247
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,480
There was like a DM that was going around

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,480
to like all big, to whatever my size account is,

249
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:07,000
asking you if you think Joe Biden's nice with it or not, and it was really, really funny.

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,880
I was getting very upset about that.

251
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
That's really funny.

252
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Yeah.

253
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,180
I get people sending me pictures of like babies and ugly people and being like, "This is you,

254
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
I think."

255
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Yeah, showing off.

256
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
Cool, man.

257
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,180
Oh, that me?

258
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,180
Oh, okay.

259
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
That's you, Tommy Pickles.

260
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Oh, that's cool.

261
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Oh, yeah.

262
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:30,820
Oh, yeah, I mean that's that's pretty much what the the human brain evolved pattern recognition for is to see a bald guy and then

263
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah

264
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,760
Yeah, I was looking for your barcode when I first met you brother. I was like is this that it's just a hit man

265
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,100
I've been I've been approaching a brand new level of bald. I met you when you had hair. Yeah, actually doesn't count

266
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,060
It doesn't count. I've been approaching a new level of bald where the other day on my youtube recommendations. I got I got a

267
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,380
a channel called bald brotherhood.

268
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,020
It was like, it's like a channel that's just full of guys talking about how beast it is

269
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
to be bald.

270
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,660
Can I tell you what, there is a bald brotherhood already and you do not.

271
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
Folks.

272
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,300
There's a bald brotherhood in, yeah, in prison.

273
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
There's a big bald brotherhood.

274
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,180
There's a bald white brotherhood.

275
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
I guess that makes sense.

276
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,260
A lot of it was about sneaking cigarettes and cell phones into your, into your bunk.

277
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,400
That is not just a Nazi thing, believe it or not.

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,540
People love sneaking cigarettes.

279
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,860
It's not even a prison thing.

280
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
I like smoking cigarettes.

281
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,340
Yeah, I guess you're right.

282
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:33,980
I think if I was in jail, I would like to become like an Elder Scrolls-style traitor, because

283
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,020
they apparently have those somewhere.

284
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,140
There's a guy who's giving out fucking Samsung Galaxies to people.

285
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,220
Oh, wow, that would be fun to do like a barter, to be like a-

286
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
What's that word?

287
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
Yeah.

288
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
Yeah.

289
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,180
I would want to be like a quest giver who helps you subclass.

290
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Yeah.

291
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,180
Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,360
for any of the gangs or anything but just for like being like a spellblade or

293
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,080
something why haven't they done a prison RPG that's such a fucking

294
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:14,040
their character creator is nice the cast part was fine but then the race is a

295
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,320
little iffy yeah well they yeah the main the main quest to break out of prison

296
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,640
was okay but all the side quests of choose your faction got yeah I see that's not

297
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,520
great yeah but you can be that'd be fucking awesome you like Mass Effect in

298
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,940
jail you know effect I mean they can do it like in space so it's not racist it's

299
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,840
different aliens maybe oh yeah that's our spaceships and George Lucas already

300
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,000
did that with different aliens making them different races yeah you already

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,280
have those guys he already said the precedent yeah so we can do it I don't

302
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,960
I'm not planning on going to jail, but I'd like to like, I don't know, kind of know what it's like.

303
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:57,480
Yeah, yeah, I'm not planning on going to jail, but I'd love like a VR sort of experience.

304
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,400
Right, a VR experience that is fully immersive. I can't take off until my sentence is up.

305
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,520
Yeah, right. Yeah.

306
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,280
I've only ever seen Orange is the New Black as far as like jail media goes.

307
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,400
Yeah.

308
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,360
You haven't seen Shelf Tank?

309
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,640
It'd be pretty disappointing to go to prison and be like,

310
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,480
Where are all the fucking hot chicks dude? What the hell is this?

311
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,560
Supposed to be scissoring right now. Yeah, I've never seen Shawshank. You ever seen Shawshank? No.

312
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,000
I think I would do really well in one of those jails from like the old west where it's just one cell and I get

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,780
To hang out with the shadows through the bars and maybe like play poker with them or something

314
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,760
Oh, I would I would trick him so fast. Getting locked up in one of those jails and still joining the Aryan Brotherhood.

315
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,820
You just see like a chalk outline of a guy and you just some people are just yeah like way too eager like

316
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,380
Like a cell and the drunk tank for a night

317
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:06,720
It comes with the jail now, there's just an Aryan Brotherhood member whenever there someone's putting up a new private prison

318
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Caleb getting pulled over for a speeding ticket and just immediately trying to

319
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,520
tattoo himself the second he sees the cop car.

320
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Have you heard the bad news today?

321
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah I want to go I think if I ever commit a seriously horrible crime I will

322
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,880
probably do it in Sweden or some Scandinavian country where you go to jail

323
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,680
for 30 days for mass murder. They literally just they're already white

324
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,320
like white brother white you know white brotherhood they're already skinheads

325
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,960
in Scandinavia so you don't have to worry about that - yeah but also they get like

326
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,400
3d TVs in their cells and shit yeah and they can like yeah it's fucking it's

327
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,360
honestly like way better than my life just being like yeah no I'm guessing I'm

328
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,080
actually performing I'm changing in here you're just like watching like Bobby Flay

329
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,080
yeah that's like literally what it is dude they just like go just like you

330
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,040
have been sentenced to camp and you go to camp and they give you a they give you a

331
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,040
two-page IKEA instruction set this is a guy like holding a knife with a frowny

332
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,400
face

333
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:33,600
turn a toothbrush into a shiv just step by step a little stick guy you have bunk

334
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,480
bunk mates and there's a big celebration at the end

335
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,120
and there's games, yeah.

336
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,060
- It's really beautiful, dude.

337
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,440
I wish that we had that here, but I don't know.

338
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,560
If I ever want to kill my wife,

339
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,220
we'll be taking a vacation to Sweden for sure.

340
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,060
- Yes!

341
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,020
- If I would probably do a big crime in space

342
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,840
'cause then if they want to put me in jail,

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,600
I get to stay in space for a while.

344
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,760
It'd be pretty cool.

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
Maybe I'd like--

346
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,800
- That's a good point.

347
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,960
- Age slower or something, something like that,

348
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,400
so I'd come back and, or something like that

349
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,740
could happen with the time scale.

350
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
- Is it true that if you do a crime

351
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,760
in international waters it just doesn't matter at all?

352
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,480
- Yeah, every comedy movie I've seen

353
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,000
has made that point, honestly.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,040
I have to think it's true.

355
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,200
- That just means that if anybody ever was like,

356
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,560
hey man, do you wanna randomly go

357
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
to international waters today?

358
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,760
Just you and me?

359
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
I'd be like, fuck no, dude, what are we doing?

360
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,440
- Yeah, what are we gonna have sex?

361
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,280
- International waters?

362
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
- No way.

363
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,320
- Fuck no.

364
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,120
- Yeah, I don't know where I would do my big crime.

365
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
I think I'd have to do it in my hometown

366
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
'cause then I could be like, you know--

367
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,840
A hero. Yeah, a hero.

368
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah.

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,760
I would do my patches big crime.

370
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,680
And I mean, just to be clear for Ed,

371
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,840
the big crime we're referring to,

372
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,320
it's all shoplifting based,

373
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,920
there's no violence involved.

374
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
No, not mine.

375
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,200
It's like public defecation.

376
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

377
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,360
Saying a bad word too loud

378
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,240
could be a really big crime that we're working on.

379
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,640
There's nothing else, nothing else is going on here.

380
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
I'd probably be like a bomb.

381
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
[Laughter]

382
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
You can't say that.

383
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
He's saying if he were.

384
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
I'm saying if I was a criminal.

385
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
If he was a criminal, which he's not.

386
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
I don't even know where to start with a bomb.

387
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,640
It's like a battery, right?

388
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
You gotta go to the bomb store.

389
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,640
What explodes in a bomb? All I see is fucking wires and screens.

390
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
That just sounds like a fucking Gameboy to me.

391
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
I don't know how to make that into a bomb.

392
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
There's still a pending lawsuit in Nintendo for that reason.

393
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Yeah, absolutely.

394
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,200
Um, yeah, I don't know what makes up a bomb.

395
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,400
I think it's gotta be, I remember when I was in like elementary school,

396
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,880
this kid I hung out with, who I know now, and he's not, he's not this person he was.

397
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,560
But like the first time we hung out, he was like, dude, let me show you how to make a bomb.

398
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,040
And this is like the first time we hung out and he was showing me like-

399
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,200
Was it a water bottle bomb?

400
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,400
I don't know what it was.

401
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,440
He didn't make it.

402
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,200
He just was like, yeah.

403
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,080
So what you got to do is scrape the like dust off of the windows of the car.

404
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,720
And that and I'm like I'm like are you playing pretend I was so confused

405
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,600
He made no sense one of the kids in my middle school like

406
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,720
Blew up like the like insides of a toilet because he put a one of those like Drano bombs in there

407
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
He like in a water bottle. He just makes Drano and aluminum foil at fucking school

408
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
And yeah, and he got suspended for like one day

409
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,140
Yeah, that's pretty fucked. I mean it's like yeah, I think you should go to jail probably

410
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,540
I think he's probably in jail now most of those people are everybody who I went to middle school

411
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:38,920
It's either dead in jail or military. That's a that's a pretty those are those are the three ways that that school went. Yeah

412
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,560
yeah, I

413
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,320
there was a

414
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,480
gun scare in my school when I was in middle school and we had to like just stay in one room for like

415
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:56,240
Just fucking hours and it was because some like twerp saw like a brown plastic bag in like yeah

416
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,700
exchanged and it was very clearly just like

417
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,320
Like ditch weed like just being exchanged

418
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,080
That was always the best like the whole school locks down because there's a homeless guy with a broom three. Yeah, right

419
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,800
They're like it might be a secret. It might be a gun

420
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,720
He might be like one of those pimp games and this comes out of the might be inspector gadget

421
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:23,720
*laughter*

422
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Yeah, just like, Inspector Gadget has to be treated like a gun no matter where he goes.

423
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Yeah.

424
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
We don't know what's gonna come out of what part of this guy.

425
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah, I think we spotted Inspector Gadget, so just to be safe, we're locking down the entire school.

426
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,720
It is great that like, any middle school kid can learn that if you just like, write the word "bomb" on a sticky note,

427
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,560
You get to get out of classes for like the rest of the day and hang out outside. Yeah like that like it's

428
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,600
Yeah, I don't know if there's a good silly easy solution to that situation. Well, the solution is just don't who cares

429
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:04,860
It's literally just a school doesn't matter how many times like if you get exactly it's not like a TV station

430
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
Yeah, something that matters

431
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,140
If you get a call like from ISIS and you're like a principal at a school you just have to treat it like a prank

432
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,000
You have to be like, all right. Yeah, buddy. Go ahead

433
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,640
Cut my head off. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. See you in class later Roderick. Yeah. Yeah

434
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,920
Was always Roderick. Yeah

435
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,880
Bad kids name. Yeah, that's a naughty name Roderick Desmond. These are bad kids. Oh, it does be yeah for sure

436
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Jasmine is definitely a bad kid's name.

437
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Yep.

438
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Caleb.

439
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
Caleb for sure.

440
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Brundle.

441
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
Bad kid.

442
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Yeah, Brundle.

443
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Yeah, Brundle has no eyebrows.

444
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
Morgoth.

445
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Yeah, he was always up to trouble.

446
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Yeah, Durgan.

447
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah, Durgan for sure.

448
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Asmodeus.

449
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Asmodeus, you know when you meet a kid named Asmodeus, this kid's gonna be, he's gonna

450
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,880
be fucking smoking weed.

451
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Oh yeah, absolutely.

452
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
That's just what it is.

453
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,960
- The kids named Einstein were always total nerds too.

454
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,640
- No dude, it's so fucking annoying.

455
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,480
- Oh my God, dude.

456
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,360
Do you guys remember the first time you met a kid named Sadie

457
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,120
and did you know the Beatles song, "Sexy Sadie"

458
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,800
when you first met someone named Sadie?

459
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,440
- No, I liked-- - Did it make you feel bad?

460
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,680
- I liked T-Pain. - T-Pain?

461
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,200
- Yeah, yeah.

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
- You met a kid named T-Pain?

463
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
- No, I didn't like the Beatles.

464
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
The Beatles I thought were for babies.

465
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,600
- Oh, for old people?

466
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,440
Yeah, I liked you.

467
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,940
Now, if I had met a kid named Shoudy,

468
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
maybe I would have been like,

469
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,180
(laughing)

470
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,460
damn, what's up Shoudy from the T-Pain songs?

471
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,800
Yeah, that would be crazy.

472
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
Yeah.

473
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,460
Yeah.

474
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,300
I love that.

475
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,820
Who is this Shoudy that they're always talking about?

476
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,020
They all know someone named Shoudy?

477
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,620
That can't be a common name, right?

478
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,020
It's gotta be one Shoudy they all talking about.

479
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,420
I remember there were the whole T-Pain rehabilitation thing

480
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,660
that's been going on.

481
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,260
Not that like, that people were just like,

482
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,540
he was actually like a genius.

483
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,380
And-- Dude, yeah.

484
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,460
Yeah. It sucks.

485
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,060
They just like, just make it--

486
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,340
He doesn't have that good of a voice.

487
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,740
Just fucking auto-tune him.

488
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,620
Yeah. You know?

489
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,780
Just like put him and Pitbull on anything

490
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,620
and I'll listen to it.

491
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,180
I don't wanna hear him at a NPR tiny desk

492
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,060
singing Stomp-a-Songs, you know?

493
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,660
Like that's fucking, that sucks.

494
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,740
Yeah, I would listen to Pitbull do anything at all.

495
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,140
Yeah, Pitbull's a man.

496
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
He's so cool.

497
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,620
T-Pain also has become a Twitch streamer now.

498
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,620
Yeah, respect to that.

499
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,180
Where he plays like Warzone and shit, and people watch.

500
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,620
He doesn't even sing anymore, he's just a streamer.

501
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,300
I wish every song that Kanye did with Swizz Beatz instead had Pitbull.

502
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,820
'Cause I fucking hate hearing Swizz Beatz go, "Ehh, put your hands in the air, whoa!"

503
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
God damn it!

504
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
That thing.

505
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,820
God damn!

506
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
God damn it!

507
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:59,300
He's so fucking annoying, and I would love to hear Pitbull just go, "Dale!" and "Woo!"

508
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,020
Pitbull making Scooby Doo noises on every song, dude.

509
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,460
It fucking rules.

510
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,420
I love him, dude.

511
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,620
He just does shit like that.

512
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,900
You're like, I don't know if--

513
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,180
I don't want to be racist, but that is awesome.

514
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,620
Yeah, we don't really have that kind of guy anymore,

515
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
I feel like.

516
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,180
No.

517
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,900
Like a rapper who only does J-Lo songs and Imagine Dragons

518
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,420
features.

519
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,860
We don't have that guy anymore.

520
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,420
DJ Khaled's gone now.

521
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,780
Nobody cares about him.

522
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,140
True.

523
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,980
I saw him.

524
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:38,100
I went to the Overwatch finals at the Barclays Center a few years ago, which is one of the

525
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100
most...

526
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
I didn't even know...

527
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,700
One of my favorite things to have said on a podcast that people listen to.

528
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,740
But when I was there, it was just DJ Khaled was there.

529
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
At Overwatch finals?

530
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,020
Yeah, he played there and it was so funny because he's like, "Yo, what's up Overwatch fans?"

531
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,020
He doesn't know anything about it, clearly.

532
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,300
(laughing)

533
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,140
Yeah.

534
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,900
Just like, but like, when you're listening to him,

535
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,420
I would never have imagined seeing DJ Khaled live.

536
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,920
Like maybe at a music festival I would have seen him,

537
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,260
but I really don't think so.

538
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,700
But like, yeah, obviously he's an excellent DJ.

539
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,540
Like all the music was sick and like,

540
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,140
then like he starts doing his own stuff

541
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,620
and he's like just yelling over his own music.

542
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Like he really does do that.

543
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,640
Like I don't wanna be like a fucking retread

544
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,580
of like 2014 people complaining about DJ Khaled,

545
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,220
but it's really just like a good song

546
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,940
and him going, "Oh yeah, this is awesome!

547
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,900
We the best!"

548
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,420
And you're just like, "Come on, man."

549
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,460
- He probably thought Overwatch was a guy

550
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,820
and it was his birthday.

551
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,660
- Yeah. (laughs)

552
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,500
- And he was like,

553
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,060
"I'm going to do Overwatch's birthday party."

554
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,340
- At one point he said, "Happy quinceanera, Overwatch!"

555
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,540
(laughs)

556
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,060
- My favorite guy-- - "You're a beautiful girl!"

557
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,540
- My favorite guy since moving to New York is Funk Flex,

558
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,080
'cause the fucking aux cable in my car died,

559
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,060
so now I have to listen to Hot 97 all the time.

560
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
And he will play a song,

561
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,700
He'll play 30 seconds of a song that you like, and 25 seconds of it is him going

562
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
"Only in New York!"

563
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:05,660
And then dropping a bomb sound effect that like fades out slowly for the rest of the song.

564
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,940
And he'll play like, he'll play like, like Cascada.

565
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,340
It'll be like, every time we touch by Cascada, and the entire time he's like

566
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,700
"None of you motherfuckers know this! This is my shit! New York!"

567
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,180
This is, this is going to the bathroom!

568
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,700
This is riding the subway!

569
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
This is graffiti!

570
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,180
- Yeah.

571
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,620
- And you're just like, dude, this is like way better than any song.

572
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,820
Just put him on every song, dude.

573
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,100
- I was listening to the radio on the Uber today and, um,

574
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,180
and "Hot In Here" came on, which I hadn't heard in like a long time.

575
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,340
And it never really struck me how funny it is that like in the chorus,

576
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,780
he like does it, it's getting hot in here,

577
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,020
so take off all your clothes and then a girl's voice going like,

578
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,580
"It's so hot in here, I'm gonna take off my clothes!"

579
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,580
She says, "I am getting so hot, I'm gonna take my clothes off."

580
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
Yeah.

581
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,220
I don't, I, I, how I, how you would know besides almost everything else I say and do that I'm

582
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,700
a giant loser is that I first heard that song through Weird Al.

583
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,580
It's so rotten here.

584
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
That's like a newer one, right?

585
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
No, it was from Poodle Hat.

586
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,580
Back in the day.

587
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,340
Oh that's... Back in the day.

588
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,980
Damn, it's not even golden era Yankovic.

589
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,900
No, it's like bottom of the barrel, like, Yankovic just like trying to figure out

590
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,380
how do I stay relevant.

591
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,180
Oh yeah, that was when he dropped the glasses and grew out his hair.

592
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Yes.

593
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,380
And he looked like a dog.

594
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,940
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,540
Yeah, he looked like a golden retriever.

596
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,580
Yeah, that was great dude.

598
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,340
And he just started doing like just songs that nobody had even like really heard.

599
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,180
Yeah, well it's funny to like hear him do like songs from like 1983 on like an album that came out in

600
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,820
2007. Yeah, exactly. Like I know you really wanted to get around to to uh uh like Tainted Glove,

601
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,540
you know. I'm glad you made it to this one. I think it's just I think it got more and more

602
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,460
expensive to get the rights to do this parody. You should be able you should be able to pay

603
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,740
Weird Al to do a parody of your song. You should, yeah. Yeah. Wow. That would be great.

604
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,540
People trying to make it on SoundCloud or Bandcamp could like, you know, pay him some money.

605
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:17,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here's some like, like a Danish 13 year old is like,

606
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:25,900
yeah, so I sort of drone about fucking, fucking my teacher for an hour. Can you parody this somehow?

607
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,340
Yeah. Yeah. I feel bad for him now, man. He's doing like, he does like really old songs or

608
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:37,180
he'll do, he'll do like a parody of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme. And then it's like,

609
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,020
Just fucking just even just stick to start doing the oldies maybe yeah start hitting Elvis. Yeah

610
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,140
I think he'd kill that this guy Elvis is begging to be parodied. Yeah, absolutely

611
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:54,140
There's like a freak he died on the damn. He really does. He does look awful. He looks weird

612
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,340
He doesn't look weird as hell. He has a weird looking. I mean like beautiful for sure. I'd kiss him

613
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,140
Well the but it is funny that Elvis like

614
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,980
He dressed like that for years and years and women were like, "That's the most sexual guy who's ever lived."

615
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,480
Yeah.

616
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,180
Like, if I could fuck one person, I would fuck that magician right there.

617
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:24,180
Yeah, he looks like, he looks, yeah, I mean, he literally looks like, uh, like, uh, uh, like a Christian, like some sort of like Christian sweet boy.

618
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,680
Yeah.

619
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,880
And they put like, they put him in like, it's weird. I don't know how to describe it. It's like some sort of like angel.

620
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,520
He's dressed like a fucking ring bearer and like every woman in the 60s was like,

621
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:38,200
"I have to suck his cock." It's like, "Whatever, I'll give up anything to suck that guy's cock."

622
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Yeah. And they did.

623
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,760
And they did.

624
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,480
This guy Elvis, I mean, he went to jail. Should have stayed there, as far as I'm concerned.

625
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Yeah, he could have joined the Aryan Brotherhood also.

626
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,040
No, no. That's not what I'm saying.

627
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,400
They wouldn't do these. What he's got? He's got diamonds.

628
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I don't know if he was Italian. He was something wrong though. Let's find out.

629
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
What was Elvis?

630
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,400
He might have just been a white guy. No way to know really.

631
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,400
White guy, black comic. That was him.

632
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Chris D'Elia style.

633
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:21,400
German, Scottish, Scottish and French. Yeah, he's just some like European thing.

634
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
He's just some fucked up thing.

635
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,120
Dude, I hate Elvis! He's just some fucking thing.

636
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Weird thing.

637
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,480
He's like a weird thing as a round dancing.

638
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,460
I remember my grandma had, when I was growing up, she had like the newspaper from the day

639
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
that Elvis died.

640
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Okay.

641
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,680
And she was like, "Here, I'm gonna give this to you when I die because one day this will

642
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,480
be worth a lot of money."

643
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,800
And I was like, "I think that might be the most kept newspaper of all time."

644
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,160
I would guess there's 30 million other people who are doing this same thing.

645
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,120
This will never be worth any money to.

646
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Yeah.

647
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,200
She also kept beanie babies though, so maybe she wasn't the best judge of, yeah, yeah,

648
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,480
she kept beanie babies, kept the tags on, had them in like little cases and shit.

649
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,200
Wasn't there a thing about people making bank off that or no?

650
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,280
Or was that like just a thing people wanted to do?

651
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,600
In '96 maybe.

652
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,980
But like, well, beanie babies did the most genius thing ever, which is they would sell

653
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,180
the Beanie Babies for like 10, 15 bucks each or whatever and then in the catalog

654
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,980
they had a it would say under the Beanie Baby would say projected 20-year price

655
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,980
and then they would just make up a number. Did they really do that? Yeah, so you would like

656
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,300
look through the catalog of Beanie Babies and it would be like this one is $15

657
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:43,420
projected price in 20 years $20 million. What? Are you serious? Yeah, I had one when I was growing up.

658
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:49,100
I had Beanie Babies, I didn't know that they had a projected price. And people were so stupid that they would

659
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,420
They would just like buy,

660
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,660
they would be like, yeah, sure.

661
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,500
Wow. That's gonna be a

662
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,780
really solid investment. We should do that

663
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,380
with episodes of the show.

664
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,700
We should be like-- That would be a good idea.

665
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,260
We should project values.

666
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,140
Yeah. For these episodes.

667
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,860
Yeah. You're gonna wanna--

668
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,460
Yeah, so you'll wanna buy this Patreon,

669
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,500
'cause right now--

670
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,460
'Cause next month we're making it $1,000 a month.

671
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,300
(laughing)

672
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,120
Yeah, exactly.

673
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,100
That's gonna be really expensive.

674
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,380
I mean, you'll still have to pay that,

675
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,500
but you will get one month at the $5 price.

676
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,820
Yeah. Yeah.

677
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,260
Yeah, I guess there's no way to do that

678
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,560
with a subscription model.

679
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,500
- But I feel like there was so many scams like that

680
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,020
in the 90s that you just can't do anymore.

681
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,900
Nowadays, every scam I hear about is like Nexium,

682
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,700
like some fucking sex trafficking slave thing.

683
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,100
- Right, that's all that's left.

684
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,000
- What happened to the good old, just like, you know,

685
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,420
like Cutco, you know?

686
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,860
Like what happened to that shit?

687
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,820
- Well, 'cause sex trafficking is the only one

688
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,060
you can still get away with, I think,

689
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,260
'cause everyone loves it.

690
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,100
(laughing)

691
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,900
- It's the only one that they haven't cracked down on yet.

692
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,340
I guess that's true.

693
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Yeah, they crack down on beanie babies before cheating happens.

694
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Yeah, they're like, "Oh, you don't fuck 'em, do you?"

695
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,340
"No." "Alright, well, I guess we'll get rid of these."

696
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,340
"No."

697
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
How much sex trafficking do you think is actually happening?

698
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
A lot.

699
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,340
At least a thousand.

700
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
I think a lot.

701
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
I think a huge amount, probably.

702
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Yeah, I think a giant amount.

703
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Probably not.

704
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,340
I think a very large amount.

705
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
I think too much to fathom.

706
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
I'll play devil's advocate.

707
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Nah.

708
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Yeah.

709
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:17,240
Yeah, every time someone comes back from a Walmart. They're like I was I was so close to getting sex traffic there

710
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,640
well, I mean

711
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:17,760
Yeah

712
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
the one thing where they like see like yeah like a

713
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,480
Mexican man's like van that he uses to paint people's houses and there has to be a thousand I was here right now

714
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,320
He asked me for directions. I'm gonna get sex trafficked. Mm-hmm and always the people who are about that

715
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,920
But I'm also I'm sure that the amount that is actually going on would would make me would make me cry always

716
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Also the people, you're so emotional.

717
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,080
Make me happy cry.

718
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,880
Always when people say that story of like I was so close to getting sex trafficked you like kind of like look at them and you're

719
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
like, no you weren't.

720
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
[Laughter]

721
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
No, I don't think so.

722
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
No.

723
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Can he say that?

724
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,160
I don't think you're fetching a high price over there on that market at the Walmart kidnapping thing.

725
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,520
It's just true, man.

726
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Oh, come on, Cam.

727
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
I'm okay with that.

728
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Come on, Cam.

729
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Oh.

730
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Dude, I've been wanting to go to a fucking...

731
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I've been wanting to go to a theme park so badly.

732
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Dude, yes. I've not been to one in like...

733
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
I don't know that I've ever been to a...

734
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
A long time.

735
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
A theme park. What?

736
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Would you count that as different than an amusement park?

737
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
No. Shut up.

738
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I don't know. I've only been to...

739
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Canobie Lake Park and Story Land.

740
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,640
Yeah, those are both theme parks.

741
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,520
Yeah, the theme is stories in one,

742
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,160
and the theme is the lake in the other.

743
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,840
I've never been to like Six Flags or anything though.

744
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,800
Oh, the theme in that is Six Flags.

745
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,000
I've been wanting to go recently, so that--

746
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
There's like a few kinds of Six Flags.

747
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,760
The other day--

748
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,200
I don't think there's any Six Flags near me.

749
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh, yeah, I don't think so actually.

750
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,280
I actually don't know.

751
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,720
Great Adventure was near me,

752
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,120
so that was the one that people would go to.

753
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,320
The other day I looked at like how much

754
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,280
a five day trip to Disney World would cost.

755
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,320
Yeah, how much?

756
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,120
I looked at it, well I'm not gonna tell you

757
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,520
because of what I'm about to say.

758
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,660
I looked at it and I was like, that's a lot of money.

759
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,760
And then I looked at my bank account

760
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,960
and it was almost the exact amount of money I had.

761
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,220
(laughing)

762
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,000
And I was like--

763
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,600
Just like turning around slowly and seeing,

764
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,960
seeing if, like with Jana, it's just like,

765
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,240
she's like right behind you.

766
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,080
Yeah.

767
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,900
Just also.

768
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
Yeah, yeah.

769
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,360
Seeing you with, with your bank account

770
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,600
on one monitor zoomed in completely.

771
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,120
She gets some, she gets some ding on her phone

772
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,960
from like our shared bank account.

773
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,200
You are overdrafted $3.

774
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,680
You just text her like shipping spelled wrong.

775
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,320
Dude, I just think it would be...

776
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,640
She has parental locks on Caleb's computer that he can't view any price that's over $10.

777
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,920
It just doesn't work.

778
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,040
It blocks out that part of the page like ad block.

779
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,120
Yeah, she has a one digit password on every device I have and I can't figure it out.

780
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
It's really tough.

781
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,520
But dude, like, just like one adult trip to like Universal.

782
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,320
Yeah, I know.

783
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,840
It's so much fun, dude.

784
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm gonna go, dude. I'm gonna do it.

785
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,520
Because I've been, yeah, I feel like, I feel like there's,

786
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,920
I've reached a point in my life again where like, I would, I would have a really good time.

787
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,560
Yeah, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna get kicked out within 15 minutes for talking too hard to join the Sith.

788
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,240
No, no, no, I'm, I'm gonna, I will kill my master. I will kill him right now.

789
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,080
Why are you bringing Darth Vader here if you don't want to recruit people for the Sith?

790
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,480
That's all I'm fucking saying dude. Mm-hmm. I just would like I would just like I hate my parents I

828
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:43,420
got all wet and then he went into the hall of electricity yeah

829
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,920
That's why you always have to bring a change of clothes.

830
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I would wear a white suit and then I would just ride the haunted house like one over

831
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,680
and over again and then just keep like pissing myself just bright yellow all over my suit

832
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
and then walking out.

833
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,980
Change suits, change seats every time.

834
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Not that scary really.

835
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,980
It's really not that scary.

836
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,060
See I'm going to get back in line.

837
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,180
It's really not that scary.

838
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,260
More and more piss every time I come out of the fucking thing.

839
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Shit in my pants now.

840
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,220
It's really not that scary though.

841
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,280
I would bring like a dove and I would make it fly out as I was getting out of the roller

842
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
coaster.

843
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,260
So, it would look like I would like walk in slow motion.

844
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,260
I was getting out.

845
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
True.

846
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
It would be pretty cool.

847
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,020
I would try, I would go on the, every ride I go on, there's like a photo in it.

848
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,220
I'd be trying to get everybody to do the dab.

849
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,020
I'd be like, "Let's dab at the photo, guys."

850
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Yeah.

851
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Yeah, that'd be really cool.

852
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,220
Yeah, and then I'd make one of them buy it for me.

853
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,220
Like, "Hey, can I have $50?"

854
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Yeah.

855
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
"Wait, can you just get the..."

856
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,460
It was my idea so I shouldn't have to pay for it.

857
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,060
I think the world... so people... I think you should be allowed to show your balls and your

858
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,780
boobs or whatever on those cameras but when people go there and they get... they take like a sign that

859
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,700
has like a political message on it like... they'll have like a sign that says like...

860
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,380
Yeah, there should be an executive seat.

861
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:02,940
It says like "Free Hong Kong" at like the top of fucking the mountain machine ride and then

862
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,180
they get off and it's like... like 25 people are gonna see that man.

863
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,660
Like nobody's like... like you're not doing this in like an Indian...

864
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,660
Let's go over there and watch other people's pictures for a while.

865
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,660
That's... that's awful.

866
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,660
It's just so cool, man.

867
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,660
That is so depressing.

868
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,660
Yeah.

869
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,660
Oh my god.

870
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,340
I mean, I would love some... as somebody who does one of those, like, those prank photos

871
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,700
on there where they, like, glue pieces down to a chessboard or something, I would love

872
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,060
to see that chessboard fly up and decapitate them.

873
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Oh, that'd be sick.

874
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
Oh, 100%.

875
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,700
Yeah, well, you should... they should design a ride that specifically, if you bring a prop

876
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,660
onto it, it will kill you.

877
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,660
It vaporizes you.

878
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,660
Yeah, 100%.

879
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,660
It will, they set it up so that if you have anything in your hands, you're gonna die.

880
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the idea of somebody holding a political message is like so depressing.

881
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:59,660
But the idea of just imagining someone like having like a six seasons and a movie sign.

882
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,660
That's what I'm picturing right now.

883
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,660
That's even better.

884
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,660
That's the guy in my head.

885
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,660
That guy's cooler though because at least he's not going to Disney World like, "Man, I'm going

886
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,140
to make such a difference by riding these rides right now, by having the time of my life.

887
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,940
This is going to be so awesome."

888
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,940
Yeah.

889
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah.

890
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,140
Yeah, I would hold up a sign that says, "This ride is awesome.

891
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,340
I'm having so much fun."

892
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,340
Yeah.

893
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,340
See, that should be fine.

894
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
Yes.

895
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,340
Yes.

896
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,340
Yeah.

897
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Yeah.

898
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,340
I'd be holding up a sign that would say, "Hey, spaghetti meatball."

899
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
You know?

900
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,340
Yeah.

901
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,340
That'd be pretty good.

902
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,840
I was so pissed off when I tried to get on one of those loop-the-loop roller coasters

903
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,220
and they made me leave my bucket of pee.

904
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:40,220
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

905
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:47,220
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

906
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,220
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

907
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:01,220
he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

908
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,220
Honestly, it's the same principle.

909
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,220
And nothing is pouring out.

910
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,220
Come on, let me on the drop tower with my bucket, please.

911
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
Come on, dude.

912
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,220
It'll be fine.

913
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,220
I need this bucket.

914
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,220
I need it. It's my helmet.

915
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,220
No, I won't put it on right now.

916
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,220
There's a ride at

917
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Bush Gardens in Virginia

918
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
where you like, they have like,

919
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,220
it's like a water ride, and

920
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,220
you, um,

921
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,220
they have these little like quarter operated

922
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,240
like water guns around the water ride so you can like yes I remember this ride

923
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,340
yeah it's great but when I would go as a kid I would just like not nobody I know

924
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:42,740
would be on the ride no just sit there posted with like six dollars shooting

925
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,700
tourists in the face because it's like once I get off like I'm fucking gone

926
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:56,740
dude like that's sick yeah it's such a beautiful mechanic to put it in a theme

927
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,140
park yeah that's awesome just spraying strangers with water yeah mmm and I

928
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:10,220
bring my own ammo it's showing up a trying to like disassemble it's a

929
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,100
showing up in like a different disguise each time as you as you shoot people in

930
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:25,140
the face yeah me oh no I'm just a bumblebee I won't be using this I'm just

931
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,580
an unassuming robber on my way to a big heist. Yeah just like yeah like Larry let's get some like

932
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:35,220
disguises so people don't recognize us and just only getting like mascot costumes.

933
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:43,780
Who me? I'm Austin Powers. Yeah right. I mean British spy. Oh I'm a pimp as you can see here

934
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:48,500
so not gonna be shooting the water gun here. That's what I would do if I if I wasn't old

935
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,980
enough for an R-rated movie I'd dress up like a bumblebee and be like what are you gonna you know

936
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,980
I can't stop a bug from getting inside.

937
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,420
(laughing)

938
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,260
I don't even need a ticket, man.

939
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,080
I'm just fucking--

940
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,420
- Hey, I mean, you can turn me away,

941
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,860
but the Department of Bugs is not gonna be

942
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,700
happy to hear about this.

943
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,460
- I mean, low key my hive might attack,

944
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,260
but that's like kinda you.

945
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,100
I'm basically the queen.

946
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,460
- No, I'm not even gonna see a movie.

947
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,300
My queen's in there.

948
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,120
I just have to get in.

949
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,960
My queen.

950
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,800
- Yeah, yeah.

951
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,180
You know, if you can bring the queen out here,

952
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,740
and then if he goes in, I'm just gonna run past him.

953
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,580
- Exactly.

954
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,460
- Take off the bee costume.

955
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,700
They won't recognize me.

956
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,540
- Yeah.

957
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,980
- Hey, aren't you the guy wearing a bee costume earlier?

958
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,820
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

959
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:23,660
- Seven year old wearing a bee costume.

960
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,020
- I forgot I wear a bee costume.

961
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,720
No, but I think there is like a really flat dead bee

962
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,420
on the floor of the lobby.

963
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,940
- It looked really handsome too.

964
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,780
- Yeah, it's kind of, yeah.

965
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,620
- Before it was dead.

966
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,580
- And there's a little pee inside of it.

967
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,820
I don't know what that's about, but.

968
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:37,240
- Yeah. - Yeah.

969
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,100
- Kind of yucky.

970
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,340
You might need to clean it up.

971
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,980
- Mm-hmm, you need to clean it up.

972
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,500
- I've never worn a suit like that.

973
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,060
I kind of want to get a job as a mascot.

974
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,940
I feel like that's like the perfect job for me right now.

975
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,940
That might fund my Disney trip.

976
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,780
me and my friend, uh, we, we were doing like a thing where we were just, uh, as

977
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,740
like, uh, we never released anything we did, but we were trying to do a thing

978
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,920
where we were dressing as, as wizards.

979
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,060
Um, and just like, like running around New York.

980
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:07,500
Um, and we did like, we went to Times Square cause we wanted to like, make a

981
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,200
joke that we were like wizards who showed up and people thought we were

982
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,180
also people you take pictures with.

983
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,660
Um, and then we just were confused by that.

984
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,440
Uh, they immediately surrounded us.

985
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,640
I have felt like the Elmo's and oh yeah.

986
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,900
I was like, Oh, Oh, I'm just stomping on your turf right now.

987
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,280
I'm not even kidding.

988
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,080
They slowly circled us.

989
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:36,580
And I was like, all right, there is like 10 or 15 very, very short men inside

990
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,660
these costumes who are going to tear us apart.

991
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,100
And so we just like abandoned the bit.

992
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,200
We were like, we can't, like, we don't, we don't want to like take

993
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:50,000
It is funny. Imagine the kind of like, like six year old kid who's like, "Mom, can we take a picture with Elm-"

994
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
"Wait, there's a wizard?"

995
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah. A wizard from like, no real like, IP.

996
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh yeah, that was the whole thing was like, we're just gonna be like, magical guys and just be wi-

997
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But like, yeah, just yeah, no IP.

998
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,500
Yeah.

999
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,000
I went to college with Merlin.

1000
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Um, yeah.

1001
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I took a photo with a cowboy at Times Square.

1002
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,500
Yeah.

1003
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,000
It was so awesome.

1004
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,020
Yeah, I just don't I don't really understand all that mascot shit works

1005
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,000
I wonder did I take you like a license for that? No, no, no, I certainly felt like I did

1006
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,600
Yeah, you feel like you did not pass the test. Yeah, whatever it was

1007
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,280
Yeah, I felt like I felt like there was something that I needed you have

1008
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:30,720
Yeah

1009
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,680
you have to get a vision to be to be the mascot and it's like how if you have to get like a different license for

1010
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,360
Like a motorcycle or a passenger vehicle or whatever. You have to you have to take a specific CD

1011
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,360
for different mascots.

1012
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,360
So you need to know a lot about sharing

1013
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,360
if you want to be Elmo.

1014
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,360
Elmo can't hold somebody around the waist.

1015
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,360
He's not too weird.

1016
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Goofy though? Goofy can grab their ass.

1017
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,360
Absolutely. Goofy can do all kinds of

1018
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,360
fucking things. It's because he has a permanently open hand.

1019
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
They have a Hogwarts style

1020
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
sorting hat that they put on the

1021
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
guys in the sidewalks. The mascot people?

1022
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,360
It's a giant mask.

1023
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,360
It's the mask.

1024
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,360
They put the mask on people

1025
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,660
much and what in depending on what mascot they turn into when they put the mask on

1026
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,980
that's the house they're in I think the worst people in the world like worse

1027
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,800
than like like mass murderers or just like evil evil people are people who

1028
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:27,100
like get jobs good get jobs at something like Disney World and they just love to

1029
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,780
play their character and they get so into it and they do it for 12 hours a

1030
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,140
day and they're like that's awesome dude I want those people dead everybody who's

1031
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:38,580
in a costume at a place like that should be fucking hating their life.

1032
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,580
Mm-hmm, absolutely. That's, that has, that needs to be like the bottom tier job.

1033
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:45,380
Yeah, you need to, you have to start as Cinderella.

1034
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,820
It's like when you see a cashier smiling or something, it's like you have to stop.

1035
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,380
Do you even know where you are right now? Did you just get hit in the head by a coconut?

1036
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,220
Why are you fucking happy right now?

1037
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,100
Yeah, I better not hear the fucking cook singing back there.

1038
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,340
That better not be what I'm hearing right now.

1039
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,420
You are what are you, fucking Encino man?

1040
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,700
I did my part.

1041
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,760
I disrespected a minimum wage worker today.

1042
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,600
Oh, really?

1043
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,420
Let's hear the story.

1044
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,820
At the hardware store when I was buying my toilet seat,

1045
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:14,020
toilet seat's at the top shelf, it's a high ticket item.

1046
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,340
And so I fucking, there was a ladder right next to it,

1047
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,780
so I was like, well, I'll fucking go grab this.

1048
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,780
I grabbed it, and as I'm bringing it back down the ladder,

1049
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,060
lady walks around the corner, she's like,

1050
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,220
hey, you're not supposed to use that ladder.

1051
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,340
And I was like, well, I just used it,

1052
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,500
and I got my toilet seat.

1053
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,020
(laughing)

1054
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:31,860
Yeah, I mean, I'm always--

1055
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,700
She seemed pretty upset.

1056
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,580
I'm always scheming ways to disrespect, you know,

1057
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,700
the lower class like that.

1058
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,800
You know, I always, when I hear the garbage man

1059
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,380
coming around the corner, I run outside, I puke on him.

1060
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,460
I say it's the smell of the trash and he can't disprove it.

1061
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,820
And then I also say, "Hey, clean that up, trash man."

1062
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:49,340
Yeah, it's technically trash.

1063
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,180
That's trash.

1064
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't wanna.

1065
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,420
I ate some of the trash to make it happen.

1066
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,540
There's trash in there.

1067
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,060
Yeah, if they get too mad, I sort of sweeten it

1068
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,780
and I call them pickup artists.

1069
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,900
That's very sweet.

1070
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,380
Yeah, you guys are the real pickup artists.

1071
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,480
Yeah, and then when he turns around, I flip him off.

1072
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,940
Yeah, that's right. And say, "Just kidding."

1073
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,780
Yeah, just kidding.

1074
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,860
But I say, "Just kidding," under my breath.

1075
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,500
Yeah, but I say it not under my breath.

1076
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,960
If the guy's small enough, I pick him up by the ankles,

1077
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,860
I swing him around and throw him in the compactor.

1078
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,140
There isn't a minimum wage worker

1079
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,660
that I have not just completely punched

1080
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,680
in the fucking face a hundred times.

1081
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,900
That's right. Absolutely.

1082
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,740
Yeah. Yeah.

1083
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,980
If I see one--

1084
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,620
Waiters and waitresses, wait staff, dude,

1085
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,140
if I sit down at a restaurant,

1086
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,380
I'm asking for cloth napkins one at a time

1087
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,680
till my whole body's covered.

1088
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,520
- Absolutely.

1089
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,340
- Oh yeah.

1090
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,740
- I mean, lately I've been really pissed off

1091
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,260
that they're putting in those like

1092
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,980
touch screen kiosks at McDonald's

1093
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,340
'cause it's too easy to clean spit off 'em.

1094
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,180
- It's also--

1095
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,780
(laughing)

1096
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,620
- That's true.

1097
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,180
And how do you disrespect a computer?

1098
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:49,020
- Oh, I have tried to like just--

1099
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,700
- I know, I'm standing in front of the kiosk

1100
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,260
and I'm going--

1101
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,780
- What do I have to learn C to make this guy mad at me?

1102
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,980
- I am not telling the truth right now

1103
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,980
and trying to get him to short circuit

1104
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,940
It just doesn't work.

1105
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:00,780
What I do is--

1106
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,180
I'm basically yelling paradoxes at my kiosk.

1107
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,940
Yeah, dude, I mean, I've been caught a couple times

1108
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,820
at McDonald's with my butt cheeks just like plastered

1109
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,420
against one of those screens trying to photocopy my ass.

1110
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,260
Yeah, right.

1111
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,340
But it just doesn't work at all, dude.

1112
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,060
Yeah, I've been caught at McDonald's

1113
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,380
with my butt cheeks out, yeah, like all the time.

1114
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,220
Yeah.

1115
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,040
Yeah.

1116
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,120
Just as a sign of disrespect,

1117
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,260
just trying to show them that I don't respect them.

1118
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,500
Also assert dominance there,

1119
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,900
'cause McDonald's apparently can't ask anybody to leave ever.

1120
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,300
I don't know if you've been to one,

1121
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,540
But people just be doing crazy shit in the McDonald's.

1122
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,260
So you can just walk in with your butt out,

1123
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,660
start fucking, people play chess in McDonald's

1124
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,780
for like 16 hours a day.

1125
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,060
They're like drinking like a fireball.

1126
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,700
- I'm sorry, sir, we can't ask you to leave.

1127
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,180
- I know that we're not supposed to ask you to leave,

1128
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,020
but do you want a refill?

1129
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,460
- You have, like you slit that woman's throat.

1130
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,300
- Yeah.

1131
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,820
- But do you, but, so I'm gonna say just a few hours

1132
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,300
I'm gonna need you to go to the playpen

1133
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,140
instead of the main restaurant area.

1134
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,000
- Every city, the McDonald's are a fucking,

1135
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,180
it's a jungle, dude. - It's awesome.

1136
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,880
- Like you thought, whatever seats are the furthest

1137
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,220
from the cash register, that's like,

1138
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,020
McDonald's like doesn't even claim that.

1139
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:09,860
They're like, the restaurant ends--

1140
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,180
- That's international water.

1141
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,980
- Yeah, the second to last row.

1142
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,900
Whatever you can see from the street

1143
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:17,300
into the like, the big window.

1144
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,880
- Oh yeah, you turn the corner to see that part

1145
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,500
of the McDonald's and it's just pitch black

1146
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,300
and you can see red glowing eyes.

1147
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,780
(laughing)

1148
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,620
I put yeah they also in McDonald's the the area floor that's just outside the

1149
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,780
bathroom where it's like just just to the side of the line that you wait to

1150
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:38,100
order or pick up in but like in front of the bathroom that's called the yelling

1151
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:44,060
zone yeah you can be as loud and as as religious as you want talk about

1152
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:49,140
whatever you want yeah they literally can't stop you one time I swear to God I

1153
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,820
walked towards like the back corner in McDonald's and a tentacle just grabbed

1154
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:01,260
my ankle and started pulling me towards the darkness and I had to I had to say a few prayers

1155
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,780
and eventually it like just it uncoiled.

1156
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:09,300
100% yeah there's like it's it's fucking Pirates of the Caribbean in that corner in McDonald's

1157
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,300
every single time.

1158
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,740
I mean and something something they don't tell you about McDonald's is that if you if

1159
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,220
you if you it's like it's sort of like the secret menu where if you need fresh air you

1160
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,500
can ask the cashiers and they'll let you eat next to the drive-thru window.

1161
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,500
Oh, you have to.

1162
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Yeah.

1163
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
They have to, and you can smoke there too.

1164
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
Oh, yeah.

1165
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,700
And blow it out like you're trying to smoke inside.

1166
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,100
I've seen like a full, like I've seen like a game of Twister being played in the middle

1167
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,100
of the conference.

1168
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,860
Yeah, dude.

1169
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,100
And it is not clothed Twister.

1170
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,100
Yeah, dude.

1171
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,100
I mean, they are butt ass naked.

1172
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,420
You walk in, you see people setting up surround sound.

1173
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,420
Yeah.

1174
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,420
You're like, what the fuck is this?

1175
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,700
I saw one guy just like practicing walking on his hands, and he must have kicked this

1176
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:55,060
woman seven times. They just didn't do anything about it. It was horrible.

1177
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:01,220
I mean and yeah if you're a McDonald's and the the the chairs you can take those.

1178
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,020
You can bring those into the bathroom if you need to. If you want to

1179
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,980
you know if you want it if somebody's already in there but you also you want to

1180
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,780
go but there's not enough toilets in there. I saw a guy taking apart a chair and trying to

1181
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:16,300
make it into a robot. Like he just was trying so hard. There's always a mad

1182
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,460
I've got scientists tinkering.

1183
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,300
Oh my God.

1184
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,300
On every single time, dude.

1185
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,900
Oh my, and he's always, he always wants the fish filet.

1186
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,740
Yeah.

1187
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,580
Even if it's breakfast.

1188
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,900
And he's, yeah, he's such a bitch.

1189
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:25,740
It's amazing, dude.

1190
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,700
I love seeing, just walking in,

1191
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,100
seeing some middle-aged guy rebuilding an engine.

1192
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,920
Yeah.

1193
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:31,900
It's just a beautiful place, man.

1194
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah, it's just like, I gotta find my kid.

1195
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,820
Yeah, also no other, no other restaurant is like that.

1196
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,180
No other fast food restaurant.

1197
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,020
Really, no?

1198
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,420
Well, I don't know, when I was in,

1199
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,400
I was in downtown LA and I went to like a Carl's Jr.

1200
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,240
And that was--

1201
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,060
Downtown LA is different, dude.

1202
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,020
Dude, it was getting, it was,

1203
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:50,720
like I would walk in at like one o'clock

1204
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,180
and it was simply just like 1 a.m.

1205
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,060
It was just not one o'clock p.m.

1206
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,060
Yeah, last time I was in downtown L.A.,

1207
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:58,940
I think it was with Cam,

1208
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,020
we saw a woman walking around with no pants.

1209
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:01,980
100%.

1210
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,860
Just like, and no underwear either, just battling.

1211
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,540
By figure, I just assumed.

1212
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:08,340
She also had like the craziest bush I've ever seen, dude.

1213
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,460
(laughing)

1214
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,300
I swear to God, dude, it came out.

1215
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,700
I mean, that's why she was allowed to do it,

1216
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,220
otherwise L.A. censors everything.

1217
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,620
Yeah, it came out like five inches from her waist.

1218
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,780
It was fucking insane, dude.

1219
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,900
Yeah, I'd love to see the silhouette of that.

1220
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,820
And just like, "Oh, does she have Cthulhu down there?"

1221
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,220
I don't know what that is.

1222
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,220
They got the craziest graffiti out there, too.

1223
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,060
I don't know if you guys seen, there's this huge tag

1224
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,900
that says Hollywood.

1225
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,620
You can see pretty much wherever you are.

1226
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,140
It's nuts, dude.

1227
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:34,980
They just leave that up.

1228
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,900
I think they're gonna start saying,

1229
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,140
"Yeah, it's in like this other language."

1230
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,980
They're gonna start talking about Spanish graffiti.

1231
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,780
They got the craziest graffiti there,

1232
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:46,900
saying things like polio. They got the craziest food, they got this thing called Del Taco.

1233
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:52,220
I don't know what the hell is going on there. What does that mean? What's that guy's name?

1234
00:57:52,220 --> 00:58:00,300
What's that restaurant called? Inside Out? In-N-Out? Yeah, right. You're close. That damn

1235
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:05,240
place should be on the Out-N-Out if you ask me. Yeah, that's right. I go there, I order

1236
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:11,340
fries animal style every time. It's so funny. It's so cool that there's a place you can

1237
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:16,620
order stuff animal style. That's like the coolest way to order something ever.

1238
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,060
Fries there are like a 4 out of 10 too. I hope your California fans come for me.

1239
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,380
In-N-Out is just fine. How do you think that animal style thing worked man? Do

1240
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,460
you think like they had like... Well they're Christian. Yeah so like that

1241
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,420
doesn't make sense like they didn't come up with it themselves. Some guy must have

1242
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,300
come in and been like "I'll take some fries. Make them animal style baby!"

1243
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:46,260

1248
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,300
You cook this shit in mustard, I'm leaving man, fuck this.

1249
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,720
That is nasty as fuck.

1250
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,920
Yeah, they're very precious

1251
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,860
about their little restaurant, aren't they?

1252
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,500
They are, it's really annoying.

1253
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,340
In the worst place in America.

1254
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,900
It's just fucking fine.

1255
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,380
It's cheap as hell though.

1256
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,460
I'll take White Castle, dude.

1257
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,900
I'll take White Castle over that shit.

1258
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
I've never been to White Castle.

1259
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,620
I will not take White Castle over that shit.

1260
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,540
I'm a New York boy.

1261
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,420
It's like 70 cents for a little tiny baby burger.

1262
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,960
Man, I have been every kind of intoxicated

1263
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,900
and gone to White Castle just to see

1264
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,600
if I can feel something when I taste that.

1265
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,680
I just don't.

1266
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,520
Nothing.

1267
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,420
- You're insane, dude.

1268
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,200
I came to your house and you gave me a ball of pasta

1269
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,400
that's been deep fried.

1270
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,760
A ball of spaghetti.

1271
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,360
- That is fried capellini.

1272
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,880
- That's the craziest, that's crazier and worse

1273
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,240
than anything that they sell at White Castle.

1274
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,960
- I'm telling you that that has flavor.

1275
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,200
I'm telling you I have not tasted White Castle burgers

1276
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,040
and enjoyed them.

1277
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,000
- It's got pickles on it, dog.

1278
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:58,880
That's all I'm saying.

1279
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,880
- Bro, most burgers got pickles on them.

1280
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,720
Bro.

1281
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,040
- I don't know.

1282
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,840
Not the way I make 'em.

1283
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,280
not animals. I'm making my own pickles.

1284
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,000
Nah, I'm, yeah, no, I don't know. I've just never enjoyed White Castle and I feel stupid

1285
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,640
because of that, because I'm like, everybody loves it. Yeah, I mean, if you're coming down

1286
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,200
to Boston, I mean, you just, you've got to try McDonald's. That shit goes nuts. It's

1287
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,280
insane, dude. It's insane. Have you heard about what happens in the weird part of the

1288
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,600
McDonald's? There's always some freaks there. Yeah, there's always something weird going

1289
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:32,480
on there. Yeah. Alright, boys, I'm out. Yeah, this is that part. Bye, sweetie pie. Bye, everybody.

1290
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:42,480
